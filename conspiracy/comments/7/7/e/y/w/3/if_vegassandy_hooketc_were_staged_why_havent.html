<p>People are on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis and are never told of the whole plan so very few people  actually know the whole truth.

<p>Like, let&#39;s say my kid was going to be used in a &quot;false flag&quot;. Do I have to move after, so the neighbors don&#39;t see that I still have a kid? Do I have to hide him from his cousins and grandparents, and lie to them about it? What happens when they come over to visit? Am I allowed in public with my kid, or does he just live in the basement now?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t see any practical way this would work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Also, how would it be possible to keep so many involved persons quiet about the conspiracy?&quot;</p>

<p>Is both the most classic and worst argument against any conspiracy. There are global conspiracies which have been going on for generations much more massive in proportion. The &quot;how&quot; is answered easily enough, but unless you are brand new to what conspiracies are, you have heard good answers and ignored them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Conspiracy theorists seem to forget that individuals are very hard to control, and that big groups are just a bunch of individuals. Plan a murder with two accomplices and you might get away with it, but with 100 accomplices you&#39;re guaranteed that someone will talk, and someone else will screw up, and someone else will get caught red-handed...</p>

<p>Seriously, it&#39;s hard to get a large group to coordinate even on a simple task that requires no duplicity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that was just an example. But I do think conspiracy theories get more outlandish as the number of conspirators spirals out of control.</p>

<p>For example, there are a couple of conspiracy theories that implicate NASA...not its director but the entire organization. That&#39;s literally thousands of people. You couldn&#39;t get a thousand people to keep a surprise party secret, let alone a global conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So 911 wasn&#39;t an inside job? Trust me on this..or don&#39;t. Conspiracies control entire governments and all facets of society from entertainment to every voice of authority the masses trust in. Far more vast and far reaching things than a simple Hollywood production are pulled off daily and continually through years, decades, centuries. Not many ever need know why they are doing what they are doing or for whom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I&#39;m saying is something that shouldn&#39;t even be controversial: for each additional person who knows a terrible secret, the odds that it&#39;ll stay a secret decreases. If that means that the 9/11 theory you subscribe to is highly unlikely, well, the reality is that at some point you need to ask yourself: &#39;why are so many people willing to keep their mouths shut about a conspiracy by the government to murder thousands of its own citizens?&#39; Even if you&#39;re ultimately right, it&#39;s a good question, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Though it&#39;s not probably nearly as many as you think, sure..it is a good question, but don&#39;t start with the assumption that there couldn&#39;t be one. Even if i had no foggy clue i could make a handful of educated guesses without thinking too hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you don&#39;t even consider the possibility that it could be a handful within that thousand? When people block label something like NASA, they aren&#39;t saying every single person new. It&#39;s a long distance between working there and being duped yourself and a handful of people doing the dirty work. See this is the counter argument that&#39;s always used, as if the idea of &#39;how could thousands of people be in on this?&quot; and &quot;someone would stuff up&quot; stack up but really they are slightly redundant. Because a) clearly to those that think something is fishy, someone has indeed stuffed up and b) It never is the masses only those within the masses who present themselves as one unit for this very reason. I think at the very least, the very least if you look at this you can&#39;t say it all feels okay, normal and nothing stands out.  I am positive everyone working at NASA at the time thought man landed on the moon. But they were fed the same thing, to them it was real. So they weren&#39;t part of the conspiracy per se, but they played a part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we&#39;ll see then. I&#39;d say it would also be very difficult, as a small group within NASA, to fool a bunch of space aeronautics professionals into thinking they had successfully sent men to the moon.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I&#39;m really saying here anyway: more people means more complexity, and more complexity means lower likelihood of success. It&#39;s something that has to be considered. Sometimes it spirals way out of control. I think it&#39;s even sillier when people talk about the &quot;mainstream media&quot;, which is an entire industry of thousands of people each with their own motivations and goals. But some conspiracy theorists will toss ideas like that around without even considering the logistical problems. You have to at least think about it and account for it.</p>

<p>I always think: &quot;if I were the conspirator, would I have executed this plan?&quot; In the case of Vegas/Sandy Hook/etc the answer is a clear &quot;no.&quot; It&#39;s complicated, it&#39;s expensive, it&#39;s needlessly cruel, there&#39;s guaranteed to be loose ends, and if my endgame is tighter gun restrictions I can think of a dozen easier and more effective plans. Every time one of these mass shootings happens, r/conspiracy cries &quot;false flag&quot; and &quot;they&#39;re coming for our guns&quot;, but no real gun control ever materializes. You&#39;d think eventually the conspirators would figure out this is a ton of work for no reward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so you&#39;re suggesting that an entire community of people were in on a secret plot to create the illusion of a mass murder of children, because they all agreed that gun control was very important.</p>

<p>Only, Sandy Hook famously hasn&#39;t led to any substantive gun control. You&#39;d have to struggle to find specific instances of Congresspeople even trying particularly hard to pass gun control legislation. For the most part they don&#39;t bother.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it just possible that the thought of a bunch of kids getting shot to death is so repugnant, that your mind is rejecting it in favor of increasingly outlandish conspiracy theories in which the children are safe? That, in a country where anyone with the resources can put together an arsenal, and where mental illness often goes untreated or ignored, just maybe someone who was mentally ill got his hands on his mother&#39;s cache of weapons and did something unthinkably terrible -- not to bring about any greater change in society, but just because he could?</p>

<p>Otherwise, you&#39;re going to have to figure out why whoever coordinated the conspiracy failed to institute any meaningful gun control legislation. I mean, it seems to me like, in a real conspiracy, they&#39;d just take away your guns right after, right? But they didn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. I don&#39;t know what happened with those events...I was just offering an answer to the question... Could be meds... People get crazy on that stuff. I do know that 9/11 wasn&#39;t what we were told. 
As for gun laws after Sandy Hook, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control_after_the_Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control_after_the_Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting</a> - Some bills didn&#39;t pass, but many did -Nationally.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook may have been a FEMA capstone event with live actors.  There&#39;s a lot of strange stuff about it, but I&#39;ve been to busy reading Herzl diaries and studying political Zionism and the Third Reich... Only so much time in the day. :)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who those kids are, but there aren&#39;t fieldtrips on a Sunday, unless they started Friday and returned Monday.<br/>
Am I missing something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we&#39;ll see then. I&#39;d say it would also be very difficult, as a small group within NASA, to fool a bunch of space aeronautics professionals into thinking they had successfully sent men to the moon.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I&#39;m really saying here anyway: more people means more complexity, and more complexity means lower likelihood of success. It&#39;s something that has to be considered. Sometimes it spirals way out of control. I think it&#39;s even sillier when people talk about the &quot;mainstream media&quot;, which is an entire industry of thousands of people each with their own motivations and goals. But some conspiracy theorists will toss ideas like that around without even considering the logistical problems. You have to at least think about it and account for it.</p>

<p>I always think: &quot;if I were the conspirator, would I have executed this plan?&quot; In the case of Vegas/Sandy Hook/etc the answer is a clear &quot;no.&quot; It&#39;s complicated, it&#39;s expensive, it&#39;s needlessly cruel, there&#39;s guaranteed to be loose ends, and if my endgame is tighter gun restrictions I can think of a dozen easier and more effective plans. Every time one of these mass shootings happens, r/conspiracy cries &quot;false flag&quot; and &quot;they&#39;re coming for our guns&quot;, but no real gun control ever materializes. You&#39;d think eventually the conspirators would figure out this is a ton of work for no reward.</p>
