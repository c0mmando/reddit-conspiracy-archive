       antifa have existed for decades and they are nothing like isis. the reason you hear more about them now is because of the rise in right wing extremism. whilst they are throwing bottles of urine and smashing windows, right wing extremists are killing people by running them over with cars so the right wing media will be pushing the antifa narrative to make them sound like a legitimate threat. obviously its working.

       hate speech leads to people being lynched, literally, so saying its about "muh feels" is intellectually dishonest. how many people did the kkk kill? how many people did stalin or hitler kill? that is what antifa fights against.
      </p>

       is there any truth to this?....

       I think all instance of domestic terror is sad and ridiculous.

      <p>
       I'm not playing this dumb game of who is worse, they are both equally destructive forces in our country and have no place in modern society.

       I won't coddle a baby regime of ignorant Hicks or college kids with no work experience. Yes, I'm using a joking hyperbole to indicate how little and pointless both of these groups are for our country.

       I can see why you hate them like I hate AntiFa, but the KKK doesn't go around causing riots, property damage, and attacking innocent people.

       well, they do and hate speech incites those actions. but it is different to antifas actions. i wont look at your links until after the football later, but ive never denied theyre violent, and ive said i dont agree with their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       to me, the videos ive seen of antifa attacking people, they look like scared kids who cant fight for shit and gang up on people.

       i gave you 5 or 6 examples of hate speech resulting in murder. all within the last few years, including this year. you have not responded to that at all.

       have you got a timestamp? im not going to watch it all. the funny thing is in both these videos it comes across as nerds that are all talk. have they actually done anything serious? have they killed anyone like the right wing groups?
      </p>
      <p>
       do you even disagree with their basic idea that racism is wrong? disagreeing with their actions, their methods is one thing. i think theyre idiotic kids in that regard, but i dont believe theres a place for racism in a free and civilized society. are you saying youre ok with right wing extremists murdering people because they are black?

       well, just so you know... butyric acid is more commonly known as a "stink bomb". so no, they werent planning a ""gas attack", they were planning to let off a stink bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       that, along with your lack of awareness about people literally getting murdered because of hate speech, just reinforces my view that theres a lot of false right wing propaganda surrounding antifa and a lot of people are falling for it.

       No one is arguing how long they have been around or what their "roots" are. We are looking at the actions of a group today, based on current events, and categorizing them. Why is that so hard to understand? You seem very blinded by the left/right divide that you continuously bring up to somehow downplay Antifa's actions.

       There is a trend with Antifa's actions vs. the "extreme right" as you call them. The death of that girl in Charlottesville is terrible and there's no defending the actions of that day. Antifa has hundreds of documented assaults on anyone that does not agree with their views. You are using one instance of violence on the right to downplay the obvious trend of using violence to silence opposition that Antifa in the left is moving towards.

       ive given 5 or 6 examples of right wing/hate speech leading to the murder of 8? people in the last couple of years. i would rather have a bottle of urine thrown at me than me murdered.

      <p>
       its dishonest to simplify antifas stance as using violence against anyone who disagrees with them. racism, prejudice, hate speech leads to very real, very serious, consequences for people, that is what they claim to be using violence against.

       They use "racism, prejudice, hate speech" as a guise to assault anyone with a dissenting view, you know that. And they do it while acting like children and being unable to form a coherent argument.

       Sometimes, if you're not careful, you become what you are fighting. Antifa tactics are just like the browncoats of ww2 era. Silence opposing opinions, lash out and attack other groups, create large mobs who all wear a similar color, advocate for a new leadership while simultaneaously marching with a hammer and cicle but maintaining innocence that "we're totally against fascism". LMFAO

       No, its pretty clear that Antifa isn't an organic movement. They are simply another tool being used by certain powerful individuals. I'm sure they believe in their cause, but that doesn't change the fact that they are being used.

       It's very ironic,yes. They silence through violence. Opposing views are to be crushed. By definition they are, themselves, fascists. Interestingly, the new definition of fascism calls it a right-wing ideology. This is revisionism in its finest.

       What ever helps you sleep at night, whippersnapper. I've been on this Earth long enough to distinguish delusions/propaganda from reality. I'm here to tell you, Antifa is closer to modern-day fascism than a lot of the kids participating in it realize. Most of these kids have no original thoughts.

       I won't validate your "assault shpeal" as it's laughable. Global? In America? Modern day? Pre-civil rights days? Suggesting that minorities are in danger due to their skin tone in the current  age is just silly.

       I'm under the impression that US citizens have already gave up all their privacy/freedom rights for more security. They don't need more incentive.
       <br/>
       The receipt is simple: add "Liberty/freedom" in your law title and say that anybody fighting it is a traitor! Work done, half their population will be defending the law, even if they don't understand it.

       No. It is a political ideology. Some groups have added ANTIFA to their name but, for the most part, it is a series of various groups all having their own interpretation of the idealogy.

       Wow, you're totally delusional.  You should stop eating up so much ANTIFA lit.  They are clearly a group, and they have been since 1932 when they were founded as the militant wing of the Communist Party (and claimed as such in Rote Fahne, their newspaper).

       I'm not American so didn't go to 'college' and if you mean 'what year did you drop out of University?'. The answer is 'I have not, and have been studying almost constantly since 2004 around the other work I do'. Currently hold two degrees. One in British Law, one in Swedish Law, and working towards a Masters in Swedish Law.

       No. Not really. The first degree I was permanent (obviously, most people do their first degree full-time), but now I do it part-time. A few hours per week while I work, hence why they have taken substantially longer.

       TPTB is sponsoring Antifa,  BLM, The pussy hat freaks, the sudden out of no where "alt-right" movement,  these fake neo-nazis showing up rallies sponsored by the deep state. The whole plan is to cause enough conflict it leads to a shooting war, and when the first shots are fired they come for everyone's gun, and when we can't defend ourselves from the jackboots, it's over, like 1984 except full of pajama boys and gender confused children. Big things planned for November 4th.

       well, they do and hate speech incites those actions. but it is different to antifas actions. i wont look at your links until after the football later, but ive never denied theyre violent, and ive said i dont agree with their actions.

       It's very ironic,yes. They silence through violence. Opposing views are to be crushed. By definition they are, themselves, fascists. Interestingly, the new definition of fascism calls it a right-wing ideology. This is revisionism in its finest.
