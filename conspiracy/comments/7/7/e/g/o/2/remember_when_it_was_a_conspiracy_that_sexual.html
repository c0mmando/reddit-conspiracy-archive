    <div class="md"><p>Maybe my age group is more &quot;woke&quot; or something but people joke about Hollywood molesters all the time and it seems like a common sentiment that child actors get molested. I think that&#39;s because nowadays it&#39;s more acceptable to even talk about being molested as a child so since people acknowledge their own experiences with it they realize that it&#39;s likely to happen in Hollywood. The moment you implicate someone they like they&#39;d probably get pissed though.</p>

<p>Definitely not just your age groups; it&#39;s been a topic for decades. People have talked about troubled child stars being manipulated and/or abused by parents and producers for a long time. It&#39;s long been a mainstream topic. The plights of people like Natalie Wood and Judy Garland have been well known for many years. The entire premise of this thread is absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think most people knew that Hollywood is full of pedophiles and just didn&#39;t care? Maybe that&#39;s you, but no, that is not &#39;most people.&#39; And the commenter above wasn&#39;t calling people average in the sense that he/she is more special, it&#39;s a way of referring to &#39;most people.&#39;</p>

<p>And yes, it is important that most people wake up to the fact that there is a lot of truth to many so-called &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; because this corruption threatens all of our safety and freedoms, not so that people who happened to find out about said corruption can feel special or say &#39;I told you so.&#39; People who care about &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; are people who care about truth, and are people who, and I gather from your comments this might be difficult for you to understand, actually do care about other human beings, even human beings they don&#39;t know and will never meet, such as children going into the entertainment industry full of excitement and hope and dreams, only to be brutally traumatised in the worst ways by sociopathic powerful predators who are protected by the very people who are supposed to protect children and victims.</p>

<p>And the fact is that most people in the world also care about other human beings and don&#39;t want to live in a world where pedophile rings are protected and children are essentially thrown to the wolves. Most people also do not believe such evil exists, I know that I used to dismiss the rumors of pedophile rings in various elite circles, thinking of it as impossible. Until I actually did some research into it. And then trying to tell other people about it was incredibly difficult, because most people do dismiss the idea that elites run pedophile rings off hand, without looking at evidence. And there has been concerted efforts in the corporate media to discredit those trying to get the truth out about this issue as &#39;conspiracy nuts.&#39;</p>

<p>So what people need to realise is that, by now, so many of these &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; that were once ridiculed, have turned out to be true, that they have to start paying attention to what&#39;s really going on and ask themselves why the media is doing so much right now to try to paint independent researchers and journalists as &#39;fake news&#39; or &#39;crazy&#39; when such people have been proven right time and again. Just because something is deemed&#39; crazy&#39; by the mainstream has absolutely no bearing on whether its true or not.</p>

<p>So, while you just want to while away your life watching Avengers knowing that children are being abused and raped and your law enforcement, government and media are complicit in it, others choose to try to raise awareness about the issue and get something done to stop it. That isn&#39;t people &#39;thinking they&#39;re gods&#39; that&#39;s people CARING about other people.</p>

<p>it seems to me that you can&#39;t imagine any reason, beyond self-aggrandisement, that anyone would try to push for truth or justice, which honestly says so much more about you than about anybody else.</p>

<p>The casting couch wasn&#39;t formalized and ritualized. It&#39;s a catch-all term for powerful producers abusing the starlets beneath them.</p>

<p>What do you think it meant? A literal couch, a pedantic contract of roles for sexual favors? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in Burbank, though I personally never had anything to do with the industry I&#39;ve known more actors then most. I met both Coreys&#39;on several occasions, they weren&#39;t friends of mine and like some other famous kids had a dark aura about them. I originally thought it was because they were famous they thought they were better, but as an adult I&#39;ve learned that&#39;s not really the case. </p>

<p>During the 80&#39;s most of these kids would go to school on set during shooting and some would go to public school when they weren&#39;t. Public school was terrible for them, I found out from some years later. Since they are TV or movie famous it&#39;s believed in school by people like me they have all these friends, I mean they&#39;re famous. They do have friends from the set, but these same kids are also they&#39;re competition for parts, so that didn&#39;t make it easy. Most of them had crazy parents too. One or two of the kids I knew were them or became household names, most were the kids you see in the background. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about the Hollywood that we know are filled with pedophiles and rapists. But having some insight into the kids lives, these were truly easy pray for these sick fucks.</p>

<p>Th emental gymnastics people will do to not have to face up to the fact that reality is nothing like how they&#39;ve been taught it is. And I understand, I really do, because when I first discovered the truth and understood how so little of what the mainstream media says is an honest depiction of reality, and how much is covered up, and how many sociopaths there are running things, I genuinely went into full on clinical depression for 6 months. It&#39;s extremely psychologically traumatic, especially if you&#39;ve been brought up in that liberal academia type world where your peers are the type of people who read the NYT and WaPo or are even the type of people who work for them.

Still to this day, see refuses to even watch it saying &quot;I don&#39;t want that devil shit in my house! You&#39;re crazy!&quot;</p>

<p>Why do they react so harshly to something they aren&#39;t even willing to gander at. Knowing nothing about it, they come to a conclusion. They are all programmed. It&#39;s sad.</p>

<p>Like Snowden. Conspiracy hounds are so desperate to take credit for Snowden they say &quot;see and you call us tinfoil hat crazies!&quot; As if that proves anything. They&#39;ll even cite MSM sources they&#39;d normally shunned to make themselves into martyrs out of headlines. </p>

<p>Meanwhile I can produce 30-40 year old mainstream magazine cover stories about the NSA using mass surveillance on citizens. </p>

Right there you&#39;re saying that they cite MSM sources.  Why do you think they shun those sources when they&#39;re showing that they are the ones trying to make a mockery out of so called conspiracy theorists?
Of course there are going to be some credible reasons to believe these things, that&#39;s why the rational among us believe or at least critically think about these things.  We don&#39;t just believe stuff because it&#39;s an interesting idea or some guy was screaming about it in public.  It&#39;s the people who ignore those credible sources and still dismiss anything out of hand and call anyone who believes it crazy but then do a 180 and say they knew it all along when it&#39;s proven to be true, those are the people I&#39;m talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was never a conspiracy theory that powerful and influential people use their status to get away with sexual abuse. The Catholic sex abuse scandal was proven in a court of law to be a thing, many people went to prison or got sued into oblivion. Senators get busted for it all the time. There&#39;s been accusations and quite a few convictions over the years in Hollywood too, dating back to the golden age of cinema and the Studio System that gave moguls power over barely-legal female sex symbols . </p>

<p>What IS a conspiracy theory is the implication that the ringleader of a worldwide pedophile ring is the Clintons, Podesta and other high-ranking Democrats, and that they&#39;re running a child sex operation out of the basement of a pizza parlor in Washington, DC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you so much.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been covering VIP paedophilia on my blog for awhile now. Mainly covering the UK side of thinks, MPs, celebs, elm guest house etc.</p>

<p>You wont believe the amount of people who turn around and look down their nose at me, call me a conspiracy nut and refuse to listen to anything I have to say, regardless of evidence or proof.</p>

<p>I try my utmost to point out to these people that for years and years people who saying Savile was a Paedophile and sex abuser, same can be said about Edward Heath, Leon Brittan, Cyril Smith. Anybody who tried to out them years ago was called a conspiracy theoriest, nobody wanted to believe that this was such a huge problem with some of the biggest names from around the world caught up in it all.</p>

<p>Only years on do we know that it turned out to be true. I&#39;m still trying to shine a light on others names like Cliff Richard, Andrew Lloyd Webber and others, again all been reported for years, all with similar connections to the likes of Savile, Rolf Harris, UK Royals etc yet people just dismiss everything I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>Gurantee when some of those people die in years to come it will out them and people would have all but forgotten about the warnings others had tried to give years previously.</p>

<p>Very frustrating.</p>

When they couldn&#39;t find anything, they paraded 11 women to make false accusations and that went nowhere. Now they are offering bounties for women to come forward.  That might attract some false accusers, but it will still have to be proven.  Still fucking crickets. The women of Hollywood have just started accusing.  There has been no investigations except Harvey.  Give time for their accusations to be proven.  Where as they have had plenty of time to try and prove the Trump accusers.  </p>
