      <p>
       Morning, y'all! Just remember what I said a couple of days ago in my previous posts... Hannity, old new (to us) Uranium breaking news stories, FBI/DOJ obstruction/admin. covering and colluding, the congressional and FBI witnesses the Holder/Lynch DOJ's threatened NOW coming out, etc. ALL PART OF THE PLAN. It's all designed to swell pressure cooker the Trump admin. has surrounded the swamp with. The dirty establishment and their deep bosses are desperately clinging to the ONLY THING THEY HAVE LEFT. The swamp-employed MSM, tirelessly continues to "do what they're told and paid to do", like every abused Patsy, to obstruct and cover for (((them))).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had to make a list right now of every outlet that IS "fake news", just lost anyone NOT reporting this... YET. Don't worry though because like I also said in my previous posts, one way or the other, it's coming and (((they))) ALL KNOW IT!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost as if no one remembers when Dana Rohrabacher met with Assange in August. I've NEVER claimed to be "breaking news" on here, but for fucks sake /pol/, you seem to inconveniently forget, way too many REALLY important things, I feel the need to remind you of. Then, I'm left feeling like I need to pull a Wherl of Fortune and just finish the puzzle for you, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, y'all... remember when I said regarding Comey and Mueller for instance, that the admin. needs to make certain things look, "really good for the cameras"?! If you forget again, just read the archived caps (thanks to the anons who do all of that, BTW. It's very helpful!).
      </p>
      <p>
       Stick with me here, y'all. Imagine you sent an officially sponsored U.S. representative (Rep. Dana R.) to "meet with Assange" on be half of the admin./WH and you (the admin.) knew that you'd eventually be called on it to publicly confirm the trip, because it HAS to be "publicly documented" on the "official calendar"...
      </p>
      <p>
       ... then wouldn't it be SO MUCH EASIER to have Sessions start publicly barking about and releasing rogue statements like, "We are seeking the extradition of Assange and a formal investigation of Wikileaks", instead of trying to rationalize via the corrupt MSM why you're REALLY there, NEGOTIATING WITH HIM? The MSM and every guilty establishment swamp-dweller they cover for, spent the better part of the last 2.5 years convincing every oblivious viewer/reader they had, that Assange and Wikileaks were "Russian-funded enemies of the state". That makes it pretty fucking hard to convince those masses of "sleeping" people, that a WH/Admin. sending an official representative to meet with Assange, was a great idea, right?! It would've been pretty hard for all those people to believe that an admin. currently and actively being investigated for supposed "Russian election hackings/admin.collusion", had really good intentions, for meeting with Assange, no?! Exactly, so what did they do?! They ramp up Sessions public calls for "extradition and investigation", so it looks "good for the cameras", while creating a solid cover for the oblivious, MSM bullshit swallowing, people. To be clear... EVERYONE IN THE "SWAMP" KNOWS WHAT ASSANGE HAS, WHAT'S IN IT AND WHERE HE GOT IT. Everything I've said DAYS AGO about what you're seeing NOW regarding the Huma/Weiner files (even the shit coming out of Judicial Watch about Huma/Weiner files - better late than never, I guess) IS A STRATEGIC PART OF THE PRESSURE BUILD UP.
PAY ATTENTION TO MUELLER AND COMEY... when it's all over and you realize I was right, you'll read tweets from Trump saying things like, "we kept our promise and we didn't even have to work that hard, everybody. The swamp drained itself and we helped them. Many good people who got pulled in a long, very long time ago, by some really bad, nasty, very nasty people, were begging us to save them and let them redeem themselves. We're not winning anymore, folks, WE WON!"

       He was born in the swamp.  Raised in the swamp.  Works for the swamp.  And he's playing the role he's supposed to play.  Anybody expecting Trump to save us is going to be waiting in disappointment for a very. long. time.

       I’ll just flip that comment back at you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing i always mention when people say this is: during Obamas 8 years there was a average of 3-400 people arrested on human trafficking and paedophilia charges, this year alone that number is in the several thousands. I’d say he have saved a LOT of people. Dont believe me, look it up to form a conclussion yourself, if not, I can provide you with some nice sources.

       The swamp is being drained as we speak, and Im really sorry for all the missguided souls that dont see that

       How humble of Trump, to have all of this wildly spectacular success, and not even want to take credit for it.  He's always so humble and under the radar with
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       he accomplishes.  It's almost like he pretends not to even have anything to do with the criminal cases the doj and fbi pursue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody does humble better than Trump.

       No, the deal with trump is that he knows exactly how and when people will react to certain stuff. Its so delightful watching him play the other side time and time again. Im sick of being bipartisan. Im going to go full trump on this sub now, because he is involved in the biggest of them all right now, and that is taking down the pedophile elite that run the show.

       You mean, like how people react to his own creepy pedo-like comments?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since nobody does pedo better than Trump, maybe he'll be kind enough to lock himself up too, when it's all done.  Well...  After he's done threatening NK with nuclear Holocaust, of course.

       The Numbers cited there are prostitution as well. And whaddayaknow, even those declined more and more under Obama, but from the looks of it, the problem is only getting bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article mentioned that an average of 270 kids where rescued a year, and that number is as well way way higher so far this year alone also. And Im talking about human trafficking and pedophilia charges. Look up the arrest on FBI.gov, then come back to me. It took you two minutes to prove you didnt actually read what either i wrote, or what was in the article.

       You attack my reading comprehension yet you gloss over that it says the prostitutes were minors. This doesn't even cover all of Obamas two terms, just a few years, so your numbers are still nonsense. Like the other guy said too, trump would be tweeting like crazy if he was actually doing the things you think he is.

       One could just assume the influx of busts is just lip service to the pizza gate community. If you see busts happening, you naturally think progress is being made, but I'm not convinced yet. These are all just sacrifices to their network to get the heat off the story in my opinion, it has nothing to do with Trump or Obama. In order for any black market to thrive, there must be curuption at the top levels, so until I see some big names start falling I won't be satisfied with the results.

       I wish people would just stop for a second and at least attempt to put themselves in other peoples shoes, and to be respectful of other people and not get themselves all caught up in thinking they're superior, because the people who do that cause all the problems in the world and are the least likely to work out that they're part of the problem.

       It was already obvious, but became crystal clear once he started talking about Wikileaks and Assange at the start of the week, and the numbers tweeted by JA. He doesn't know wtf he's talking about, and you're gas gullible as they come if you believe anything this guy says.

       This. That's precisely what makes this whole "MegaAnon" narrative intriguing enough, and therefore interesting to watch (for me at least), and High Level Insider has some explaining to do, haha...

       So your insightful contribution is that we have no way of knowing anything for sure? Doesn't sound too bright of a conclusion to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but you say Mega is a fraud without saying WHY. Then you say that he has no credibility again WITHOUT SAYING WHY.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would conclude that because you're a person who makes position statements without giving the reasons behind them that YOU are a fraud and YOU have no credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fine to be a skeptic, but your skepticism should be grounded on REASON, not on fruitless emotion.

       So your response is to ask me questions in an emotional, petulant manner - "Why would you trust this guy??" - as if that is anything close to a reason that supports your position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the onus is on you to give a reasonable explanation because you are the one trying to discredit Mega. But because you don't, you have demonstrated that you have zero credibility. The only thing people shouldn't trust is YOU because people like you who only make position statements are people who infect healthy minds with unreasonable doubt and emotional skepticism.
      </p>

       Your credibility is gone. It's time to move on.

       I've only read MegaAnon post shared on this sub.  From what I've seen there is some truth to his predictions.  I don't see him being an insider though just a guy following a lot of information making claims.

       However you state he is a fraud and doesn't know what he is talking about.  Care to dissect and break this down across the board? You sound like Anon 5.

       Come on! Don't you need to physically see with your own eyes as the bullet passed right thorough their chest to believe it?

      <p>
       It's the video of the guy who's mom is a paramedic trying to help out, not really NSFL, but also not conclusive proof. But I've also seen enough to be convinced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can someone answer an honest question? What reason would the government, if they actually did do this.. why wouldn't they ACTUALLY just kill people. What do they have to gain by leaving hundreds of people alive as loose ends, people that (never do) can come out and show the world it's fake?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there's two arguments that exist on this sub that directly conflict.. they'll murder a girl who has a tumor on her pituitary for saying there's more than one shooter.. versus they'll spend tons on money, planning, hiring hundreds of loose ends to make it look like people died..
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't those two types of conspiracy theorists at each other's throats? They'll murder this one person for saying something against the narrative, versus they're unwilling to actually kill a hoard of people for.. reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly curious at this point.

       Was the first thing I noticed as well. The original MA posts weren't formatted like a 12 year old trumpite wrote it. Which actually made it seem plausible. Now we get the (((them))) bullshit and weird all caps. Not even trying to be similar.

       I admit.. I hadn't looked back that far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still only one usage, so I wouldn't read too much into it, but I agree it does lend some credence that it may be the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I picked "y'all" specifically because it is a southern dialect thing - which (if unintentionally/casually used) could give off more information on the poster (making them less 'anon').
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that they realized that and stopped using "y'all" for a while to camouflage their language. Now that things are supposedly "in the bag / it's happening" for real (at least from megaAnon's perspective), and the volume of posts has gone
       <em>
        WAY
       </em>
       up, maybe they are being less careful with concealing their language. Again just a possibility.

       I just have to have a small moan, MegaAnon has been a shining light through all the chaos, complexity and confusion, and I finally feel the relief of those jigsaw pieces coming together, but she has no idea how difficult it is to piece together a grand narrative from nowhere. MegaAnon is quick to berate people for not working things out for themselves, but if you don't have the benefit of insider knowledge it's all as clear as mud. Having said that, God bless MegaAnon

       9/11 was the first conspiracy I looked into and that was around middle school. Concrete false-flag evidence imo. Everything he has said has eventually came out days later. I’m still skeptical but it’s literally happening before our own eyes.

       Nothing has changed, they're just using conservative MSM channels to piggy back on the story to tie it to Trump, which makes it white noise to the hive mind population in an attempt to bury the story it in plain sight. Similiar to how Alex Jones will report on real issues, then act crazy about something trivial, to ensure all that he says is equally unbelievable to the average listener. Trump is working in conjuction with the MSM to be the fall guy, and once the deed is done, they'll just swap him out with Pence or someone else less polarizing, and most of us will just celebrate the fact that he got impeached as some sort of victory, and be content with that.

       As much as I want left-wing oligarchs and cronies to go down (Clintons, Comey, Lynch, etc. all the "deep state"), let us NOT forget for one second that crooked ass Trump has his own set of handlers and his own "Deep State" warmonger neocons who only aim to scam the fuck out of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us not forget that Trump has surrounded himself by the same lobbyists and neocons that have ravaged this country and the world for over 40 years. Don't be duped into thinking they are somehow "the good guys".

       We can address the mechanisms that are destroying us: the Patriot Act, Citizens United, lobbyists, private prisons, the defunct "War on Drugs", we can lessen the burdens for middle to lower classes on healthcare, regulations, etc., fix defense spending to stop the theft of trillions of dollars from private contractors, gut the power of large corporate cartels and embolden workers, etc etc etc.

       Good points but you need to replace the existing corrupt structure with something positive. You need an alternative way of generating wealth for

       He's right. My suggestion is usually to work the people we personally know in our areas of influence by gently reminding them that we are living in a brutal prison planet and that we need to all put in a little wee bit of work per day to change the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't realize this but even a 5 minute convo with 1 person per day about the prison planet situation has a good chance to go a LONG, LONG, LONG way because important news naturally spreads like wildfire among people. Imagine if we all just spent 2-3 minutes a day nudging a sleeper here and there in our circles (our kids, parents, friends, associates, ect..).
      </p>
      <p>
       People still underestimate their own power. Each individual has a lot of power but they assume they have little power and get discouraged by this illusion. The fastest way to world peace is to focus on the self and get the self working towards a better future. That's all everyone has to worry about. The rest will take care of itself.

       Not really. Anon just said:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I get asked all of the time on here, shit like "what can we do to help", like I'm some internet-certified life coach (and I'm not, those degrees are bullshit BTW) but that said, posts like yours drive me nuts (no offense). Y'all post about and/or reference JFK all the time. Did he not say, "ask not what your country can do for you, but what YOU can do, for your country"? I mean, I'm not trying to seem condescending but there's an awful lot of people bitching on here all the time about how long shit takes, it will never happen, they'll cover it up, (((they're))) too strong, etc. but other than that, not much else coming from y'all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not for nothing but between two of the archive files on two capped images of posts I made, between /pol/, twitter and Facebook alone, there are like 150k views. Whether people think I'm a Larp or not, I don't give a fuck, but imagine if everyone who's "woke" enough to be here or click a link to read my posts they think I'm just regurgitating info on, actually picked up a fucking phone and used the same 3 minutes of reading time, to call the FBI, DOJ, WH, etc. and DEMAND ACTION, or better yet, peacefully protested outside those offices, demanding JUSTICE and PROGRESS, then maybe YOU wouldn't have to wait! Know what gets shit publicly recognized and moving in DC?!? 150k people standing in front of THE SWAMP. If YOU think it can happen ANY FASTER, than MAKE IT FUCKING HAPPEN. Stop bringing more problems than solutions. Hasn't this admin, or the last 9 months of it's term, proven to you ENOUGH, what they're up against?! They're practically BEGGING YOU TO SHOW UP AND ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY, then do it. If everyone on /pol/ right now took the 3 minutes it took them to read this shit and CALLED the DOJ and FBI asking THEM the same questions of "why" and "when", you know you'll just keep asking me, then MAYBE you will be able to say you had a small part in making "IT REALLY HAPPEN", on YOUR schedules, not (((theirs)))."

       I have heard about MegaAnon for the first time here, 2 weeks ago:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74soc5/megaanon_drops_huge_nuggets_about_the_calm_before/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74soc5/megaanon_drops_huge_nuggets_about_the_calm_before/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anon was very loud about three 3-letter agencies coming down soon:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I told you FBI, CIA and eventually, the Fed. It's all coming down."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Anon also talked about the next wikileaks file dumps and how it's related to the "investigations" of the "collusions" etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "This dump will be broad. It will probably be the biggest file dump Wikileaks has ever published in size and when it's out there, it's going to leave NO DOUBT on things like, WHO colluded with Russia, WHY it was done, WHAT crimes Hillary (as Secretary of State AND as a presidential candidate) and the elite DNC/GOP/Obama admin, like Lynch, Comey, etc. actually committed. Again, when it's done you will have ZERO DOUBT AS TO WHO IS ACTUALLY GUILTY OF CRIMES AND ELECTONS RIGGING. "

       Come on! Don't you need to physically see with your own eyes as the bullet passed right thorough their chest to believe it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the video of the guy who's mom is a paramedic trying to help out, not really NSFL, but also not conclusive proof. But I've also seen enough to be convinced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can someone answer an honest question? What reason would the government, if they actually did do this.. why wouldn't they ACTUALLY just kill people. What do they have to gain by leaving hundreds of people alive as loose ends, people that (never do) can come out and show the world it's fake?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there's two arguments that exist on this sub that directly conflict.. they'll murder a girl who has a tumor on her pituitary for saying there's more than one shooter.. versus they'll spend tons on money, planning, hiring hundreds of loose ends to make it look like people died..
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't those two types of conspiracy theorists at each other's throats? They'll murder this one person for saying something against the narrative, versus they're unwilling to actually kill a hoard of people for.. reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly curious at this point.
