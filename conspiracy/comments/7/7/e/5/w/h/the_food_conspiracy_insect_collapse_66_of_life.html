       75% of flying insects died off over 30 years in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insects = 66% of life on land.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at a photo of a "nature reserve" in the German insect study, you can clearly see the reserves are in intensive agricultural areas. It's kinda the point. It's like southern Ontario, a big shit hole of crop fields with small tree islands. The islands are too isolated and small to sustain biodiversity. Ecology needs a depth and breadth of forest to propagate. My brother-in-law used to say, if the bugs won't eat it, neither will I. I always admired the bald faced simplicity of that claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 corporations = 100% of media.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 families = 100% of food. (poetic license = slight exageration)
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans and livestock occupy 50% of land and caused 80% of land vertebrate species extinctions over 10,000 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans and livestock caused 66% of insect die offs in the last 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans and livestock will destroy 100% of soil in 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our food is killing all the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       When soil dies we will have to cut more trees to grow food.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is clearly not only unsustainable, it is anti-sustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The food that is poisoning us while destroying earth and burning soil is not a giant corporation filled with worker drones.
      </p>
      <p>
       90% of food products we buy is owned by 10 corporations, and those 10 corporations buy their food supplies from 5 super rich powerful families.
      </p>
      <p>
       These 5 families now own the poison proof seeds and technology we need to eat. This is why we allow them to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monsanto and Bayer are the 2 primary drivers of mass extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are going to legally merge into one giant earth killing machine, and we're too caught up in race, sex and class politics to notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ten corporations now buy food from 5 family monopolies in America while in India, small farms produce 75% of food. These 5 families want to monopolize food worldwide. They must be stopped or life on earth will die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carbon pricing food will reduce its energy footprint. Make food great again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie Sanders and Barbara Boxer once sponsored a bill that would allow the government to claim 66% of all carbon tax payments, with the remaining 33% going to private citizens. This is predatory socialist capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Hansen wants 100% of your carbon tax payments to be paid back to you, the private citizen, with 0% for governments and corporations. Conservatives agree this is the most equitable and quickest way to unite humanity for survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Liberals and Conservatives use Sex, Race and Class politics to prevent this from happening and perpetuate the militarization of tax receipts whether it be for social or military wars.

       Anyone who is able really needs to start growing their own food. American suburbia is filled with grass, which is useless. Imagine if that were gardens. Even this could be be bad though if everyone grew the GMO crop with pesticides, because then we would be spreading pesticides to even more places. We need organic home grown food. Save the seeds for the next crop when possible. This is how we counter the spread of the GMO seed.

       Community gardens like they have in Germany and Austria would be cool, but so few people know how to garden and I have no idea how you would go about jumpstarting a gardening culture like that.

       The best idea I could come up with is start your own garden and give extra food away to neighbors. This improves their health by giving them fresh vegetables and possibly piques their interest in getting into it themselves. Fundamentally people make poor long term decisions because they fear lack of money (or more directly, they fear starvation) so they work jobs that may not be in their best long term interest to make money. If you can help alleviate that fear by giving people fresh food then it can have a ripple effect which can result in more overall net gain than you might think just from the amount of food you gave away. It seems insignificant but every little bit helps.

       There's a guy in Florida that pays people to let him use their yards to garden with and then sells the stuff he grows in local farmer's markets. It's an interesting model for getting people who don't know/want to garden to open up land for it. It wouldn't be hard to have something like that where the owner is paid in a mix of fresh food and money.

       Thats a cool model. Reminds me of a guy I met in San Francisco who has  had a community garden for over 30 years there. He lets people come volunteer and take whatever they want which is also a nice model because it teaches people the basics, spreads fresh food around the community, and helps you maintain the garden.

       Well you can't buy GMO seeds at stores like Wal-Mart or whatever, but the pesticides would be an issue. In that.. Good luck growing anything without pests destroying it.

       Oh yeah, you can. But the pests get worse as you keep going. Like the first year I grew squash the yield was unbelievable. Dozens of huge butternut squash from multiple plants, etc etc. After that year, I got squash borers every time. I try to fight them, but its hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the soils I grew tomatoes in now has carried the disease over to future plants. Kale got ravaged by some nasty ass shit, along with all other leaf vegetables (but especially kale..)

       One thing did work really well with minimal pests, and that was green beans.

       That makes sense. I set up the garden then moved out so idk how it did in subsequent seasons (although I know the owner of the house did pretty well the next summer). I've heard about different natural remedies such as introducing predator insects or pairing certain herbs that act to ward off pests, but I haven't tried any of those yet.

       Big suprise, Monsanto seems like an unstoppable cancer, which is probably ironic, if we could get more untampered data from their 'scientists'.  Didn't France outlaw their pesticides precise due to the Neonicotinoids leading to colony collapse disorder?  As things get worse, the societal collapse only further overshadows these kind of foundational concerns.  We don't get paid enough to do these justice, and the people that do, seem to get paid to turn a blind eye.  Talk about frustrating.

       Seriously, massive issues with our food supply and logistics are basically the primary driver of a huge chunk, possibly a large majority, of the disease burden all over the world, especially in the west.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've personally witnessed multiple reversals of 'incurable mystery diseases' simply by way of dietary alteration, but suggesting that the food is whats really making people sick is still widely considered quackery by too many professionals and members of the public.

       Food sustainability is something I'm quite passionate about, and it's something that everyone can contribute to changing. We can all make a choice about what we eat, and instead of pointing fingers to the cattle producers and the "5 food families" we should take responsibility for our own actions and reduce meat consumption (reduce, not eliminate, don't panic).

       What would happen to these big livestock companies and factory farms if America decided it would eat 50% less meat? They would be in absolute crisis and collapse. If no one if buying their food then they simply cannot exist, the power is in our hands to beat these guys but we need to make uncomfortable changes.

       Also, just shifting focus on meat consumed to more sustainable versions is a great idea too. Grass fed meat from ruminants isn't just more sustainable than grain fed meat, it's usually better for you. Feed lots are a ton worse than traditional methods ethically, environmentally and in terms of health. so it really should people really should consider staying away from feed lot meat just on its own.

       I am happy I live where I do. my father and law and his friend went hunting and shot a moose. I was given 2 quarters to cut up and now I have a freezer full of moose burger that will last my family till next hunting season at the very least. we grow a garden (albeit a short growing season) and we usually have carrots for months after harvest. if we do good with broccoli we blanch it and freeze it for later. we could definitely do more but we try to get as much food from subsistence living as we can.

       get rid of your lawn and plant food.  buy only whole foods and stop buying processed shit.  Buy local.  if enough people reduce the amount of money they get then we can make a change.  we have to feed the things we want and starve the things we dont

       Big suprise, Monsanto seems like an unstoppable cancer, which is probably ironic, if we could get more untampered data from their 'scientists'.  Didn't France outlaw their pesticides precise due to the Neonicotinoids leading to colony collapse disorder?  As things get worse, the societal collapse only further overshadows these kind of foundational concerns.  We don't get paid enough to do these justice, and the people that do, seem to get paid to turn a blind eye.  Talk about frustrating.

       That makes sense. I set up the garden then moved out so idk how it did in subsequent seasons (although I know the owner of the house did pretty well the next summer). I've heard about different natural remedies such as introducing predator insects or pairing certain herbs that act to ward off pests, but I haven't tried any of those yet.
