        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, I&#39;m not against transgender people, whatever my opinion is on why they are the way they are, it doesn&#39;t matter, I believe live and let live as long as people don&#39;t force themselves on you and your children. </p>

<p>Now we&#39;re celebrating this as not only completely normal, but that men should be fantasizing about other men posing as women. </p>

<p>They signed up for a heterosexual experience, and to deliver this is disgusting. </p>

<p>To be fair, as I&#39;ve gotten into my 30&#39;s and really thought more about mind control, the media, the destruction of the family, etc I realize now that things like porn and playboy had far more negative consequences than positive on the morals of our culture and how we view women and relationships. </p>

<p>I loved playboy as a kid, I loved porn, but now I realize what it does to your mind over the long term, and also the progression of how it starts innocent and then trys to guide you on a more degenerate and then more degenerate type of material. </p>

<p>Even back when internet porn sites were brand new, I remember pop up after pop up of truly sick porn links trying to get me down the rabbit hole. </p>

<p>It&#39;s my opinion this is on purpose to destroy our culture, Playboy is a failing brand and certainly this is massive publicity for them but they aren&#39;t the ones leading the charge, even sites like pornhub will pop up endless shemale video links. </p>

<p>How is it that transgenders can force themselves into heterosexual mens space and claim to be a sex symbol they should fantasize about, but when heterosexual men tell transgenders that they want nothing to do with them and it&#39;s gross, they are bigots?</p>

<p>Simple, because the degenerate people in charge want the narrative this way, and want to use public opinion and peer pressure to convince impressionable minds that men fucking she-men is totally normal and should be celebrated. </p>

<p>Same with the current one, Ines Rau, who had <em>already</em> been featured in the magazine three years ago. French model, had success before it was reveal she was a post-op transgender woman. Now she&#39;s just being &#39;upgraded&#39; to a Playmate.</p>

<p>She doesn&#39;t have a dick, so you don&#39;t have to be scared that you&#39;ll accidentally see a dong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being outed is fraud, it&#39;s not the same thing as being openly pushed. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not afraid of seeing a dick, and this is the kind of bullshit that gets pushed on men like me that don&#39;t want to be force fed pics of trannys. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of guys who are embarrassed that they constantly look at tranny porn, so they try and shame men like me LOL. I&#39;ve had 70 something female sex partners, I&#39;m not some repressed mormon living in a basement, I just don&#39;t think teenage boys need to be shamed into thinking shemales are normal THEY ARE NOT. </p>

<p>Even science tells us it&#39;s a trick, our brains are wired to be attracted to female features, so when a man fakes it through surgeries, signals get crossed and confused. Media is trying to make an illusion a fact. </p>

<p>By they way, she does have a dick, it&#39;s turned inside out and shoved up inside her, it&#39;s still a dick, it&#39;s not a vagina, and unless you subscribe to tranny magazine, you shouldn&#39;t be seening picks of guys, it&#39;s really that simple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re the one accusing me of being against &quot;nature&quot;, it&#39;s not my argument it&#39;s his. &quot;You&#39;ve already lost&quot; yet you don&#39;t explain why...? What exactly is wrong with my philosophical approach to defending my entire existence?</p>

<p>Yeah, it is pure mental illness that makes me uncomfortable in my own body and I have rationalized it that way. Am I supposed to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist or should I follow what makes my life easier and take steps to alleviate the suffering my illness causes me? You have this broad concept of &quot;mental illness&quot; with no real notion other than the vague concept of &quot;dat bad&quot; when you&#39;re probably suffering from some about yourself be it depression or anxiety. It&#39;s fairly common.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How am I shaming you because I don&#39;t think tranny pics belong in heterosexual magazines?</p>

<p>Why is it ok for you to force your lifestyle on me? Just go be you, go fuck people that want to fuck you, most men do not want to have sex with transgenders, sorry, but whatever percent do, great, go have fun. </p>

<p>My argument is simple, you are not a sex object to most of us, you are not a woman to most of us, it doesn&#39;t mean we hate you, or don&#39;t support your right to be you, what people like me don&#39;t support is you forcing your lifestyle on us. </p>

<p>How about, being a Man means not being threatened by what other people find interesting or pleasurable.  You might find being a Man is having the Self confidence to acknowledge differences, without being personally insulted.</p>

<p>You are totally right that this is part of a much larger agenda, a satanic agenda. You&#39;re also right that Playboy was a gateway drug to harder porn. Now, it&#39;s nothing, pretty much. It will likely close down the magazine in less than a year, now that Hef is dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am well aware that Hef doesn&#39;t run Playboy. But he&#39;s the one who&#39;s kept the mag publishing, same way he&#39;s gotten to stay in the PB Mansion even though it&#39;s been sold. </p>

<p>You must be much younger than me. The Playboy of my youth had truly beautiful natural women like Lisa Welch, Sandy Cagle, Karen Witter, Justine Grenier, Terri Welles, Barbara Edwards, Karen Price, Petra Verkaik (!), Susie Scott, Devin Devasquez....</p>

<p>[didn&#39;t have those memorized....had to go look them up]. </p>

<p>Then if you go back further, to the 1960s/70s, heyday, there were absolutely spectacular all-natural women.</p>

<p>Playboy has sucked for a long time. Not erotic, not sensual, far gone from the &quot;girl next door&quot; types who made sex look fun, healthy, participatory. Now it&#39;s porn star wannabes with the accompanying fake boobs, lips, nose, and so on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;m probably younger than you. Because you actually bought Playboys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The best part about Playboy was the articles.&quot; LOL! From the guy who never bought Playboy and can only relate to the recent fake playmate types. </p>

<p>Offering observations about why Playboy was great and now sucks is not &quot;pining over the past,&quot; it&#39;s merely an explanation. Those women in those pictures are going to live forever on the internet (or at least until the EMP), so there&#39;s nothing to pine for. They&#39;re still there. It&#39;s my interest in porn that&#39;s gone away (thank Jesus). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>dailywire....  No wonder you think the way you do.  </p>

<p>I know it can be upsetting when certain urges arise in a man, and coming to terms with those urges can make some people uncomfortable, but it&#39;s OK.  You don&#39;t have to fight it.  Just be happy with who you are, and everything else will be OK.  There is really no downside, unless some bigoted assholes try to make you feel bad about it. You don&#39;t have to lash out like this. Nobody gives a shit about how you feel about yourself, or who you want to have sex with.  Your obsession with who others want to have sex with is troubling. You need to let it go, and embrace who you are.  There is not shame.</p>

<p>Unless you think homosexuality is a choice.  In that case, I have to ask how difficult it was for you to choose to not be homosexual.  By the level of animosity you have towards the LGBQT community, it seems it must have been a significant struggle for you. I&#39;m sorry to hear that.  I know who I am, and I&#39;ve got no problem with that.  I can&#39;t imagine how difficult it must be for you to deny who you truly are. It&#39;s sad, even pathetic really. </p>
