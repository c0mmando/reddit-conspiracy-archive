       Alright, I haven't been here (in this sub) for very long, so if I'm off base with the following, please let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the aftermath of the LV Shooting, more and more people are seeing, and poking at, the gaping holes in the official narrative. This sub, and individuals on other forums, bloggers, etc, have done a good job of calling out the inconsistencies (which are glaring), but from where I stand, it doesn't seem like we're any closer to the truth. I think, given time, the truth would come out organically, and we might even reach a critical mass with enough average people calling for a stop to the shenanigans and illegal war.
      </p>
      <p>
       My fear is that we don't have time to wait for that to happen. We're already seeing the Goog/YT/FB/etc censoring and censuring anyone asking even the most basic, logical, questions. Even more, the
       <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-cyber/tech-firms-improve-cooperation-on-extremism-but-more-needed-u-s-security-chief-says-idUSKBN1CN2TF">
        US Security Secretary is calling for corporations
       </a>
       to do even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       to clamp down on "extremist" content and "propaganda". Meanwhile the MSM is THE propaganda arm of the Deep State, but that's whole other can of worms.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is extremist content? Well, based on this
       <a href="http://start.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/publications/research_briefs/LaFree_Bersani_HotSpotsOfUSTerrorism.pdf">
        DHS Funded Study
       </a>
       extremist/terrorist content now may include subject matters relating to:
*Americans who “are fiercely nationalistic, as opposed to universal and international in orientation”
*Americans considering themselves “anti-global”
*Americans who are “suspicious of centralized federal authority”
*Americans who are “reverent of individual liberty (especially their right to own guns and be free of taxes)”
*Americans exhibiting a belief in “conspiracy theories that involve grave threat to national sovereignty and/or personal liberty and a belief that one’s personal and/or national way of life is under attack”
      </p>
      <p>
       This pretty much means we, everyone here, are all extremists in their eyes, as well as anyone that simply questions authority. If this definition becomes common place, if the Liberty Act or other similar legislation goes through, we're looking at a real Totalitarian existence here in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of you here seem to be damn good at digging and detective work. There needs to be a concerted effort to get past the surface layer discrepancies and get to the truth. Maybe this is in fact happening, and I don't see it. Just seems to me that we're focusing more on the parade of disinformation - why Campos' story doesn't add up, why he looks 20 lbs heavier on Ellen, was the private award ceremony restaurant remodeled or not, is Schuck FBI or not - rather than digging deeper and finding a real smoking gun. If that doesn't happen, and soon, I think we're all well screwed.

       See my comment below. The administration is playing this close to their chest because they know it could lead to escalation/division in the country. Mandalay bay is controlling the narrative to avoid lawsuits - they sent a janitor to check on something a security guard should have looked into. Also, these comments will be deleted in about an hour.

       Pay very close attention. They are experimenting with body doubles at this point to prevent any true assassinations. I keep my ear very close to the ground -  this could be disinfo, however I believe the source to be credible. The motive for this shooting was an assassination attempt. Trump was flown in to Vegas that evening to meet with Sheldon Adelson the next morning. The meeting was moved to the White House after the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Campos was possibly a shooter. Look for evidence of a shooting platform in the second hotel room. Find the pictures of the green tape on the mattress - this was the primary shooters location.

       I read you as saying Trump was the target and that he was there to meet with Adelson, who appears to be a right-wing foil to Soros. Admittedly I don't know much about Adelson... but a short read suggests he's a Republican with Zionist leanings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying that the attempt was funded by Adelson/ his people, or that it was carried out by an anti-zionist group? Or simply an anti-Trump group?

       At this point the administration doesn't even know. I would be willing to bet Soro's funded this, considering he shorted MGM's stock just before this went down. Our friend John also warned /pol/ to look into OSI (a soro's owned company which would benefit from this event) so that leads me to believe the shadow government orchistrated this.
