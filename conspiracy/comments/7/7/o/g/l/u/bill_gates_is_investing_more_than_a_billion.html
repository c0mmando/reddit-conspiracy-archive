    <div class="md"><p>The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation have been quite open about their views on education reform (and the need thereof) in the USA. You can even read about it in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation#Education">wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>They already put in estimated 3.4B$ towards that and similar goals, so while this donation/investment is significant, it&#39;s not really coming out of the blue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. He declared about 10 years ago that he was going to give the bulk of his money away and set up the foundation. Today he&#39;s much higher on the rich person list than before. How&#39;s that possible.</p>

<p>He is doing it to get richer. It is a tax dodge, plain and simple. A legal tax dodge but still a tax dodge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the free insult. I&#39;ll make sure to pass that on to all the people in Africa who got access to fresh drinking water, medicine and education due to his efforts (along with other such as Buffet and Bush). His net worth has been on the decline for a while now (due to his charities), and if you read the wiki you&#39;ll notice some of their stances are non-conventional when it comes to education in the USA (so you can count that as &quot;advancing his interests&quot;).</p>

<p>Do you have any reason to suspect his actions? Or are just an Apple person?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Gates was known his entire life for NOT giving to charities. Then suddenly he all about &quot;giving away&quot; all his money. Yeah... right.....</p>

<p>Dude. Putting money in a private foundation is NOT about giving your money to charities. It&#39;s about manipulating 5% of his annual profits to look like it&#39;s going to useful charities in order to not pay taxes on the remaining 95% profit.</p>

<p>He&#39;s paying 5% to not pay taxes on the remaining 95% of his profits only. And that 5% goes into some creative ways to make more profits.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not in the 1%. He&#39;s in the .001%.</p>

<p>Why are people buying this bullshit about him being a philanthropist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey dude, I was around when MS-DOS was first released. I was here watching Microsoft crush the competition using ruthless tactics. Bill Gates never ever gave anything to anyone. Ever. Including, and especially, after he created his foundation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that I&#39;m defending Gates, it&#39;s just that you&#39;re 100% wrong about this. You&#39;re saying things that are factually incorrect. I have direct ties to nonprofits in the Seattle area, and I personally know for a fact specific times when money has moved from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to specific nonprofit organizations. I&#39;m sorry but you&#39;re just completely dead wrong about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, never ever ever, except for the minimum he has to give? And that just happens to go to the handful of random regional nonprofits I&#39;m connected to?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are a million valid reasons to hate Bill Gates, but &#39;lack of philanthropy&#39; is not one of them. He gives away a mountain of money each year. He&#39;s known for this. Criticizing Bill Gates for not giving away enough money is like criticizing Michael Jordon for sucking so much at basketball. It doesn&#39;t even make sense.</p>
