       Why the fuck have they still not come up with a motive / any other evidence regarding Stephen Paddock's "one-man-shooting-spree" bullshit?
      </p>
      <p>
       No better evidence they fucked up the false flag than their quick desire to move on with no questions answered. This story was supposed to dominate coverage for weeks instead theyre working hard to cover anything but.

       I think Soros was the financial backer for the guns found in the hotel room. That's why the Weinstein shit has blown up. To distract people. I think he's been arming the left and Mexicans for years. LV went way wrong for some reason. I think he was behind Leeland Yee (D) CA he was caught (trying) to smuggle guns into CA. There are class 3 weapons all fucking over the place in CA. Shit, fast and furious was probably done under Soros order. Just a thought

       This is bigger than Soros. Implement a perpetual climate of fear through security checkpoints and metal detectors at every hotel/casino in the country, and every festival/event, even just local. I think the idea was to implement a climate of fear and force us to demand more "security".

       The "left" isn't some monumental entity. Antifa and the Corporate Democrat Establishment are not "left" they are Neoliberal Centrists. The real Left is fighting the DNC and trying to take the party from the grassroots with organizations like Our Revolution, which has helped take 8 state parties from the Dem Establishment since last November.

      <p>
       I think it's important to note that Soros is only a part of the bigger picture. There are those more powerful than him in this world, and it is according to their plan that events go.

       hate speech is speech whether you like it or not.  People with hateful ideas need to still be given a place to voice their ideas as it gives a proper forum to debate them.  Otherwise ideas get fetishized as "suppressed thought"

       Pretty sure murder is already illegal.  I think you aren't familiar with either the constitution or natural rights.  I'm not advocating hate speech, but it's pretty obvious how slippery of a slope it is to restrict speech that's deemed hateful.  Especially given this current generation of college students who view microaggressions as violence.

       thats easy for you to say as someone who i imagine has never been a victim of violent crime because of your skin colour, religious beliefs or sexual preference. if your brother was murdered for being black im sure your opinion would be different. you certainly wouldnt be dismissing it because of a "slippery slope"
      </p>
      <p>
       the constitution was written 200 years ago. times change and laws need to adapt with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       think about it, youre saying you value your right to promote hatred above other peoples right to not be murdered. i dont think its possible to come up with a better example of insanely petty selfishness.
      </p>
      <p>
       the consistent theme with people that hold your opinion is their inability comprehend that hate speech creates violent crime that often results in the loss of life

       What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

       what's pathetic is that if someone has a different opinion than you, they automatically get called racist/kkk/murder supporter. And it's absurd that you keep equating words with murder.

       no one got called racist for having a different opinion. they got called racists for saying "tough shit if you get killed for being black, but their right preach hatred is more important than someones life"
      </p>

       its more absurd that you dont understand how words incite and encourage people to hurt others even though ive just given you a few links showing recent murders because of it.

       Isn't an alleged "hate crime" also just, you know, a regular crime?
      </p>
      <p>
       If somebody knifes a Jewish person or beats up a gay person, isn't that an attempted murder or assault crime anyway?
