       Short excerpt for tl;dr written in 1870
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Constitution has no inherent authority or obligation. It has no authority or obligation at all, unless as a contract between man and man. And it does not so much as even purport to be a contract between persons now existing. It purports, at most, to be only a contract between persons living eighty years ago. And it can be supposed to have been a contract then only between persons who had already come to years of discretion, so as to be competent to make reasonable and obligatory contracts. Furthermore, we know, historically, that only a small portion even of the people then existing were consulted on the subject, or asked, or permitted to express either their consent or dissent in any formal manner. Those persons, if any, who did give their consent formally, are all dead now. Most of them have been dead forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years. And the constitution, so far as it was their contract, died with them. They had no natural power or right to make it obligatory upon their children. It is not only plainly impossible, in the nature of things, that they could bind their posterity, but they did not even attempt to bind them. That is to say, the instrument does not purport to be an agreement between any body but “the people” then existing; nor does it, either expressly or impliedly, assert any right, power, or disposition, on their part, to bind anybody but themselves.&lt;

       As a contract, I agree, you need two parties and there has to be agreement and consideration.  But a Constitution or Declaration of Country and its independence is somewhat of a written framework for the rest of the laws and execution to  be organized around.  Of course it's not a real contract.

       I'm not sure theyre werent multiple shooters.

      <p>
       I cant see there being crisis actors and real deaths or crisis actors and real bullets.

       Nobody was shot. Zero shots fired.  The video of 'dead' people had actors and fake blood. Just like Boston bombing. I'm 100% sure this was another hoax.

       I'm completely with you, no shooting, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we need to prove the following things in the following order:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        That any live rounds were fired at all
       </li>
       <li>
        That anyone or anything was struck by those rounds.
       </li>
       <li>
        That injuries and deaths resulted.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       None have been satisfactorily proven yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone else asked me what proof of a shooting would be good enough and I'm not sure I know how to answer that. Any thoughts?

       He honesty might be. Maybe he was working that night and heard about the shooting and just wanted to be part of it... the world may never know.

       But we do know that pulse nightclub did not have an active shooter inside for hours while CNN and the police chilled outside spectating. Pulse was a play with a very dramatic plot, but very amatures writing and acting. 2/10

       You're comparing apples to oranges. Their crimes abroad stay there. It's not unlike "what happens in Vegas..." come to think of it. Within the borders of the US they are certainly going to opt for the less sloppy route. Why kill people when if you fake it the majority are going to think people died anyway?

       Successfully faking such events would be incredibly more difficult, costly and complex than simply hiring or tricking stooges into carrying them out IRL.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of people and logistics involved would be exponentially higher, from fake victims (and their families) to fake medical personnel cops, firefighters/paramedics and countles others who would have ti WILLINGLY play along.

      <p>
       Essentially you are arguing that groups of ruthless, powerful people are willing to go to extreme measures to dupe, undermine and destroy society, but that they would not be willing to slaughter a relative handful of what they see as wretched peasants?
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain you logic, please.

       I don't think you've thought through the risks involved for each case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The risks of screwing up a faked event are limited to someone talking about it. But who would they talk to and who would listen before they get taken aside and dealt with? Certainly not the media, who are absolutely complicit in spreading these lies. Financial incentives, agreements to reduce or quash criminal sentences, credible threats of violence against anyone who steps out of line... that's all it takes to control people.

       The number of people who need to be directly in on the plan is probably much smaller than you think. But even if it's a large number of people, we are talking about the US government and its allies. They have unlimited resources and millions of people from military families in dozens of NATO countries to call upon. I bet most of the people taking part do it for their country, out of loyalty to their command. After all, nobody gets hurt so where is the harm?
      </p>
      <p>
       The inconvenient truth is there's no evidence for any shots being fired, let alone anyone being injured or killed by gunfire. I do mean no evidence too. No physical evidence of bullet holes in anyone or anything. There isn't even credible evidence for
       <em>
        blanks
       </em>
       being fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have in place of what should be an abundance of physical evidence is a relatively small number of secondhand accounts from a handful of dubious individuals. In fact, if you do some deeer digging you'll see Las Vegas is just like every other one of these media phoney fake shows. They all rely on the gullibility of the masses and their trust in the media and in the word of complete strangers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, there are just as many accounts from regular  people saying "that's not gunfire" as there are suspected actors loudly proclaiming otherwise. For some reason people prefer to believe the accounts that agree with the thrust of the main narrative, the key fact for which is that people were shot and killed, instead of all those credible eyewitnesses that say no shots were fired. And this is in spite of knowing that the media and the government (who are fundamentally the same group anyway) deceives us continuously and on purpose.

       Vegas makes more sense if you assume that it
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       our own government, but was instead a foreign or corporate actor.   It explains some of the sloppiness and confusion around the handling and cover-up. If the US planned this there would be a much smoother cover-up and a prepared story and time line. (And probably prepared legislation of some kind).
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock may have been working for our side. Maybe he was selling arms to buyers the US could never admit to. Maybe he went rogue, or maybe the buyers set it all up just to do the shooting and leave Paddock's body to take the blame.  In any of these scenarios the US would cover it all up even if it wasn't originally their operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why, if it was a foreign or corporate entity the 'reason' becomes a lot easier.  There are plenty of foreign powers who would do this just to f things up for our government. As a retaliation strike for some nastiness we did to them or just to embarrass or emasculate our intelligence agencies.   It's probably not a coincidence that after Vegas the CIA Chief is openly claiming they will be "more vicious".  Keep an eye open for massacres and assassinations abroad - whomever is emasculated by those probably had a hand in vegas.

       Pretty good watch.  And someone asked the film maker, Corbett, What he thought of Las Vegas.  He was like I really don't.  He feels it's just the latest sensational thing to grab our attention and keep it focused away from the really important things going on quietly as TPTB moves it's agenda forward totally obscured by a cloud of Hollywood Pedos, terrorist attacks, NFL players taking a knee, and of course the endlessly fascinating accusations and counter-accusations of Russian collusion between Trump and the Democrats.

       It really bothers me that the Seth Rich story has basically stalled out without further scrutiny into the inflammatory claims in the Seymour Hersh audio recording and Rod Wheeler naming Detective Joey DellaCamera as the source who told him the police were told to stand down on the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell, no journalist has even
       <em>
        asked
       </em>
       DellaCamera to comment on Wheeler's claims, and they've all let Hersh's statements slide completely, instead of e.g. asking the police if Hersh was right about the chain of custody he said the laptop went through to get to the FBI, and/or about Rich being shot with a .22. Neither of those details has been made public. and a straight answer from the police could either discredit or lend credibility to the recording, if only they were asked. These are obvious avenues for real journalistic follow-up on these unconfirmed but serious allegations, but just aren't being touched. This bothers me every day.

       this. I have a degree in journalism and work in construction. I can easily get a job with the mass media but I don't. as editor-in-chief of my school paper, I tried to get the professor running it to loosen up the rules on what students could write about because I felt we were just another PR mouthpiece for the college. she ended up completely blowing up at me and saying that i "didn't get it." this was just the first thing to disillusion me with being a reporter. now I understand that she was completely right and there was something I didn't get fully, which is that we were being trained to be good, little "journalists" and not real, no bullshit, gumshoe reporters who actually dial phones, hit the street and go knock on doors.

       It's legit.  It takes practice.  Boiled down to:  Try to fly all the time, testing if you are dreaming. Eventually (as short as a day or two) you will try to fly when you're sleeping.

       I can fly easily, I can climb. Don't you hate getting trapped in dreams? Literally, imagine dreaming and suddenly you have 500 black marks in your dream on your arms and you wake up in panic because you think that you might wake up with the 501st black mark which in turn, means at least a year, if drawn in a cross, line for days.

       The conspiracy to keep us "plugged".  Now that ive awoken, its so surreal how i used to live in the past.  My whole family is "plugged", and they live their lives in blissful ignorance while all of these huge events come crashing down around us.  They sit there happily scrolling through youtube, waiting for ads to finish, chomping down a double cheeseburger with the tv in the background playing some ad, all the while blissfully stupefied to the fact that hollywood is rotting this country's moral compass, there was foul play in the vegas shooting, hillary might be in bed with the russians etc.  How far gone is a person where it wouldnt be worth it to unplug them?  I cant imagine how it could be, from here on out, to just live my life and die a stupified sap.  They have perfected this system against the middle class, without firing a single shot.

       lately?  the theory that reality is a simulation run by an AI, manifesting as a mutable timespace cube in line with the Back to the Future model of time travel, the secrets of which have been given to a few well-known groups whose ideology possibly (or maybe not) aligns with the ethics that such an arrangement produces.

       One simulation theory I like to ponder is one where the AI is essentially our ego experiencing itself in a definable realm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, I think if this is a simulation, no one of this realm is aware of this. There may be entities (viruses, bugs, glitches) in this realm that are aware of the implementation of the simulation but I don't think they have much sway over the general scheme.

       something like this, yes.  if you were stuck in a void as an entity, and you wanted to learn about yourself you'd maybe copy yourself or parts of yourself and study them.  this process of splitting and reconfiguring is what energy does.  if we're all energy - well you can see where that leads.  so the question of how does that energy organize itself is indicative of the underlying design patterns at play, and one must only observe nature to see the overall pattern.   my theory is that we're in a fracally phi reality here - as this is what nature tends to show.

       The idea that the reality around me is inauthentic or false. It's not what it appears to be. My evidence primarily consists of little things I've noticed over the years, so I guess you could call it a "hunch", but I feel it in my bones. Something strange is going on.

       I just feel like I'm not supposed to be here, in this place, living this life. I see flashes of another place and time that feel "real", but I've never been there. It's like a vague memory from my childhood or something. This place just feels inauthentic. Like this life is made to appear real, but it serves another purpose, something nefarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the whole scientific perspective of our reality being an illusion, just molecules bouncing around, our senses being unreliable, etc. I'm not talking about that at all. I can't shake the idea that this place was designed with a malevolent intent behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could speculate all day, but I just don't know for sure. Is this world is a prison, and I (we?) did something before we came here to warrant this punishment? Is it all in my mind? Is Earth a simulated biosphere? Or did we do nothing wrong, but we are nevertheless trapped here for some esoteric reason? It sounds like the Matrix, but the Gnostics were on to this idea 2000+ years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the most provocative thought to me is that I am dead and this is hell. Not the Abrahamic hell really, but something real that the old myth is based upon? I was so happy and kind as a child, and now I've become this... thing. Did I die as a child and come here?
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like madness but it's been preoccupying my thoughts. I sometimes wish that either my family or I had a history of mental illness, so I could write it off as that.

       Time is a prison.  The wardens sit between the frames of the refresh rate of the universe.  They have been contacted by occultists and they have shared their information with them in order to stimulate negativity in this realm as punishment.

       Well of course it is not what it appears to be. Philosophy 101, man. You are limited by what your human body allows you to experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their are wavelengths, colors, and sounds all around you that are impossible for you to percieve. You only live in the 3rd dimension and can barley even experience that as it truly is. Every animal on this planet pretty much lives in a different reality based solely on their sensory organs.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the subatomic level though you are just oscillating electrons, which is simply vibrating energy. ALL matter is made up of that, meaning that matter doesn't exist. It's all just energy forming holograms that compose the 3rd dimension. All life is made of this same basic stuff in the universe, meaning that you are literally just the universe experiencing itself. It's all one thing. Call it God, the Absolute, or Elmo the Dark Lord, we don't fucking know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that you are more than your physical body. Conciousness is NOT limited to the 3rd dimension. It is not tangible. It isn't made of oscillating electrons like everything else. That's because it isn't the brain that creates conciousness, but conciousness that creates the brain. The total number of minds in the universe is one. Your brain is just an antenna tapping into the universal conciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you feel you are in a false reality is because this is stuff the mystics figured out millennia ago through inner-exploration, but you have been discouraged to figure it out for yourself so that you are a more obedient worker and consumer.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the universe. Enjoy the 3rd dimension cause it's a lot of fun. You'll be taking all your memories back to the Absolute when you die so no worries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Jesus could be real and you go to Hell. But at least you weren't born in a manger.

       Recent lurker, but this entire Vegas thing really bothers me. I actually searched for this sub after it happened because nothing made sense to me. The attack in Niger is bothering me and finally, that whole kenneka jenkins story. I have to find things to do to not think about it, especially the jenkins girl. When I want info on something, I will search and read to no end, and it's not good for me. Your mind takes you places you don't want to see or believe.

        Successfully faking such events would be incredibly more difficult, costly and complex than simply hiring or tricking stooges into carrying them out IRL.

       I don't think you've thought through the risks involved for each case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The risks of screwing up a faked event are limited to someone talking about it. But who would they talk to and who would listen before they get taken aside and dealt with? Certainly not the media, who are absolutely complicit in spreading these lies. Financial incentives, agreements to reduce or quash criminal sentences, credible threats of violence against anyone who steps out of line... that's all it takes to control people.

        The number of people and logistics involved would be exponentially higher, from fake victims (and their families) to fake medical personnel cops, firefighters/paramedics and countles others who would have ti WILLINGLY play along.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The number of people who need to be directly in on the plan is probably much smaller than you think. But even if it's a large number of people, we are talking about the US government and its allies. They have unlimited resources and millions of people from military families in dozens of NATO countries to call upon. I bet most of the people taking part do it for their country, out of loyalty to their command. After all, nobody gets hurt so where is the harm?

       The inconvenient truth is there's no evidence for any shots being fired, let alone anyone being injured or killed by gunfire. I do mean no evidence too. No physical evidence of bullet holes in anyone or anything. There isn't even credible evidence for
       <em>
        blanks

       being fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have in place of what should be an abundance of physical evidence is a relatively small number of secondhand accounts from a handful of dubious individuals. In fact, if you do some deeer digging you'll see Las Vegas is just like every other one of these media phoney fake shows. They all rely on the gullibility of the masses and their trust in the media and in the word of complete strangers.

       In fact, there are just as many accounts from regular  people saying "that's not gunfire" as there are suspected actors loudly proclaiming otherwise. For some reason people prefer to believe the accounts that agree with the thrust of the main narrative, the key fact for which is that people were shot and killed, instead of all those credible eyewitnesses that say no shots were fired. And this is in spite of knowing that the media and the government (who are fundamentally the same group anyway) deceives us continuously and on purpose.

       As a contract, I agree, you need two parties and there has to be agreement and consideration.  But a Constitution or Declaration of Country and its independence is somewhat of a written framework for the rest of the laws and execution to  be organized around.  Of course it's not a real contract.

        One simulation theory I like to ponder is one where the AI is essentially our ego experiencing itself in a definable realm.

       something like this, yes.  if you were stuck in a void as an entity, and you wanted to learn about yourself you'd maybe copy yourself or parts of yourself and study them.  this process of splitting and reconfiguring is what energy does.  if we're all energy - well you can see where that leads.  so the question of how does that energy organize itself is indicative of the underlying design patterns at play, and one must only observe nature to see the overall pattern.   my theory is that we're in a fracally phi reality here - as this is what nature tends to show.

        Other than that, I think if this is a simulation, no one of this realm is aware of this. There may be entities (viruses, bugs, glitches) in this realm that are aware of the implementation of the simulation but I don't think they have much sway over the general scheme.

       no some people are aware.
