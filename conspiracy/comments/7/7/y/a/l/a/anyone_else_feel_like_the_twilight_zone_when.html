        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It feels like Im living on another planet.  The Chans and here people understand these specific issues.  But talk to your everyday citizen or average Joe, and mention Awan or Seth Rich, or even the Uranium One deal, no one knows a fucking thing about it.  The lamestream media hasn&#39;t even touched these issues.  We knew about the Uranium One deal before the election, a whole fucking year ago and it just now hit Hannity&#39;s show last week.  A fucking year.  And even now, its not front page news.  It disappeared.<br/>
Who in your normal life knows who the fuck the Awans are?  Or even Seth Rich.  Maybe they know he died, and that its a &quot;debunked&quot; conspiracy theory, but who among them would or could tell you how he died, where he was from, what his occupation was etc....  </p>

<p>I just dont fucking get it.  George Webb broke the Awan case, what, a year ago now?  And no one knows about it.  </p>

<p>How many people beyond us that dug through the Podesta and DNC files even know what the files contained?  The general population knows Wikileaks released emails, but that they were &quot;hacked&quot; or &quot;stolen&quot;, and were Russian influenced.  The contents we all poured over and continue to pour over, no one the fuck knows.  </p>

<p>Its like the Twilight Zone or something.  A year later, and no one knows anything if you talk to your neighbors or coworkers.  </p>

<p>Its Trump Russia 24.7 on the news since a year ago.</p>

<p>Talk to a normal person and say &quot;I dont think Trump colluded with Russia and he isn&#39;t a Russian spy and Mueller is on a witchhunt&quot;.  The person would look at you like you were insane.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For instance, if you want to pull someone into the LV shooting start with the simple comparison of the Campos pictures. Did this to my one friend Friday and with only knowing something didn&#39;t seem right he noticed instantly that it wasn&#39;t Campos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just my opinion...</p>

<p>The picture comparison does more to hurt the las Vegas investigation. There are plenty of other legitimate inconsistencies to focus on. Honestly I think it&#39;s the same person, why wouldn&#39;t it be? They could have picked anyone to be Campos due to lack of social media, why change actors between award ceremony and Ellen show?</p>

<p>The truth is still out on las Vegas tho...</p>

The moles people keep saying are missing could of simply had make-up applied over them for a television appearance.

    <div class="md"><p>Guaranteed, it does not.</p>

<p>The Dark Ages started off at the Crisis of the Third Century in Rome. There were plenty of &#39;good&#39; Emperors after that-- Aurelian, Diocletian, Constantine, etc., but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the Roman Empire was in long decline.</p>

<p>Why should that be the case? They had the organization, technology, and capital to continue their rise-- Why would that particular empire fall?</p>

<p>There are plenty of other good examples throughout history, Rome just happens to be culturally important and what I&#39;m more familiar with.</p>

<p>Science and logical thinking don&#39;t just pop up out of nowhere, they have to be clawed at, grasped for. The payoff for e.g. satellites didn&#39;t come for <em>decades</em> -- people did them at first just to see what they could be useful. Science is curious, probing, and a money-sink for a long long time. That&#39;s what needs to be nurtured.</p>

<p>Progress, most certainly, does not come naturally.</p>

<p>nobody is trustworthy. Bernie threw the election and single handedly created Trump as president. once he was out, there was no competition. </p>

<p>at this point progressive vs conservative is no longer the issue -- its insider vs outsider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But as I said in another thread, its been a year now.  It doesnt feel like people have been won over.  Weve been red pilled, those of us digging through each new Podesta release last year and all the events that transpired since then too helped.  But as I said, mention something as pivotal to us all as the Awans, something we&#39;ve known for half a year or more.  We know this case intimately.  But who outside of our scene (the chans and here) knows a thing about it.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve known about pizzagate for a year.  We know it existed and was and is real.  Yet, its just a debunked conspiracy theory to mainstream society...most people.   </p>

<p>At what point will this all come out.  At what point will all this information leak out about Seth Rich, pizzagate, Awans, all of it.  It feels like a strange lsd trip or something. The majority of people are not on the chans or on here.  Yet the majority has no idea about these conspiracies.  Not even that they dont believe in the conspiracies.  They fuckng have no idea who the Awans are, or who Seth Rich is beyond basic details.  I bet some people on here could quote whole Podesta emails by heart.  How many wikileaks emails do you think the average person, mainstream person read or has read?  My guess is zero.  </p>

<p>I dont understand the gaslighting.  Its not that the conspiracy theory is wrong.  The mainstream media hasn&#39;t said a fucking word about any of this stuff.  Awan, Seth Rich, Haiti, pizzagate.  It doesnt exist to the average person.</p>

<p>Ufo&#39;s are talked about openly for godsake. And on tv too.  ghosts are talked about.  on tv.  the loch ness monster is talked about in newspapers.</p>

<p>EVERYONE knows about bignfoot, lochness, Ufo&#39;s.  </p>

<p>Yet n0ne of these other conspiracies have made a dent in anything.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. It&#39;s frustrating how many people, smart people I know, on all sides of political scale, know nothing about anything that we talk about here! It is sad really.</p>

<p>The MSM still has a tight grip on the limited amount of time that working people have to listen/watch/read news. Maybe what 15-30 min a day?</p>

<p>And if you try explaining what you know, this changes their comfortable place of &quot;knowing&quot; what the nightly news or NYTimes told them is the truth.</p>

<p>It takes patience, but when you find someone who is willing to learn and listen. Start with easy ones like... Oh remember when they all told us there were WMD&#39;s in Iraq and just about everyone, both dem and repub bought that lie? Well we are natural sceptics and we look at things through that lens all the time.</p>

<p>Remember when they tried to convince us that Benghazi was caused by a video? It was a well planned terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11! And it wasn&#39;t supposed to ever be known what happened except the guys there lived to tell their story. </p>

<p>Amazing how we are constantly being bombarded with lies to help cover up &quot;their&quot; schemes.</p>

<p>But the easy ones you mentioned started off with WMD&#39;s.  The media and the left&#39;s embrace of Bush these last few days is precisely what Im referring to here.  Bush is a war criminal asshole who should be tried for war crimes.  He isn&#39;t a good guy, never was.  Yet, turn on the news, and he&#39;s a good guy because he&#39;s anti trump.  In what world is bombing innocent people a guy character trait?  The idea that they once called Bush literally hitler and now are saying he&#39;s a guy guy, all while calling Trump a nazi, is just so fucking bizaare.  In what world is Bush a good guy?  He sure wasnt a good guy to these people in the 2000&#39;s.  Now he&#39;s a moral authority because he calls trump a bigot?  Its so bizarre.  Its like some movie or something</p>

<p>Bush was only driven by his own hubris but he was the puppet of a coterie of sycophants acting under connivance. This is the same scenario with Trump, or any other recent presidents for that matter. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re falling into the narrative they want you to grasp ; you&#39;re seeing Trump as a paladin just like some felt the same for Obama. Those puppets will resort to any kind of vicious mendacity in order to gain more followers. Portraying themselves as &quot;outsiders&quot; or &quot;revolutionaries&quot; is part of the subterfuge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that ultimately it is a combination of things. </p>

<p>A) There is a very large segment of the population that is actively brainwashed by the mainstream media/ideas/culture, etc. These blue pills have a “what you see is what you get approach” to life. They will live their entire existence in ignorance and pass that ignorance down for generations. These are the people who are utterly clueless about the world we live in while keeping themselves distracted by various forms of entertainment, sports, shopping, vacations, etc. </p>

<p>B) People who know things are awry but choose to bury their heads in the sand. They still have no clue how deep the rabbit hole goes but don’t buy into the official narrative (9/11, Vegas, etc.). Their attitude is acknowledges that things aren’t exactly okay, but they say to themselves “fuck it, what am I going to do?”.  These types often seek distractions as well but not nearly as much as say Group A. Their concerns impact them, but not nearly enough to actually do substantial research or live their life in a completely different way. </p>

<p>C) <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and /pol (minus the racist bullshit). People alarmed enough to dig and dig because they seek truth in this truly corrupt world we reside in. Fully aware of the tremendous and calculated manipulation that encompasses our lives. The only recourse is to dig, discuss and distribute this information to others. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think (A) is worth much effort, because they are followers and will follow whatever the dominant paradigm. Either they lack the brainpower, courage or have been hypersocialized to virtue-signal their adherence to groupthink. Make no mistake some of these are various &quot;sides&quot; (Left and Right), though currently for whatever historical reason, groupthink appears more manfiested/vocal on the Left. Perhaps because the right was out of power (Pres., deep state, Hollywood, MSM) and got scrappier...</p>

<p>The battleground is stimulating the (B) group to action. The B group can be brought to action by their discomfort at lies being revealed -- that&#39;s where the C group excels. </p>

<p>Therefore, it&#39;s the C group tasked with populating idea-factories (research, reports, investigation, memes) to gently awaken the masses. </p>

We try to find out what it is rather than taking everything from mainstream media/scientists etc. Also, people here aren&#39;t afraid of bursting their bubble/reality whatever you call it and are open minded ready to listen and aren&#39;t afraid of the dark side of humanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not think it is possible to discuss such topics unless people have become curious on their own.  It is a slow process of going down the rabbit hole that cannot be done as a collective.  Sure a bunch of lile minded people can sit down and watch &quot;Loose Change&quot; together.. but EVERYONE is at a different level of awareness.
There is little point in hoping people will ask questions about things when they never query the answers.  I&#39;d recommend this School Of Life video on Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave as essential viewing and to take head when trying to &quot;wake people up&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason I&#39;m not still one of those people was pretty much due to chance - I got sick and had more time to browse online, and I happened to see with my own eyes the media lie about an event I experienced myself, in order to push a particular agenda, despite the fact they were sent all the footage and evidence telling them they were wrong. That was what made me realise that the media lies, even when they KNOW the truth, it&#39;s not just like they make mistakes, they either knowingly deceive or just so wholesale believe in what &#39;authorities&#39; say over and above what &#39;average citizens&#39; say, that they are essentially liars, biased and useless.</p>

<p>So I had the impetus to look into things for myself and fact check everything, and I also had the time. I fell into a deep depression finding out what I found out. I&#39;m glad I know, but I feel terrified when I see how many peopple, even intelligent well educated people who I know are decent and rational, will ignore this information and will react very very extremely to it, like shrieking and stuff. It&#39;s weird and scary, because people really do need to start realising what&#39;s going on or we will all suffer the consequences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media is the 4th branch of the government.  They truly are powerful.  They have the power to form and shape mass opinion regardless of facts.  This past year is a testament to that.  You repeat a lie enough, it will trick everyone in to believing it.   Freethinkers and skeptics are the exception. we either don&#39;t participate in MSM, take it with a grain of salt, or Participate in it, but form our own opinions.  Most humans in the country/world blindly digest what&#39;s on tv and take it as literal gospel without a second thought. It&#39;s social
Psychology.  If there&#39;s anything I&#39;ve learned in the last year is that the media is truly a powerful, opinion-swaying entity.  I like to debate with people, and time after  time,  what that&#39;s shown me, is that most of these people don&#39;t really understand what&#39;s truly going on. they&#39;ve heard what they&#39;ve heard, and repeat it blindly, without the ability to reciprocate useful, insightful diagooue on the matter.  It disintegrates into ad hominem, personal attacks, and patronizing, condescending remarks made to make you feel like a fool for questioning what&#39;s being forcefullt spoon fed to you. They read a headline, or hear a latest breaking news story, and anything in conjunction to that is invalid because it &quot;was on tv&quot; -therefore it&#39;s infallible.  The media is the 4th branch of the government.  The new age is upon us.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So often the conspiracies in here are binary - you&#39;re either a part of the global power elite, and privy to all of their secrets and dealings, or you&#39;re not.</p>

<p>I see the world as involving all sorts of conspiracies and power centers.  Trump seems to me like a mafia boss, someone who doesn&#39;t have the blessings of legitimate power like a Bush or a Kennedy would, but someone with his own strings to pull and secrets to hide.</p>

<p>I could very easily see how the powers in Washington, such as the Bush family&#39;s friends in the military and CIA, would oppose Trump in ways that they would not oppose a traditional Republican.  I could see how Trump might make a desperate deal with Russia to save his campaign.  I could also see how Russia could easily do all of that without Trump&#39;s involvement.</p>

<p>I share OP&#39;s disappointment that nobody, including pundits and party leaders, seems to have a coherent view of anything other than the week&#39;s tabloid headlines.  The fact that the Democrat&#39;s first articles of impeachment included the NFL kneeling scandal as part of Trump&#39;s high crimes and misdemeanors was profoundly disappointing to me.  Either the man is a danger to the country and Republicans and Democrats will have to work together to oppose him, or he isn&#39;t.  That document just seemed like yet another in a river of chum intended to increase partisan division, divide America, and pander for votes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the thoughts, good food for it.</p>

<p>One of my rabbit-hole-feelings has always been that Trump is a player and has done his good-little-boy part in using his persona, money and probably even hotels to further domestic action, foreign plots, or social engineering. We forget he had a bad TV show on a major mind-melting network all too often. But, he is at the very bottom of the power ladder, and it has eaten away at him as he&#39;s gotten older. He plateaued, so went for the politics game. It&#39;s not at at all outside of possibility that he has surveillance systems in his hotels that have caught any sort of salacious act by celebrities or officials and those are his cards. He strikes me as a lackey in every way, who lucked out on an inheritance and position in life, but wants more. If there is anything relative between he and the common person in America, its they feel unfulfilled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. I can see how he could not be part of the group, as I can picture him being part of it. I can also see why he&#39;d deal with Russia. I feel like it helps to understand whats going on if you put yourself in their shoes.</p>

<p>If I was born in Germany, I may of been a Nazi during WW2. If I was born in a racist family, I&#39;d probably be a racist. People can&#39;t comprehend these things and act like it would never happen to them.</p>

<p>I understand both sides, but I feel like Trump is a far better choice for America than HRC. Instead of the MSM attacking him on baseless shit, they should attack him for real political mistakes made or about to be made. If he&#39;s tax plan goes through it&#39;ll be great for the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can&#39;t see the Trump-Russia thing, you aren&#39;t credible as a thinking person to me. You are someone so caught up in your own biases that you let a con man play you. Take the fact that he is allowing the release of the CIA Kennedy stuff. I&#39;ve yet to see anyone on this sub question why he might do that. The answer is obvious to me. He&#39;s pandering to you, just like he did with Obama&#39;s birth certificate, vaccines, and other conspiracy theories. He doesn&#39;t believe that shit. But he knows that you do and if he throws you an occassional bone, you will just blindly follow along. And lots of you prove him right every day. There is no amount of evidence of connections that will make you say there is something odd going on with Trump and Russia. Maybe you believe there isn&#39;t sufficient evidence of collusion (despite an email basically stating it). Okay. But if you don&#39;t find the connections odd, you are hopelessly biased towards the guy. If you think he&#39;s competent or playing 6d chess or whatever, you are hopelessly biased. How hard is it to make a fucking condolence phone call and get basic shit right, like remembering the soldiers name and not being callous? How hard is it to condemn a white supremacist attack? How hard is it to pass legislation your party wants when you control everything?</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t everyone you are talking to. Its you. You have trouble thinking rationally and separating yourself from your biases. Its pretty simple.</p>

<p>Now let the downvotes rain!</p>

<p>the communism is a method by which to solidify control and eliminate competition by making the successful oligarchs into rulers of their respective market sector.</p>

<p>say communism happened here and Spectrum(tm) was given control of all media and communications... Spectrum would be happier than a pig in shit with no competition, able to set prices wherever they wanted and do as they pleased because they literally would BE the communications law agency, and the sole provider of service sanctioned by government.</p>

<p>they want communism because under communism they can ensure only their business interests are legal and allow them to self-regulate and prevent any competition in economics or politics.</p>

<p>it creates a stark divide of classes, where social mobility does not exist, and competition can never come except from within the existing party and economic agencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>soviet Russia...</p>

<p>the oligarchs were very capitalist among themselves, the government was just ruled by industry -- or more specifically, specific business interests (aka the oligarchs, who were really in charge of the party)</p>

<p>communism would never cause this -- but there never has been an example of real communism because its impossible in the current human state of existence with lack of true AI and complete automation of economy.</p>

<p>what always happens is a specific in-group takes the government, then divvies up &#39;public&#39; infrastructure among themselves to manage -- which turns them into defacto capitalist oligarchs. Rulers of a false republic representing only themselves (the economically powerful) and claiming that since they are the government that everything is publicly owned.</p>

<p>the communism we&#39;ve seen is much akin to handing the world over to the Wal-Mart board of directors and CEO. once they were the sole economic agency, competition, quality, etc would not matter.</p>

<p>the sole goal would become to increase margins and quality of life for themselves every quarter and foment revolution -- aka other people taking their stuff.</p>

<p>its fascism we&#39;ve been calling communism, fascism that uses far-left rhetoric and cultural application to persuade and pacify the masses rather than far-right rhetoric focusing on culture preservation.</p>

<p>which makes it more insidious, because without a cultural preservation standard, they literally wont give a f*** what happens to anyone but themselves -- and will make whatever changes are beneficial to them solidifying control and not society.</p>

<p>china is an example (especially before they semi-capitalized), Russia, and almost every other &#39;communist&#39; country.</p>

<p>none of them ever made it past the beginning stages because once industry is &#39;socialized&#39; it never leaves oligarch&#39;s hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>communism means the means of production are controlled by the people/workers through democratic government.</p>

<p>there has never been a communist country -- the only countries claiming to have been communist never actually supported the ideals of communism because it was not possible in reality.</p>

<p>you could say china is/was communist. but it was not -- as many workers suffered under laws they disagreed with that were not beneficial to them -- millions starved while the upperclass lived in luxury comparable or greater than the luxury of the west...</p>

<p>the only sort of communism I can even really believe ever existed was hunter-gatherer societies before recorded history.</p>

<p>there have been many movements which proclaim communism to the masses but never deliver their promises and instead centralize control under themselves.</p>

<p>even if democratic means are used in appearances, the elections are rigged and thus it is null and void of democracy or control by the workers themselves.</p>

<p>let me reframe the question for you though -- if I promised to be a free market capitalist, but instituted communist laws, would I be a free market capitalist? </p>

<p>the answer is no. talk is cheap and action is defining.</p>

<p>communism in history has always been a case of murder the powerful and tell the idiot peasants what they want to hear and implement policies that appear to work towards this but in reality do not. </p>

<p>once they are in power, any semblance of the original mission is deemed impossible and no further transition is made which would decentralize the wealth and power concentrations.</p>

<p>you can easily say they were communists, but i&#39;d argue to them the term communism was a means to an end and a total joke that had no real meaning.</p>

<p>If I say I&#39;m democratically elected but murder all my opponents it does not make me democratically elected...</p>

<p>the same can go for any ideology.</p>

<p>I can proclaim to be a Christian or catholic and never follow a word of the book or doctrine... but that does not make me one, even if I have a fancy degree and a high ranking position in the church</p>

<p>I am defending myself from saying it cannot exist because it has, in times long before recorded history when working together was the sole basis for survival and there was no money.</p>

<p>the modern examples of communism show intense cognitive dissonance and that a majority of their platform was lies/propaganda and excessively authoritarian, which Marxism actually wanted to stop -- the authoritarianism based on capital.</p>

<p>but such authoritarianism was only exacerbated because even if they were labeled &#39;the state&#39; private individuals controlled large swaths of public life as singular agencies under the party head.</p>

<p>How can you not see that globalist elites are receiving a backlash <em>precisely because of world-wide market reforms like free trade, the Eurozone, etc</em>. </p>

<p>Here are some scholarly papers that can let you know what&#39;s going on economically in the world. Its not communism or headed towards communism.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free-trade_agreements">Free trade agreements.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2939&amp;amp;context=key_workplace">NAFTA.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169721811024105">Effects of free trade on US labor markets.</a></p>

<p>And on and on. There are so many free trade agreements that are by their very nature more and more free market and less and less government interference. Please read some better sources. You will have to roll up your sleeves, but you will be much better informed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>under the way I define communism they well <em>could</em> be.</p>

<p>think about it, if total centralization of control over your trade benefits your industry and that&#39;s what your after, your absolutely no different to the commies.</p>

<p>free market is inherently characterized by intense competition, not monopolism. once you reach a state of monopolistic control over various industries, that becomes the same in practice as communism -- with the owners divvying up to others what they deem to be their worth, and no entry into competing with those agencies for anyone outside the power circle.</p>

<p>I never said they all are. but surely, at least a few see ways they could capitalize on the restrictions of communism as has been done in the past.</p>

<p>Multiple tens of thousands. And more importantly <em>its more than at any time in human history.</em> That&#39;s what free trade does.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Extreme poverty has fallen by a third in about 25 years because of free trade. We know this from research. For instance areas of china exposed to more free trade had the vast majority of the free trade gains.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>being interdependent globally does not mean entirely decentralized...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean it kinda does. Its certainly the way we&#39;ve gone about it. The evidence for decentralization is in the trade agreements themselves. Its in the data. You can see all of this by just reading more economic writings from mainstream economists. They demonstrate this stuff empirically. Its not just a story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, you try to make the point that people who don&#39;t believe the Trump Russia collision is a blind supporter of Trump (or so that&#39;s what I saw it as).  But is it possible to not believe the Trump Russia collusion... and wait for this... not be a Trump supporter? You paint a big brush across saying that biases play a role as to why people suck trump up, which I can agree, but you are also saying that people don&#39;t believe the Trump Russia collusion BECAUSE people believe the bullshit he says. Wrong. Trump and Russia never made sense and still doesn&#39;t, not because of biases but because of other factors that you clearly ignored. Although I disagree with the wording of your statement I believe it makes sense to extent. Trump is a puppet and you complaining about him not doing and doing stuff is part of the plan, because he knows you nor anyone else will do shit about it, Americans are lazy and weak; Trump and goons laugh at us everyday. </p>

<p>&quot;The problem isn&#39;t everyone you are talking to, it&#39;s you. You have trouble thinking rationally and separating yourself from your biases. It&#39;s pretty simple.&quot; </p>

<p>Pizzagate was one of the most pushed stories by Russian bots last year. Why is that?</p>

<p>Same thing with the &quot;His name was Seth Rich&quot; bullshit. Why do bots want to push these made up narratives so much?</p>

<p>Why did Russian bots push the Las Vegas false flag hashtags so hard the first week of Oct?</p>

<p>It&#39;s fascinating to see how many accounts that attempt to look like normal US citizens but really aren&#39;t. Check out the accounts using #MAGA (especially if it&#39;s in their profile).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually reading Podesta&#39;s emails is a great place to start. Pizzagate fucktards like to interpret his emails through a lens that has been presented to them to actively prevent critical thought. It&#39;s sad really. Most of them think they are smart having discovered some truth that most people haven&#39;t figure out yet, because they read a poorly laid out website that spoon feeds lies to them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like talking to creationists and flat earthers. They want so desperately for their narrative to be true that they ignore all evidence to the contrary. </p>

<p>I never said he was an honest man. Go ahead, find where I did.</p>

He thought it was ridiculous that I was even talking about it, dismissing it (and all other conspiracy theories) as Russian propaganda/fake news. Today I am trying to put together some opening points so I can ease him into the discussion next time we are together. I think Operation Northwoods is a must.
