        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/clit123.html">clit123</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We&#39;ve been waiting over a year.  </p>

<p>Trump ran on the explicit idea, and said it to Jeb Bush&#39;s face, that he&#39;d release the truth about 9/11.  </p>

<p>He said to Hillary&#39;s face he&#39;d appoint a special prosecutor, he&#39;d throw her in jail and he even talked about the Clinton Foundations actions in Haiti to her face.  He&#39;s done nothing about any of this.  </p>

<p>Sessions was chosen for AG and we thought, given what Trump said he&#39;d drain the swamp and arrest Hillary and go after pedophiles and the deep state.  He has done nothing about it.  In fact he recused himself from it. </p>

<p>Flynn, Sessions, bannon, Chafetz, and Gowdy, and others in the administration or close to the administration are open conspiracy theorists.  Many who tweeted about pizzagate and other Clinton crimes.  Trump is friends with Alex Jones, and Cernovich too I believe.  He is friends with Roger Stone.  He calls Hannity after every show.  Trump and his administration is a literal conspiracists dream because its stacked with people who know about all the issues: 9/11, Clinton, Haiti, pizzagate, Awans, Seth Rich, etc...  Yet none of them have done a single thing about these issues.  Some have fired or left.  Every time we put faith in these people they let us down.  Chaffetz is the perfect example.  Trump gave him power to investigate everything and anything.  He leaves.  </p>

<p>WL/Julian Assange: whatever happened on Oct 17 seems significant.  Hillary and her communications director tweeted out that WL was going to release a bombshell report that never happened in those last few days of the campaign.  Assange hinted at and never has released that bombshell.  We are all waiting for the smoking gun that proves pizzagate and Hllary collusion.  Or the Seth Rich smoking gun.  WL/Assange understandably aren&#39;t going to reveal their source.  But that source was almost certainly Seth Rich, and to topple this Trump Russia witch hunt and to imprison Hillary we have to know the truth about this.  WL/Assange refuse, are unable to release , or don&#39;t have proof of Pizzagate or Seth Rich or the Awans etc....  Assange I assume wants to clear his name.  Providing that proof of the Dems making up this Russia thing would be the proof.  He refuses to drop that KO.  Assange may be sitting on the smoking gun of all smoking guns.  The proof that Seth Rich was murdered and pizzagate is real, and that Hillary ordered Seth Rich killed and that they all made up the Russian bullshit as cover.  It would be the single most important story in US History.  If he has it, why is he sitting on it?   Why has he sat on it for a year or more?  </p>

<p>Although the lamesteam media has largely ignored these issues, those sympathetic to these issues or exposing them are unable to or unwilling or dont have the information at all.  Cernovich, Posobiec, Alex Jones, Hannity, etc... Hannity being very close to Assange almost certainly knows the truth.  He&#39;s actually spent time with Assange in person.  Yet he too does nothing.  We keep waiting for that bombshell release that proves the truth.  Nothing happens.  </p>

<p>We seem as far away from the truth on these matters as we were back then in 2016.  The media is silent.  We keep getting promises.  And no one is getting imprisoned.  </p>

<p>It makes no sense.  Im tired of waiting.  </p>

<p>We know they killed Seth Rich.  We know pizzagate is real.  We know the Russian Trump connection is a hoax witch hunt.  Im tired of waiting for justice in these cases.  Im tired of waiting for it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure. It could all be blue balls mind fuckery. It&#39;s definitely possible. A real sucker punch of hope offered and snatched away, again and again. </p>

<p>But....I don&#39;t think so. Yet. For one thing, I believe--as Meganon said--that some of this ISN&#39;T about justice, it&#39;s about revenge and mental (and maybe physical) torture. </p>

<p>What kind of mental agony do you think Hillary is going through, losing the election, becoming even more and more despised (despite her vocal brainwashed 20% or whatever). </p>

<p>What about DWS? She doesn&#39;t keep her shit together on camera nearly as well as the Clintons. We&#39;ve seen her rattled. You know she&#39;s under profound stress.</p>

<p>And what about the American people? Do you think they&#39;re REALLY ready for &quot;exposure&quot; of a political pedophile ring (actually, I think they just might be). For a massive takedown of the deeply corrupt DNC? </p>

<p>This may all be a slow drip-drip-drip of torture for the criminals, and ring-ring-ring wakeup call for the masses, who are less and less somnambulant by the day.</p>

<p><strong><em>OR</em></strong>and I&#39;d like to emphasize this, maybe it&#39;s all being timed to blow right before the November 2018 or 2020 elections. The ultimate &quot;October Surprise&quot; that leads Trump to his second term. </p>

<p>Like everything--fucking EVERYTHING--nowadays, I can see both sides of what&#39;s going on. Maybe this is some long strategic mental warfare game where the killing blow is still a year or more off. </p>

<p>So you might be right. This might all be the biggest bait&#39;n&#39;switch blueballs bullshit ever. Or it might be a slow burn that takes a long time to become bonfire. </p>

Republicans had years to investigate HRC. With Chaffetz gone the investigations of Hillary in any real sense are dead. Now the only people looking are reporters and how far are they going to get vs HRC? She&#39;s survived year and year and years of them. Now you have open civil war in the party and the man attack dogs like brietbart being turn on follow R&#39;s. You think HRC has skeletons and corruption wait tell we get a roy moore caucus.

Take your North Korea like love and dedication for the current administration and go shill your brainwashed agenda elsewhere. You&#39;re nothing more than a product of propaganda and brainwashing by the Republican Party. It&#39;s disgusting that you think Trump is somehow different and not some regular bullshitting politician that is only out for himself and the ones that bought him.
