       We've been waiting over a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump ran on the explicit idea, and said it to Jeb Bush's face, that he'd release the truth about 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said to Hillary's face he'd appoint a special prosecutor, he'd throw her in jail and he even talked about the Clinton Foundations actions in Haiti to her face.  He's done nothing about any of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions was chosen for AG and we thought, given what Trump said he'd drain the swamp and arrest Hillary and go after pedophiles and the deep state.  He has done nothing about it.  In fact he recused himself from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flynn, Sessions, bannon, Chafetz, and Gowdy, and others in the administration or close to the administration are open conspiracy theorists.  Many who tweeted about pizzagate and other Clinton crimes.  Trump is friends with Alex Jones, and Cernovich too I believe.  He is friends with Roger Stone.  He calls Hannity after every show.  Trump and his administration is a literal conspiracists dream because its stacked with people who know about all the issues: 9/11, Clinton, Haiti, pizzagate, Awans, Seth Rich, etc...  Yet none of them have done a single thing about these issues.  Some have fired or left.  Every time we put faith in these people they let us down.  Chaffetz is the perfect example.  Trump gave him power to investigate everything and anything.  He leaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       WL/Julian Assange: whatever happened on Oct 17 seems significant.  Hillary and her communications director tweeted out that WL was going to release a bombshell report that never happened in those last few days of the campaign.  Assange hinted at and never has released that bombshell.  We are all waiting for the smoking gun that proves pizzagate and Hllary collusion.  Or the Seth Rich smoking gun.  WL/Assange understandably aren't going to reveal their source.  But that source was almost certainly Seth Rich, and to topple this Trump Russia witch hunt and to imprison Hillary we have to know the truth about this.  WL/Assange refuse, are unable to release , or don't have proof of Pizzagate or Seth Rich or the Awans etc....  Assange I assume wants to clear his name.  Providing that proof of the Dems making up this Russia thing would be the proof.  He refuses to drop that KO.  Assange may be sitting on the smoking gun of all smoking guns.  The proof that Seth Rich was murdered and pizzagate is real, and that Hillary ordered Seth Rich killed and that they all made up the Russian bullshit as cover.  It would be the single most important story in US History.  If he has it, why is he sitting on it?   Why has he sat on it for a year or more?
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the lamesteam media has largely ignored these issues, those sympathetic to these issues or exposing them are unable to or unwilling or dont have the information at all.  Cernovich, Posobiec, Alex Jones, Hannity, etc... Hannity being very close to Assange almost certainly knows the truth.  He's actually spent time with Assange in person.  Yet he too does nothing.  We keep waiting for that bombshell release that proves the truth.  Nothing happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       We seem as far away from the truth on these matters as we were back then in 2016.  The media is silent.  We keep getting promises.  And no one is getting imprisoned.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes no sense.  Im tired of waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know they killed Seth Rich.  We know pizzagate is real.  We know the Russian Trump connection is a hoax witch hunt.  Im tired of waiting for justice in these cases.  Im tired of waiting for it.

       Julian Assange is a  complete fraud, a gatekeeper. He is the master of all gatekeepers. First for the liberals, and then for the conservatives, and loves to use divide and conquer tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is also a complete fraud, and uses his masterful persuasion techniques to gain blind support as long as he's alive.

       I don't think Assange is a gatekeeper, but I do fear he was eliminated last October, at the height of his organizations interference and power in the US elections, when he was dropping the Podesta emails. Thing's haven't been right with him or WL since his internet got cut and we went dark for those two months...

       People who know how to spell and punctuate correctly might be a little more intimating. Your posts are riddled with errors of both.

       I read your stuff to give you a fair shake, and now I realize you don't deserve one. Fear has nothing to do with it, nor "getting through to me." You're the odd one out here; I'm just alerting others. "You" actually have very little to do with this, other than to call out your cancerous presence.

       Can't attack the message so attack something small and insignificant. While you rally people for group think. There's a lot more people here who share my ideology then you think. You can block me. I'm good with it. I'll still be here. You won't silence me. I understand though you want to make sure no one here's ideas different from yours but again maybe you should go to one of the places where the limit what people talk about since that is EXACTLY what you are trying to do. How many other people here are you going to call to be blocked with out even challenging their ideas? Your whole I disagree with this person so they must be silenced creates a damn good ECHO chamber doesn't it.

       Not sure. It could all be blue balls mind fuckery. It's definitely possible. A real sucker punch of hope offered and snatched away, again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
       But....I don't think so. Yet. For one thing, I believe--as Meganon said--that some of this ISN'T about justice, it's about revenge and mental (and maybe physical) torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of mental agony do you think Hillary is going through, losing the election, becoming even more and more despised (despite her vocal brainwashed 20% or whatever).
      </p>
      <p>
       What about DWS? She doesn't keep her shit together on camera nearly as well as the Clintons. We've seen her rattled. You know she's under profound stress.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about the American people? Do you think they're REALLY ready for "exposure" of a political pedophile ring (actually, I think they just might be). For a massive takedown of the deeply corrupt DNC?
      </p>
      <p>
       This may all be a slow drip-drip-drip of torture for the criminals, and ring-ring-ring wakeup call for the masses, who are less and less somnambulant by the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         OR
        </em>
       </strong>
       and I'd like to emphasize this, maybe it's all being timed to blow right before the November 2018 or 2020 elections. The ultimate "October Surprise" that leads Trump to his second term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like everything--fucking EVERYTHING--nowadays, I can see both sides of what's going on. Maybe this is some long strategic mental warfare game where the killing blow is still a year or more off.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you might be right. This might all be the biggest bait'n'switch blueballs bullshit ever. Or it might be a slow burn that takes a long time to become bonfire.

       If the trumpets had something they would of used it by now. Trumps throwing everything he can to distract from the russia investigation. Republicans had years to investigate HRC. With Chaffetz gone the investigations of Hillary in any real sense are dead. Now the only people looking are reporters and how far are they going to get vs HRC? She's survived year and year and years of them. Now you have open civil war in the party and the man attack dogs like brietbart being turn on follow R's. You think HRC has skeletons and corruption wait tell we get a roy moore caucus. Day 1 trump got in office he said he wasn't going to jail Hillary.

       You guys are funny.  I used to actually worry a little, wondering whether your lies were having an affect on people.  But it's pretty clear that America is starting to wake up, at least a little, which is a start.  If anyone is reading this, and has the picture of HRC signing books in Costco, next to a bunch of toilet paper, with the morbidly obese woman in front of her, please post it for u/omnitalented_artist (more like onedimensional_hack)

       You seem to be pretty defensive for someone who thinks our message isn't working. Look at trumps number just among his "base". That shits getting smaller and smaller every day as trump trips over his own feet and keeps the chaos up. Moderate voters dont want to focus on your identity politics and racism. Going to be a blue wave.

       Is there not Civil War in the Democratic Party? Did you see Tom Perez's latest cowardly/totalitarian move to expel all non-Neocon establishment types from leadership positions? They're already gearing up for another rigged primary where the hand-picked DNC candidate repels young voters and Trump skates to a second term.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Russia thing, it was concocted in the 24-48 hours after Clinton lost. You talk about nothing on Clinton, they've been pounding the Russia story for over a year now and that's been an even bigger nothing--at least the FBI report found Clinton and the State Dept. completely irresponsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't give a shit about Roy Moore. Or most any politician. I'm just waiting for them to go down. I do not think you have a deep grasp of all that's happened in the past two year, much less before that.

       Assange touts the official MSM 9/11 narrative, remember that. He's most likely a CIA asset and a limited hangout. At the end of the day, he hasn't leaked anything that has taken a single person down. Podesta? Hillary? Nope. Nothing.

       Wikileaks leaks just enough info to get the whistleblowers to keep blowing the whistle, which allows the CIA to find out who to assassinate.

       lmfao is this a serious post? You’re telling me people actually believe and think this shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me guess, you spend a lot of time on /pol/ and this was your first election? Your familiarity with Trump goes back to early-childhood fond memories of a rich man on a tv show?

       Yes, conspiracy. So all you government lovers need to GTFO. Take your North Korea like love and dedication for the current administration and go shill your brainwashed agenda elsewhere. You're nothing more than a product of propaganda and brainwashing by the Republican Party. It's disgusting that you think Trump is somehow different and not some regular bullshitting politician that is only out for himself and the ones that bought him. It's so so sad the amount of people who have become such tools for the government, spewing bullshit day and night in defense of dear leader.

       your putting your faith in the very people who are abusing us. its all controlled my friend.  EVERYTHING.
all the presidents don't even have any real power,anyway  its all a facade, an illusion to distract us so they can go ahead with the agenda quietly behind the curtain.

       i would recommenced you read the protocols of the elders of zion.  many people say its fake, but thoses who have actually read it can see that its exactly what is going on.

       I don't think the agenda is behind the curtain anymore. Trump got elected and that shit is like oz now. Lobbiest in every position. The exact worst person in each sec. spot. Devos, Ross, Munchin. Can it get anymore deep state corrupt elite then that? trump tried to but carl Icahn in. Trumps at best the real elites puppet.

       if he is, why is everyone we hate against him?  No one supports him.  Dems, Republicans, the media, wall street, the war machine.  Everyone I hate is against him.  Why?  If he was the real elites puppet he'd be cheered on.  Who else is cheering him on besides conspiracy theorists like us?

       Chuck grassley, is as establishment as the come and hes running interference on the intel commuity hard core. Jeff Sessions is as corrupt as the come start up refusing to answer questions to protect his master. The koch brothers the mercers, the devos. 3 of the biggest elite families on the planet. You either are a baby conspiracy theorist and are only scratching the service or just don't know who holds the money in this country. Money and power = elite deep state. koch, devos, prince, kushner, mercer, brietbart, All trump donors. All the deep state elite. Can you point to any deeper then prince and devos?

       The single biggest problem I have with this sub is people's willingness to claim they
