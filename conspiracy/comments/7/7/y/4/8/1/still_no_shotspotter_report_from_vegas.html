        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m having trouble digging up info on whether or not Vegas has a Shotspotter system in place.</p>

<p>Shotspotter is an acoustic gun-shot detection system that triangulates gunfire in urban areas. According to a search I ran a week or so ago, several articles from 2016 stated Shotspotter is deployed in 90 cities across the U.S. According to an article from Gawker from the week following the shooting Shotspotter is deployed in 89 cities but no one is returning calls to Gawker. As already mentioned, I looked into it briefly a week or so ago but I just checked again tonight quickly and the results don&#39;t look like they have changed, but now I can&#39;t find any articles saying 90 cities from the same search terms. Here is a quote from Shotspotter&#39;s own website:</p>

<p><a href="https://ir.shotspotter.com/press-releases/detail/111/shotspotter-announces-expansion-to-seven-new-u-s-cities">https://ir.shotspotter.com/press-releases/detail/111/shotspotter-announces-expansion-to-seven-new-u-s-cities</a></p>

<p>&quot;joining the more than 90 jurisdictions that already rely on ShotSpotter to ensure a fast, accurate response to gunfire incidents.&quot;</p>

<p>Interesting to note the following misleading quotes highlighted in the cnbc article which is the first search result from Google when entering &quot;Las Vegas Shotspotter,&quot; (copy/paste):</p>

<p>&quot;AMP · Oct 10, 2017 · ShotSpotter Incident Review Center in Newark, California where they verify ... &quot;In the case of Las Vegas, if we had been there — either indoors or within a ...&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the full article:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/10/10/gunfire-detection-systems-see-renewed-interest-after-las-vegas-tragedy.html">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/10/10/gunfire-detection-systems-see-renewed-interest-after-las-vegas-tragedy.html</a></p>

<p>Here the full quote from the article putting into context that it&#39;s in reference to another technology, not Shotspotter:</p>

<p>&quot;In the case of Las Vegas, if we had been there — either indoors or within a range of being able to pick it up outdoors — we would have picked up that glass breaking,&quot; said Sally Fernandez, president of Safety Dynamics, an Arizona-based company known for its SENTRI system. &quot;And we would have picked up the first shots.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the Squaker article (curb your criticism, they&#39;re the only ones asking):</p>

<p><a href="https://squawker.org/analysis/shotspotter-used-in-las-vegas-detects-gunfire-location-in-30-seconds-so-why-did-police-take-75-minutes-to-stop-stephen-paddock/">https://squawker.org/analysis/shotspotter-used-in-las-vegas-detects-gunfire-location-in-30-seconds-so-why-did-police-take-75-minutes-to-stop-stephen-paddock/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting article:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/story/14326546/1/shotspotter-stock-up.html">https://www.thestreet.com/story/14326546/1/shotspotter-stock-up.html</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s another interesting article:</p>

<p><a href="https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2017/apr/20/gunfire-sensors-credited-with-swift-arrest-in-dead/">https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2017/apr/20/gunfire-sensors-credited-with-swift-arrest-in-dead/</a></p>

<p>I can&#39;t find a comprehensive list of the 89 or 90 cities currently employing the Shottspotter tech. A few of the articles mention some of the cities, the article from The Street I linked earlier states:</p>

<p>&quot;At mid-year 2017, ShotSpotter&#39;s systems covered 480 square miles in 90 U.S. cities and municipalities, wit New York City and the Puerto Rico Housing Administration representing its largest contracts. On Sept. 19, the company announced new deployments in Cincinnati, OH; Jacksonville, FL; Louisville, KY; Syracuse, NY and St. Louis County, MO., and others. Meanwhile, Miami officials voted to triple its deployment of ShotSpotter last Thursday and Chicago police announced they would expand use of the technology on Friday.&quot;</p>

<p>None of the articles that I checked list Las Vegas. I did a lot of skimming and have a lot of distractions outside the Cyber, so forgive any errors I may have made. If I have made a mistake it&#39;s an honest one.</p>

<p>Another interesting note, I ran several searches in r/conspiracy for the term &quot;Shotspotter&quot; a week or so ago and got nada. I just ran the same search and got 2 results from 19 days ago:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=Shotspotter">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=Shotspotter</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s my post from 3 days ago regarding all this in which I mention having run 2 searches:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/773i0r/comment/doj5r3f">/r/conspiracy/comments/773i0r/comment/doj5r3f</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s my post from 6 days ago and my first attempt to bring it up. I searched r/conspiracy for &quot;Shotspotter&quot; after posting the following comment and got zilch:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/76gste/comment/doe6kch">/r/conspiracy/comments/76gste/comment/doe6kch</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to have as much time to monitor this post as I would have liked, but I thought this topic was worthy, so have at it, but please don&#39;t take it personal if I&#39;m not as attentive as I should have been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;What would this system do if say this was a planned event and not some madman shooting.&quot;</p>

<p>No idea, I&#39;m an amateur and too often distracted away from researching this to call myself any sort of expert. If it hadn&#39;t been published in so many places already I&#39;d be hesitant to bring it up for fear of giving the bad guys clues, but a bad guy will research this stuff more than I ever would so, my guess is the shooter probably knew about Shotspotter tech and hoped the concert would be a distraction.</p>

<p>&quot;And if vegas does have it, why would they hide it?&quot;</p>

<p>Hopefully genuine security concerns. Maybe to hide something nefarious. Although my first guess would be concerns over liability in terms of  public safety and maybe in terms of accounting for tax dollars spent on a system that was may have been easily distracted by a concert and firecrackers. The response time to the shooter was quick, not sure if it was quick to the casino or quick to triangulate his precise location. I don&#39;t know what kind of track record this tech has, but if I remember correctly it&#39;s filtered down from battlefield tech out of Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

<p>&quot;Just some thoughts. I like your post.&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It did seem to over hype the technology and would fit with the “we need more security” false flag scenario. But it seems that rabbit trail went nowhere. I still have no idea what to think other than the official story is BS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of Vegas hotel rooms have no balconies and heavy duty type windows that are hard to break and lots won&#39;t even open at all. Supposedly this is to prevent suicide from people who lost to much gambling. No idea the validity, could be an old wives tale.</p>
