<p>How did he get to his room, magic? His existence there implies he parked (valet), entered the hotel, and went to his room. What will a video do to change that and what will the video add to your ideas/theories?</p>

<p>I mean, they say he murdered 58 people, that&#39;s a bit worse than stealing. Some guy was stealing Amazon packages all over my neighborhood and even after he&#39;s caught the video of him is still in all the news articles. Why? They caught him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He made millions over a long period playing 14 hour days at a game that only returns 98-99% of your money if you play perfectly..</p>

<p>In case anyone struggles with math that means he isn&#39;t even getting a 1% return from the machines but is claiming he is making millions from them per year. $5 million in 1 year</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that&#39;s stealing.</p>

<p>Really because you don&#39;t even have actual evidence he was profitable as a gambler, you are picking one number from one news report that wasn&#39;t even a full tax return.  How about holding you&#39;re own burden of proof up to the standard  you expect from the msm and police, fbi etc.</p>

All i can do is prove that part of the story is wrong, it&#39;s not up to me to then prove where he got his money from, just because i can&#39;t prove where he got his money from doesn&#39;t mean gambling for long periods at 98-99% return rates is somehow magically profitable all of a sudden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the &quot;american casino guide&quot; 
Video poker is a game of skill, as well as luck, and there is no guarantee that you will come out ahead. On average, you should get a royal flush about once every 40,000 hands. The royal flush makes up about 2% of the total payback percentage on a machine. Therefore, if you don&#39;t get a royal you will be losing about 2% of the money you put through a machine. I play a lot of video poker because it&#39;s usually the best game to play in any casino. Last year I got 14 royal flushes. This year I have not hit one yet. So, even though the game is being played close to perfectly (we all make some mistakes) luck is still a factor as to whether or not you come out as a winner.  However, the longer you play the game, the more likely it is that the return on the machine will approximate the expected payback percentage for that particular game.﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least some of what you&#39;re saying is false. In video poker, you &quot;hold&quot; some cards after the deal, and the redeal is truly random -- your outcome is not predetermined when the deal starts. (Unless your friend programs poker-themed slots, which are a different thing.) Video poker does have optimal strategies depending on pay tables. Good players can find machines that give them a very slight house edge.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a silly thing to argue about anyway -- Paddock made his money in real estate and probably lost more than he won at casinos. But video poker is a legitimately beatable game. Don&#39;t take my word for it, you can research this online.</p>

I mean, he wasn&#39;t obsessed with it. But, in the end he lost about 40% of what he put in (several thousand). However he was comped every time... toward the end I think it got to his head a little bit. I had to remind him he didn&#39;t &quot;win&quot; anything with the rooms, food, etc.. This is exactly what his brother, media, etc. are trying to feed us. That he only lost 2% every time but the difference was made up by the comps. Bullshit. </p>
