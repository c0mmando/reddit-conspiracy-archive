It was night and room lights were off. That gun should&#39;ve lit up like a Christmas tree.</p>

<p>Did he use a flash suppressor? If so wouldn&#39;t the flash still be visible to some extent?</p>

<p>Did he close the curtains? If so why were the curtains intact the next morning? And wouldn&#39;t the flash still be visible through the swiss cheese curtains?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an HD video with a clear view of room 32135 (assuming that&#39;s the room the shooter mainly shot from b/c it has a much better vantage point. Glare is hiding the other room). It baffles me there&#39;s no visible muzzle flash...</p>

<p>Just media reports. No real funerals or anything like that. Some of the initial &quot;injury&quot; reports, if you read them, were laughable. For example, some asst fire chief from CA apparently &quot;sat in the ER for hours, and decided to pack-up, leave the Luxor and <em>drive back to California</em> instead of receiving <em>any</em> legit treatment in Nevada. Every story arrives at dead-ends like this. Have YOU looked into any of them? Please proving links to any stories that don&#39;t involve dry-eyed acting from people paid to do so. Again, please provide links to support your basis that this was real. Thx.</p>

<p>Explain all the deaths and injuries </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What deaths or injuries? All I&#39;ve seen is bad acting and mannequins filmed by a strange guy failing to do CPR on a single person.</p>

<p>If a newspaper prints a photo of someone wearing a bandage lying in a hospital bed that proves <strong>absolutely nothing</strong>, and if it&#39;s enough to convince you then you deserve to be fooled.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think the injured were actors who then went to fake hospitals with actor doctors? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think almost all the injuries were fake, with the possible exception of a twisted ankle here and there from the rush to leave.</p>

<p>There is no footage of any doctors treating anyone. A man in a hospital doctor&#39;s coat isn&#39;t necessarily a doctor, I presume you have seen medical tv shows before.</p>

<p>If you think shots were fired, present evidence. Show a single piece of footage that shows beyond doubt an actual round hitting anyone or anything. Show some of the bullet holes caused by these rounds, in people, in the grounds, anywhere in the area...</p>

<p>You can&#39;t and you won&#39;t because <em>no shots were fired</em> and it was <em>a staged event</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great question. Ultimately anything can be faked on TV, injuries can be made to look real, photoshop does an amazing job etc.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s ever possible to prove someone died via secondary evidence. If you consider the possibility that government officials and media would be directly involved then we can&#39;t trust any form of government documentation, such as birth and death certificates. It can all be faked. Perhaps if a particular individual had a clear history extending back many years, and no shady reasons for being involved voluntarily (criminal charges, media or government connections etc) I might be more inclined to believe it.</p>

<p>I would also expect to see normal grieving from relatives and friends of the alleged deceased, and please, don&#39;t tell me &quot;people grieve in different ways&quot; because nobody grieves the way these characters do it for the cameras.</p>

<p>I would expect most relatives and friends unwilling to even be interviewed while mourning. For the very few who might consent to interviews I&#39;d expect to see crying with real tears, people unable to speak, breaking down altogether, shattered beyond words. Instead we get the most cartoonishly stoic and upbeat characters eulogising their fallen friend or relative while harbouring no ill will whatsoever towards the assailant. It&#39;s beyond absurd.</p>

<p>How about those claiming injuries? What would be more convincing than the evidence we have seen so far? How about:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple clear video angles corroborating a particular claim, e.g. someone who claims to have been shot caught on camera by at least two and preferably more angles.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s relatively easy to fake a moment in time once. It&#39;s much harder to keep everything consistent from multiple angles -- check out the &quot;continuity errors&quot; on imdb&#39;s goofs  section to see what I mean.</p>

<p>A real event will always be consistent from every angle, because it really happened.</p>

<ul>
<li>convincing wounds, pain, recovery and recovery time, scars, ongoing disabilities caused by the wound, bullet fragments recovered from the wound.</li>
</ul>

<p>A real bullet wound leaves a scar for life. If it&#39;s fake, that person needs to maintain the lie for the rest of their life. Norman Cassiano (Orlando Pulse Nighclub shooting &#39;victim&#39;) has no scars from his claimed shooting injuries. We know this for a fact because he was too vain and too stupid to keep his scar-free shirtless body hidden from his idiotic Facebook followers. </p>

<p>A real wound leaves a scar that doesn&#39;t need to be hidden, is consistent with the claimed injury, and can be produced on demand at any time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The next step in verifying your claim is to prove the link between these two people and your friend. Then you&#39;d need to prove the link between your friend and you.</p>

<p>Not sure how you&#39;d go about doing that without doxxing yourself or your friend in the process, but if you can think of a way to pr be it that you&#39;re comfortable with putting on a public website then I&#39;m keen to see the whole chain.</p>

<p>Of course, if you can&#39;t do that or are not willing to do that, then unfortunately we will be in exactly the same state, unable to verify the claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that sounds like a tall order. Especially being 3 degrees of separation. I know people that say they know/are related to these people, but aside from Facebook screenshots (which I assume is insufficient) I can&#39;t think of a way.

    <div class="md"><p>There were no actual ballistics. Even the real showing people by the stage and what they are saying proves this.

Real injuries and deaths to 500+ random people at a vegas concert would result in an overwhelming amount of deposition and lawsuits in real life.

<p>Explain all the deaths and injuries </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What deaths or injuries? All I&#39;ve seen is bad acting and mannequins filmed by a strange guy failing to do CPR on a single person.</p>

<p>If a newspaper prints a photo of someone wearing a bandage lying in a hospital bed that proves <strong>absolutely nothing</strong>, and if it&#39;s enough to convince you then you deserve to be fooled.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think the injured were actors who then went to fake hospitals with actor doctors? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think almost all the injuries were fake, with the possible exception of a twisted ankle here and there from the rush to leave.</p>

<p>There is no footage of any doctors treating anyone. A man in a hospital doctor&#39;s coat isn&#39;t necessarily a doctor, I presume you have seen medical tv shows before.</p>

<p>If you think shots were fired, present evidence. Show a single piece of footage that shows beyond doubt an actual round hitting anyone or anything. Show some of the bullet holes caused by these rounds, in people, in the grounds, anywhere in the area...</p>

<p>You can&#39;t and you won&#39;t because <em>no shots were fired</em> and it was <em>a staged event</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great question. Ultimately anything can be faked on TV, injuries can be made to look real, photoshop does an amazing job etc.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s ever possible to prove someone died via secondary evidence. If you consider the possibility that government officials and media would be directly involved then we can&#39;t trust any form of government documentation, such as birth and death certificates. It can all be faked. Perhaps if a particular individual had a clear history extending back many years, and no shady reasons for being involved voluntarily (criminal charges, media or government connections etc) I might be more inclined to believe it.</p>

<p>I would also expect to see normal grieving from relatives and friends of the alleged deceased, and please, don&#39;t tell me &quot;people grieve in different ways&quot; because nobody grieves the way these characters do it for the cameras.</p>

<p>I would expect most relatives and friends unwilling to even be interviewed while mourning. For the very few who might consent to interviews I&#39;d expect to see crying with real tears, people unable to speak, breaking down altogether, shattered beyond words. Instead we get the most cartoonishly stoic and upbeat characters eulogising their fallen friend or relative while harbouring no ill will whatsoever towards the assailant. It&#39;s beyond absurd.</p>

<p>How about those claiming injuries? What would be more convincing than the evidence we have seen so far? How about:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple clear video angles corroborating a particular claim, e.g. someone who claims to have been shot caught on camera by at least two and preferably more angles.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s relatively easy to fake a moment in time once. It&#39;s much harder to keep everything consistent from multiple angles -- check out the &quot;continuity errors&quot; on imdb&#39;s goofs  section to see what I mean.</p>

<p>A real event will always be consistent from every angle, because it really happened.</p>

<ul>
<li>convincing wounds, pain, recovery and recovery time, scars, ongoing disabilities caused by the wound, bullet fragments recovered from the wound.</li>
</ul>

<p>A real bullet wound leaves a scar for life. If it&#39;s fake, that person needs to maintain the lie for the rest of their life. Norman Cassiano (Orlando Pulse Nighclub shooting &#39;victim&#39;) has no scars from his claimed shooting injuries. We know this for a fact because he was too vain and too stupid to keep his scar-free shirtless body hidden from his idiotic Facebook followers. </p>

<p>A real wound leaves a scar that doesn&#39;t need to be hidden, is consistent with the claimed injury, and can be produced on demand at any time.</p>
