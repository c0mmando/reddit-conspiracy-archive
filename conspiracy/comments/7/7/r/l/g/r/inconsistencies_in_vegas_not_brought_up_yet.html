       The leaked pictures show Paddock dead in room 135 the Below video shows that window was not broken well into the shooting.

      <p>
       Also, if Paddock had cameras and the wire from the food cart was running through 135, if he was shooting from 134 at the time of that picture, why did the cable run to 135? He couldn't have seen the monitor. He was in a different room.

      <p>
       That cable is going to 135, the shooting took place from 134 per that window being broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock died in 135, the window in 135 wasn't broken when he died.

       I don't really buy that, why did he have 1000 if rounds in mags? If it was an arms deal would he pre load the mags? You think ISIS is buying bump stock AR15s? If they were 23? Where they doing a pilot run to try them?

       So a mafia in America has to go to Vegas to get 23 guns? Anyone could buy those.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was a cartel.... They are going to pay someone, fly them to the United States to buy 23 guns worth 8 grand?
      </p>
      <p>
       So the cia is monitoring a cartel so dumb the have to spend 5k to send someone to America flight and hotel   and pick the most surveillance city in the United States to buy 7 grand worth of guns??
      </p>
      <p>
       An organization big enough to be labeled a cartel should have no issue obtaining 23 guns.....

       They are only telling you what they want you to know. Can you tell the difference between full autos and semi autos by obscure pictures? If so, tell me. We also have no pictures of the weapons supposedly in the car. I should also note, machining semis into full autos is quite easy if you have the right tools. Talk about profit. Semis cost about 1,200. If you machine it, it would cost you 3,000. Give or take. Black market full autos will cost you around 8-10k at least. On the normal market it'll cost around 15-20k. Think about it.

       Problem with the gun deal idea. The guns were left behind. Also, cartel doesn't need his guns. Neither does the mob or Isis. Any of them already has better or can get better with no hassle. Then you also have the angle of how did a gun deal turn into mass murder.

       And then on top of that, the deal went bad and a random unplanned mass shooting happened... no... arms deal has to be the dumbest theory on this whole event. Basically no money involved and the attack didn’t just happen randomly.

       Is a las vegas strip hotel 32 floors up a good place for an arms deal?
      </p>
      <p>
       No its a very unsafe and bad place to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No reason that anyone would do it there if they were actually trying to buy and sell a lot of guns.

       Well you don't have a criminal mind. That is the best place to do it in my opinion. No cameras in the hallways. A regular. A high roller. Casino knows all about you and hell they may be in on it as well. This is Vegas. It's run by the mafia and CIA. Sometimes hiding in plain sight is the best camouflage.

       You watch too much tv if you think its a better plan to use a 32 floor hotel in a highly secure area of a highly secure section of the city.  Even if you want to believe that its a run and owned by the cia/mafia hotel its still full of the public who isnt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a start of a list of better places:
      </p>
      <p>
       A motel off the strip.  Less people, and cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       The desert.  Even less then that.

       yeah... first problem i had with this theory about it being a gun deal gone run (unless said "gun deal" was an elaborate "sting-operation" where-in the FBI/another alphabet agency found someone they wanted to lock down, sent feelers, got response, set-up meet, the guy being set-up got wise and flipped the script on them) was why do it in a hotel... I mean common LV is surrounded by thousands of miles of desert... ya know what deserted means... NOONES THERE TO WITNESS YOU ATTEMPTING TO BUY/SELL drugs, guns, children, etc.

       Paddock was shooting from 134, yet saw Campos on a camera in 135, walked over to 135, shot Campos, and walked back to 134?
      </p>
      <p>
       When was Campos shot? Before the shooting? How was Paddock looking at the cctv in 135 when shooting out of 134? He saw Campos on a 19 inch laptop 50 feet away?? It wasn't smokey?

       Look we have all the information they are going to release if any of this was real more details would be coming out. How much you want to bet if a real event like this took place there would be evidence everywhere the instant it was happening. Not just a few leaked videos, there would have been a massive surge of people trying to contact loved ones, people live streaming as they are waiting for the commotion to die down. This is how society operates now, if you see something you film it. Look at all the minor commotions on youtube? From small fights to large brawls, weapons being used, people being shot all of that you can find on youtube. But with the worst shooting in recorded history this is the amount of evidence we are given and to accept as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything presented all evidence presented all follow up evidence presented is a fabrication. All the inconsistency planned. Though I think they were caught off guard on how fast we cracked their official narrative, they already had a counter narrative in play. To try and snag the "thinkers" and have them play devil's advocate without even being paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bravo, bravo what a wonderful show. I'm disgusted that the individuals involved would sell out our country. I'm equally appalled by own stupidity for being suckered in yet again.

       America's government is based on checks and balances.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alphabet groups have no checks and no balances. They can do what ever they want.

      <p>
       That's the real problem.

       Won't see me arguing about that, I'd say there is more to the problems than just abc agencies, the fact that congress is in dereliction of duty adds on to it. We further compound the problem with unknowns amount of pay to play, kick backs to elected officials. The problem with budget spending and how most departments are threatened with shorter budgets if they don't use up all the money they recieved for the previous fiscal year. So massive waste spending needs to be curtailed. There is no limit to our issues that we call government.

       They feed you a bunch of wild goose chase conundrums to distract you from a very simple operation.  There was no Paddock, there was no Jesus.  It was a staged FEMA drill with staged photos inside the Mandalay room.

       I thought the camera wires from the food cart were running through 134. Where did you see wires running from the hallway into 135?

       In the photo of the front door of 135 where the gun is on the floor, you can see a wire going through the picture that looks like a USB cable.
