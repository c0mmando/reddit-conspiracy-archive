<p>Oh and the fact that there were two people in the room and meals ordered for two. Who was the second shooter. Two windows were shot out and fired from and two different calibers used. Sure one person could do that, but given the time, audio evidence, and paddocks physical condition aftrr his injury, it certainly seems like people would be interested in the guest in his room.</p>

<p>Could it be that something didn&#39;t go according to plans?

The IRS and FBI don&#39;t have a clue how this guy got 5 million and don&#39;t tell me video poker! Why is Campos being interviewed by Ellen with &quot;Schuck the handler&quot;?! The &quot;help me brother&quot; video was enough for me to believe this was a real event and people did die that night, so why did this happen? Is Paddock just the fall man? Are they covering up that someone else did it to prevent war? I&#39;ve also wondered if this could be tied to Weinstein in any way? Someone somewhere needs to get the American people the truth!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, I still think this was a arms deal gone wrong. Paddock worked for the FBI/CIA and was selling weapons to some terriorist group as part of a sting. If the Government is involved it would be easy to fake it and say that all the guns were easily obtainable semi automatics in Paddocks name.</p>

<p>Have we seen a list of weapons yet or are all 23 weapons accounted for? </p>

<p>Thats why he set up cameras, they were going to arrest these guys in the middle of the sale.</p>

<p>Something spooked them (probably Campos) and they killed Paddock, shot at the crowd and fled down the stairwell and became just another scared victim.</p>

<p>They&#39;d want to cover it up, imagin the hysteria that a gun sting gone wrong resulting in the deaths of hundreds AND they never caught the shooters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this was one of my first thoughts also and seems very plausible. That would explain why he had the money. It would also explain why they&#39;re trying to make him the fall man. I doubt the real shooters escaped though, my guess would be they all died in that room that night including Paddock. And maybe Campos and Schuck were both agents working with Paddock on the deal and when it all went wrong Campos tried to intervene and got shot? That would explain why he was up there instead of the &quot;door alarm&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going off of your theory, if Campos is a real person who had no involvement until he discovered the scene, then i can see it being that the fbi/Cia spooked him really good into keeping his mouth shut. The Ellen &quot;interview&quot; showed that he could be scared shitless</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be my thoughts. Wrong place wrong time. Some amature (maybe illegal immigrant? I haven&#39;t looked into that though) gets sent up for an unrelated call and ends up in the middle of an arms deal. First reaction is be the hero, gun fire breaks out. </p>

<p>CIA/FBI get to him right away and threaten him, he&#39;s the main liability. They could kill him off but his name was leaked to early. The whole thing didn&#39;t go according to plan and they&#39;re cleaning up one hell of a mess. </p>

<p>Maybe that break and enter at Paddocks home was to place paperwork for those guns.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t tell the public they were selling guns to terrorists. Sting or not. Imagin the chaous that would cause if the whole country knew we had large orginized terriorist cells already inside our boarders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! At least show us security footage from the Mandalay Bay! They really expect us to believe this BS?  These fuckers can see someone peaking at another guy&#39;s cards through a fucking security camera but can&#39;t show us a single video of homeboy bringing multiple assault rifles in to a motherfucking hotel room? There&#39;s not one video of him carrying large duffle bags, etc.? I&#39;m pretty sure the city of Las Vegas has more fucking surveillance cameras than the goddamn White House. This shit makes no sense. STOP LYING TO US!</p>
