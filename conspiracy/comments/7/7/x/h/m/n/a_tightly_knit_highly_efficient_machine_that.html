       No, he's talking about communism and the Soviets subversive tactics internationally.  Read the full speech, it's obvious. The rest goes on to ask the press to not voluntarily not report on issues that may impact national security.

       I think that's the cover for what he said. Obviously there is that about the Soviets too.

       But why say this part which I think is clearly leveled at the US intelligence community...

       Are you suggesting dissent wasn't silenced in the USSR? Or that the USSR was conservative in it's military/intelligence spending? I get that these things sort of, at least the latter one, apply to the US, but think of the context of the times.  It makes way more sense that he was talking about the country that they were in the cold war with.

       Uh, sure but why make such a big fucking deal about it at a reporter's dinner at the Waldorf? He was killed shortly thereafter right?

       Also, he deliberately does NOT say that he's talking about the soviets in my quoted text.  He is talking about the deep state.

       All the behind the scene's groups... they tend to blend together at the top. Deep state, Secret societies (masons, Bilderburger, Bohemian Grove, ect , ect) Religious leaders, Top bankers, Secret wealthy families (people so rich they do not show up on lists like Forbes) , and much more i'm sure.

       Great reply. There's no easy answer to OP's question. The agents of the USSR shared the same "principles" as the US war complex (at the time and still today). OP and everyone reading this who hasn't listened to the entire press conference (The President and The Press) should do so and draw their own conclusions about whom he was speaking. And even if Kennedy was referring solely to the USSR, as some people believe, OP should keep in mind that the basic ideals of communism/socialism stem from the mystery religion(s)/secret societies, the same religions and societies into which many of the significant players of Kennedy's murder are/were indoctrinated. Kennedy knew that the secret societies we are so opposed to are as much Communism as they are Free Masonry, and fundamentally Luciferianism. The US intelligence agencies had their Soviet counterparts. Those elite bankers are all in on it too. They worship and sacrifice to ancient Gods. Who knows what exactly Kennedy had in mind, but we know he was right or at least on the right path.

       me too. They heard that and panicked.  Why would a sitting president come out and make a point to call out pretty much by name the CIA, Military, Mafia, Press/Media, and business leaders who all were conspiring to use the cold war to their advantage ... meaning $$$.
