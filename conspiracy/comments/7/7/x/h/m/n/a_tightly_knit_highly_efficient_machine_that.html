    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s the cover for what he said. Obviously there is that about the Soviets too.</p>

<p>But why say this part which I think is clearly leveled at the US intelligence community...</p>

<p>&quot;Its preparations are <strong>concealed, not published</strong>. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its <strong>dissenters are silenced</strong>, not praised. <strong>No expenditure is questioned</strong>, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.&quot;</p>

<p>This is all referring to US elements, not Soviet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you suggesting dissent wasn&#39;t silenced in the USSR? Or that the USSR was conservative in it&#39;s military/intelligence spending? I get that these things sort of, at least the latter one, apply to the US, but think of the context of the times.  It makes way more sense that he was talking about the country that they were in the cold war with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, sure but why make such a big fucking deal about it at a reporter&#39;s dinner at the Waldorf? He was killed shortly thereafter right?</p>

<p>Also, he deliberately does NOT say that he&#39;s talking about the soviets in my quoted text.  He is talking about the deep state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great reply. There&#39;s no easy answer to OP&#39;s question. The agents of the USSR shared the same &quot;principles&quot; as the US war complex (at the time and still today). OP and everyone reading this who hasn&#39;t listened to the entire press conference (The President and The Press) should do so and draw their own conclusions about whom he was speaking. And even if Kennedy was referring solely to the USSR, as some people believe, OP should keep in mind that the basic ideals of communism/socialism stem from the mystery religion(s)/secret societies, the same religions and societies into which many of the significant players of Kennedy&#39;s murder are/were indoctrinated. Kennedy knew that the secret societies we are so opposed to are as much Communism as they are Free Masonry, and fundamentally Luciferianism. The US intelligence agencies had their Soviet counterparts. Those elite bankers are all in on it too. They worship and sacrifice to ancient Gods. Who knows what exactly Kennedy had in mind, but we know he was right or at least on the right path. </p>

<p>(a) By adding at the end of paragraph 1 thereof the following subparagraph (j):</p>

<p>&quot;(j) The authority vested in the President by paragraph (b) of section 43 of the Act of May 12, 1933, as amended (31 U.S.C. 821 (b)), to issue silver certificates against any silver bullion, silver, or standard silver dollars in the Treasury not then held for redemption of any outstanding silver certificates, to prescribe the denominations of such silver certificates, and to coin standard silver dollars and subsidiary silver currency for their redemption,&quot; and</p>

<p>(b) By revoking subparagraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 thereof.</p>

<p>SEC. 2. The amendment made by this Order shall not affect any act done, or any right accruing or accrued or any suit or proceeding had or commenced in any civil or criminal cause prior to the date of this Order but all such liabilities shall continue and may be enforced as if said amendments had not been made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>me too. They heard that and panicked.  Why would a sitting president come out and make a point to call out pretty much by name the CIA, Military, Mafia, Press/Media, and business leaders who all were conspiring to use the cold war to their advantage ... meaning $$$.</p>
