       Cold as ice. Though those who paid attention during the primaries and afterwards know there was fuckery afoot. Assange practically admitted Seth was the leaker. DC Police refuse to release body cam footage they claimed initially they didn't have...he was at a party that night but all attempts to find a list of its attendees have run into a wall. They have sealed it up quite well. But anyone who looks at the circumstantial evidence will know that this man was murdered because he knew too much and tried to speak out.

       There is no proof the Israeli military trained Mossad mole working in the dnc was murdered.  There were a lot of rumors and action-packed narratives like fbi leaving guns in cars (lol).

       I've never heard any of your narrative before. Any links on the Seth Rich Mossad narrative? I believe he wasn't a mole but a Wikileaks leaker who was murdered for his heroic actions.

       No I did not read that report. I'm not saying it's wrong, but the idea of high school friends claiming he used to wear a colored bandanna to honor a country seems ridiculous to me.

        In high school, he wore a blue bandana from Israel Holocaust Museum from 2006 summer trip. His father Joel trusted the trip’s sponsors (even though only 60 miles south of war)  because there is always some conflict going on in Israel, so many people were used to fighting and threats

       I do see some plausibility in the theory that Seth Rich was murdered for cause. I doubt that we'll ever see much in the way of resolution.

       I saw some odd internet revelations about the case, but many of them were speculative. Together with the lack of transparency from law enforcement and MSM's near absence of coverage or follow-up makes me suspicious.

       One thing I am certain of, at these higher echelons of political and business dealings, it is serious hardball and sometimes people get ruined or hurt. This is the case throughout history.

       This Seth Rich case has some of the earmarks of that.

      <p>
       There exist only three answers to the question, "Was Seth Rich murdered as a result of having leaked sensitive DNC information to others?"
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Yes
      </p>
      <p>
       2) No
      </p>
      <p>
       3) It is unknown at this time.

       I cannot get beyond #3.

       Seth Rich will count among the assassinated and ignored like Michael Hastings and Gary Webb.  There was never an honest investigation to begin with and don't expect any follow up by the media.
