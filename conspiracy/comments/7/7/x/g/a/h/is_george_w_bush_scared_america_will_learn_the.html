<p>Clintons are lower on the food chain (maybe literally?), my guess is they&#39;re actually punching above their weight to have gotten as far as they have. Figuring both Hillary and Bill have taken a lot of abuse...I always wondered about Trump and that &quot;She got schlonged&quot; line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No? Why would any of them fear us knowing the truth? It&#39;s not like we will do anything about it. We already know tons of fucked up shit we do nothing about it.</p>

<p>Jews still control our government. The Patriot Act still exists. We contend with the Federal Reserve. We cope with monsanto and water poisoning. The Utah Data Center is operational. Civil Asset Forfeiture is still a thing.</p>

<p>But people are more concerned about being black or having a pussy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth that he was nothing  but a puppet. The way I am taking your statement is that you feel it was an inside job/ false flag. To do something like that you have to have more influence then just the president. That takes some deep state type of shit. </p>

<p>A lot of these things that are happening that are not just random chance and seem weird. Would take deep state type of influence. These scenario would be events that would shape cultures. Have influence over all people not just the ones they directly affect. Yes that is a possibility. God I hope not. </p>

<p>That would mean that some one is trying to shape how I live my life cause they think I am doing it wrong.  I like where I am at in this world. I am not a piece of shit. I care for my neighbors. I try and help those who need it just like the majority of the population around me. So why the fuck people want to change me. Has the world around me gone to shit while the years passed. Does my son even stand a chance growing old and having a kid of his own? </p>

<p>Sorry for the story just mind fucked myself. </p>

<p>This happens often, to tell the truth people are often given special plea bargins, or let off entirely if it leads to far greater justices and beneficial ideas, symbiotic relationship.</p>

<p>There is a good chance that if they go down, they&#39;ll try to take us all down with them.  Would it be worth 200 million lives to try to end 4,000 people?  </p>
