       The media and scientific community calls people "Climate Change Deniers" for a specific reason. To discredit them. To make them seem like nuts.
       <br/>
       They say "Look at those idiots who can't even see that the avg trend of temperature for the past 100 years!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       What's ironic is that the "Deniers" are the ones demanding scientific evidence.  Yes, the ones who are asking for evidence are the crazies here.   WTF?  Do you even know what people who question climate change are saying?  If not, this is what they believe:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Very, very few, if any, skeptics think that actual temperature is not rising. It certainly is. This fact is simply verified by looking at temperature records. There is no doubt, temperature is rising.  However, the rate of increase, as predicted by the best scientists of the 90's, was WAY off.  By their calculation, we should be having an average temperature 2 to 3 degrees higher than what we have now.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The percentage of temperature increase attributable to man-made carbon emissions is inconclusive. It could be 10%, it could be 80%. We just don't know for sure because there are too many variables to consider.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No one is sure if spending trillions of dollars to cut emissions will have a measurable effect. They tell you that it will. But there is no way to quantify this. Again, too many variables. Remember, the Earth and the Sun goes through cycles.  As much as we want to prevent it, sometimes, it happens.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They portray global warming as a catastrophic event that will end all life on earth. It isn't. More CO2 means more vegetation. Which in turn, uses up CO2. Higher temp means more evaporation from the oceans which in turn means more rain. Deserts and wastelands that gets very little water now will become viable. Higher temperature coupled with more CO2 means plants will grow larger and faster, solving the ever growing food shortage problem.  True, there will be much negative consequences, like floods, and heat waves, hurricanes, and so on. But to say that this will end civilization is plain stupid. We will adapt. Just like we always have thru ice ages and droughts.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If you watch to mainstream media, you will never hear these arguments.  You only hear how bad global warming is.  AND! DID YOU NOTICE HOW THEY DON'T USE THE PHRASE "GLOBAL WARMING" ANYMORE?" Why the fuck would they do that?  Yeah, oh.... because,... global warming isn't happening.

       Say there's a 10% chance the worst predictions are right, and we're heading towards catastrophe.  Roll the dice?  How much are you willing to gamble on your conclusion that almost every expert on this topic -- literally all of whom have spent more time and effort working on this than you -- is wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Human societies have met with catastrophe many times.  One thing each of those events has in common is a whole lot of people completely confident that everything would be fine.

       I don’t doubt, nor question climate change. I believe that is just part of Earths natural cycle. What I call BS on is the so called man made global warming. I do not believe scientific,  and weather records have been kept, and studied long enough to prove/disprove man made global warming. Why is it not just Earths natural cycle taking place?

       So what natural (non-anthropogenic) physical mechanism is causing the warming we observe over the past century? If this is truly a natural cycle, then there needs to be some mechanism that can account for the warming. Without such a mechanism, and without demonstrating that it can account for the warming, this is just a baseless assertion. I’m all for questioning mainstream views, but unless we actually have evidence, I’m not going to just believe something like this.

       But we can measure the Sun’s temperature and activity to high precision. The Sun hasn’t been getting significantly hotter over the last century. We also know that the Sun doesn’t get hotter and cooler over timescales of centuries based on what we know about stellar structure and evolution.

       There's a lot of scientific evidence out there that you're clearly not interested in engaging with.  Seriously, you're saying "its too complicated, there's too many variables to know," then using the absolutely least complicated, single variable analysis to disprove some strawperson you conjured up, and you think that's definitive?

       He just stated correctly that the predictions from 15 years ago were far off compared to what really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very easy to verify. And it does put serious doubts on the theory (obviously), but also on the honesty of the researchers who either overestimated their understanding of what is happening, or dramatized their predictions to get more attention and funding..

       That's not true though, the best predictions from around 2000 are not far off from the observed record.  Keep in mind too that the independent variable in these calculations (the amount of carbon emissions, rather than their effect) is uncertain and has to be predicted as well.  The reason a lot of the inaccurate predictions were wrong was that they described what could happen if we emitted more than we actually did.  The 2000 onwards time period is when some countries/corporations/consumers started taking the issue seriously, so its not some gotcha for the actual emissions 2000-2017 to have differed from what a reasonable expectation would have been in the year 2000.

       Let's get the facts straight:
The atmospheric CO2 levels from 2000 to 2015 rose from 365ppm to over 400 ppm. I.e. we have a catastrophic increase by over 10 percent. This also agrees with the projections in the studies from 2000 (or what numbers did they expect?)
      </p>
      <p>
       It is really really hard to fit the models that were used in the studies in 2000 (where CO2 is the key variable which explains the rise in temperature from 1900 to 2000) to the observations from 2000 to 2015..

       It is shocking to see, how the "man-made CO2 climate change" theory turned into a religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, mainstream media (as well as most leading politicians) completely fail to see the self purpose of dramatized predictions by climate researchers: it is obviously more beneficial for the funding of your research if you predict that earth is moving towards catastrophic warming, instead of saying "hmm.. temperature rose for the last 150 years, as well as CO2.. but there are also these recent ice age temperature drops that we cannot really explain, so we do not really know"..

       Whenever there's a "discussion" about the scientific aspects of AGW the AGW-militant gets all flustered and accuses the skeptic of buying into the "conspiracy theory" aimed at discrediting it. Cramming all opposition into one camp has been a wide-spread method which, by itself, has turned many people into AGW defenders if only to avoid the stigma.

       I've been around a long time.  The only aspect of weather which has changed is the reporting of it.  Back in the day, weather was simply weather.  These days, it's 'news' ... and lying 'news' at that
      </p>
      <p>
       Weather reports now claim it will be 'sizzling' tomorrow or next week.  They predict the temp. will be 40 degrees Celsius.  People get up and go to work. On the train, they say to each other they're dreading the heat.  They talk themselves into believing it
      </p>
      <p>
       That night, the lying 'news' claims it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       40 degrees
      </p>
      <p>
       No it wasn't.  Look at your home thermometer.  It was 26 degrees
      </p>
      <p>
       It happens day on day, month after month .. lying weather reports
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the climate experts are reported by the lying media as claiming this or that month was the 'hottest since records began' .... all based on the daily lying weather forecasts
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all BS.  Oldies like me know it.  We've lived through fire, floods, very high and very low temperatures, hurricanes, cyclones, freaky weather, droughts, etc.  The weather today is no different, although I believe (and contemporaries agree) that on the whole, it's cooler today, and there are less (not more) catastrophic weather events
      </p>
      <p>
       Then look at the rich.  They are still buying mansions right on the water's edge.  They are heads of governments.  So what do you think ... would they sink their money into supposedly 'rising seas' if they actually believed in climate change?  Would they risk their own and their families' lives like that?  So there you are.  The rich and powerful do not believe a word of climate-change or rising sea levels.  But they want you to believe it

       Higher temperatures also means more water vapor will be retained in the atmosphere and

       Exactly what I expected.  I have 2 degrees in physics and getting a PhD in astrophysics.  I know more than you, so shut the hell up.  Right?  And just because Roy Spencer has some past with the BIG EVIL OIL COMPANIES, anything he says must be lies, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, how does a degree in physics make you the defacto expert in Climate Change?  Do you think an ecosystem is just about physics?  What of plant life and animal life that would react to climate change?  Does physics explain ecological systems and how it would affect climate change?  Why do you think a controlled lab environment, the epitome of a controlled variable situation, necessarily predicts what happens in the real world, the epitome of an uncontrolled variable environment?  Even if you could reduce the earth's complex climate to a thermodynamic equation, what degree do you have that proves how the changes will affect the future?  What degree do you have that says no new variable will come in to play?  Do you have a degree in economics that can prove that the benefits of countering global warming is far greater than the economic impact?  Well, here, I think I have the advantage.  Because I happen to have a degree in economics.  And by my account, all the money being poured down the climate change sinkhole is by far the greatest waste of resources we have seen in the past century.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're reading the data and papers, and you place such faith in them, then why have all the predictions for the past 15 years been so wrong?  Maybe it's perhaps because Climate Change involves so many different variable that it can not be effectively predicted?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, how much are we spending to study and counter climate change per year?

       We spend exorbitant amount of money on a problem that we are not 100% sure will mean the destruction of earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But consider this.  How much do we spend on countering a 100% guaranteed end of the world event like an asteroid hitting the Earth?  I don't know, but off-hand, I'll say probably less than 1% of the money that goes in to climate change.  You still don't think this isn't political?

       The thing is, the scientific facts all line up against AGW. All that AGW has had going for it has been speculations and prognostications that have all turned out to be wrong. Take the effort to discredit and deny the fact of natural cycles for example. Every person in fields related to climate accepted such cycles prior to the AGW scare. But those cycles were inconvenient so the new breed of specialist climate scientists took the stance that such were unproven. They then set out to prove that cycles are a myth. That effort failed of course, so now the apologists are trying to claim that the Mann-stick and Mann's paper did not deny cycles. Worse, they're now trying to tell us that the new breed of climate scientists are the ones who identified cycles just recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The total amount of contradictory crap being shoveled on the public seems to be why AGW is fading as an issue. Liberal politicians throw around the AGW scare during elections but do nothing in the same way that Conservatives throw around tax-cuts and then do nothing. Both of those need to toss a bone to the voter base but neither has any interest in following through. Regardless of how often they fail, there will continue to be a segment of the population so invested in AGW that it will continue to be an issue long after the facts prove otherwise.
