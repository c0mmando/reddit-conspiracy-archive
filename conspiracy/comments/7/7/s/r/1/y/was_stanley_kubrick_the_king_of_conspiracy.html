       Stanley Kubrick (July 26, 1928 â€“ March 7, 1999)
      </p>
      <p>
       2001: A space Odyssey - This movie depicts monolith on the moon.  It turns out, monoliths in our solar system is real, but at the time of the movie, there's no way he could have known  :

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A Clockwork Orange - Story of mind control experiments and mass perception manipulation.  This story is not only relevant because of MK Ultra, but we now see first hand how the media is being manipulated by those in power  :
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Eyes Wide Shut - This movie depicts a cult that worships sex and sex slaves, and we all know what's happening in Hollywood right now  :
       <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/stevens/ct-life-stevens-tuesday-r-kelly-0718-story.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And, of course, we all know Kubrick died on the release of Eyes Wide Shut from a "heart attack" /s.
      </p>
      <p>
       What did he know?  Was he an insider?  Was he an Illuminati?  How can 3 of his movies predict/explain so precisely what was to come or what was happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.  Please don't bash me for linking wikipedia.  The information on those pages is not critical to my questions and are there only to provide general overview for those who may be unfamiliar with MK Ultra.

       I think he knew something, perhaps participated. Possibly a Freemason, if that matters- 2001: A space odyssey was steeped in mystery school symbolism. Eyes Wide Shut had a lot of it too.

       Monarch is a mountain with a ski area on Hwy 50 in Colorado, smack in the middle of the monarch butterfly migratory path from Mexico north. While I can't say they aren't connected because anything is possible, I can say that the ski area got it's name that way, and that the film was shot in Estes Park, Colorado.

       You're generalizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet you a lot of us believe that they
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       land on the moon, but some things were definitely hidden from us. Look in to recent announcements about "water" and "caves". They've probably known about that stuff for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for "climate change", it's definitely a scam. The climate changes from moment to moment, so the term is purposely innocuous. Human impact is minimal. Changes in solar activity have much more influence.

       People like the one you replied to have the most difficult time understanding that this sub doesn't have a consensus and that we encourage independent thoughts and ideas. I think that is the root cause of the vitriol from anti-conspiracy theorists. The thought of thinking for themselves and coming to conclusions that aren't supported by all the sheep absolutely terrifies them.

       OK let me amplify what the poster above just said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        this sub doesn't have a consensus and that we encourage independent thoughts and ideas.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So that means you will encounter just about every possible combination of agreement and disagreement on any given conspiracy subject, including whether it exists, who is behind it, how important it is, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I want to ask something - you say "I like that y'all..." setting up two groups: yours on one side, and "y'all" - meaning, I suppose, all conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       On your side, does everyone believe the same thing? Does everyone on your side believe in Global Warming? Does everyone on your side think secret societies like the one in Eyes Wide Shut do not exist? Are you a part of one big group that has the same opinions on everything about the world? Just wondering...

       And if you knew anything about Kubrick's films, you'd know he deviated from the source material quite a bit. That he used books and short stories simply as a shell to tell HIS story. And that Arthur C Clark wrote 2001 alongside Kubrick while the film was being made. But no, you just want to come in this sub and insult people so you can feel better about yourself.

       It's relevant in that OP is saying he believes these NASA photos that show a monolith on a moon around Mars. People believe that but not NASA when they try to study the climate.

       The only way that would be relevant is if, because NASA provides valid information in one situation, NASA could not then provide invalid information in any other situation. That's absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       btw, I am extremely skeptical about photos of other planets that purport to show traces of civilization, such as this obelisk. I'll believe it when we have an astro-archeology team on the spot - like that the scene in Space Odyssey.

       While unrelated to my original post, let me say something about that climate change you mentioned.  The media and scientific community calls people "Climate Change Deniers" for a specific reason.  To discredit them.  To make them seem like nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very, very few, if any, skeptics think that actual temperature is not rising.  It is.  This fact is simply verified by looking at temperature records.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they do argue against is the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The forecast for the rate of increase in temperature since this became a concern is and has been WAY wrong.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        The percentage of temperature increase attributable to man-made carbon emissions is inconclusive.  It could be 10%, it could be 80%.  We just don't know for sure because there are too many variables to consider.
       </li>
       <li>
        No one is sure if spending trillions of dollars to cut emissions will have a measurable effect.  They tell you that it will.  But there is no way to quantify this.  Again, too many variables.
       </li>
       <li>
        They portray global warming as a catastrophic event that will end all life on earth.  It isn't.  More CO2 means more vegetation.  Which in turn, uses up CO2.  Higher temp means more evaporation from the oceans which in turn means more rain.  Deserts and wastelands that gets very little water now will become viable.  Higher temperature coupled with more CO2 means plants will grow larger and faster, solving the ever growing food shortage problem.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       True, there will be much negative consequences, like floods, and heat waves, hurricanes, and so on.  But to say that this will end civilization is plain stupid.  We will adapt.  Just like we always have thru ice ages and droughts.

       He predicted a monolith on earth's moon, and on Jupiter's moon Europa, and we have an outcropping on one of Mars' moons.  He showed a bunch of rich people having orgies in masks,  and R Kelly had sex slaves.  How is that precise?  He and Burgess didn't predict media manipulation, they observed it like many others have over the last century.

       It's rumored he filmed the moon landing because the actual moon landing crew ran into ET's etc and couldn't release that footage. I think he knew too much and ultimately payed the price

       Maybe. The doctor's daughter getting abducted in the end by the rich people's goons (or secret society) is basically a pizzagate reference. Not that the braindead public does anything with the knowledge, but referencing it broke a code I would assume.
