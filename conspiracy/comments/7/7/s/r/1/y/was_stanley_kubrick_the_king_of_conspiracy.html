<p>2001: A space Odyssey - This movie depicts monolith on the moon.  It turns out, monoliths in our solar system is real, but at the time of the movie, there&#39;s no way he could have known  : <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160923-there-is-a-huge-monolith-on-phobos-one-of-marss-moons">http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160923-there-is-a-huge-monolith-on-phobos-one-of-marss-moons</a></p>

<p>A Clockwork Orange - Story of mind control experiments and mass perception manipulation.

<p>Eyes Wide Shut - This movie depicts a cult that worships sex and sex slaves, and we all know what&#39;s happening in Hollywood right now  :  <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/stevens/ct-life-stevens-tuesday-r-kelly-0718-story.html">http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/stevens/ct-life-stevens-tuesday-r-kelly-0718-story.html</a></p>

<p>And, of course, we all know Kubrick died on the release of Eyes Wide Shut from a &quot;heart attack&quot; /s.   </p>

<p>What did he know?  Was he an insider?  Was he an Illuminati?  How can 3 of his movies predict/explain so precisely what was to come or what was happening?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re generalizing.</p>

<p>I bet you a lot of us believe that they <em>did</em> land on the moon, but some things were definitely hidden from us. Look in to recent announcements about &quot;water&quot; and &quot;caves&quot;. They&#39;ve probably known about that stuff for decades.</p>

<p>As for &quot;climate change&quot;, it&#39;s definitely a scam. The climate changes from moment to moment, so the term is purposely innocuous. Human impact is minimal. Changes in solar activity have much more influence. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So that means you will encounter just about every possible combination of agreement and disagreement on any given conspiracy subject, including whether it exists, who is behind it, how important it is, etc.</p>

<p>But I want to ask something - you say &quot;I like that y&#39;all...&quot; setting up two groups: yours on one side, and &quot;y&#39;all&quot; - meaning, I suppose, all conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>On your side, does everyone believe the same thing? Does everyone on your side believe in Global Warming? Does everyone on your side think secret societies like the one in Eyes Wide Shut do not exist? Are you a part of one big group that has the same opinions on everything about the world? Just wondering... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way that would be relevant is if, because NASA provides valid information in one situation, NASA could not then provide invalid information in any other situation. That&#39;s absurd. </p>

<p>btw, I am extremely skeptical about photos of other planets that purport to show traces of civilization, such as this obelisk. I&#39;ll believe it when we have an astro-archeology team on the spot - like that the scene in Space Odyssey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While unrelated to my original post, let me say something about that climate change you mentioned.  The media and scientific community calls people &quot;Climate Change Deniers&quot; for a specific reason.  To discredit them.  To make them seem like nuts.</p>

<p>Very, very few, if any, skeptics think that actual temperature is not rising.  It is.  This fact is simply verified by looking at temperature records.  </p>

<p>What they do argue against is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li> The forecast for the rate of increase in temperature since this became a concern is and has been WAY wrong.<br/></li>
<li> The percentage of temperature increase attributable to man-made carbon emissions is inconclusive.  It could be 10%, it could be 80%.  We just don&#39;t know for sure because there are too many variables to consider.</li>
<li> No one is sure if spending trillions of dollars to cut emissions will have a measurable effect.  They tell you that it will.  But there is no way to quantify this.  Again, too many variables.</li>
<li> They portray global warming as a catastrophic event that will end all life on earth.  It isn&#39;t.  More CO2 means more vegetation.  Which in turn, uses up CO2.  Higher temp means more evaporation from the oceans which in turn means more rain.  Deserts and wastelands that gets very little water now will become viable.  Higher temperature coupled with more CO2 means plants will grow larger and faster, solving the ever growing food shortage problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>True, there will be much negative consequences, like floods, and heat waves, hurricanes, and so on.  But to say that this will end civilization is plain stupid.  We will adapt.  Just like we always have thru ice ages and droughts. </p>
