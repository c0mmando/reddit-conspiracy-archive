<p>Update on event&#39;s Via solarham.net</p>

<p><em>October 21, 2017 @ 00:15 UTC</em></p>

<p><strong>M-Flare / 2682 Returns</strong></p>

<p>Surprise! Solar activity is now at moderate levels. A low level M-Flare (M1.1) was just observed at 23:28 UTC (Oct 20) around the remnants of old region 2682, now turning into view off the southeast limb. This is the same region that was previously numbered 2673 in September and produced a number of X-Class solar flares. X-Flares are likely not to be expected, however more updates to follow in the days ahead whenever necessary. Image courtesy of SDO/AIA.</p>

<p><strong>The last of three events should definitely have a slight earth directed component.</strong></p>

<p>These events will likely create cannibal Cme&#39;s A process which allows the following cme&#39;s to draft the proceeding events trails, which allows them to enter earths trajectory at a higher maintained velocity. </p>

<p>I&#39;d argue Event 1 was an M class event. The following two showing more similarities to X class events. The events do not appear to be listed at this time via <a href="http://solarham.net/solarflares.htm">solarham&#39;s flare watch</a>. <em>&quot;Which I&#39;d argue Flare two and three very well should be&quot;.</em></p>

<p>This should peak earths seismic activity into a higher state of emergency then previously assessed:</p>

<p>I expect a couple 6.0&#39;s to occur prior to a 7.0 event later on in the week. (6 day watch). Yet the quaking activity should begin picking up within the next 72 hours. With the largest of quakes occurring within 7 days time... (I&#39;d guess day 6)...</p>

<p>My main areas of concern, within this forecast: New Mexico, Kamchatka RU, and Italy. </p>

<p><strong>I am now expecting to see: upto a 7.3 event in magnitude...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>&quot;Future flares / cme&#39;s may also inspire additions to this post.&quot;</em> </p>

<p>This is an update, of a continuation of posts, on my active feed (based on todays cme&#39;s which we were expecting-</p>

<p>I will likely have some more interesting updates to release later on in the week! Yet, its late and I just wanted to inform you a third flare occurred today. </p>

<p>Welp, that&#39;s about it!</p>

<p>Take care ya!</p>

<p>:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if a sphere like object (i.e. full halo cme) such as events 2 and 3 take place in a non geoeffective position, its still common and practical to assess plasma bands to strike earth with a glancing blow.</p>

<p>This is far more ideal then a direct hit, however our sensors will likely show a higher proton count, and KM/s from the events which took place earlier this week. </p>

<p>So Yes, but in my understanding of these events, these hits will likely be felt (ill be it) mildly, here on earth, in the days to come...</p>

<p>Essentially the flares are more so orb like. Which allows some plasma to reach earths magnetic field. (even though the initial trajectory is not a direct hit in itself). </p>

<p>This is my own work and forecast though. I merely expect this to happen based on my experience with tracking these events. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so, those quakes are too far away from the Yellowstone magma chamber to be tied with that system. Though would you mind talking about your experience with these quakes (were they rolling or shaking, duration, local reporting, etc)? I find the quakes in that area to be very interesting because they are no where near any fault system and they seem too deep to be magmatic. Thank you for your time! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt one personally, and that was a 4.2 a while back I think. It felt like a rolling wave motion. My apartment blinds were smacking against the window and the apartment felt like there were waves of energy going through it from underneath my feet. That&#39;s the best I can describe it. It seems they keep happening but this is the only one I have personally felt. Could they be caused by underground explosions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the reply! As a California resident I have felt my fair share of earthquakes and that sounds normal (except for the fact your quakes aren&#39;t happening on a fault system). There are two types of earthquake: a rolling wave like motion and a more violent up-and-down shaking. I have personally seen more damage from the rolling type, but really if it is over 6 it could matter less. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it is underground explosions. <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/#%7B%22autoUpdate%22%3A%5B%22autoUpdate%22%5D%2C%22basemap%22%3A%22grayscale%22%2C%22feed%22%3A%2230day_m25%22%2C%22listFormat%22%3A%22default%22%2C%22mapposition%22%3A%5B%5B46.484210323012825%2C-113.32397460937499%5D%2C%5B47.05702528260841%2C-111.88751220703125%5D%5D%2C%22overlays%22%3A%5B%22plates%22%2C%22faults%22%5D%2C%22restrictListToMap%22%3A%5B%22restrictListToMap%22%5D%2C%22search%22%3Anull%2C%22sort%22%3A%22newest%22%2C%22timezone%22%3A%22utc%22%2C%22viewModes%22%3A%5B%22settings%22%2C%22map%22%5D%2C%22event%22%3A%22us1000asda%22%7D">This</a> map shows the activity in your area but I&#39;m not familiar enough with it to say whether there could be sense or a pattern to it, which I would expect were it man caused.
