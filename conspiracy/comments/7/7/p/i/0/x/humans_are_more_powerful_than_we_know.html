       The following post will be the culmination of 4 years of research and experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I first started off in the conspiracy world by digging into occultic matters and fringe spiritual theories like parapsychology and cryptozoology. That is where I learned of an ancient phenomena called the aura. Many civilizations and modern day spiritualist cultures have documented it, believing it to be an emanation of the soul or spiritual light of some kind. Those talented in the viewing of this strange field of light surrounding the human body are able to detect sickness before outward physical symptoms appear, read emotions, and even detect when a person is lying. My curiosity piqued I began to search for a possible scientific explanation for something that millions of people throughout the ages were convinced existed but our current scientific community openly scoffs at. My search led me to discover that humans do indeed have a field of some kind, a low frequency electromagnetic field generated by the electrical processes of our nervous system and organs. But wait, humans can't see electromagnetic fields right? As it turns out that may not be entirely correct. A
       <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1364">
        recent study
       </a>
       has revealed that humans have the same light-dependent magneto-sensitive protein in our eyes that other species of animals use to view magnetic fields which aids in navigation (birds and insects primarily). Given the proper equipment for downstream neurological transport of the electrical signals CRY2 gives off and something to translate them into intelligible information and visuals it is plausible humans can actually see electromagnetic fields that exist in the Extremely Low Frequency range. This segues into research I have done on the Pineal Gland.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pineal Gland is a small raisin to grape sized organ that sits at the geometric center of the head. I focused my attention on this gland for numerous reasons that led me to believe it may function as much more than just an ELF-EM field detector. For starters it is known to contain structures similar to the
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11962759">
        rods and cones
       </a>
       our eyes use to function, meaning it could easily function as the organ responsible for translating the information generated by CRY2 into visual images. The pineal also contains
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12224052">
        calcite microcrystals
       </a>
       with potential piezoelectric properties. These crystals could provide the medium for the observed changes in the bioelectromagnetic field related to emotion and health. The pineal has also been proven to be sensitive to ELF, which can alter the production of compounds it produces-
       <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-079X.1990.tb00901.x/full">
        http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-079X.1990.tb00901.x/full
       </a>
       . In addition to all of this the pineal is one of the few parts of the brain that exists both outside of the blood-brain barrier and in a single, non-dual nature that the rest of the brain's two hemispheres exhibit. It also receives an inordinate amount of blood flow, second only to the kidneys.
      </p>
      <p>
       To test my theories I decided to learn how to see auras myself. I followed the instructions given quite freely in various places on the internet meant to teach "sensitives" how to access this ability, and low and behold I began to get results. On the first day I was able to see the first "layer". It appears as a thin, bright outline about an inch thick that follows a person's movements on an ever so slight delay. I pushed further and began to see black and white sparks as well as jagged lines several months in. Eventually I reached the point where I am now where I can occasionally get glimpses of color from the "emotional body" but this requires a lot of time and meditative concentration. Nevertheless I proved to myself that ancient spiritual knowledge can actually precede the knowledge we attain through the current method of slowly and methodically mapping out every aspect of reality from the atoms up. This, I think, is why the current scientific community has steered as far away as possible from researching this subject unless they hold spiritual beliefs (e.g. Dr. Strassman). It brings validation to spiritual knowledge that predates the current scientific method, undermining their entire profession.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the pineal gland and our electromagnetic fields are the source of what many know as "supernatural abilities". Telepathy for instance becomes increasingly plausible as we already know the brain uses the parts of the field closest to the skull to transfer information. It is not a stretch of the imagination to suggest that full information transfer between two people via electromagnetic field contact is possible with practice. The many reports of people being able to see clearly with their eyes closed during meditation can be explained by the pineal gland, or "third eye". It is also quite likely that the pineal is the producer of endogenous DMT, the strongest psychedelic compound known to science which constantly circulates in our blood and spinal fluid. It is chemically analogous to two other very important nuerotransmitters that are already known to be produced by the pineal, serotonin and melatonin. My personal belief (and conjecture) is that the pineal is our "spiritual antenna", the thing that lets our consciousness tune in to various different reality frequencies and facilitates things like astral projection, astral vision, and of course auric vision.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are more powerful than we know, learn auric sight, try astral projection, and meditate your way to elevated states of consciousness. All these things have basis in science, science just doesn't know it yet.

       Got links to the procedure for the meditative practice that lets one see auras? I should like to give it a go! If you want, PM and I can talk to you about my own experiences in a similar vein of exploration.

       Medical science in uk ignore the pineal - I have a pineal cyst first they said there was nothing there (found due to Tumor symptoms and memory issues) 
Then endocrinology said it was there then the first scan went missing and they did another one and suddenly it’s there again - see Neuro in 2 months but a whole fb community of sufferers are being fobbed off - they discussed having a gift in that forum the other day and quite a few of us do... 
I can see auras... thanks for your post really informative drs here don’t operate at all on these cysts I’m hearing (before I even see a Neuro)

       Very intriguing... This certainly would seem to validate my thoughts on knowledge of the pineal and it's functions being suppressed. A bit of a personal question but do you have a history of psychedelic use?

       Hm, so much for connecting dots there. Terrence McKenna died from a pineal tumor due to his overuse of psychedelic substances and I was thinking that maybe this pineal cyst thing could be similarly connected. 
Still, it is very strange to see medical professionals do everything they can to not confront an issue head on. What are your thoughts on that?

       I’m not sure it’s odd - hospital dr said it was there 2 gps have said all clear until I’ve told them it’s there then suddenly it’s in front of them and they can see it but they just say it’s fine - even tho they know I’m having short term memory loss as they’ve tested it themselves (hence MRI in first instance) lots of people in same boat

       I think this may be a byproduct of the arrogance that's infested the medical community. A family friend of ours actually died due to many of his doctors misdiagnosing his cancer as various benign conditions like cat scratch fever or an infection which led to it progressing to the point that chemo couldn't kill it without killing him. All that because they just couldn't conceive of someone as young as him getting lung cancer. I'd suggest looking for overseas help if your country's doctors are trying to look the other way.

       hell yea. forgetting the name but its on the tip of my tongue... hydrokinetics? a kind bald dude in a black hoodie and black glasses could move a pond of still water almost like a stream after he focused enough. he did the same with the air by demonstrating with the air around a tree, making the leaves flutter on a calm day. he described learning these things from non humans. he seemed very.... busy almost. like these videos were so important but he had bigger matters on his hands. his last video i ever saw, was him trying to explain how he learned these abilities and about 20 mins in he began a sentence about the CIA and the video would stop not allowing you to skip any further. i scrolled down and about 3 or 4 comments said they experienced the same thing... i left that page and forgot about the whole thing fearing i stumbled upon a truth i wasnt ready for. if anyone remembers that dude or if hes still out there please let me know

       Interesting, I'm unfamiliar with the youtuber you're talking about but the idea intrigues me. Could be that we can use our electromagnetic fields to interact with the environment and not just each other.

       around this time last year is when i found him. either through this sub or the p1zzagat3 sub. and yea that was the astonishing thing about the guy. he wasn't showing off, just pointing out 'hey guys we can actually use telepathy'. very responsible and careful about everything he said. if we're born here under earths magnetic field, and every ancestor before that was too, one could argue the earths magnetics are already hardwired into us.

       And they are for pretty much every animal on the face of the planet. I never understood the push back that the scientific community gave the subject considering that fact. After what I've learned I'm almost certain the majority know what I do and the implications of the information has them shaking in their boots. Imagine how quickly they would be irrelevant if everyone learned how to use our natural born spiritual abilities to access something like the Akashic Records. There would no longer be any need for knowledge gatekeepers because all the knowledge in the universe would be free and available to everyone.

       Welcome to arguably the biggest cover up in our times.

       That being said, you need to be careful with opening your pineal gland because if you do not have a solid foundation spiritually you can open up a channel for evil spirits.

       Don't worry I'm more than prepared. I was raised with this kind of stuff, my parents taught me how to fight against evil spirits and demons back when I started getting harassed by them as kid thanks to the success of their ministry, going after the weakest link in the chain as it were. Its been so long that at this point they fear

       The Akashic Records are the memories, experiences, and knowledge of all conscious beings in the Universe. In all the reports of it that I have read it manifests as a gargantuan library in a higher vibrational astral realm, and one must be an experienced astral projector in order to make sense of it. Or so I hear, never been there myself.

       Notice how the leaves on the ground don't actually move? Just editing... don't fall for this bogus trash. If humans had such powers, there would be ONE person who would make a video revealing it. There are 6 billion people and not one person can make a video showing it?

       Yeah I'm pretty skeptical. The way he often stops talking to wave his arms around and make wooshing noises when the wind picks up is a red flag. But it does seem to start and stop when he wants at times. He is also selling "lessons", which makes me think this is just another scam for money.

       Doesn't look like CGI to me, there is noticeably less leaves on the ground farther to the right after they fly around for the first time. I'm just not convinced it's anything but coincidence.

       Just so you know, telepathy is the ability to read another mind. What you are talking about is telekinesis. Those are two entirely different things which leads me to believe you have no idea what you are talking about.

       Just the elite obsession with eating pineals, as well as their unhealthy curiosity with the RH- blood type.  Never seen anything related, except they eat both.  They're pretty keen on blood as a whole, spirit cooking, injecting young blood for vitality, but I've always wondered their curiosity with RH- blood type.  Seen many posts that it's alien blood, or part non-human, but false paths are everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does result in pregnancy complications, and the need for pregnant mothers to take anti abortion medication as the body sees the RH- fetus as foreign.  Just wondered if anything came up.

       Hm, their obsession with eating pineal glands could be rooted in the occultic idea that it is the "seat of the soul". A belief shared by several ancient cultures including the Egyptians. They might view it as eating a person's soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps RH- is a hold over from the time of the Nephilim? All the giant skeletons with elongated skulls could indicate that some survived the Great Flood. The Paracas Skulls are of particular interest as they contain mitochondrial DNA that has never been observed in humans before. The elite's fascination with it could tie into their obsession with Satan, perhaps a symbol of their desire to attain his power over the earth for their own.

       “Eating their soul”.. that statement got to me..but I can see them doing this to young children because their pineal gland isn’t yet calcified like the majority of the people.  This is also a reason why the elites are into Pedophilia. They want the young blood, pineal glands, etc. to stay young.  I seriously think most of them are possessed by other dimensional evil beings.   It’s an evil world out there friends.

       Makes sense in both contexts really. They would be eating the younger, more energetic soul of a child in order to bring the vibration of their own soul in line with it, potentially extending the lifespan of their physical bodies. They most certainly are possessed, there's a historical rapport between powerful people who engage in pedophilia and the practice of demon summoning and occult practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the calcification note, I'm not sure if this is true or not. I think that those rumors may have actually been started by research that uncovered these alcite microcrystals in order to get people to believe they are a bad thing and the result of the government secretly poisoning the water. Placebo is a powerful thing after all, especially when a kernel of truth is involved. If you believe that humans co-create the reality around us then it is possible the elite know this and use it against us.

       Well you can't take the trick, out of the trickster. satan had control of the world for 100 years, 100! Last century, and all of Earth's history to prepare for the demolition of God's church and he still fucked up. The fascination of satan is from the fact that he gave everyone riches in those 100 years, and now we will see that satan is actually miniscule, kind of like a vicious, sharp toothed dog vs a gargantuan lion. If their are enough mini dogs, they might be able to overthrow the lion, but both the lion and the one dog is immortal so it's kind of like an eternal war, for the whole of the universe since the big bag of dicks decided that he was better than the hivemind. So the purpose of the 100 year test was a filter for the sadists, the opposite polarity of inner good. Sadists will get what they want, pain and giving pain to sadists while the middle scalers get to choose, and the more powerful beings of the positive polar good on the spectrum are battling the more evil of the negative bad spectrum.

       Everything you say makes sense. Our bodies , auras, and basically everything in this reality is electromagnetism. It's part of the blueprint, and it's directly tied to duality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me show a few images. This is the electromagnetic field:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://c.asstatic.com/images/1402432_634711394320156250-1.jpg">
        http://c.asstatic.com/images/1402432_634711394320156250-1.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically this field, or flow of energy is present within our make up. How this field manifests, and the placement of our organs, our eyes, ears, nostrils, ...All symmetry is a sign of this electromagnetic pattern.  It's in trees, it's in an eyeball, it's in living things.
      </p>
      <p>

        http://www.pion.cz/_sites/pion/upload/images/a14cf10a5583d19f7cfdebd63cf64382_electromagnetic-spectrum.png

      </p>
      <p>
       That pic shows what visible light spectrum we can see. But like you mention op, there is higher frequency sensing that is possible within different spectrums. This is where our pineal , our third eye, can see.  It's a different spectrum of inner vision most access through meditation or hallucinogenic drugs. Personally I think the pineal can access all the spectrums, only we have to translate it into a heavier spectrum to experience it. But it's source is what we would call intuition, or empathy, this ability we have to Read and Feel reality in a subjective way.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the pineal is centered perfectly within the electromagnetism. The organs like the heart, and pineal are in a sense electromagnetic portals within the body. The East calls them chakras, and the correlate to a color. So within our body there is electromagnetism in varying tones, because color is a tone of frequency emanating. Higher frequency in the pineal, lower within the sexual organs.
      </p>
      <p>
       His pic shows well the energy movement within electromagnetism, view this as our eyes and head and it fits perfectly

       Visually , with very little practice, you can see the Aura simply by looking right above the surface of the body. The aura can extend to 10 feet more or less, but there is no definitive boundary from where it ends and reality is pushing back or keeping it in place while we dream, and we access higher frequency experience through the pineal. The pineal is our link to the body while we dream,  and while waking we mostly turn it off to complete mundane physical tasks.

       Hey, telepathy seems like a form of intuition where you are open to receive an energetic communication from another. The usual language seems to be inert. It is an instantaneous impulse then the language follows.  The impulse carries information directly to the awareness.

       Yes telepathy seems to focus on the meaning and concepts that our brains translate into symbolic language. In telepathic experiences some friends of mine had on psilocybin mushrooms they were able to communicate through imagery and general feelings but not in words.

       I've been telepathic all my life ... it's not constant but it's a common occurrence that most people put down to "co-incidence" ,, like they do the many things which aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       'we' can (and do) 'create' the life we live and the things which happen to us, we can 'create' the things we 'desire' and the Universe is happy to 'help' us!
      </p>
      <p>
       but to have such 'control' that the effects of your 'thoughts' are 'immediate' requires 'balancing out' one's karma so that 'old negative karma' is minimal and doesn't affect the manifestation of one's current 'thoughts/desires'
      </p>
      <p>
       On a basic level we do it every day, i.e. first you have a thought - "I'd like to have a pizza" and so you then do the actions required to 'achieve' this pizza e.g. you can make it from scratch which takes the combination of many 'steps' Or you can order one by ph and have it delivered, which doesn't require many 'steps' at all, i.e.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step #1- think "hmmmm I'd
       <em>
        really like
       </em>
       a Piiizzzaaaa!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Step #2 - call Pizza place and order pizza, give details, wait.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step #3 - Answer door, pay for and collect Pizza
      </p>
      <p>
       Step #4 - Eat Pizza .... mmmmmm! :D
      </p>
      <p>
       and there you have it, "How to create your Pizza" 101
      </p>
      <p>
       You're welcome :D

       For  sakes this is what every stubborn human doesn't get, literally just paying a small price for lit shit. It's almost like they are machines who don't have a conscious, or know that they have ALREADY been kicked out in the past, with full recollection

       Science is starting to prove this correct, we have scientific proof of the electromagnetic aura that surrounds our body. And the CIA have used psychics to get information via remote viewing.  They've been doing it for years and there are released documents that validate what I am saying.
      </p>

       It's real whether you laugh at it or not.  People with a closed-minded approach to taking this seriously only limit themselves.  This type of truth is based on how you choose to feel and think about it.  That's essentially  how the universe functions.  Look up quantum physics.  Atoms only follow the accepted laws of physics when you're looking at them.  So your beliefs shape your universe.  If a  person chooses to laugh at it and mock it for being outrageous then in their universe they won't experience it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are woefully unaware that they are creating existence and that it isn't the other way around.  Speak to every person who has written guides on how to be successful or how to get what you want out of life.   They all say the exact same thing.  They told themselves mentally that nothing can stop them and thus they literally created their own success.  Positive thinking is legitimately powerful in ways unexplainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meditation is the most fascinating thing I have read and researched.  For thousands and thousands of years meditation has been known to be a gateway to our higher energetic expressions.  It astounds me that so many people scoff at meditation as a way to heal yourself but it's been known to do miraculous things by many different cultures yet the modern world has scoffed at it and swept it under the rug.  Conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find yourself instinctively laughing at something I implore you to humor me and sit back and think why you so abruptly dismissed something.  I believe we humans, especially in the Western world, are being conditioned to do this.

       No, you expected this yourself because of your second last paragraph. I really haven't thought about this correlation between quantum theory and spirituality. I find it very interesting that physics and metaphysics that are both sometimes contradictory actually have some kind of interaction. But if we can prove so much with physics, in the end, how much meaning will there be left in our existence?

       Meaning is personal.  You create your own meaning.  And you can change the meaning.  It isn't static.  Because it's an extension of you and what you find to be important.

       Then what am I? What makes life develop and consciousness arise? At this point, I'm not even sure about my consciousness. When I was totally baked two weeks ago, I couldn't keep myself in the conscious world but rather switched between what I perceived and what I thought. I'm not okay with creating one's own meaning. I still have this feeling that life has one meaning for everyone and that reality is kind of equal to everyone to a certain point and that it is not malleable.

       In my opinion, based on my belief, you're an energetic spirit derived from Source in an infinite universe.  You branched off in your own unique direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rationalize my existence as something that was unavoidable.  If the universe wasn't infinite I couldn't exist.  Because every possibility that could happen does happen and thus here I am.

       I know it may sound weird but here goes. I practiced the aura reading/feeling for a couple years in my youth. I was able to not only see auras, but feel them as well. It was a pretty cool trick that I would do at parties or whatever, I would have someone "write" letters on my back, but without touching it. Generally I could still feel their touch about 2 inches away from my skin, in the same way that you can feel somebody staring at you, or feel someone get close.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't told many people this, but I have quite a few friends and family members that can confirm this.  I originally found out how to do this from a book I found in  a family members book store, however the cover was missing and it's been along time so I can't remember which book it was, but it really worked.

       Medical science in uk ignore the pineal - I have a pineal cyst first they said there was nothing there (found due to Tumor symptoms and memory issues) 
Then endocrinology said it was there then the first scan went missing and they did another one and suddenly it’s there again - see Neuro in 2 months but a whole fb community of sufferers are being fobbed off - they discussed having a gift in that forum the other day and quite a few of us do... 
I can see auras... thanks for your post really informative drs here don’t operate at all on these cysts I’m hearing (before I even see a Neuro)
