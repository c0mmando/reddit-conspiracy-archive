      <hr/>
      <p>
       AMENDING EXECUTIVE ORDER 13223
      </p>
      <p>
       By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and in furtherance of the objectives of Proclamation 7463 of September 14, 2001 (Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks), which declared a national emergency by reason of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York and Pennsylvania and against the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States, and in order to provide the Secretary of Defense additional authority to manage personnel requirements in a manner consistent with the authorization provided in Executive Order 13223 of September 14, 2001 (Ordering the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces to Active Duty and Delegating Certain Authorities to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation), it is hereby ordered as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 1. Amendment to Executive Order 13223. Section 1 of Executive Order 13223 is amended by adding at the end: "The authorities available for use during a national emergency under sections 688 and 690 of title 10, United States Code, are also invoked and made available, according to their terms, to the Secretary concerned, subject in the case of the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, to the direction of the Secretary of Defense."
      </p>
      <p>
       Sec. 2. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
      </p>
      <p>
       the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
      </p>
      <p>
       (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

       Here is the full Bush EO that was amended

      <hr/>
      <p>
       Any Ideas about what is going on that would require more people to be able to reactive military personnel? Is it a new stop-loss measure or a prelude to military action like it was when bush first implemented it in sept. 2001?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like this may be to stop-loss and reactivate Air Force Pilots.

       Which would point to an increase in war tempo in the coming months.

       From the discussion I saw over in
       <a href="/r/military">
        /r/military
       </a>
       , it sounds like this is going to allow more retired troops to be reactivated into military duty. Someone linked an article that said the first wave is likely going to 1000 retired Air Force officers called back to active duty to fill a "shortage", despite the fact that 2016 already saw a drastic increase in the number of officers. The executive order doesn't just apply to officers though, and a lot of users there were speculating that it is just another step in gearing up towards a war with North Korea or Iran.

       Just found a USATODY article addressing the pilot shortage and the recall and added it to the OP. The amendment to the EO would fall in line with that issue. But it does leave open the other things you mentioned.

       Thanks, that was the article I had read. It's possible that's all this is, but it doesn't seem like there is anything in the Executive Order that limits it to just this case. More retired personnel could be called back in the future.

       Lots of generals etc once retired come out and talk about how the wars are bullshit, based on lies to achieve goals that don't exist. This order says to me that another bullshit war is going to happen and this prevents ex servicemen spilling the beans once they are out of the military because they will just get called back in.
