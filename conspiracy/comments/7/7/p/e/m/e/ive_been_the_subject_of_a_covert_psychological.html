       I figured it would be good to write about these experiences to help other people going through this. I've only covered the first month or two of what's happened so far, but if you're curious check out

       If you read through all of my posts so far then you might believe me a little more. If you don't, that's alright. It's very difficult to convince people of this so I've almost given up trying. I'm just documenting my experiences and sharing them with whoever feels like reading. Mostly I'm hoping someone experiencing this in the future might find this one day and realize they're not alone.

       but from looking at the front page it looks kind of hilarious. I try to maintain a sense of humor about my situation and conspiracy theories in general... it feels healthier than wallowing in it 24/7. I guess it'd suck dealing with trolls all the time, though.

       Has this ever proven anything useful? I'd definitely consider looking into those if they have. Especially the biomarker one. The others I feel like I could think of ways around from their perspective.

       I'm not quite understanding what you're saying here but I'm probably just not comprehending it right. I was saying the experimentation seems psychological in scope. The methods used to produce the psychological (and sociological) effects desired are physiological.

       I agree with this. I just wish the aversion therapy was used to change bad behaviors to good ones. I would actually be
       <em>
        fine
       </em>
       with this whole thing if it was aversion therapy designed to rehabilitate and make me into a better person. However, it seems like it's completely the opposite. I've made strong efforts to resist that but this has certainly changed my thoughts and behavior for the worse.

      <p>
       I mostly agree with this, but I don't know if "approve of" is the best way to put it. They have a specific goal in mind, and I've eventually learned that humanizing them is a mistake. There is no humanity displayed on their end, it's purely sociopathic manipulation to achieve the results they want.

       Thanks for this, I haven't seen it. I know people have mixed feelings about Vice, but I've always enjoyed their stuff. I don't watch or read as much stuff about the TI community as I probably should. For some reason I'm very skeptical many of the people that claim to be TI's actually are, but that's possibly a little ignorant and narcissistic of me to assume that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give it a watch in a bit and let you know what I think!

       some suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
       keep a diary written or video kept offline (ie. do an entry while disconnected from the internet and store it on a usb or a drive.  never have that storage device connected to anything online), so that you can have a narrative you can show others if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you think you're under some kinda EM attack try to make a colloidal with a conductive metal in it (ie. colloidal silver water), put it in a spray bottle and spray your walls and windows with it. this might help provide a bit of a faraday cage effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you have ways to track blood pressure, heart rate, etc. (a blood oximeter, for instance could measure the heart rate and oxygen rate) keep a log of these too when episodes happen.  start to document all of the physiological effects and modes in which they happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       additionally you can harden your computer from exploit.  i'd recommend installing qubes and using their sandboxing features to help mitigate against system corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the basic stuff - non-processed food diet, meditation, and regular exercise.

       Excellent recommendation! Silver and water shield radiofrequency. Wearing wet clothes shields radar attacks. Spraying clothes with home made colloidal silver may increase attenuation.

       I believe disconnecting from the internet through conventional means is pretty futile; these guys definitely know what they're doing on the tech end. I do actually carry a USB with some notes and records related to this, as well as back up my files online. So far they haven't messed with anything I've stored digitally, but I'm sure they have the means to.

       This is great advice, and when this was first starting I did all of that. Ran 2-3 miles every day, did resistance training for all the muscle groups I knew how to cover every other day, did yoga for 30 minutes every day... depression and a deepening feeling of futility have removed those from my routine. I'm hoping to get back into that soon - for example I recently participated in a 5k (it's a start)

       I'm not convinced these meters provide much useful information because anything digital can easily be tapped into and controlled by the people skilled enough and paid for that sort of thing. I also doubt any protective VPN or encryption or whatever that you have on your phone would make it much harder for them. I guess it doesn't hurt to try, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked around on you wiki which is a bit of a link rabbit hole. The links also don't seem to be lead by much of a description as to what exactly they lead to. There is still definitely a lot of useful information there, but it seems kind of jumbled.

       I played around a little bit with a few apps I found that I think are relevant to the electromagnetic events you were describing. The only thing interesting I found was that

       True. Phone apps are hackable. I recommend phone apps as an introduction to metering. Hand held meters are not hackable but an EMP attack can destroy them. Hand held meters can be stolen. Lock them up when not in use. See the Meters: Hand held meters wikis in

       Thank you for your sympathy. I've thought about it, but I'm pretty reliant on technology and the internet, so I feel like I'd get very bored. I'm also not positive this would stop in that case. I haven't been able to get far away from all cell towers and civilization yet to see if it would prevent this from happening, but it's certainly something I should try.

       I read all your posts. I understand you don’t want to or can’t discuss what you “did” to warrant these things happening to you. You mention going to Johns Hopkins, what kind of professionals were you evaluated by there? Have you considered contacting whoever you were involved with while doing the “bad thing” and asking what you need to do to make them stop? It sounds like a lot of resources, time and money being spent to “terrorize” you, but for what purpose do you think? Whatever you “did” or were involved in must have been pretty bad. Have you ever heard of trigeminal neuralgia?

       Seems to be Gang Stalking (that’s the term, right ?). You can find an interview with an Army Intelligence officer (Col ?) who investigated these Domestic psy-ops, was a radio interview but available online. She said Congress members are aware of it but unwilling to tackle the issue.

       Curiously, there can exist a spiritual/demonic element to these cases. Specific prayers of strength and protection can also be found online. This may allow you to develop in ways that otherwise would not have occurred. Turn this unfair attack into personal growth, albeit in grinding fashion.

       the fact that it's possible that I'm a non-consenting subject of an experiment. They said they thought it was more likely that that was not the case, but admitted that it was possible based on my account of what is happening to me.

        Have you considered contacting whoever you were involved with while doing the “bad thing” and asking what you need to do to make them stop?

       There were multiple "bad things" and the people I associated with have no power to stop this from happening. The only possibility of help would be from that past employer, but that bridge is burnt to the ground and I believe they complicit in this anyways.

       From what I understand about it, it primarily results in symptoms of shock-like pains in the facial region. I don't get those. Mine literally feel like they're occurring in different regions of my brain. Sometimes the inside of the top of the back of my neck where that soft spot is is also affected.

       I should - and hopefully will - start documenting what areas of my brain it feels like it's coming from by referring to diagrams of brain anatomy online. I'm pretty certain the shocks in different areas have their own individual affects on my behavior, so that could be interesting.
