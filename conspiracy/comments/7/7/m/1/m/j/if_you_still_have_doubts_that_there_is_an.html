       It's quite clear that there is a concentrated effort to divide this nation, which raises some questions for me... Who is doing it? For what purpose are they doing it? Where is this heading?

       Just your run of the mill divide and conquer technique. There is a benefit to the ruling elite when the masses fight each other. If the masses united under one banner, they would be shaking in their pedo boots.

       LOL I'm assuming you were going for "racist", but you ere so triggered in the moment that you couldn't quite make the mind-body connection with your fingers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So somehow, in your mind, I'm "racist" for trying to bring awareness to the fact that the Elite are trying to divide us and cause racial hatred? They don't like YOU either, buddy. Black/white, whatever. They don't give a fuck about you OR me. WE are their cannon fodder, buddy. Wake the fuck up, and break out of your conditioning. If the skin colors were reversed, I'd be saying the same shit, because I know race is an illusion. It's only a mechanism that TPTB use on stupid people to keep us distracted from who, and what we REALLY are. Our consciousness. Call me a racist for pointing this out all you like. It only reveals how brainwashed and programmed you are.

       Yes. Your post is virtue signaling for white supremacists and it's meant to stoke ethnic divisions under the guise of promoting unity.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why you're only focused on the "anti-white" message from the elites. It's really obvious and your deflections onto me aren't helping making it any less so.

       Listen, if the skin colors were reversed I'd be saying the same thing. It's not the skin colors that matter. It's the principal. It's the fact that they are trying to Balkanize this country and fulfil their evil NWO agenda while us peasants fight each other over silly shit. I don't identify as my "race". I am my consciousness/my spirit. Race is an illusory concept. How does bringing awareness to the fact that evil men in high positions of power are using the superficial concept of race against the population as a means to control and manipulate us make me a "racist"? Just because I'm pointing out the tactics, doesn't automatically make me a "white supremacist" or even a "white nationalist". Nowhere did I express contempt or hatred towards any other race, but you have such programmed thinking that in your mind me pointing out the demonization of "white" people in the media to further an agenda by a third party automatically equates to me hating other races. It's sad that you are unable to see how shallow and programmed your thinking is.

       It's true. Some people are trying to make white men look bad. The best way to do this is to use the left as they are easy to control and don't think for themselves, that's why you see so many brain dead mainstream media soaking liberals parroting shit they hear in their echo-chamber.

       It's true. Your entire post is you parroting insults against liberals that you soaked up from conservative media in an echo chamber. It doesn't even make sense, nothing you said is relevant or meaningful.

       A) it's not parroting because it's my actual opinion and they're words I thought of not repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) I get my information from all sorts of sources both left and right and make my own mind up and always think of my own opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) My comment was meaningful because it's true. Stupid people are told what to say by the mainstream media and other nut jobs, all of which is obviously not true and just doing a bit or research or having common sense would help people realise this. For example, a couple modern left wing arguments is that only white people can be racist and if you're a white straight male your opinion is worth less than say, a gay black woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       D) Remember that the left wing is the democratic party... If you've been on this sub for a while I shouldn't have to tell you why that's relevant.

      <p>
       C) No it isn't. Your going on and on about how stupid everyone else is and how meaningful your opinions are don't led any credibility to you or your argument. And no, it's not a common argument that only white people can be racist among the left. That's a common argument dog whistle for white supremacists to use.
      </p>
      <p>
       D) Who cares? Oh right, you are one of those people who only listen to alt right conservative echo chambers. Like I already proved.

       A) Haven't got an argument so "uh-huh" will do, who needs an actual argument if you can dismiss it if you disagree right? Because if I dismiss it it means I win...
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Still can't construct any argument so you just call me a liar with no proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) My opinions are meaningful to me because I'm eligible to vote, didn't say they're meaningful to everyone as it obviously won't be. Also, yes, it's a mainstream left wing argument so I don't see how you could say it's a dog whistle for white supremacists especially considering the fact there really aren't alot of white supremacists these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       D) I'm not alt-right, I actually do listen to all kinds of sources wether it be left or right and decide my own opinion. That's not an echo-chamber and you didn't actually prove anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't actually come back with a constructive argument it's much easier to be sarcastic, call them a liar and label them as alt-right because then you can dismiss the argument because they are bad person, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard for a lot of left wing people to construct an argument that actually rebuttals the arguments presented to them. Like you just proved.

       Its not only the different skin colors they want divided but we are seeing the attack on males in general as well. Lumping all males as predators etc.. there is a full on attack on roles and families.

       This is a good point, and I have considered that. I still stand by my point that there is a pretty hefty amount of racial divide propaganda being peddled, and I think it is wise to address it. The video I linked to was quite an eye-opener to me. It's become a pretty strong trend.
