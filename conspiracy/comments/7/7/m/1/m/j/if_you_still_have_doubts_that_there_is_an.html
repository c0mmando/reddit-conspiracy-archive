<p>LOL I&#39;m assuming you were going for &quot;racist&quot;, but you ere so triggered in the moment that you couldn&#39;t quite make the mind-body connection with your fingers.</p>

<p>So somehow, in your mind, I&#39;m &quot;racist&quot; for trying to bring awareness to the fact that the Elite are trying to divide us and cause racial hatred? They don&#39;t like YOU either, buddy. Black/white, whatever. They don&#39;t give a fuck about you OR me. WE are their cannon fodder, buddy. Wake the fuck up, and break out of your conditioning. If the skin colors were reversed, I&#39;d be saying the same shit, because I know race is an illusion. It&#39;s only a mechanism that TPTB use on stupid people to keep us distracted from who, and what we REALLY are. Our consciousness. Call me a racist for pointing this out all you like. It only reveals how brainwashed and programmed you are.</p>

<p>Listen, if the skin colors were reversed I&#39;d be saying the same thing. It&#39;s not the skin colors that matter. It&#39;s the principal. It&#39;s the fact that they are trying to Balkanize this country and fulfil their evil NWO agenda while us peasants fight each other over silly shit. I don&#39;t identify as my &quot;race&quot;. I am my consciousness/my spirit. Race is an illusory concept. How does bringing awareness to the fact that evil men in high positions of power are using the superficial concept of race against the population as a means to control and manipulate us make me a &quot;racist&quot;? Just because I&#39;m pointing out the tactics, doesn&#39;t automatically make me a &quot;white supremacist&quot; or even a &quot;white nationalist&quot;. Nowhere did I express contempt or hatred towards any other race, but you have such programmed thinking that in your mind me pointing out the demonization of &quot;white&quot; people in the media to further an agenda by a third party automatically equates to me hating other races. It&#39;s sad that you are unable to see how shallow and programmed your thinking is. </p>

<p>C) My opinions are meaningful to me because I&#39;m eligible to vote, didn&#39;t say they&#39;re meaningful to everyone as it obviously won&#39;t be. Also, yes, it&#39;s a mainstream left wing argument so I don&#39;t see how you could say it&#39;s a dog whistle for white supremacists especially considering the fact there really aren&#39;t alot of white supremacists these days.</p>

<p>D) I&#39;m not alt-right, I actually do listen to all kinds of sources wether it be left or right and decide my own opinion. That&#39;s not an echo-chamber and you didn&#39;t actually prove anything. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t actually come back with a constructive argument it&#39;s much easier to be sarcastic, call them a liar and label them as alt-right because then you can dismiss the argument because they are bad person, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard for a lot of left wing people to construct an argument that actually rebuttals the arguments presented to them. Like you just proved.</p>

<p>This is a good point, and I have considered that. I still stand by my point that there is a pretty hefty amount of racial divide propaganda being peddled, and I think it is wise to address it. The video I linked to was quite an eye-opener to me. It&#39;s become a pretty strong trend.</p>
