<p>Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance, Vaccine Safety and Development Branch, National Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 1999.
Thomas M. Verstraeten, R. Davies, D. Gu, F DeStefano</p>

<p>Background: Concern has risen on the presence of the ethylmercury containing preservative thimerosal in vaccines. We assessed the risk for neurologic and renal impairment associated with past exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine using automated data from the Vaccine Safety Data link (VSD). VSD is a large linked database from four health maintenance organizations in Washington, Oregon and California, containing immunization, medical visit and demographic data on over 400,000 infants born between &#39;91 and &#39;97.</p>

<p>Methods: We categorized the cumulative ethylmercury exposure from Thimerosal containing vaccines after one month of life and assessed the subsequent risk of degenerative and developmental neurologic disorders and renal disorders before the age of six. We applied proportional hazard models adjusting for HMO, year of
birth, and gender, excluding premature babies.</p>

<p>Results: We identified 286 children with degenerative and 3702 with
developmental neurologic disorders, and 310 with renal disorders. The relative risk (RR) of developing a neurologic development disorder was 1.8 ( 95% confidence intervals [CI] =1.1-2.8) when comparing the highest exposure group at 1 month of age (cumulative dose&gt; 25 ug) to the unexposed group. Within this
group we also found an elevated risk for the following disorders: <strong>Autism (RR 7.6, 95% Cl = 1.8-31.5)</strong>, non organic sleep disorders (RR 5.0, 95% Cl = 1.6-15.9}, and speech disorders (RR 2.1, 95% (1=1.1-4.0). For the neurologic degenerative and renal disorders group we found no significantly increased risk
or a decreased risk.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: This analysis suggests that high exposure to ethyl mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines in the first month of life increases the risk of subsequent development of neurologic development impairment</strong>, but not of neurologic degenerative or renal impairment. Further confirmatory studies are needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i actually plan to. Pediatric waiting rooms are notoriously full with long waits. Leaving behind some small printouts that look similar to the pharma glossies would at least get patients to ask questions. You know like :ask the doctor for formaldehyde and aluminum free or prolife vaccine options. Also make sure to include all the risks of alluminum and formaldehyde just like pharma does. Simply raising doubts is a very effective tool to spread awareness.  If you copy the marketing strategy of pharma it might be effective. Pharma always recommends you ask the doctor for their product. They do this in order to pressure the doctor to change his prescribing habits. I will try it out but I am not sure we will know the results. </p>

<p>By Gavin Broady 
September 25, 2012, 4:14 PM EDT</p>

<p>The Ninth Circuit on Tuesday upheld a win for Merck &amp; Co. Inc. in a wrongful death suit brought by the parents of a child who died from a vaccination, ruling that claims of strict product liability and negligence are federally preempted.</p>

<p>The appeals court found that Erin and Shawn Holmes could not sue for strict products liability and negligence so far as those claims were based on design defect and failure to warn, as such claims are foreclosed by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to question your comprehension or your honesty. The appellate court explicitly held that the plaintiffs could proceed despite the Act, because the remedies they sought could be obtained via legal theories the Act did not foreclose.</p>

<p>The case does not support your anti-vax talking point. I think you will continue to repeat that talking point rather than accept that it&#39;s plainly wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plaintiffs alleged eight claims plus a claim for punitive damages in their state wrongful death action. Application of Section 22 affects only two of these claims—the strict products liability and negligence claims to the extent that they were based upon allegations of design defect and failure to warn. <em>Therefore six of Plaintiffs&#39; claims remain unaffected by the Act and each of these provide a possible remedy to the injuries that they suffered as a result of Jacob&#39;s illness and death.</em> Accordingly, our conclusion is in keeping with the strong presumption that Congress does not, “without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.” Silkwood v. Kerr–McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, 251, 104 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984); Cf. Shafer, 20 F.3d at 6.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The excerpt implies, inaccurately, that the case was terminated and the plaintiffs were not allowed to proceed.

    <div class="md"><p>Everything the regulators, governments and Vaccine manufacturers have done is to conspire to push and denounce any scientific or medical voices against Vaccines. Many clinics have now altogether refused to give vaccine shots in their clinics. Not just for costs as they say but for &quot;disclaimer&quot; liability purposes. in Quebec, Canada, many clinics have stopped giving vaccines. It is not their problem anymore. This is a pharma  industry and government collusion. Doctors don&#39;t have any say, or they lose their jobs or get attacked personally. Parents are forced to get vaccines, doctors will not risk their life to fight what parents will not. Sad truth.</p>

Annals of Epidemiology , Vol. 19, No. 9 ABSTRACTS (ACE), September 2009: 651-680, p. 659
CM Gallagher, MS Goodman, Graduate Program in Public Health, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY</p>

<p>Abstract
PURPOSE: Universal newborn immunization with hepatitis B vaccine was recommended in 1991; however, safety findings are mixed. The Vaccine Safety Datalink Workgroup reported no association between hepatitis B vaccination at birth and febrile episodes or neurological adverse events. Other studies found positive associations between hepatitis B vaccination and ear infection,
pharyngitis, and chronic arthritis; as well as receipt of early intervention/special education services (EIS); in probability samples of U.S. children. Children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) comprise a growing caseload for EIS. We evaluated the association between hepatitis B vaccination of male neonates and
parental report of ASD.</p>

<p>METHODS: This cross-sectional study used U.S. probability samples obtained from National Health Interview Survey 1997-2002 datasets. Logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the effect of neonatal hepatitis B vaccination on ASD risk among boys age 3-17 years with shot records, adjusted for race, maternal education, and two-parent household.</p>

<p>RESULTS: <strong>Boys who received the hepatitis B vaccine during the first month of life had 2.94 greater odds for ASD</strong> (nZ31 of 7,486; OR Z 2.94; p Z 0.03; 95% CI Z 1.10, 7.90)
compared to later- or unvaccinated boys.Non-Hispanicwhite boys were 61% less likely to have ASD(ORZ0.39; pZ0.04; 95% CIZ0.16, 0.94) relative to non-white boys.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that U.S. male neonates vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine had a 3-fold greater risk of ASD; risk was greatest for non-white boys.</p>

<p>In a sense it DOES, because if you do enough studies one will eventually show the result you are looking for. It&#39;s why there is a push that ALL data/studies should be released, not just those that show something new and/or show the result you want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From another discussion-</p>

<p>The main issue is child health safety and the balance of the risk of disease against risk of the vaccines.</p>

<p>It has always been the drug companies, health authorities and medical professions argument that “children will die” to scare parents into vaccinating. When that is shown to be fallacious with hard fact they change their position as you have to argue something else.</p>

<p>And if you want to compare total health outcomes – adverse effects of disease against adverse effects of vaccines, health authorities refuse to carry out long term studies by independent, unbiased objective researchers of total health outcomes between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. These would provide hard data to compare differences on the extent of mortality and adverse effects of vaccines compared to diseases. This would reveal the extent of asthma, allergy, diabetes, SIDS, arthritis and many more conditions which kill and/or debilitate for life and permit a risk/risk comparison of vaccines vs no vaccines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to answer this one. In the US, it&#39;s very hard to find a pediatrician that will space vaccines out. They tend to stay on the &quot;down low&quot; and many won&#39;t accept Medicaid or other insurances. If a pediatrician doesn&#39;t vaccinate a high enough percentage of patients, he may get a letter from the insurer saying he&#39;s not delivering their standard of care and they won&#39;t cover his patients anymore. How then do you do business?</p>

<p>As a new parent, you assume doctors will be reasonable about this vaccine thing. It shouldn&#39;t be a big deal to just space them out a little, right? Your parents, who are from a generation that didn&#39;t have to vax as much, assure you that yeah, that pediatrician should be reasonable. If you&#39;re the first in your friend group to have a kid, your friends won&#39;t know much about it, and if not, your friends probably are provax anyway. Everything on Reddit is provax, so no help there. </p>

<p>So you get to the pediatrician with tons of questions about everything baby-related, and he says &quot;okay time for the first round of shots&quot;. You mention that you&#39;d like to do just one today and come back next week for another one. Pediatrician lets out a hearty laugh and condescendingly assures you vaccines are safe and effective. Medical assistant comes in immediately and gives all the shots. </p>

<p>What you didn&#39;t realise going into this is the pediatrician has been trained since school to address and squash &quot;vaccine hesitancy&quot;. He was ready for you. They see this every day. Their job is basically to measure kids&#39; growth and then push vaccines all day. </p>

<p>So you get home, baby might be fine. Or.. baby might break out into a rash and have trouble nursing. Go back to pediatrician, tell him you think baby had a vaccine reaction? Pediatrician immediately lets out a hearty laugh, gives you the vaccines are safe and effective speech again, and says there&#39;s no way this is related to vaccines. Here&#39;s some eczema cream and zantac for reflux. </p>

<p>The cycle continues every two months. Until...parent either A. Buys into the vaccine propaganda B. Gets fed up, starts calling other pediatricians, but gets discouraged when they can&#39;t find a vax-flexible doctor. C. Gets fed up, stops going to well-baby visits. D. Starts asking local mommy groups and friend circles if there&#39;s a vax-flexible pediatrician, which may work, or may also get you kicked out of those mommy groups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is stuff that CDC doctors and researchers actually said, I just don&#39;t get why there&#39;s any question that people should be concerned about vaccinating their children. I don&#39;t understand how this is public knowledge/out there and yet isn&#39;t out there and isn&#39;t public knowledge. How did they explain this away?</p>
