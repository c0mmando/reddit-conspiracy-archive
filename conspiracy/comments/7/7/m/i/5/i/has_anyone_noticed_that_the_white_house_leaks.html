       no, the phone event is of recent weeks, to out the last leakers

       It's why the reporters of the press

       Kelly and Trump had a bad relationship, they thought he was about to resign

       Possibly but Trump didn't request or plan the remodeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was planned while Obama was still in office, like a year out. I'd be just as concerned of the remodeling being an opportunity for bugs to be planted.

       I think it was more he was a weak cos. He couldn't control the flow of information that made it to the president unfiltered. Bannon, Jared, spicer, plus who else knows were all fighting amongst each other to put the other one down. Kelly has ousted everyone but Kelly ann and Miller so there is no infighting publicly. Reince was prob leaking too but it wasn't just Jim.

       Yep. Say what you will about Kelly, but the leaks have come to a halt.

       Gorka and Bannon also left around when Reince got fired. I'm not accusing them of anything, but it is worth noting.

       Steve Bannon: "Darkness is good. Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power. It only helps us when they [liberals and media] get it wrong. When they're blind to who we are and what we're doing."

       It's hyperbole.  Bannon is essentially saying that comparisons to the Dark Lord of the Sith, or any kind of evil cartoon, help him.
When people like Wolff meet Bannon and he turns out to be an actual human being with some good ideas ( elsewhere in the article, he talks about his push for a trillion-dollar, job-creating infrastructure bill) they may believe the rest of the caricature is wrong too.
       <br/>
       And it helps because it cements a certain fearsome reputation that is useful for those who want to wield power. Which one would you rather have yourself compared to: the galaxy's greatest villain or a bumbling Jar Jar Binks?
      </p>
      <p>
       But go ahead and take his quote literally because yeah he surely meant it that way and it was in no way hyperbolic.

       It's possible they are lizard people too.
But being paralyzed with possibilities is no way to go through life.
We make decisions based on our best information and move forward. Sometimes we are wrong.  Most times we are right.  No, that stick on the sidewalk is not a snake even though my lizard brain told my subconscious it could be.  I did not enter defense mode.
In the same fashion I believe that Bannon is not the devil and probably not a pedo.

       This sub has been taken over by bots.

      <p>
       The leaks haven’t stopped, the President just keeps luring or doing some stupid shit that becomes the focus of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point, Both Trump, and Kelly got caught in a lie about the widow phone call. Turns out it was being recorded and we have more evidence of the president lying again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet this sub buried it.  An actual elected government official caught lying, again is the foundation of wire true conspiracy theories come from. But this sub supports him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sub is being manipulated, it’s painfully obvious at this point.

       My mistake, I was doing talk to text. What I meant to say was he lied about having proof of the phone call to the current widow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next day, the White House Press Secretary denied that, or recording existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I feel it is insufficient evidence to rely on the widow,  at this point, Trump has been caught and way too many lies over this scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am a little skeptical of that last  phone call in support of Trump, to be honest. They just got caught lying again about a retired Navy seal supportered Trump on Fox News, and it turns out he wasn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a plant used to drum up military support for Trump in the news.  Why should we believe this person too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I wrong to put a particular magnifying glass on people support trump in the media at this point? This is not the first time they caught lying about status in order to influence  a segment of the population?

       The emperor stuff is said in jest by most people, but I wouldn't expect you to understand. As long as Trump sticks to his America First campaign promises I will support him 100%. If he flip flops and starts supporting amnesty, gives up on the wall, starts putting other country's citizens interests above Americans then I will be the first to go at him.

       perhaps you should take your own advice, as i didn't write that. i also didn't write anything about leaks or my feelings about them, and you have yet to respond meaningfully to what i actually wrote.

       So you read those lies I posted, then why did you pretend to not know what I was talking about? Is playing dumb your debate strategy? Current events is what are talking about here, but I guess you are taking cues from the original poster and just sticking your head in the sand when the news doesn’t fit your narrative or world view.

       Your response was “what” and honestly you should be thanking me for being as nice about as I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I’ll break it down for you. The Trump administration had a leak in their admin that was releasing WH info to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, the voters and the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the WH wanted to put a stop to the leaks and started looking for the leaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still with me? I can type slower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Wikileaks comes out from Russia, (hey are you guys neighbors?) with leaks pertaining to the DNC and Now Trump and his supporters love leakers, like Seth Rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       So leaks against Trump=Bad, unless it’s against his rivals and then it’s all good.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it should be is leaks against the government is good for the American public as we can see what the fuck they are up too.

       I was wondering if you can explain how the current admin is not, in fact, the establishment? A billionaire property developer who is now the POTUS seems pretty much the fucking establishment to me? Or do you really believe a man that was born into billions is just "one of the guys" and understands the plight of the common man? Laughable.

       So all billionaires are establishment? Is that what you are saying? I guess all the establishment people that he had seemingly good relationships with before running for President and are now attacking him and half of America relentlessly are faking it. You obviously have your mind made up about the guy and won't change. Good for you. I won't waste any more of my time because you obviously didn't listen closely to any of his campaign speeches or his inauguration speech if you think he's part of the political establishment. Enjoy the TDS over the next 7 years.

       Dude, the widow confirmed the phrase was said but wasn't given a chance to say the rest of the sentence, which was along the lines of, he knew what he was getting into but was still brave enough to enlist.

       Dude, the mother was there and she unequivocally confirmed that Trump disrespected their family.  You guys really need to just stop this bs and realize that gaffe prone Trump fucked up his messaging for the millionth time, then he fucked up the damage control, and then he had his cabinet throw gasoline on the fuckup.

       Any halfway intelligent person would have just apologized for the miscommunication, heaped on some more praise and condolences for the family, and let it go.  But as usual, Trump's insecurity overwhelmed his ability to strategize.

       That's just the version of the story that Trump fans cooked up to spin an incredibly embarrassing situation. Scaramucci's interview with The New Yorker was an unmitigated disaster, since good PR people should never be the story. They certainly shouldn't be the story by insulting their future coworkers. As for "getting out" on purpose, all of his and the White Houses actions point to an expectation of staying on long term:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Scaramucci sold off his hedge fund
       </li>
       <li>
        Leaks about displeasure regarding his hiring
       </li>
       <li>
        The tone of The New Yorker interview was one of someone expecting to stay in a position for a long time.

       If you're going to read between the lines, it has to at least make sense. This involves an elaborate plan and tons of work just so Priebus can be fired. But wait, Trump could fire Priebus whenever he wants. There's no evidence nor motive.

       You asked a loaded question. It started with the assumption that Trump already intended to fire Priebus. Answering fully would force me to adopt your assumptions first. I have no intention of doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about this, why don't I put forward my interpretation of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scaramucci was hired by Trump because he seemed loyal to Trump, looked great on TV, and was brash. All of these are things that Trump values. Scaramucci is thrilled at the chance and immediately starts preparing to be part of the White House. At some point, he convinced Trump that Priebus was to blame for leaks in the White House (maybe true, I don't know). Priebus was already on thin ice, so Trump decided to fire him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scaramucci gets the sense that he has the ear of the president, gets cocky, and gives a disastrous interview with The New Yorker. He has no background in PR, so he doesn't know that part of your job is keeping your mouth shut. Kelly, Trump, Bannon, and other staff have a little chat about how Scaramucci will just be trouble and cause more infighting (itself a major driver behind leaks). Scaramucci gets fired soon after.

       Think of it as very badly written software code, it's all spaghetti in there. Public opinion is a major factor to take into consideration and considering anything Trump does is bad according to some, getting someone else to get rid of someone he wants gone can be an effective strategy

       The reason a lot of people write off Hilary's supposed corruption, is because she is literally the most investigated politician in political history. If there was major dirt on her republicans would have found it over the past 30 years. The problem is a bunch of noobs to politics fell for russian and right-wing media pushing crazy conspiracies to the point that you dumbshits actually think she's a sulfer smelling satanic Illuminati assassin child rapist. You guys run around acting like you're "woke", but until you can admit you fell for fucking dumb ass propaganda you're still just a bunch of useful idiots. That's how I see it.

       You think they are dumb enough to blame Mooch instead of trump. No ones that dumb. The Rnc and Ryan know exactly who is to blame. This isn't 4d chess. This is a idoit making bad choices on live TV for the whole world to see. More people fired or quit from this white house then any other in our history. You know the saying lose 1 employee you had a bad employee loss 5 you have a bad manager. We're at what 15? 20?

       I noticed this a while ago but did not realize it was potentially tied to Priebus' firing. I used to look forward to reading the news on Monday mornings! Always a new leak to stir things up. Now it's just not as fun.

       Actually, they didn’t stop completely.

      <p>
       There were two leaks after he left. A transcript of a phonecall, and another that I can’t recall right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But guess what. Both leaks had something in common. The info they contained was available when Priebus was still on the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it continues to appear that Priebus was the mole.

       My mistake, I was doing talk to text. What I meant to say was he lied about having proof of the phone call to the current widow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next day, the White House Press Secretary denied that, or recording existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I feel it is insufficient evidence to rely on the widow,  at this point, Trump has been caught and way too many lies over this scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am a little skeptical of that last  phone call in support of Trump, to be honest. They just got caught lying again about a retired Navy seal supportered Trump on Fox News, and it turns out he wasn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a plant used to drum up military support for Trump in the news.  Why should we believe this person too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I wrong to put a particular magnifying glass on people support trump in the media at this point? This is not the first time they caught lying about status in order to influence  a segment of the population?

       It's possible they are lizard people too.
But being paralyzed with possibilities is no way to go through life.
We make decisions based on our best information and move forward. Sometimes we are wrong.  Most times we are right.  No, that stick on the sidewalk is not a snake even though my lizard brain told my subconscious it could be.  I did not enter defense mode.
In the same fashion I believe that Bannon is not the devil and probably not a pedo.
