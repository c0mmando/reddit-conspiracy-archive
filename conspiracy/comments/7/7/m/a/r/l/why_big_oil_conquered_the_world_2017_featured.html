       Just watched this yesterday... so it seems that it might already be too late for a population to actually go against these oil companies as they have already turned their influence in the technological world and have already bought out politicians to create the laws protecting their assests.

       Yes..because it's all about control. This documentary has helped me understand some of the things TPTB do that "don't seem to make sense".

       We dont need oil. There is free abundant energy in each packet of space, and the government secured and perfected this technology in the 80s at the latest. All it needs is exposure and we are home free from the constraints of oil.

       What I am saying is, they have already divested their assets from Oil into technology. So even if this free energy were to come and the public could use it, these people would already have more control in our lives. Using smart meters and other technology to monitor energy usage, they are given a level of control. Say something negative about the current power structure...no more power. Its free right? Well they will still have their finger over the switch.

       Thing is, this technology is not profitable. We will no longer be subjected to a false scarcity based economy. Education and information will be free, poverty and hunger will cease to exist. Fear and guilt will dissolve from humanity in favor of love and openness. Then we will meet the aliens and explore space.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no switch when it comes to this technology. All we need is for the currently classified patents to be declassified, open source and reproducible. Manufacturers should produce the parts needed in mass, and the technology should be taught to anyone with the desire to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what we have to push. It's up to us. Disclosure is only a matter of time and it's up to us to make sure that it's complete disclosure.

       Basic quantum field theory predicts we should see an enormous vacuum energy value.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because quantum field theory states that all fields [like the electromagnetic field] must be quantized, or sectioned, at each 'length'. This means you section the field at different 'wavelengths'. The smaller the length of the field you section or quantize, the higher the frequency, the higher the energy. The electromagnetic field spans the entire Universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       This goes to infinity, obviously, keep quantizing smaller and smaller and higher and higher energy with no limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We put a cutoff in the equations to stop the quantizing at the planck length, because this is a fundamental quanta of action or a fundamental set of measurements for a fluctuation, planck length size, planck mass energy, planck time speed, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, even using this cutoff, we're left with an enormous amount of predicted vacuum energy, 1093 grams / cm3.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this is telling us is perhaps at each point in space, the vacuum is so highly energetic that space is curved back on itself, into singularity. Black hole fabric of spacetime, planck density 'empty' space.
      </p>
      <p>
       When this is extrapolated, it would mean that the entire fabric of the cosmos is knit together in a sort of hyper-dimensional, or 4d overlay that knits every point in the Universe into a single point with zero physical distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how the cosmos is entangled, this wormhole fabric of the vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nassim's proton solution evinces this by showing that the proton's holographic energy density (how many natural planck quantization energies [how many planck length diameter spheres of the planck mass energy] fit inside) add up to 1055 grams - the estimated mass of the Universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because the protons are also this spacetime fabric, intimately knit with all other protons and communicating through their holographic surface horizons to all other protons. In effect, a proton is only a proton because of it's relationship to all other protons. This reinforces the fact that there is no such thing as an isolated system, and we cannot look at a single proton as a discrete entity (or anything else).
      </p>
      <p>
       So his proton equation is literally taking all protons into consideration, and spitting out the mass/radius of a single one, beautifully.

       If you actually understood the math and science behind QM/astrophysics/QED etc. and had studied it, you would already know why this man's papers are not science and are not mathematically correct. There are plenty of counter-sources that discredit his "work."
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think the easiest way to tell it is all fake is the fact that his papers aren't published in scientific journals. The majority are self-published or published in fake journals where pseudoscientists write about pseudoscience that is peer reviewed by other, like-minded pseudoscientists. Neither he, nor any of his "peers" have bona fide associations with academia on any level.
      </p>
      <p>
       His work tries to look like science and sound like science but in reality there are no experiments ever conducted because it is all based upon bogus numerical coincidences - quite clearly unscientific. But it sounds good and makes people feel good, that is why - to the untrained eye - it may appear like this man is actually some sort of scientist on the verge of a breakthrough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't blame you and I apologize for making assumptions about your educational background - all you did was unwittingly copy and paste some classic disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not going to go line by line disproving his claims because the burden of proof is on him to prove, through experimentation, that his models have better prediction power than the current set of accepted models. He has not.

       I obviously don't mean numerology in the sense of fortune telling, I mean numerology in the sense that random numerical coincidences tend to mean absolutely nothing.

       So my first post should read:

       Absolutely 100% fake.
But you don't have any training in math or science so you will insist that its true despite being completely fabricated numerical coincidences.

       You must be the 100th person to say this to me, yet I have not had a single individual produce a single piece of actual evidence to suggest that Greer is misleading. He has a lot of documents and eyewitness testimony that would be indisputable if it were able to be brought to a court.

       Saw the How months ago and just watched the Why this morning. It's even better. Scores big against Al Gore and Maurice Strong. All the resources driving the Environmental movement come from the same crew trying to run everything--the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, et al. Corbett has done a great job with these. I learned from him that anecdote about John D. Rockefeller's father starting selling snake oil and cheating his boys every chance he gets to "make 'em sharp".

       Slander is certainly an important tactic for maintaining control, but I think u r oversimplifing or implying that its more partisan than it is. From what I understand, both sides have a history of caving to big oil interests just like both sides have a history of slander.  Try to think less in terms of left vs right and more in terms of the haves and have nots.

       The Republicans are far more pro-Big Oil and anti-environmentalism than the Democrats. That's why the Republicans want to maintain large oil subsidies while the Democrats want to discontinue them.

       That is absolutely untrue. If you believe that then you know little about American domestic energy politics. The left, since the Carter administration, has been pushing for clean, alternative energies, partially to break our addiction to oil, while the Republicans have been major supporters of Big Oil.

       Particularly on the local level, Democrats have pushed for alternative energy development, which is why WA and CA are the top states for such production. That being said, there are some Republicans who support alternative energy, too, especially in the Midwest, but such support hasn't made its way on the national-level GOP party, which receives a lot of money from Big Oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The differences between the parties on energy is readily apparent from their party platforms and the rhetoric they use.

       I will repeat what I said in the first sentence of my previous post: WA and CA are the leading states, gigawatt wise, in alternative energy as a direct result of policies. More so, anyone who has observed American politics would be familiar with the stark differences between Democratic and Republican energy policies, e.g., Republicans wanting to open up public land for oil exploration while the Democrats have pushed for more solar and wind energy.

       &lt;&lt; At that time, crude oil was transported in wagons-platforms in open wooden
barrels, because of which the most valuable part of the cargo evaporated. Upon arrival, there remained
Only a thick sediment, which lost its main value. This situation has changed
Thanks to John Rockefeller, who was the owner of the railway transport
company "Union Tanker Car Company", and had a patent for metal and hermetic
tank wagons used to this day. &gt;&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of the invention of the "tank" (and the possession of a patent for it), the company
"Standard Oil" has become a global monopoly in the field of extraction, transportation
and oil treatment. And Rockefeller himself became the first billionaire in the history of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this state of affairs caused opposition from the US federal authorities.
In 1911, the US government intervened in the affairs of the company "Standart Oil". As a result,
the company was forcibly divided into many separate
companies, in the names of which the abbreviation "SO" was preserved:
- Standard Oil of California
- Standard Oil of New York
- Standard Oil of Ohio
- Standard Oil of Indiana
- Standard Oil of New Jersey
- etc.
      </p>

       :) And what have the Cistercian brothers here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Until the end of the XIX century, the Order of the Cistercians was quite monolithic, although in it
and there were separate disagreements. However, under the pressure of the Vatican, in 1891 of the Order
Cistercians were given an independent order of trappists. This event put
the end of the single order of the Cistercians, since most of the monks
among the released (trappistov). This blow to the monolithic order of the Cistercian Order -
was inflicted at a time when the general of the order was Leopold Wackarz (Leopold Wackarz).
      </p>
      <p>
       The official abbreviation of the Order of Cistercians is SOC (Sacer Ordo Cisterciensis).
And the breakaway trappistov - OCSO (Ordo Cisterciensium Strictioris Observantiae).
Common in the abbreviations - the letters "SO".
      </p>
      <p>
       :) The name of the Cistercian Order (SOC) - means "Standart Oil of California"? :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Forced collapse of the order - occurred at the time when he was led by Leopold Vakazh.
A forced collapse of the "Standard Oil" - was when it was controlled by John Rockefeller.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rockefeller and Vakazh (Vakazha has a portrait, not a photo):

       It is early in the morning and I haven't had any coffee yet. I am not seeing exactly the connection between Rockefeller and the Catholic church. I always thought he was one of those fanatics who worked 12 hours a day 7 days a week. Did he spend a lot of time reading the bible? Was he big on commandments 7 &amp; 9 &amp; 10? This looks like a difficult fit.

       I quite enjoyed both these documentaries, but I can't imagine
       <strong>
        how
       </strong>
       any historical recap of the 1900s and the world wars can omit any mention of the Bolshevik Revolution, wherein Jewish Bolsheviks took over the Soviet government and murdered upwards of
       <strong>
        60 MILLION RUSSIANS
       </strong>
       . It's directly relevant to Germany's reaction.

       Actually, I

       </em>
       imagine
       <strong>
        how
       </strong>
       it wasn't mentioned, and I can imagine
       <strong>
        why

       With all the dogma associated with Climate Change - I have been extremely skeptical on the whole push for Cap and Trade, but it's hard to find anything related to the insiders and the money trail.

       Great documentary! I think the "why" is more about the future of thier business though.  Bankers know their product has no true value, and someday, ppl will raise up stop using it. Same with oil, someday ppl will simply stop using it. So, these industries  want to get in the business of products that will never become obsolete, human existence itself. If they can track, monitor and control everything about us, they will never go out of business. It's not simply about control. It's about staying in business. It's about creating the greatest business model of all time. Money changers and oil men will be unemployed in the future. So might every other industry seen today.

       I liked part 1 better.  The moral of this one seems to be that we are irreparably fucked.  The planet is being destroyed but the only ones in the position to do anything about it are part of a psychopathic kakistocracy set on culling the population and tightening their control over every aspect of our lives.  In conclusion.... do fentanyl and zone out?  I'm at a loss.

       Would be sweet if someone wrote a summary, so it is much easier to comprehend for the normal citizens. feels like just a bunch of information thrown at you, and you got to piece them all together, i would try and attempt this but sometimes just don't have time.
