        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is what I have come up with based on the available information, or more accurately, the <strong><em>LACK</em></strong> of available information. </p>

<p>The fact that Campos not telling his dispatcher that he was shot makes absolutely <strong><em>NO SENSE</em></strong>. 
Every security guard knows that that radio is his <strong><em>LIFELINE</em></strong>, and there is <strong><em>NOTHING</em></strong> more important then telling his dispatcher that there is an active shooter and the he had been shot.</p>

<p>To me, this was a FBI fast-n-furious type operation that went terribly wrong. The buyers somehow figured it was a sting and shot both Paddock and Campos. Campos didn&#39;t call it out on the radio because he thought the FBI was his back up and that they were already on their way. And let&#39;s not forget the Campos does not have a guard license in the state of Nevada.</p>

<p>The FBI and MGM are sitting on the video and it will <strong><em>NEVER</em></strong> be seen by the general public because it implicates both of them. 
This scenario make a hell of a lot more sense then <strong><em>ANY</em></strong> official version. It also matches the timelines.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shoot Paddock and Campos when deal goes south.</li>
<li>Need diversion to cover get away.</li>
<li>Shoot into crowd at concert.</li>
<li>Leave before cops get there.</li>
</ul>

<p>If they wanted to just kill people, they had plenty of weapons and ammo to keep shooting for some time and make a fight of it when the cops get there.</p>

<p>The shooting of the concert was a diversion just to cover their tracks as they escaped.</p>

<p>QUESTION 1: Did the FBI have the cameras on that floor disabled for their operation? </p>

<p>QUESTION 2: Does the video of Paddock coming and going show him with his FBI contact or perhaps Campos himself?</p>

<p>QUESTION 3: A former security officer claims that the Mandalay Bay does not have door alarms. So what was Campos actually checking?</p>

<p>QUESTION 4: Why is MGM in control of this investigation? They seem to have more influence and information then the Sheriff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only two things I&#39;ll add...</p>

<p>First, if deep State was in on it, Campos might have called in on a secure radio, ie, not on police or MGM channels. </p>

<p>Second, I&#39;m not yet sure whether Paddock-Campos ran this alone, or if FBI was in on it. The lack of prompt backup might suggest FBI wasn&#39;t prepared to give backup, hence maybe rogue op rather than a department op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good theory for Campos/partially Paddock, and what could’ve happened there on the 32nd floor. I hadn’t thought of the idea of them as “partners” so to speak.</p>

<p>I think there’s more though. The higher level shit - Soros dumping stock, the MGM CEO dumping 80% of his despite just initializing a buyback program (drastically increases value), there’s the eyewitness accounts of gunmen on the ground in the concert crowd, all the other hotels like Bellagio, NYNY, Aria, the really odd Tropicana footage. Then there’s the government / legislation component, silencer bans, NRA and HRC’s on the nose tweet, Andelstein’s meeting with Trump, the 4chanAnon guy’s “High Density Project” posts (or whatever it was). All this stuff screams deep state foreknowledge. </p>

<p>I agree with your assessment mostly, but there’s so much more out there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone considering the war of words between Trump &amp; Cartels May have morphed into actual war ? Vegas has been the conduit of weapons (Las Vegas Now, “Guns Bought in Vegas Used by Mexican Cartel” ) and money laundering for at least a decade.  There’s considerable news since Trump’s election of “using seized Cartel assets to build the Wall” , “every truck crossing the border now being properly inspected and X-ray scanned” , “threats against Trump daughter” , “sending US troops into Mexico for counter-narcotic missions”.</p>

<p>Paddock was likely making a nice living laundering narco money on e-poker (there are stories online how it’s done, using the machine’s receipt for money in play that you simply walk to the cashier window for clean bill$). Seems he had bought a number of properties which might have served as safe houses for govt or mob work. As we know he recently moved into weapons purchases which I assume was also for govt sanctioned laundering. </p>

<p>Did the Trump era ATF, DEA then coerce Paddock into conducting a sting ? So a “fast n furious” transaction became an actual bust ? A double-cross by cartel’s interpretation ?</p>

<p>Or did AQ, ISIS, NKorean agents step into a “fast n furious” op and hijack it into a terrorist strike ? This would be similar to what reportedly occurred in Benghazi.</p>

<p>Two YouTube videos stand out in my mind. Genesis CNC (“was Paddock a lone wolf”) and CWC Labs (HealthRanger) ballistic forensics. Scientifically proves not just multiple shooters but likely 1-2 belt-fed weapons involved. I don’t believe drum-mags used since the rate of fire decrease that can be heard is indicative of ammo-belt tension decreased due to links snap whereas a drum snag just halt fire altogether. Additionally, suggests an M240 7.62 (replaced the older M60) not M249 5.56mm weapon. Consider the implications ! Multiple shooters, serious weaponry.</p>

<p>And several online testimonials of burst shots were fired within Tropicana, outside NYNY, outside Bellagio.</p>

<p>Could be a bloody, multi casino heist occurred ? </p>

<p>Could be the Cartels are pushing back against Trump policy and LV was/is the battlefield.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question 3 has been pretty thoroughly debunked.  The claim was made by a 10-years past security officer but the system was later updated with door alarms and was pretty well documented by other security personnel. </p>

<p>Also, question 4, I think MGM is just worried about 600+ lawsuits coming down the pike.  I don&#39;t think they were involved in whatever was really going on there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IF the FBI was operating there, MGM was involved in a support role at the VERY least, and they are very clearly trying to minimize the legal exposure (600 may prove to quite low). However, producing Campos for an interview with Ellen? She is very deeply owned (for lack of a better word) by MGM; they are one of her primary sponsors, and she is NOT a journalist. That was not an interview, it was a presentation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll concede #3, to a point. All of the rooms are on key cards which means computers, which means alarms. However, all the hallways have cameras facing both directions, they don&#39;t send security officers up to see if a guest decides to prop their door open or a while. I just don&#39;t buy checking an alarm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks OP.  I dunno, I think everything about the incident makes sense in the context you propose except the shooting of the crowd.  If it was an arms deal gone wrong (or sting op like you said) I cannot make sense of why the perps would spend 10 minutes shooting into a crowd after they had already shot in the hotel (Paddock and Campos).  At that point they would have known they had a matter of minutes or less to escape, and smashing out windows and shooting randomly into a crowd for 10min would make no sense at all and only waste time and draw more attention to themselves and their location.</p>

<p>I think the whole operation is some sort of false flag &quot;inside job&quot; type thing.  The purpose is to stoke fear, hatred/division, and obedience from the public.  Whodunnit is another question, but a false flag to keep the public scared and eager to give up their rights is the only motive that makes sense.  </p>

<p>Nothing in my theory excludes this.... for a reason. Swap False Flag for the sting scenario and we agree.</p>

<p>The shooting into the crowd was to cause massive chaos to slow police response and give them a panicked crowd to get lost in as they escaped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible there was a group of people who had to escape so one or two stayed back and fired for a few minutes as cover.</p>

<p>Otherwise I agree with <a href="/u/geeves_007">/u/geeves_007</a> in that it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to shoot for that long. Surely a burst of fire into a crowd would cause a similar panic.</p>

<p>Another thing that isn&#39;t referenced in your theory is that there were reports of shooters at several other hotels around the area, including video of people stampeding and screaming.
I don&#39;t get how that fits in unless they were just trying to cause mass confusion.</p>

<p>Yeah, the stampedes might just be from people hearing there&#39;s a shooting and panicking, but there&#39;s at least one video out there of security locking down a casino that was a mile away from the shooting and the security guards verifying there was a shooting in the casino that was locked down. I think there is police scanner footage referring to it too.</p>

<p>Again, it could all just be part of the confusion. I&#39;m not sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>RE: Reports of shootings in other casinos etc.  2 pretty simple explanations for that I would say.</p>

<p>1) There were supposed to be tandem attacks in other areas, with the same objective (basically terrorism, by who is the question) and the shooters in other locations backed out, or failed for some other reason.</p>

<p>2) The more likely explanation for the other casino shooters question is that they never existed and were just erroneous reports by panicked people and the security at the casinos not sure what was happening so they acted as if it was a live shooter in their hotel when in fact there never was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2) makes no sense. These hotels were nearly 2 miles from Mandalay Bay. You don&#39;t run for your life at teh sounds of gunfire that&#39;s almost 2 miles away, especially when you&#39;re in one of the nosiest cities on Earth. And people don&#39;t hear &#39;there&#39;s beena  shooting at Mandalay Bay  a couple miles down the road&#39; and then all start screaming and running. That&#39;s just not how people act. And when you hear the eye witnesses talk about it, they describe very clearly that the gunfire was there, at the hotels, it wasn&#39;t jus tthey heard a rumor or whatever. Unless someone was playing the sound of gunfire over some speaker or something, although the woman who took video at the Bellagio said the front windows were all shot out, and they wouldn&#39;t let her out there to film it, but one of the Bellagio staff confirmed with her there and then that there&#39;d been a shooter there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I have no idea.  I certainly do not profess to know with certainty what may or may not have happened with these other supposed incidents in other casinos far from the main attack.  </p>

<p>I certainly wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were other shooters in other sites as part of a larger scale coordinated attack.  It is my belief that this attack MUST have involved multiple people, so why not have shooters in other casinos?  Seems very plausible.  But I just haven&#39;t SEEN much evidence of that aside from spotty witness accounts and the Bellagio woman&#39;s video.  Correct me if I am wrong, but her video did not show or record any actual gunfire or evidence of gunfire (shot windows etc).  She only talked about those things.  Is there any video you have seen that definitively shows gunfire in another casino?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps that would apply in a situation with a single gunman on a rampage.  But the scale of this event...  It is simply inconceivable that this was accomplished by one individual.  Therefore, as it seems at least several people must have been involved, that scenario seems very unlikely to me.</p>

<p>Its one thing for a guy to snap and shoot up a shopping mall.  Those kinds of attacks usually end with at most a few dead and injured.</p>

<p>This is more akin to that attack in Kenya a few years ago in the mall where multiple shooters were involved and the motive was political / terrorism as opposed to just a single person losing their shit and going on a rampage.  </p>

<p>Its one thing for a solo crazy person to hatch such a plan.  For them to actually pull it off, alone, is highly improbable.  Because there almost certainly had to have been several people involved, there must be more to the motive than what you suggest.  </p>

<p>It is absurd to think Paddock hatched this plan because he was a crazy wanting notoriety or whatever, AND THEN he managed to convince several OTHER people to participate as well.  To what ends?  Why would anybody else help him?  </p>

<p>Do you think a single deranged person with allegedly no military training could have realistically pulled off such a massive attack in one of the most secure and heavily surveilled cities on the planet all by himself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A conspiracy is not always the answer just because a story has some inconsistencies or aspects that seem unlikely. Most things in life cannot be tidied up nicely with a bow. It would be suspicious if the ENTIRE story made 100% sense without any confusion, because that is not representative of the chaotic and weird nature of life. The idea that a vast government conspiracy must be the answer simply because there are mysterious aspects to a story is ludicrous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just mysterious aspects, it&#39;s that the police and FBI have covered things up. They have wiped all info about the event from the devices of anyone there, they have completely ignored all teh eye witness accounts of multiple shooters at other hotels, hotels a couple of miles down the strip from MB. Why would they ignore stuff like that? Eye witness testimony matters, it&#39;s evidence, adn yet they just dismiss it, they haven&#39;t even said they&#39;re looking into it, despite the confirmation on the police scanner audio of multiple shooters and all the eye witness testimony. Surely any good law enforcement agency would follow up on such leads and let the public know, instead of ignoring it, banning thos journalists asking those questions from participating in press conferences etc.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a little naive I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps they don&#39;t want anybody releasing those videos online in order to keep information from the public given that it is an ongoing investigation. By not releasing certain information, they can better determine whether or not a potential suspect played a role given what that suspects reveals they know about the event. </p>

<p>With automatic fire as rapid as what is heard in the video, i am not surprised that people thought there was more than one shooter. Police often report more than one shooter even when there is only one. One such instance was in Dallas when the police chief used that robot to bomb the assailant.</p>

<p>Why are you so befuddled when it turns out that people&#39;s highly contextual and relative perceptions of events vary greatly, any scientist will tell you that the LEAST reliable source of information is that which is gained from a firsthand account. Fuck, go to your local community college, take an intro course to psych and you&#39;ll learn just how unreliable eyewitness testimony/memories of chaotic and traumatic events are, or just how malleable and unreliable memory in general is. </p>

<p>You are taking the LACK of information in some cases to make massive assumptions. You&#39;re surprised that an incredibly chaotic event like that would have a lot of differing stories? It&#39;s called the Rashomon Effect. It&#39;s a fact of basic human psychology that this kind of shit is inevitable in the aftermath of any chaotic and traumatic event.</p>

<p>Oh, cool, thankfully I don&#39;t give two buttery fucks what you think of me. I think you&#39;re uneducated and ignorant to how the human brain works and how individual perception of reality can provide you with a very different experience of one event from someone else who was also present, how badly people communicate information and say one thing yet mean something else entirely, how often stories change as new evidence comes to light, how totally normal it is for someone to make a mistake and later changes their story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think ludicrous is strong word for this.  They&#39;ve done it before.  Why wouldn&#39;t they do it again if it served some (as of yet) unknown strategic objective?</p>

<p>Remember, &quot;conspiracy&quot; only means more than one person plotting / completing an illegal act.  I am 100% convinced this is a conspiracy of some form.  I cannot believe one deranged senior citizen could possibly have accomplished this in a city as secure as Vegas and actually executed what appears to be the plan.  And that NOBODY knew anything about it and NOBODY seems to know anything at all about this guy to boot.</p>

<p>One day he plays some video poker like he always does, and then retires to his suite filled with 23 guns and thousands of bullets, wires up some surveillance cameras, barricades the door shut, and unleashes thousands of rounds of gunfire on a concert across the street?  And nobody knew anything about it?  His partner didn&#39;t notice anything unusual?  Nobody knows a damn thing at all?</p>

<p>And he left not a shred of an explanation WHY he did it either?  </p>

<p>That, I think, is ludicrous.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean there&#39;s no way a single guy could pull this off? He had automatic rifles with 100 round magazines. He had cameras set up outside for security purposes. Obviously he thought about it for a while and planned very thoroughly. You know how easy it would be to actually haul 20 rifles up to a room? A good size suitcase would hold 5 with ammo no problem. When&#39;s the last time your suitcase was checked while on your way to the hotel room? I wouldn&#39;t think twice if I saw a man walking into a hotel with 4 suitcases. Once he&#39;s up in his room he is free to do what he wants nobody will know. </p>

<p>So really all he had to do was smash a window and shoot automatic weapons into a crowd of 20,000 people. I mean, that crowd was DENSE! I&#39;m honestly surprised he didn&#39;t get more kills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that just doesn&#39;t happen is why.  Think it through.  You&#39;re suggesting some psychopath comes up with an idea that he is going to shoot as many random people at a concert simply for notoriety as a mass murderer, and then he manages to convince other people that this is a good idea and to help him?  All this despite the fact that this is almost certainly gonna end with their own deaths either by suicide, SWAT team, or death penalty after the fact?</p>

<p>How would he find these other people that would agree to help in this insane and pointless plan given the stakes?</p>

<p>When several people CONSPIRE to commit an evil act like this there is ALWAYS a motive besides just &quot;snapped and wanted to kill a bunch of people&quot;.  Maybe its political, maybe its religious, maybe they are part of a brainwashed cult or whatever.  But the point is the MOTIVE links the conspirators together, and it is for the motive that they agree to do the act.  Several random people do not all go crazy in the same way and happen upon each other through sheer luck and pull off such an operation.  There was planning and execution of an extremely complex plan here by multiple individuals.  That precludes your hypothesis absolutely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think that? Literally the only thing pointing towards him acting alone is that the police said it. All the evidence points towards him having been with others, from the room service receipt, to the use of his key card in the room while his car left the hotel, to the reports of multiple shooters at various locations, both on the police scanner audio and eye witness testimony, to the forensic audio analysis of the shooting that clearly identifies two shooters at different positions....literally the ONLY thing that suggests there was only one shooter is the police/FBI statements. And even the Sheriff himself initially said he didn&#39;t think he did it alone.</p>

<p>Please, please, have a think about why you believe what you believe, and if you discover it&#39;s because you&#39;re putting an inordinate amount of faith in authority and official statements, try readjusting your thought processes, because it&#39;s dangerous the more people that think that way! And I&#39;m not saying that in any disparaging way because a year ago I would be thinking the same as you and it&#39;s only because I had a personal experience that revealed to me the erroneous nature of my own basic assumptions when it comes to the media and &#39;the authorities&#39; that I was able to actually start evaluating things solely on the basis of evidence.</p>

<p>I think these two + maintenance worker (possibly) were up to no good and campos is the one that pulled trigger on paddock.</p>

<p>And yet when the police arrived two minutes after the shooting had stopped, Campos had made it all the way down to the elevators in the Central Court.</p>

<p>On Ellen, he just said he pulled his pant leg up and saw blood.  I don&#39;t think he ever said anything about seeing the actual wound.  I&#39;m assuming by the time he pulled his pant leg up, the blood from the wound had trickled down his leg, so he wouldn&#39;t have had to pull his pant leg up that far to see blood.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to know what hospital he went to for treatment, (and when) but of course Ellen was probably instructed not to ask those kinds of questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they shoot Paddock in the head but only shoot Campos in the leg? How is it better to create a diversion by getting a lot more police (who immediately set up perimeters) to show up? Perhaps Campos was in shock after having been shot, and panicked and as a result resortes to training that he applied inappropriately at the wrong time (keeping radio traffic clear, which I am sure is something they&#39;re trained to do, though obviously not in the way that Campos did). When traumatic shit happens to people, they react irrationally and do stupid shit that makes no sense. It&#39;s entirely normal. And why would the FBI set up a sting to catch potential mass-murderers DIRECTLY across the street from a concert, in a room with a perfect firing angle with the perfect weapons to inflict a massive amount of damage? Why would they give live rounds and load every gun? </p>

<p>It&#39;s an ongoing investigation. They are not releasing footage because that could compromise the investigation by making it difficult to determine how a potential suspect knows key infornation. They do this in almost every murder investigation and countless people have been caught because they accidentally revealed that they knew something that was unavailable to the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty logical and level headed response you make, I have a couple questions for you, they say paddock is the shooter and acted alone, so who else could implicate themselves by providing info not publicly released? And my second question is how would you feel if say 1 year from now, they haven&#39;t released a fully transparent report?  I ask because it seems like these days, when something somewhat fishy happens, it quickly vanishes from the news, and then as time goes on people move on to something else and forget about it. Kinda like the 2 cargo ships that crashed into us navy ships recently, swept under the rug and forgotten. No real answers given.. or say like the twa flight 800 I think it was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe someone knew about his plan or helped him plan it, or provided him with gear or information that he used. There could be other parties involved even though Paddock actually did the deed by himself. I don&#39;t think the FBI necessarily cares about providing answers or reports to a public that no longer cares. Things vanish from the news so quickly because A: there is nothing new to report and b: the public loses interest. Now of course, the media are masters at making something out of nothing, and could probably continue to report on a &quot;dead&quot; story for quite a while, but even then people lose interest, and why do that when there are a ton of other &quot;stories&quot; (whether they have value or substance or not) to report on? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your theory. </p>

<p>The one issue I have is.. the fact that there was sustained shooting aiming on a crowd of people for a significant amount of time, which leads to me to think that the killing of those people was planned, or intended for a reason over than needing to get away and cause a diversion. You don&#39;t need to shoot those people to cause a diversion. The penalty for being stung at the gun deal is one thing, but then to shoot all those people.. well, you&#39;re looking at the death penalty and you also have to escape. Risky. Just doesn&#39;t seem plausible for me, unless those that were being stung were ISIS. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI and MGM are sitting on the video and it will NEVER be seen by the general public because it implicates both of them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree i think it was a sting op gone wrong. im thinking feds were pretending to be dealers and sent Paddock to make the deal. i also think the shooting was part of the plan and deal. the attackers would get all their weapons ready and waiting for them to carry out the attack. they figure out Paddock is working for the gov&#39;t, kill him, carry on with some of the attack, but get out earlier than planned knowing feds were there. Campos walked in on something he shouldnt have, and now forced to help sell the feds story. </p>

<p>so maybe feds didn&#39;t take them down right away because it would expose them setting this up, or this was more of a false flag and they wanted it to go down. and maybe they sent Paddock with the intention of him getting killed so they could make him the culprit. (maybe he knew too and thats why he sent the money).  i think this is really important <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJsormyzCQY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=20m36s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJsormyzCQY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=20m36s</a>.  when the guy asks for the floor to be evacuated so &quot;C.I. ..uh... snipers&quot; can go up. </p>

<p>MGM was compliant with feds leading up to it, but they also don&#39;t want to get sued by victims so they not giving in so easily to what the feds want the story to be, especially if it could cost them millions. don&#39;t want any blame im sure thats bad for business. so feds and MGM are kinda battling over what the story is. </p>

<p>If he was a Mandalay Bay employee, his failure to report the shooter could result in MGM being found negligent in their response and would put MGM at risk of massive payouts to the victims in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>If Campos wasn&#39;t employed by Mandalay Bay, why was he up 30 some floors in the hotel?  It would make sense for him to be in contact with Mandalay Bay security if he was CSC, but he would probably be restricted to remaining in the lobby, or other ground floor areas.</p>

He had a camera hidden in the hallway, but how would that give him an exit? It seems more likely to warn him that he needs to stop and shoot himself/shoot the police.

<p>That event was itself a cover for other thing, for example the video that was here in reddit with those guys with heavy guns escorting a guy in another hotel at the same time.</p>

<p>As far as shooters you actually see somebody in the 4th floor shooting in the famous taxi driver video. I think Paddock was just brought upthere and shoot. </p>

<p>Also I think other shooter from an helicopter circling the area as many of you tube videos show.</p>

<p>I think one of the big mistakes they made is that they have thousands of witness and number 2 every guy who was military just for the sound of the weapon knows they are lying. </p>

<p>The gun deal went wrong theory does not add up when you consider that Soros made a fortune by selling options on the Mandalay stock just a few days before, what are the odds of that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I can tell, there might have been one shooter at another hotel. Most of the reports heard shots, but didn&#39;t see a shooter. One testimony video reported hearing shots on a PA system, like there were recorded gunshots being played in one/some of the hotels. Forensic acoustic analysis determined at least one other active shooter closer than Mandalay to the scene. Perhaps recorded gunshots are there to muddle audio analysis. This would indicate precognition. The 2nd gunman remains at large. MSM is saying it&#39;s only Paddock. ISIS claims credit, quickly denied by FBI.</p>

<p>A lot points to psyop, false flag type stuff. The type of op that gets intelligent skeptics who go on conspiracy boards to fear the government.</p>

<p>My guess is it was a political hit. Done by MKULTRA with or without ISIS involvement (bomb materials found). For the purpose of passing political agenda. Including gun grabbing and profiteering from metal detectors / scanners at the casinos. Of course, if you own metal detectors, you don&#39;t need to create anything like this, you just have to wait for it to happen and then be the opportunist to make your money. But it sure as hell helps create fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen this explanation put forth here and other forums, and it is definitely the most plausible explanation. I remember watching the shootout that happens halfway through season 2 of True Detective and thinking it ruined the show because it was so unbelievable, but this Vegas shooting was nearly identical if you believe that a law enforcement fuck up caused it.</p>

<p>Also, MGM is seemingly in charge of the investigation because they are still heavily controlled by organized crime, namely the Chicago Outfit, and they are not trying to get sued into oblivion for a government mistake. That is the other thing about this incident: the mob now has something really big over the government. They can hold that over their head basically forever and use it as leverage to get away with a bunch of unsavory shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why was bomb material found? Was it also supposed to be included in the deal?</p>

<p>Shooting into the crowd is not a distraction nor is it an escape plan. Especially not when it happened from one of the most perfectly positioned rooms in the hotel. If anything, you would want to do your deal away from the strip for slightly more security, on the opposite end of the hotel.</p>

<p>No, the purpose of the hotel visit definitely included firing on the crowd. That wasn&#39;t an afterthought.</p>

<p>The lack of video footage is very telling. FBI has something to lose. If it was just MGM&#39;s problem, I don&#39;t think the FBI would have as much of a problem with releasing the video. This directly implicates the FBI.</p>

<p>The only point I take issue with. He does not appear to have an active guard card or PILB license, but that&#39;s not necessary for him as he is a gaming employee and as such must be registered by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. This is a private registry, unlike the PILB registry and so cannot be searched. </p>

<p>Hey, thanks for that, I will.</p>

<p>By your citation, EVERYBODY that works in a casino is a Gaming Employee. Okay, but not my point. </p>

<p>Do dealers get asked to do patrol and well-checks?</p>

<p>Do security officers get asked to deal Blackjack? </p>

<p>My point is that there are typically rules that separate security personnel and everybody else, up to an including job responsibilities and personal relationships. And you CANNOT DO BOTH. </p>

<p>Also, do you need a license of some sort to be employed as a security guard in Nevada? Because, Campos doesn&#39;t have one. Granted, as a casino employee, there are numerous other valid and reasonable reasons for him to have been up there. But they are saying he was security. </p>

<p>Honestly this is the only popular theory I&#39;ve heard that isn&#39;t supported by the evidence we have.</p>

<p>If there is one thing we can be sure about is that it was planned.</p>

<p>The types of weapons, the special tool to break the window, the amount of ammo, the location, the cameras, the supposed trajectory calculations, they all support the idea that there was a plan to shoot as many people as possible.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine a worse possible &quot;diversion&quot; than shooting 100s of people over the course of 20 minutes from a crime scene.   Why not just pull a fire alarm and try to blend in with the 100s of other people evacuating?</p>

<p>Question 2: police have stated they found over 200 different videos from security footage of paddock before the shooting, and he was always alone. So no doesn&#39;t show Campos or FBI.</p>

<p>3 : if the guy is a former employee, maybe the alarms were installed after, or maybe he was fired because he is an idiot and what he says means nothing. However I really doubt the MGM are putting out a story of how he went to check and alarm that doesn&#39;t exist. Why would they do that? </p>

<p>4: why do you think MGM is in control of investigation? The only info I heard from them was that the disagreed with the police timeline. They sound relatively uninvolved but maybe I missed something.</p>

They can just hold back information and reports and documents and evidence on anything that happens. They realize that if they wait long enough, people will forget, move on, and stop asking questions. All they have to do is completely avoid the whole thing and eventually people move on, but that doesnt make what they are doing alright.  Im not one of those guys who thinks every single thing is a conspiracy, all im saying is that our government is elected and funded by us to serve us, and they should provide us with enough transparency so that the truth is very clear.
