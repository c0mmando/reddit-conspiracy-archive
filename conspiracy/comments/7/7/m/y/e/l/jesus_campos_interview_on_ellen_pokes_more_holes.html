        <h3 class="title">Jesus Campos interview on Ellen pokes more holes in the official timeline.</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">42</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LoneStarMike59.html">LoneStarMike59</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the October 13 press conference Sheriff Lombardo tries to explain the 6-minute gap between the 9:59 PM call made by Jesus Campos and the time Paddock started shooting at the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.</p>

<p>Press Conference starting at the <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/2Gs9hIufmAo?t=9m54s">9:59 mark</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We were provided with the time of <strong>21:59 as a human entry into a security log.</strong>  Through investigation we have determined that <strong>Mr. Campos had encountered the barricaded door adjacent to the suspect&#39;s door at approximately 21:59.</strong>  In his attempt to gain entry to the 32nd floor, it required him to ascend to another level and eventually make access to the 32nd floor.  He went to the doorway that he was dispatched to originally to address the open [hotel room] doorway.  He mitigated that situation and subsequently received fire from the suspect.  </p>

<p><strong>When you culminate that timeline associated from the original 21:59 to the 22:05 timeline that we still stand by as the initial volley of fire, Mr. Campos received his wounds in close proximity to 22:05.  He attempted to relay that information via  his radio and it was confirmed because he also relayed that information via his cell phone.  So the timeline to both of those sources have been verified.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Sheriff Lombardo is implying that <strong>as soon as Campos encountered the barricaded fire door while on the stairway, he reported it at 21:59.</strong>    And <strong>after</strong> he was was shot, he relayed that information via his radio and cell phone.</p>

<p>I watched the Ellen Show again.  Campos begins telling his account of what happened at the <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/F7gj1FoRIfE?t=23s">0:23 mark</a></strong></p>

<p>So this door alarm was for a hotel room a few doors down from Paddock&#39;s suite.  He couldn&#39;t get onto the floor because of the barricaded fire door.  And in this Ellen interview <strong>he does not mention calling anyone about the blocked door at that time.</strong></p>

<p>So he says he &quot;dropped down&quot; which I&#39;m assuming he meant he took the stairwell back down to the 31st floor and then went to another set of stairs (most likely the ones at the elevator bank in the center of the building) came back to the 32nd and walked down the hallway towards Paddock&#39;s room and the adjacent stairwell.</p>

<p>He would have had to pass the hotel room where the door alarm went off before he got to the stairwell, <strong>but he doesn&#39;t mention checking it.</strong>  But he may have just left that part out because it&#39;s not integral to the story.</p>

<p>Says he made it down to the stairwell, opened the outer door to the stairwell and discovered that the inner door was barricaded.  <strong>And that&#39;s when he says he called to report the inner fire door was barricaded.</strong>  Not at 21:59 when he first encountered the blocked door, but a few minutes later when he accessed it from the other side and saw the brackets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking he was probably shot just a few seconds at the most after ending that call.</p>

<p>Now Campos did say he used his radio to call in that there had been shots fired, but wanted to keep the radio clear so other people could handle the call, but he also said that&#39;s when he switched over to his cell phone.  I think when he was on his cell phone is when he reported that he himself had been shot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I went to go lift my pant leg up and I saw the blood.  That&#39;s when I called it in on <strong>my radio</strong>  that shots have been fired.  And I was gonna say that I had been hit, but I got on <strong>over my cell phone</strong> just to clear that radio traffic so they could coordinate the rest of the call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So who did he call on his cell phone?  Was it building security?  Was it 911?  He never says.  If it was 911, they&#39;d know what time he called them.</p>

<p>Also, It&#39;s sounding to me like Paddock fired shots into the hallway on two separate occasions.  Once when Campos was shot in the leg, and then a couple minutes later when the maintenance man arrived.</p>

<p>And it had to have taken at least a couple of minutes for the maintenance man to arrive.  In the Ellen interview, he says he was on another floor and took <strong>the service elevator</strong> down to the 32nd floor.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/WxKMQXY">Location of Service Elevator</a></strong></p>

<p>Paddock&#39;s suite is where the man&#39;s thumb is in the picture.  The service elevator is across the hall from that room with the red dot in another wing  in that area that&#39;s twice as big as the rooms on either side of it.  it&#39;s a bank of 4 elevators, I believe.  So maintenance guy would have had to basically walk almost the entire length of two wings to get all the way down to the fire exit door that he was sent to check on.</p>

<p>The maintenance man says that when he rounded the corner from the Center Court (where the elevators that are used by guests are) and initially started walking down the 100 hallway, everything was quiet.  He says he was more than halfway down the hallway, when he hears what he initially thought was a jackhammer, but it sounded like it was coming from outside.  (Paddock shooting at the crowd?)  He then says that Campos yelled at him to take cover, and almost immediately after that shots started coming down the hallway.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m thinking that if there were shots fired down the hallway, it would have been on two separate occasions.</p>

<p>Another thing I find puzzling is why did it take until October 11th - 10 days after the shooting - before we ever heard about this maintenance man?  He wasn&#39;t mentioned in the initial timeline given on October 4th, and he wasn&#39;t mentioned in the second timeline given on October 9th.</p>

<p>And while we&#39;re on the subject of discrepancies, Sheriff Lombardo appears to have two different reasons about why the initial check-in date of September 28th was used rather than the 25th.</p>

<p>On October 10th, he tells the <strong><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/sheriff-shares-new-details-about-las-vegas-shooting-investigation/">Las Vegas Journal Review:</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://archive.is/7oxGm">Archived link</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paddock, a video poker player, checked in to Mandalay Bay on Sept. 25 — three days earlier than initially reported.</p>

<p>Lombardo said Paddock <strong>spent those first three days in a separate room</strong>, and the hotel provided that room free of charge for unknown reasons. Paddock spent the <strong>remaining days in the corner suite</strong> where he staged his attack, and he paid for the suite himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“We’ve learned that there’s a difference of comp days versus personal pay days,” Lombardo said. “We were going off the personal pay days.”</p>

<p>First three days would have been the 25th, 26, and 27th.  Then he allegedly moved to the Suite (32-135) on the 28th.  Yet we have that room service receipt from** September 27th** and the receipt shows him in <strong>32-135.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://cdn.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/server-two-people-431x600.jpg">Top of room service receipt showing date and room number (table number)</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DLRzNztUMAA_n7K.jpg">Bottom of room service receipt showing Stephen Paddock as the guest in that room</a></strong></p>

<p>From his press conference of October 13 at the <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/2Gs9hIufmAo?t=5m47s">5:47 mark:</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dates of the 25th versus the 28th.  This was not breaking news no matter who believed it to be so.  We were aware of the discrepancy of the 28th versus the 25th in the early parts of this investigation. What we weren&#39;t aware of is why the date of the 28th was utilized in the early portion of this as I was provided this as part of the person registered in the suspect&#39;s room.  We have come to learn that the suspect <strong>did occupy the room on the 25th</strong> and the situation on how the room was compensated or paid for had changed and the name as part of the registration had changed on the 28th to include Mary Lou Danley.  So that was the confusion associated with that no matter what the perception is whether we were being non-transparent or attempting to be subversive is false.  I was acting on the information at the time I was provided it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So he makes it sound like Paddock was in <strong>the suite</strong> for the entire time he was there.</p>

<p>This story just has so many holes in it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just waiting for Timeline 4.0.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im suspecting lately this was something along the lines of operation fast and furious 2.0. what if this was an arm&#39;s deal that paddock had happened to come accross somehow. Jesus campo is cartel and the FBI were dealing arms. Could this be why paddock had barricaded himself in to his room as they were after him to eliminate a witness? If so what is the reason for the shootings? </p>

<p>Basically, maintenance guy calls in the shots fired, like they haven&#39;t been called in, and makes no mention of Campos or if him being shot. That directly conflicts with anything they&#39;ve said to the effect of &quot;Campos warned me and I took cover&quot;. Sounds like the guy from Ellen to me at least. Uploaded on the 11th.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maintenance guy sure sounded calm.  I didn&#39;t really hear any gunshots in the video.  I wonder if there was more to the call that they just didn&#39;t play?  Why was it only released on the 11th?  Who&#39;s to say this call wasn&#39;t recorded <strong>after</strong> the day of the shooting?  If they can release a call from the maintenance guy, why can&#39;t they release any of the calls allegedly made by Campos?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All valid questions I&#39;d say, although with the recent news of MGM likely trying to control Campos to reduce liability from lawsuits, I highly doubt they&#39;d manufacture fake evidence and release it to the public.</p>

<p>Although I&#39;m sure they&#39;re omit truth, and bend truth to save money, it would only hurt them immensely if they lied in a big way, and it would absolutely murder them if they fabricated evidence.</p>

<p>They&#39;re the only party that&#39;s motivated to be honest about what they do say (motivated by money), and I think what they don&#39;t say is evidence in itself, hence why haven&#39;t we heard Campos call it in?</p>

<p>The better question, as you&#39;ve pointed out multiple times, Campos was the one reported to call it in numerous times by police, he supposedly warned the maintenance guy right away, saving his life.. why do we have audio that contradicts all of that?</p>

<p>This just makes everything else not add up even more.</p>

<p>That video doesn&#39;t seem to add anything? I&#39;m confused why in that video the reporter isn&#39;t asking &quot;why is the maintenance guy reporting it if the security guard already has?&quot; It just seems like they&#39;re incapable of realizing questions worth asking.</p>

<p>No because fire escape doors are meant to be closed when not in use.  They&#39;re just not meant to be bolted shut.  I don&#39;t think the alarm system had a way to distinguish a closed fire exit door with a fire exit door that was bolted shut.</p>
