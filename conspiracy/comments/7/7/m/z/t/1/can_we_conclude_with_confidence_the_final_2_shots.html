       What Armaedus said has nothing to do with grammar.

       You cannot conclude this but you can assume it quit reasonably, given the evidence. However there are also other legitimate assumptions, which means there is no conclusion.

       Conjecture on my part, but I think Campos was more involved in something... but I think it happened before the shooting started.  I would really question if Campos got shot at all.  He's had no surgery, has he (maybe I missed that)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally it was thought he was shot in the right thigh.  During the Ellen thing he looked down at his left leg, said he pulled up his pants, and saw blood.  If I got shot in the thigh, and the blood was at my ankle, I'd be in a bigger hurry to get it taken care of.

       Yea, that never happened.  There's no proof of that at all.  It's an extraordinary claim that remains unsupported.  Crisis actors and gofundme pages worth millions and millions of dollars is what we see everywhere with this Capstone Exercise.

       No. There is plenty of proof you just choose not to believe it. Prove no one died. Tell the families, friends, doctors, nurses, EMTs etc.that no one died. Prove that any of the people who were shot dead are still alive. You can't because you are wrong. You can't give a plausible reason that this would be a hoax. Not one. False flag...maybe but hoax no.

       No, you tell the victims they aren't real. Or provided some proof that there were in fact crisis actors. You can't. Sandy Hook didn't show any video or photos and for that reason it was called a hoax. Vegas has phone videos of people bleeding and dying and running for their life but hey those are just actors. Lawsuits have been filed unlike Sandy Hook. There is a paper trail linking this guy to guns. You saw a pic of his dead body. And the most telling thing...LE can't get there story straight...things that are planned and set up usually have a back story ready to go. Point is, no matter what proof is put in your face your delusions will find a way to discredit it.

       Smiles and giggles from those that lived. I'm sure they are happy to be alive. Being happy for a few moments doesn't tell their overall state of mind. Gofundme pages...yeah I hope so because they just got a shit ton of unexpected medical bills. But again...you haven't given any solid proof that no one died. All you are speaking on is those who lived. Nor have you addressed the points that were laid out for you to consider. I have no real idea about Sandy Hook...I honestly think that was a false flag. But Vegas...no Vegas happened and tptb are dumb founded by it. You keep disrespecting the people who were killed and injured. I honestly hope that one day you get the balls to say it to one of the survivors face that they are lying. I'm going to guess that you are too big of a coward to do so.  Explain the lawsuits...how do crisis actors file lawsuits as if they are a victim...I will wait

       Yea, I'm familiar with that old dead yarn about not questioning the official narrative because it's "disrespectful to the victims".  What's actually disrespectful is telling people they can't question government anymore.  It's beyond disrespectful to every soldier who bled and died for our independence, liberty and freedom.

       No proof would be good enough for some of you who have nothing better to do than sit around and call everything a conspiracy. I know 100% people died. You can't prove they didn't. You seen video with your own eyes and still spout bs. Like I said...go to Vegas... Tell a doc or nurse that...or a survivor. You want to stand by ur view so bad.. Go get proof.

       You are extremely obtuse. If you only knew how stupid you look saying this dumb shit to people who actually know people died. I feel sorry for you and your lack of deductive reasoning and logic skills. Convo over. Get back at me if you ever get the balls to tell a survivor they are lying. Better hope it isn't the ones I know.

       Prob so. Because any person with half a brain wouldn't say the say shit these people do. Don't believe people died? That's your right...but don't belittle the ones that think different or know different. After all, the ones who THINK no one died...that's all it is..a THOUGHT they have zero proof of that.

       We could "conclude" many things but they are still just an assumption. Is it fair to assume that Jesus was involved just because he was on that floor? I don't think so. He was SENT to that floor...he didn't just wonder there on his own. I doubt MB would cover his ass and say he was security for them if he wasn't. I'm sure the times are logged as to when they sent him to that floor. It is a more fair assumption that the last shots heard were Paddock killing himself. Had Jesus shot himself in the leg it would have been at a very close range and I'm pretty certain the docs and cops would be able to tell that. The maintenance guy was there for the shooting of the crowd so that kinda rules this idea out.

       I think it is logical to assume that whomever shot Campos, wasn't a mass murderer.    A mass murderer would have murdered Campos.  Not shot him in the leg and let him limp away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assume you are a mass murderer.  You are waiting anxiously in your room, ready to begin your massacre.     You see from your hidden camera footage, a hapless security guard milling about outside your room.  You grab your weapon, and fire at the guard through the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you check your footage, and see that you did not kill the guard.   Your 200 rounds only struck him in the leg.  He's moving, breathing, running away perhaps?  What do you do?  Do you just say "screw him" , wait 6 minutes, or 40 seconds (whichever story you believe at this point)  and start firing on the crowd?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you open your door, chase the security guard down, and fire a kill shot at close range, eliminating any chance of interference with your plan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem I have with Jesus Campos' injury stems from the photos released of the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely geeked out and enlarged the photo.  It's taken from the outside of the room.   The door is a double french door.  The left door panel has been removed from the door frame.  It is placed on the floor, sideways or horizontally, inside the suite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top of the door is visible through the open door frame, and the bottom is obscured.  I determined that it was the top of the door, by studying the pattern of the inset trim frame design. Each door has two inset frames.  The bottom does not reach the door handle -- and by most construction standards, door handles are installed anywhere from 34" to 48" above the floor. The visible inset trim frame appears longer than 34".  So, logically, it must be the top inset panel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right door has no visible gunshot damage.  The left has 10 holes that appear to be bullet entry holes, all the same size.  And it was implied that this was the door Paddock shot through at Campos.
      </p>
      <p>
       This damage does not illustrate a "spray" of 200 bullets IMO.  10 holes in one panel of a double, French door,  is more in line with single shots fired in succession.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, given this, Paddock shot through the left door,  10 bullets entering the top inset trim panel.  If  the bullet holes are in the top part of this inset panel, then he fired from his shoulder.  If the bullet holes are at the bottom part of this upper trim panel, then Paddock fired from waist height.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we assume that bullets arc up then proceed forward at downward trajectory, what are the chances of only 1 of 200 bullets hitting a short man in the thigh?
      </p>
      <p>
       For a frame of reference, I read somewhere that the downward trajectory of an AK47 is only 1.24 inches if the bullet travels 125 yards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to find a map to scale to measure the hallway -- and the closest I came was a satellite map posted by the LA Times.  Based on that, I measured the entire length of the hallway from the suite door to the end before it bends in the other direction to be around 360 feet or the length of a football field.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he used an AK47 (again, not saying he did, this is just giving me a concept)  and Campos was at the end of the hallway -- the downward trajectory would be around two feet from the line of fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judging from photos, Campos is short (in every photo of him standing, he is the shortest person).   And he's overweight which implies that he likely wasn't running as fast as a fit man.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Paddock, who is described a tall man -- held a rifle at his shoulder (I think this would be more natural than waist height) ,  and shot down a hallway at a short non-athletic man taken by surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       And out of 200 alleged bullets, one hits him in the right thigh.   So is it possible for a tall man to hold a gun at his shoulder, and shoot down a hall, with a two foot downward trajectory if Campos made it to the end of the hall or 360 feet,  and hit the short stocky Campos in the leg.  I guess.  But it seems that it would hit the guy in the back. Frankly, it seems like it would have hit Campos in the HEAD or chest within a few feet of the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       And per the Sheriff, the bullet was not removed from Campos' leg.  Why?  Is there any explanation of that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does Mandalay arm it's security officers?  It would not make much sense NOT to provide a handgun to a security officer in Vegas.  Did he return fire?  What type of gun was he carrying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I not see evidence markers in the hallway?  In the photo of the food cart outside the adjoining room, I see bullets on the carpet, wood damage likely from SWAT breaking the door frame.  But no evidence markers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the photos of the hallway, two officers are walking down it, there is no damage to walls, no evidence markers.  And I'm assuming these  all scene photos were taken at the same time.  There is an evidence tag no. 19 next to a rifle on a bipod visible inside the room from the doorway -- so they had tagged evidence prior to taking photos.   Isn't that the standard procedure to preserve the evidence, chain of custody etc.  Tag it, inventory it, photograph it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, that bipod raises another interesting problem IMO.  Are they suggesting that Paddock shot Campos through the door with a weapon mounted a bipod placed on the floor?  Why would he do that?  Why would he need stability or even a bump stock ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Schuck's statements on Ellen are a bit troubling to me.  He credits Campos with saving his life, right?  He stumbled upon the injured Campos and hid with him from the gunfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then maybe he should explain the audio recording wherein he alerts security of the gunfire.  He did not mention an injured security officer.  Why would that be omitted?  Wouldn't that be the FIRST thing a person would say after informing them of gunfire -- "I have officer Campos here.  He's injured.  He needs an EMT."
       <br/>
       Schuck tells the dispatcher to call "the police."  I don't think that's logical.
