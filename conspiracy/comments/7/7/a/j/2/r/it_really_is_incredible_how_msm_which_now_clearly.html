    <div class="md"><p>Never said Reddit had a stronger impact than other news sources, merely lumping Reddit in with the rest of the media suspects. If you don&#39;t think the lack of mention of the facts contained within the Hill article from ANY high ranking news org besides FOX (which doesnt give them a pass, theyre still generally fake news) is disturbing I implore you to change your definition. Doesn&#39;t mean Trump isn&#39;t colluding to say this is a bombshell of a story; why wont they report it?</p>

<p>The fact that the MSM mostly shunned it ought to tell you something. </p>

<p>Did you miss this part?  It looks like the bribery investigations were treated as a separate operation from the sale of the Canadian firm, Uraniumm one to the Russians. </p>

<p>Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, you may believe t_d is a reputable source, but it is beyond any doubt that there&#39;s foreign influences that have taken over that sub a long time ago. It&#39;s literally a propaganda machine.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the reason you see these two places where this is being pushed so heavily.. they&#39;ve figured out that this sub has enough people that will accept things that aren&#39;t fact based. The one subreddit that&#39;s the easiest to influence.</p>

<p>I think that there&#39;s plenty of fine people here that really are interested in the truth, but those people aren&#39;t willing to accept anything truth.</p>

<p>Your very argument &quot;why aren&#39;t anyone else talking about this&quot; is very obvious to people that are even a little bit willing to be skeptical.. The only reason it is important, is because people are telling you it&#39;s important.</p>

<p>The very source being the Donald, where <em>everything</em> is to attack, attack, attack. The media is bad, liberals are mentally ill.. there&#39;s not a Shred of positivity that comes out of that sub, besides successful attacks. And anything that makes them or Trump look good.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no natural grassroots movement there. They literally not upvote anything they want to be seen, and the only things that get upvoted above 2-4k upvotes, actually has something actual humans agree with.</p>

<p>This sub and many others with millions more users simply don&#39;t have 1/10th the number of posts that reach that high of a number of upvotes.</p>

<p>So unless it has a large number of unemployed people that decided it&#39;s their job to get certain posts to the front page daily.. it&#39;s obvious that there&#39;s forces at work there, and even here, to try to influence how people think.</p>

<p>Be more skeptical, be less likely to just accept something as fact. Don&#39;t let them prove this sub is full of easily manipulated people. That&#39;s how they got their stranglehold. People that are far too willing to grab onto anything that attacks, attacks, attacks.</p>
