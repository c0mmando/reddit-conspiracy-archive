        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This LV shooting is the most widespread event where people from a broad demographic are doubting the official story.</p>

<p>Maybe the social engineers are panicked that the &quot;center must hold&quot; which in this case is moms and aunties.  So they put Campos on Ellen to put them at ease with a trusted authority figure for their demographic.</p>

<p>Weird he was on frickin&#39; Ellen.  It makes no sense except from the perspective I just laid out.</p>

<p>Which is just more circumstantial evidence of how intense the information control systems are in American and how weak the law enforcement ability is when you run foul of Gestapo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MGM likely so worried about lawsuits that they asked Campos to do it this way. Coached them on how to do the interview and what the narrative needed to be. It makes sense - they face an insane amount of liability from this tragedy. Campos appearing on Ellen as his sole “interview” speaks more to their concern re lawsuits than it does some conspiracy. MGM pissing their pants rn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also weird that it was an unpaid interview followed by a check for 25 grand and It was the ONLY interview he was doing, as Ellen let us know. Even though he had several lined up before his &quot;disappearance&quot;.</p>

<p>DeGeneres hinted that Campos would not be giving any more interviews after appearing on her show, but that the appearance was unpaid.</p>

<p>“You&#39;re talking about it now and you&#39;re not going to talk about it again,” DeGeneres said</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weird in that such an interview on such a light-weight, day-time talk and gossip show wouldn&#39;t typically take place until long after the event and after all the dust had settled, not while it&#39;s still a major news event that there&#39;s no consistent time line or coherent explanation of the events leading up to, during, and right after it to the extent that they are or should be known.</p>

<p>It has the effect of pushing the event into the past as something that&#39;s over and done with and presenting Campos simply as another passing human interest story, innocent bystander becomes modest local hero, among all the rest these shows routinely chew up and spit out... here today... gone tomorrow and we can not only forget about Mr. Campos tomorrow but are even being strongly advised to do just that and leave the poor fellow alone hmmm?</p>

<p>It seems that the show is really is over folks, not that it ever really began or that we really saw much of anything for what was supposed to be such an incredibly big news story. </p>

<p>Shoddy, slipshod work by the cops and equally shoddy and slipshod work by the mainstream media that isn&#39;t important enough or powerful enough to hold the authorities feet to fire and quite frankly doesn&#39;t feel it has any responsibility to do that in the public&#39;s interest, either.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s what things have devolved and degenerated, or perhaps I should say De Generes-ated to. </p>

For the &quot;largest mass shooting&quot; in 2017 America in a high-end casino with thousands of cameras and where everyone has an iphone, we have less information and video evidence than columbine high school with their grainy, black and white vhs tapes!</p>
