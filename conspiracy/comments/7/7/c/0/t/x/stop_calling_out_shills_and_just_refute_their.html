       Other people read the comments. A shills purpose is to make it seem like they are discrediting your argument for other users reading through the comments and not engaging. They don't care what your saying. They are trying to frame your argument in a certain way for the audience for lack of a better term

       Actually, shills entire purpose is to convince someone that they are right. You may put effort into proving them wrong.. but they're still going to just put in effort somewhere else trying to convince someone of something.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also think that people accuse others of being a shill with very little evidence almost constantly. I'm relatively new, and if I disagree with anyone, my account age is used as the reason why I'm a "shill".
      </p>
      <p>
       Most times, I engaged them in discussion, not trying to prove myself right, or prove they're wrong.. and they apologized for the accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the easiest explanation of a shill, is posts per minute, or simply only putting in effort, repeatedly, for one specific topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have views they'll argue, but they aren't going to put in effort to make the same exact argument over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if it's a rant, but since I'm new, I feel like I'm unfairly targeted far too much, when it's clear I will comment on anything, I don't have one thing I give a particular shit about.

       As someone who has spent countless times arguing with these people it's just best to ignore them. It is fun to just shit on them. If you use logic they're just going to spread out the debate, forcing you to respond while getting no where.

       The one useful thing about engaging them is that if you keep your cool and draw it out for long enough, they run out of cue cards, get frustrated and tend to start lashing out- that's when they start breaking rules and get banned. Of course they just come back with a new UN, but it's still satisfying in the short term.

       i agree with all the sentiments in this thread, but i think OP is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can use the shill-presented opportunity to provide enough examples of their shilly tactics for other readers to learn their patterns.  this exposes a set of actors much larger than the shill themselves - it exposes classes of actors.  and the lessons learned will apply forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       secondly you can waste their time.
      </p>
      <p>
       thirdly, the shill ain't really gonna improve their game.  it's not in the nature of mercenaries to be as committed to single-minded on things as the "nutter".  that's not their function.  their function is disinfo and discrediting.  they're sent in as tactical weapons.  so they'll never be as strong on a subject.  this gives anyone diligent enough with free practice and education in how the shill operates.  basically you can use engaging the shill as practice.  this is actually pretty enlightening as you'll realize things that the shill's behaviour gives away - which will open doors or other avenues with which to press the buttons of the shill machine - that which directs the shills.

       That defeats the point of shills, if you could counter someone's argument, you wouldn't attack the source.

       They play dumb as fuck, though. They'll try and drag the comment chains out as long as possible to derail the discussion, all the while throwing out bullshit logical fallacies.

       A shill will move the goalpost, gaslight, and keep you running around in a circle banging your head against the wall.

       They want you to engage so that they can wipe your energy.  Do not engage with them.  Poke some fun If you like, but don't try to discuss things or refute or spend one second giving them links.  Your energy is needed engaging with real people, not robots.

       Other people read the comments. A shills purpose is to make it seem like they are discrediting your argument for other users reading through the comments and not engaging. They don't care what your saying. They are trying to frame your argument in a certain way for the audience for lack of a better term
