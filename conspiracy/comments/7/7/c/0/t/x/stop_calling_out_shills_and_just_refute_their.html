    <div class="md"><p>Actually, shills entire purpose is to convince someone that they are right. You may put effort into proving them wrong.. but they&#39;re still going to just put in effort somewhere else trying to convince someone of something.</p>

<p>But I also think that people accuse others of being a shill with very little evidence almost constantly. I&#39;m relatively new, and if I disagree with anyone, my account age is used as the reason why I&#39;m a &quot;shill&quot;.</p>

<p>Most times, I engaged them in discussion, not trying to prove myself right, or prove they&#39;re wrong.. and they apologized for the accusation.</p>

<p>I think the easiest explanation of a shill, is posts per minute, or simply only putting in effort, repeatedly, for one specific topic.</p>

<p>People have views they&#39;ll argue, but they aren&#39;t going to put in effort to make the same exact argument over and over.</p>

<p>Sorry if it&#39;s a rant, but since I&#39;m new, I feel like I&#39;m unfairly targeted far too much, when it&#39;s clear I will comment on anything, I don&#39;t have one thing I give a particular shit about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with all the sentiments in this thread, but i think OP is correct.  </p>

<p>you can use the shill-presented opportunity to provide enough examples of their shilly tactics for other readers to learn their patterns.  this exposes a set of actors much larger than the shill themselves - it exposes classes of actors.  and the lessons learned will apply forever.  </p>

<p>secondly you can waste their time.    </p>

<p>thirdly, the shill ain&#39;t really gonna improve their game.  it&#39;s not in the nature of mercenaries to be as committed to single-minded on things as the &quot;nutter&quot;.  that&#39;s not their function.  their function is disinfo and discrediting.  they&#39;re sent in as tactical weapons.  so they&#39;ll never be as strong on a subject.  this gives anyone diligent enough with free practice and education in how the shill operates.  basically you can use engaging the shill as practice.  this is actually pretty enlightening as you&#39;ll realize things that the shill&#39;s behaviour gives away - which will open doors or other avenues with which to press the buttons of the shill machine - that which directs the shills.  </p>
