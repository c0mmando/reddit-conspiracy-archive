        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are very often drills in the exact or very close proximity to the &#39;live&#39; event in both time and space, and the scenario being acted out in the drill is always the exact same or very similar scenario that actually ends up happening. Statistically speaking, this is no coincidence. So what is going on and why don&#39;t more people know about this?</p>

<p>Congresswoman questions Rumsfeld about the war games that were taking place on 9/11 at the same time as the attack (if you go back to the beginning of the video you&#39;ll see her asking some other pertinent questions that the American people forgot about, like the major DoD contractor Dyncorp trafficking in women &amp; children, and the Pentagon being unable to account for more than $3 trillion between 1999-2000): <a href="https://youtu.be/S_UJweReNTw?t=6m5s">https://youtu.be/S_UJweReNTw?t=6m5s</a></p>

<p>Aurora Dark Knight massacre &#39;eerie coincidence&#39; drill about same situation taking place on the same day: <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2012/07/20/real-life-shooting-imitates-training-exercise-at-parker-medical-school/">http://www.denverpost.com/2012/07/20/real-life-shooting-imitates-training-exercise-at-parker-medical-school/</a></p>

<p>There are similar drills that take place at the same time as most of these attacks. The &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; is that drills help them get attackers/bombs into place resulting confusion helps them to pull it off. Presumably they use it for footage also. I don&#39;t know, but these can&#39;t ALL be coincidences, and if these events aren&#39;t &#39;inside jobs&#39; or &#39;false flags&#39; or &#39;hoaxes&#39; then then why the hell hasn&#39;t this been reported on in the mainstream in terms of the number of these coincidences, and an investigation conducted into WHY so many terror attacks or mass shootings involve &#39;spooky coincidence drills&#39;?</p>

<p>Insight into this and the way they might do it can be found in the operation northwoods document: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5rBc4GS06s&amp;amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5rBc4GS06s&amp;amp;t=2s</a></p>

<p>This video shows questioning of norad and the faa about their incompetence on 9/11 and shows how the confusion and delays aid the attackers: <a href="https://youtu.be/wrD8VbAcB2A">https://youtu.be/wrD8VbAcB2A</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve often wondered the exact same thing! This has to be more than coincidence!, For whatever reason, I have been letting it go, thinking that it must have been discussed and explained before, and that I must have missed those conversations. That never satisfied me and so I’m really glad you brought it up, and am looking forward to reading some rational, albeit conspiratorial, explanations.</p>
