    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       Just got finished watching the Jesus Campos interview,
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/F7gj1FoRIfE">
        https://youtu.be/F7gj1FoRIfE
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       and I have some quick questions that other people might have answers to
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Campos was called to check on a door that was left open.  When he approached the door on the 32nd floor, it wouldn't open.  So, where is the open door he was supposed to check on?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) @ 1:28 - Does the fact that Ellen just casually reachs back for detailed map of the hotel floor and a pointer strike anyone else as odd. Also humorous.  But odd?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) @ 2:18 - Campos says that he mistook gunfire for drilling sounds.  That would mean Stephen Paddock had started firing out the window before Paddock shot Campos.  But, that's a direct contradition of the (current) timeline?  Also, assuming Paddock was firing a weapon, how could he hear the sound of a door slam outside his hotel room over the sound of gunfire?
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Supposedly Paddock had a camera outside of his room.  Wouldn't that tip him off more than a slamming door?  Also, where was Paddock receiving that video feed, did he have a laptop or computer set up in the room?  And does Campos make any mention of the cart outside Paddock's room?
      </p>
      <p>
       5) @ 3:12 - Campos called in on his radio that shots had been fired, but he didn't tell anyone he had been shot so he could clear radio traffic so they could coordinate the rest of the call.  What in God's Holy Name is he blathering about?
      </p>
      <p>
       6) @ 3:25 - Paddock supposedly shot through the door at Campos.  Does that mean Campos never had eyes on the shooter?  Campos wouldn't be able to verify Paddock as the actual shooter?
      </p>
      <p>
       7) Is anyone else bothered that Jesus Campos and Stephen Schuck have eerily similar suits on?
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Did Stephen Schuck not hear any of rounds that were reportedly fired at Campos?
      </p>
      <p>
       9) @ 4:58 - Somebody find that guest who Campos told to get back in her room, I want to see an interview with her!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's my thoughts and questions.

       Re #5. What was he clearing the radio traffic for if there was 6 full minutes between him being shot and the mass shooting? Is he psychic?

       To discuss what course of action to take about SHOTS FIRED BEING REPORTED IN THEIR HOTEL WHICH HE CLEARLY STATES HE REPORTED.

       I don't understand why you all are acting like one of their security guards reporting someone is shooting a gun is a non event.  Really?

      </p>
      <p>
       It was a room door, dumbass.  Quit misconstruing facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) @ 1:28 - Does the fact that Ellen just casually reachs back for detailed map of the hotel floor and a pointer strike anyone else as odd. Also humorous.  But odd?
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely weird but not surprising.  Ellen is a sociopath media puppet, what do you expect?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) @ 2:18 - Campos says that he mistook gunfire for drilling sounds.  That would mean Stephen Paddock had started firing out the window before Paddock shot Campos.  But, that's a direct contradition of the (current) timeline?  Also, assuming Paddock was firing a weapon, how could he hear the sound of a door slam outside his hotel room over the sound of gunfire?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a complete lie.  Campos mistook the gun being fired with the intent to kill him as drilling sounds.  Paddock was shooting at him.  I have no idea what screws are loose in your head that you can come to the conclusion he must've been firing elsewhere when Campos clearly states he was being shot at and mistook that for drilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Supposedly Paddock had a camera outside of his room.  Wouldn't that tip him off more than a slamming door?  Also, where was Paddock receiving that video feed, did he have a laptop or computer set up in the room?  And does Campos make any mention of the cart outside Paddock's room?
      </p>
      <p>
       Campos wasn't aware of the cameras.  He isn't a psychic.  He's explaining his thought process during the event.  Not being aware of the cameras he assumed the only logical thing, that the door slamming must've alerted paddock.  Obviously he assumed wrong because he wasn't fully aware of what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) @ 3:25 - Paddock supposedly shot through the door at Campos.  Does that mean Campos never had eyes on the shooter?  Campos wouldn't be able to verify Paddock as the actual shooter?
      </p>
      <p>
       What point are you trying to make with this?  No one's trying to use Campos as an eye witness to point the finger at paddock.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) Is anyone else bothered that Jesus Campos and Stephen Schuck have eerily similar suits on?
      </p>
      <p>
       No.
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Did Stephen Schuck not hear any of rounds that were reportedly fired at Campos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't mention it.

         He said he gets notifications about a door being ajar doesn't mention checking any door ajar and after the stairwell/fire exit check calls it in and proceeds to leave, no mention of checking a door that is ajar only the stairwell with a metal bracket holding it.

         He said as he was leaving the stairwell area and he heard what he took to be "drilling sounds". Halfway down the hallway is when he says he heard Rapid gun fire." Two different incidents.

         No he didn't mention it he only vaguely says he could feel pressure from bullets behind his head. Shuck also said he heard what he thought was a jack hammer "I believe outside it wasn't in the hallway yet."
