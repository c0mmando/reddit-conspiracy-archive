It seems like a gigantic letdown but did we do that to ourselves by hyping ourselves up over a tweet that Assange himself never stated was significant? Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never been able to shake the feeling from last October. Some believe it is spreading disinfo, but I genuinely don&#39;t know, and haven&#39;t known since then, whether Wikileaks is still on the side of the People or has been totally co-opted. Things are still...different...no more PGP signature, when before that was a usual occurrence. Then Wikileaks teased us for months about how we wanted proof of life, the mods changed at r/Wikileaks and censorship on the topic began, which is when r/whereisassange was formed, and finally his first appearance was on...Hannity? Nothing made sense then and nothing makes sense now. I hope and pray the man who says he is Assange is indeed him, but there is grave doubt deep in my soul. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great points. And Assange opened up a Twitter account after the disappearance/blackout and sometimes it can feel like more of a bot then an actual person on the other end. Maybe his family was threatened? He&#39;s being blackmailed?</p>

<p>If the CIA is as evil as they are portrayed on this subreddit then why wouldn&#39;t they go after his family in order to get to him and blackmail him? Or even Russian intelligence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember all of the stuff that happened. The story I&#39;ve come to be optimistic about, and that fits the timeline, is that:</p>

<p>Assange WAS about to drop Part 3, And he DID get pulled out of the embassy, but not by who you think. Human tendency has a way of going to the worst case scenario, but...I think Assange was pulled by white hats in the Intel community, maybe not the US intel community. Maybe MI6 pulled him. But they did it because there was an attack planned on him and they had to pull him before he was killed. </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because they needed him to help take down the deep state. They did it to help Trump lay breadcrumbs and weave a story so the entire US didn&#39;t go to war with itself. </p>

<p>I believe this is why he can somehow &quot;see into the future,&quot; or say he was wiretapped months before it was publicly disclosed that he actually HAD.</p>

<p>This explains why Assange can&#39;t be seen frequently, especially at first - he&#39;s probably in protected custody. That&#39;s why Hannity was able to &quot;fly to London&quot; to interview him, as with John Pilger. I haven&#39;t quite figured out the distorted video in the interviews, though. This also explains why WikiLeaks began leaking Vault 7. I think Trump has Assange working for him in exchange for a pardon. </p>

<p>This also explains the strange phone call last year, where some anon called the embassy and published the audio on YouTube. The woman at the embassy said she wasn&#39;t allowed to talk about it. This could mean 1) he was there and shut up, 2) someone bad took him, or 3) someone GOOD took him.</p>

<p>This would also explain why Embassy Cat doesn&#39;t post as much, but isn&#39;t completely gone. </p>

<p>And I think things are going to be exposed this weekend. </p>

<p>If you read this, Mr. Assange, please know that we are with you. </p>

<p>Take those fucking bastards down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kind of where i have arrived too...i really want this to be true but the odds are so miniscule. Even so, its about the only explanation that makes sense for all the other weird stuff going on. The bread crumbs (to include Sessions today saying he can&#39;t comment on an open investigation), LV shit shown, Uranium One, Weinstein, new Huma emails, DOJ\Potus remaining mum, Bannon &amp; Girka moving back into media, Assaunge\Hannity...started with assaunge&#39;s hash, then coordinated media stories/coverage, now congress is beating the drums...the quietness of Trump and Sessions is the real kicker tho. You know there not idiots, they&#39;re strategists, and this whole movement we&#39;re seeing right now smacks of a well thought out and coordinated operation. ...at least i hope it is.</p>
