<p>So...either Paddock didn&#39;t have a plan at all, more people working in the hotel room fled, or everything was moved (or staged) before the crime scene photos were taken. What&#39;s most likely here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right. After Paddock fired hundreds of rounds, striking about 600 people he moved the weapons all round the room, scattered a few shell casings here and there and then shot himself in the stomach and then shot himself in the mouth. Got it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said “striking about 600 people”</p>

<p>That’s what my comment is referring to. 600 people were not shot. More than likely, most injuries occurred from being trampled. </p>

<p>That&#39;s complete bullshit. There&#39;s as yet no complete list of injuries sustained from simple bullet wounds. We know all the area hospitals were overflowing with the injured and the calls for blood came out. You can quibble that I overstate the number of bullet wounds. Big deal. It&#39;s quibbling. </p>

<p>The guy was firing automatic weapons into crowds of people for ten minutes. Then add the accounts of eye witnesses in other hotels who also were shot at. Unless you want to call all of them liars as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a little tid bit. Sheriff Lombardo admitted to .308s in his room. Light machine guns like the m60 or the m240(which fires at 600rpm and sounds identical to the one from the video) both fire 7.62x51. 7.62x51 is interchangeable with .308. Also AR15s when made fully auto have a ROF of 800rpm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I read and heard from that 60 mins interview he had guns lined up around the room against walls. I am reading Mike Detty&#39;s book right now on his gun dealings with the FBI as a CI. When he would have people connected to the cartels coming to his house for larger purchases, he would line the guns up around his living room against the wall. This isn&#39;t the absolute proof that he was a gun dealer and this was a deal gone wrong, but I wouldn&#39;t rule that scenario out still. </p>

<p>It makes no sense that if he had &quot;2 shooting platforms&quot; in seperate rooms and was firing on full auto or with a slide fire, why wouldn&#39;t he keep the guns close by for ease of access. If his goal was to kill as many as possible why waste time running across the room to grab a neatly placed gun rather than picking another one up from by your feet. This isn&#39;t rocket science. Its just common sense. Maybe there was areason for it.  But none that I can logistically think of. </p>
