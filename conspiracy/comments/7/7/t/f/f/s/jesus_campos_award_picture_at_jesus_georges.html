        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The picture of Jesus Campos receiving an award at the Jean Georges Steakhouse is real. There are two private dining rooms with two different themes. Whomever is trying to make this into an issue picked the wrong dining room for comparison.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the original image that is being claimed to be a fake. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/4S3GB5c.jpg">Jesus Campos Award </a></p>

<p>If you go to the Jean Georges Steakhouse website there is a virtual tour that can be seen which allows you to look at the whole restaurant. I used the virtual tour to get the following pictures.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/L2k62N3.jpg">The Background Still Exists </a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/2VTBuK2.jpg">So Does The Chandelier</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s been said that the background and <del>chandler</del> chandelier shown in the Campos award picture do not exist after the recent renovation. That simply isn&#39;t true.</p>

<p>By taking the virtual tour of the restaurant you can prove this for yourself.</p>

<p>Go to this website.
<a href="https://www.aria.com/en/restaurants/jean-georges-steakhouse.html#/Overview">https://www.aria.com/en/restaurants/jean-georges-steakhouse.html#/Overview</a></p>

<p>And find this picture in the images section. It&#39;s the 3rd in the rotation. Scroll down to almost the bottom of the page and find the image carousel.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/gV8Oj9J.jpg">Virtual Tour</a></p>

<p>Step through the images of the virtual tour and go into the entrance to the restaurant.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Q65Q1nl.jpg">Restaurant Entrance</a></p>

<p>Work your way past the bar. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/lUrP6vU.jpg">The Bar</a></p>

<p>Into the main restaurant. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/GG150vs.jpg">Main Restaurant</a></p>

<p>While standing at the first place inside the restaurant scroll the image to the left and right. You will see that there is two different private dining rooms. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/I4Ja35R.jpg">Private Dining Left Side</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/O6uzROL.jpg">Private Dining Right Side</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/gUJhoAX.jpg">Closeup of Private Dining Left Side</a></p>

<p>By moving inside the private dining room on the right side you will see the following. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/TBSdDJ4.jpg">Private Dining Right Side 1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/xNomrUN.jpg">Private Dining Right Side 2</a></p>

<p>For comparison this is the Private Dining room on the left. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/wJrCeN6.jpg">Private Dining room Left </a></p>

<p>There is usually a reasonable explanation of crazy ideas if you look in the right place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really understand how they thought that someone would put out such an obvious fake. There just has to be something wrong with the idea that the picture was taken in a room that doesn&#39;t exist anymore because the restaurant had been renovated. </p>

<p>They sure did make a big deal about it though...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Just as they refuse to understand that the chopper in the sky that night was a tour chopper. They swear it was shooting people. They don&#39;t use logic to actually think that if a chopper was shooting a lot more people would be dead...slaughtered in fact. They also have no explanation as to where this chopper went after it was supposedly done shooting the crowd...as if it just flew off into the night and the FAA never noticed a whole aircraft was just gone. Some people here can&#39;t form a complete thought from start to finish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah...alot of people here don&#39;t function in reality. They must have skipped all of the classes that taught deductive reasoning, logic and the ability to put puzzle pieces together. When working a theory it should be thought out from beginning to end. If you can&#39;t connect the dots in your theory... Your theory is bunk. People here tho? That twist whatever they see into proof that their idea is correct. I honestly wonder how the deal off the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t agree with &quot;If you can&#39;t connect the dots.. your theory is bunk.&quot; I made a comment last night, actually a paper I did on logic and a psychological explanation for why divergent thought is so important, you really should check it out.</p>

<p>Basic analogy would be to use math, the idea of solve for x. The more factors that are missing, the less likely there&#39;s an answer that can be found, sure. But like (more complex) math, the idea is to figure out what information can be isolated, to be able to work parts of the problem and narrow down what can&#39;t be known, or more importantly, be able to decide if it can&#39;t be known. This is how a lot of physics problems work.</p>

<p>The problem I see a lot of people show here is a lack of organization. Unorganized thought isn&#39;t going to help understand a problem, much less find the solution. They see Grand schemes and dismiss logical conclusions. If people tried a bit harder to ground themselves in reality, a lot more might happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the case of the helicopter that should have been put to bed rather easily. Every aircraft is accounted for when in the air...if there is an aircraft not cleared...it is going to get a warning to land and if not...bye bye birdie. It is absurd to even try to make a theory fit with the helicopter. What is the theory based on? The simple fact that the helicopter was in the air and had blinking lights. People ran with it without any further research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sheriff dismisses us all, and calls it conspiracy fantasy.. but I think he has a fair point. There&#39;s those of us that look at facts and follow evidence, use logic.. then there&#39;s those who look at facts, and use imagination and refute logic.</p>

<p>Sometimes imagination helps.. or maybe more like creative thought, brainstorming helps. But I think ultimately the imagination element is what leads to things like flat Earth people.</p>

<p>We all have to coexist in this sub, there&#39;s definitely a big push to get rid of the &quot;logical people&quot; I&#39;ve seen that made me question ever joining this sub. But this Las Vegas thing interested me enough, and I hope moderators aren&#39;t swayed by the people against logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a moderator issue. The people who publish these blogs &amp; create the YouTube videos have a financial incentive to create controversy. They&#39;re not going to definitively debunk an idea, it ends their traffic on that topic. They publish everything they can, no matter how ridiculous, and say, &quot;You decide!&quot; </p>

<p>The audience is a group of people who enjoy looking at this stuff. They&#39;re not all up to date on the latest haps, and they have fun sorting through this stuff, essentially &quot;panning for gold.&quot; They find something, they get excited, and they want to share. There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with that--after all, we don&#39;t all have the same information, and we&#39;ve not all been a party to every conversation. Some are more judicious than others in their fact-finding and pronouncements. lol. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a coordinated push to get rid of any type of person, though that is the result a lot of times. Half the community is always going to be less-skilled &amp; less educated on the topic than the other half, by definition. When you have a community this large, those folks drive the content. They keep upvoting the misleading blog posts &amp; videos. The community keeps growing. And the cycle never ends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Passengers are not allowed to video. But most tours did sell a video of the flight. So, I&#39;m sure they had one and im equally sure the police got to it pretty fast lol. We won&#39;t see that anymore than we will casino footage. Idk which company it was...there more than a few who offer those tours. You could inquire about the record of the flight. There is no valid reason to think that the chopper was anything other that a tour. They happen every night. The flashes on the chopper follow the correct pattern for alerting it was there. A helicopter attack in not logical. Way too close to the airport and way too many regulations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I researched something and made a discovery. I shared what I found here.</p>

<p>If you wanna see flashing lights from another night to convince you that tour helicopters follow a visual protocol for night landings in Las Vegas then I think you should look for them. If you find that they&#39;re the same as the contested video post what you find. If you find a video where a landing was made in the same place from the same angle and also at night that shows something different then post that.</p>

<p>Just tossing out a request for someone else to find a video showing what you want to see just doesn&#39;t seem right to me. Take a little initiative. Do something to contribute other than trying make someone else find a proof that probably exists but wouldn&#39;t be an easy Google search away from finding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I took an adversarial approach because you were asking for something that might be difficult to obtain. That&#39;s how this sub seems to work. Every time someone comes up with a reasonable answer the goalpost is moved. The evidence that was just provided that explains what happened just isn&#39;t good enough. Now they have to satisfy the new requirement to kill off a ridiculous theory.</p>

<p>They&#39;re absolutely desperate to get a second shooter into this. Putting one on a helicopter is just the latest attempt. If &quot;they&quot; can get the second shooter scenario to be believable then they have accomplished their goals.</p>

<p>Every single newsworthy mass casually event is spun into a conspiracy theory. Not 1 in 10, Not 1 in 20, every single one. That just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. There are plenty of nut jobs in the World. Regular serial killers may kill hundreds but they do is slowly and quietly. They don&#39;t get the attention of millions of people. Only mass casually events draw such attention.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it possible that there are people who have a reason to promote conspiracy theories? Maybe their just trolls and that&#39;s how they get their jollies. Thing is that they dupe real people into such things.</p>

<p>Flat Earth is a prime example. There are even websites and videos on YouTube supporting that nonsense. Why is all that there? Flat Earth is BULLSHIT. Promoting the idea is BULLSHIT and at least some people who claim to believe such nonsense are probably lying.</p>

<p>If Flat Earth is total BULLSHIT then doesn&#39;t it make sense that these whacky conspiracy theories claiming that each and every one of these mass casually events is also bullshit?</p>

<p>What is the Government&#39;s motive? Usually they claim it&#39;s about gun control. Doesn&#39;t that sound like bullshit? Do we really have much say in the laws that are passed or not passed. Look at the Republican healthcare bill. That would have kicked millions of people off of healthcare. It was a widely unpopular bill. It almost passed. It came down to one guy who just happened to have had cancer recently so he understood how important healthcare was to people.</p>

<p>There has to be a motive. If someone ran a false flag or created a hoax there just has to be reason that made all the murders worthwhile. Literally, A cause worth killing for. That&#39;s just not what we&#39;re seeing with the Las Vegas Shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me. A week or so ago there was an early morning conversation here where someone made the fake-because-remodeled claim. Some thoughtful folks worked together in that thread to discover that there are very recent pictures on random instagrams and whatnot showing the alleged &quot;old&quot; decor. I figured it was a settled issue.</p>

<p>A couple days later, the same claims surfaced, and got tons of attention. I was downvoted to oblivion &amp; called an undercover CIA agent and whatnot for stating it had already been considered &amp; debunked. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone discovered there are in fact two different rooms. That makes a lot of sense. It&#39;s good to have this all in one place. But it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if people don&#39;t want to hear it. The truth isn&#39;t always as sexy as we&#39;d like it to be. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a guy on YouTube, End Times something or other, who spent a week on the ground in Las Vegas &amp; giving periodic reports. I don&#39;t know anything about the guy, but he&#39;s called End Times something or other, so I figured he was at least a little bit crazy. But he was actually there, doing actual research, which I think that is great, so I kept up with him. </p>

<p>This guy went and talked to helicopter pilots. They explained how the choppers all fly the exact same pattern, how heavily trafficked that pattern is, and how it&#39;d be impossible, in their opinion, for any chopper to deviate from that pattern even a little bit. If they did, there&#39;d be another chopper just minutes behind that&#39;d be affected, and it&#39;d cascade down the chain. Everybody would know.</p>

<p>So this guy concluded that the helicopter theory is not at all plausible. Which is, IMHO, a reasonable and probably correct conclusion. And the blowback this guy got for it--my god--people wanted to tar and feather him for daring to say that he didn&#39;t think their pet theory was plausible. <em>He was there. He was talking to actual pilots. He had actual facts.</em> And no one wanted to hear it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that chopper deviated from the flight path it is because it was instructed to by air traffic control because of the shooting. Once the police were called to the shooting the airport would have been on immediate notice and would have acted accordingly. I don&#39;t think realize just how much damage a chopper attack would have caused. Nor do they take into account how loud that chopper would have been if close enough to shoot.

<p>There are helicopters flying around there quite a bit. Several companies offer tours to the Grand Canyon and lake Mead. There are also tours that just circle the city.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t taken one in Las Vegas but I did take one in NY. The tour follows a flight plan. It makes it&#39;s circuit over and over again. It&#39;s always within a very small deviation from the exact same path pretty much every time. The pilots are doing the same thing over and over again. Customers pay good money to see the sights as advertised and for the duration they paid for. The pilots have it down to a science.</p>

<p>Obviously, he had a motive. We just don&#39;t know what it was. Perhaps he wanted to be famous. Almost everyone knows his name at this point.</p>

<p>As for saying that he didn&#39;t do it I think the burden of proof on that is on your side.</p>

<p>As for no evidence that&#39;s a bold faced lie. There is an abundance of evidence. In fact there&#39;s even a picture of his corpse. If that&#39;s not enough I&#39;m not sure what to say.</p>

<p>Why is it that every single time there is a mass casually event that it&#39;s turned into a conspiracy theory? Seems to be that there is something wrong with that one.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the original theory is bunk, but I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re right about the virtual tour being post-renovation.</p>

<p>I explain in another comment that we can conclude that the &quot;Cutlery Chandelier&quot; was kept after the renovation:</p>

<hr/>

<p>A big problem with the original theory was that they mixed up the &quot;Boardroom&quot; table with the &quot;Chef&#39;s&quot; table. The OP of the theory showed the table with the cutlery chandelier (&quot;Chef&#39;s&quot; table) and compared it to a picture of the &quot;Boardroom&quot; table.</p>

<p>Whether it was pre- or post-renovation is kind of besides the point. Why?</p>

<p>Eater.com shows that the chandeliers <a href="https://vegas.eater.com/2017/3/24/15053880/jean-georges-steakhouse-renovation-aria">before</a> and <a href="https://vegas.eater.com/2017/7/14/15969768/jean-george-steakhouse-restaurant-remodel-aria-eater-inside">after</a> the renovation are the same.</p>

<p>Furthermore, assuming the virtual tour is <em>before</em> the renovation, we would also have to accept that the &quot;Boardroom&quot; also has the <em>same</em> chandelier as it does post-renovation (per the eater.com article above).</p>

<p>In other words, in order for the OP&#39;s theory of a time-traveling JC to make sense, we would have to believe that that the <strong>only</strong> chandelier changed in the renovation was in the &quot;Chef&#39;s&quot; table room.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure the OP of this thread is right about the virtual tour being after the renovation, but I&#39;m confident that the chandeliers would be the same before and after.</p>

<p>A whacky conspiracy theory like this is swallowed hook line and sinker by some people. How do they think that the picture happened in the first place? Was it a time machine?</p>

<p>I suppose the narrative &quot;they&quot; were trying to push was that it was totally faked. I started by trying to find that picture using Google reverse image search. I couldn&#39;t find any sources that were not conspiracy websites so I figured that I was on to something. Someone was nice enough to post a link to the original source so I changed strategies.

<p>if it helps provide any insight into a general consensus at all:</p>

<p>i was pretty suspicious of the whole &quot;this picture is old!&quot; conspiracy that&#39;s been going around. as you said, it&#39;s too obvious a thing to fuck up, right? i&#39;ve kind of just been ignoring this until it was no longer speculation.</p>

<p>and so i welcomed your post. but, at the end of the day, if you can&#39;t actually prove the tour is up to date, you&#39;re not actually proving anything. and so we are still speculating. and so i am still unsatisfied.</p>

<p>what you&#39;ve put together makes sense. it&#39;s thoughtful. and my gut tells me it&#39;s likely true. but unfortunately, your post doesn&#39;t really contain any more proof than the original posts you&#39;re arguing against.</p>

<p>I know, still not enough proof, right?</p>

<p>If the virtual tour is outdated then why did the original conspiracy theory use the exact same room picture as the room on the left? The room on the left is drastically different from the picture taken of Jesus Campos at the restaurant. Funny how it perfectly matches the room on the left.</p>

Technically for either side...which ever one can prove it was updated or prove that it wasn&#39;t. Rules of evidence. Read up on them. Being that we have no reason to say the website wasn&#39;t updated we can reasonable assume that it is. That reasoning fits more than trying to say that the picture is faked. Also, this picture is floating around on the internet...so, I would imagine that if it were old/fake that it would catch the eye of others. It isn&#39;t faith it is logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is sort of what triggered the theory in the first place, someone determined that the restaurant had a bunch of renovations completed in July. So that private room on the left used to have the same wallpaper as the one in the campos pic, but as you can see above it&#39;s been remodelled with some classy chic pallet wood. There&#39;s loads of pics available online from before the renovation, and it seems as though the chef&#39;s table where campos was sitting, that room must have been largely untouched.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A big problem with the original theory was that they mixed up the &quot;Boardroom&quot; table with the &quot;Chef&#39;s&quot; table. The OP of the theory showed the table with the cutlery chandelier (&quot;Chef&#39;s&quot; table) and compared it to a picture of the &quot;Boardroom&quot; table.</p>

<p>Whether it was pre- or post-renovation is kind of besides the point. Why?</p>

<p>Eater.com shows that the chandeliers <a href="https://vegas.eater.com/2017/3/24/15053880/jean-georges-steakhouse-renovation-aria">before</a> and <a href="https://vegas.eater.com/2017/7/14/15969768/jean-george-steakhouse-restaurant-remodel-aria-eater-inside">after</a> the renovation are the same.</p>

<p>Furthermore, assuming the virtual tour is <em>before</em> the renovation, we would also have to accept that the &quot;Boardroom&quot; also has the <em>same</em> chandelier as it does post-renovation (per the eater.com article above).</p>

<p>In other words, in order for the OP&#39;s theory to make sense, we would have to believe that that the <strong>only</strong> chandelier changed in the renovation was in the &quot;Chef&#39;s&quot; table.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure the OP of this thread is right about the virtual tour being after the renovation, but I&#39;m confident that the chandeliers would be the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not aware that anyone said that people can&#39;t have opinions. That is fine. However, if your idea is confronted with logical and real facts that prove it wrong..give it up and move on to the next. The problem is that people here don&#39;t like when someone challenges their theories with facts that don&#39;t support it. How can you tell everyone else to be awake when you are turning your eyes away from the facts presented to you? We all know Vegas was shady as fuck. But at the same time...throwing around all of these baseless ideas and not focusing on the facts isn&#39;t getting anyone anywhere. BTW I don&#39;t have a side kick. You guys only like people who go along with what you say even if you have no facts to support it. </p>

<p>I just want to get to the truth and try to put some of this to bed. I&#39;m fine with some conspiracy theories but not every single mass casually event can be a false flag. There has to be at least one where some nut case decided to make himself famous.</p>

<p>Most of the rest as far as I&#39;ve seen is crap like oh Jesus Campos is acting weird. Just because he&#39;s not exactly eager to be on TV and bombarded by reporters doesn&#39;t mean that he&#39;s covering up for a false flag. Maybe he&#39;s a guy who has self confidence issues and is really uncomfortable with all this publicity. Every picture I&#39;ve seen of him he&#39;s got a dead pan no emotion look on his face. He&#39;s naturally an unhappy person. Not all that unusual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t judge people on how they act in front of an audience, or after experiencing something crazy like Vegas shooting.  I judge the fact that he went on the fucking Ellen show.  To me, it was a way of getting a narrative out, to simple minded idiots, who could replay with &quot;no, he was on Ellen the other day and he said such and such happened&quot; when bringing up something wonky with his story.</p>

<p>To me too, I don&#39;t think really a whole lot of these &quot;lone wolf&#39;s&quot; act without FBI knowledge and support... not meaning the FBI literally has been a part of every mass shooting, or that they actually hire people in the FBI to go out and do them.  I mean a Mr. Big type scenario where the FBI &quot;accidently&quot; befriends some crazy nut job, lends their support to this person, whether it be encouraging, or getting access to something they may need.</p>

<p>Something I thought of is when I was younger, in the 80s and 90s, I remember hearing so many bombings and shootings at abortion clinics here... How often you ever hear about abortion clinics getting blown up or shot up nowadays?  It happens, but not that often.</p>

<p>What&#39;s up with all these mass shootings by people who just seem to &quot;lose it&quot; one day, or in the case of Paddock, planned the fuck out of it, with no military training, and acquiring the vast majority of his weapons, in the past year... so how much training could he have possibly been doing?  Along with gambling to pay the bills, when&#39;s he staking everything out?  </p>

<p>This entire incident is wacky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanted to weigh in on the abortion clinic things. Here in Ga. it is kinda weird...they are a bit hidden. You can drive by one and know that is what it is. Security is also super tight. Armed guards. Must have ID. No windows. No phones. No going in and out. And they are in all brick buildings too. And the person getting an abortion never actually lays eyes on the doctor. Not even once. You are either knocked out or he/she is hidden. Very odd but prob one of the safest places you can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what is the motive for the hoax?</p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been a motive provided as to why Paddock did this. If it were a hoax don&#39;t you think that they would have a script prepared that claims that he was motivated by something? After all, if &quot;they&quot; are just telling a story shouldn&#39;t Paddock&#39;s motivation support whatever they want?</p>

<p>What about Jesus Campos? Is he really the best man to be the spokesman of the hoax? Why pick an obvious introvert? I think casting really screwed up with that one. He was supposed to be the hero. He&#39;s not doing well in that job is he?</p>

<p>Is there actually anything other than someone claiming that something seems odd to them to support the hoax theory? After all, whoever is pushing the hoax narrative isn&#39;t really doing a very good job of telling their story either?</p>

<p>Just because this is a conspiracy sub doesn&#39;t mean that you have to play along with the group. The emperor ain&#39;t got no clothes. It&#39;s plain and simple. The hoax is a lie...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed...</p>

<p>I picked that username long before I was on Reddit. The main interest that got me into conspiracy theories was UFOs and aliens.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also into anything related to the JFK assassination.</p>

<p>Since I&#39;m subscribed to this sub I get posts on my Frontpage. Although, I&#39;ve also been taken in by the 911 conspiracy theories I just don&#39;t think that the Government is responsible for every single newsworthy mass casually event. I usually try to argue against various aspects of the theories presented when a new one pops up. I know it&#39;s unpopular to not take the group opinion and buy into whatever bullshit is floating around on a particular day but I&#39;m really not interested in being popular.</p>

<p>I&#39;m perplexed with how some of these &quot;theories&quot; come from. Flat Earth is the one that really makes me frustrated. People will stubbornly argue against the the fact that the Earth is a sphere. In my opinion there are only a few possible reasons. </p>

<p>They&#39;re just stupid. Only thing is that most of them don&#39;t actually seem to be stupid. Some of them are pretty good at defending their own position and they appear to have a good command of the English language.</p>

<p>They&#39;re just trolls. This is the most likely explanation but I just can&#39;t imagine what pleasure someone might get out of claiming to believe such nonsense.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just not getting what people do in conspiracy subs. Maybe it&#39;s kinda like a weird version of the old TV show liars club. Participating in a conspiracy sub is supposed to be about trolling. Most everyone is in on it and they&#39;re just trolling whoever stumbles into the sub without knowing what&#39;s going on. Kinda like how Reddit is full of inside jokes.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where they get controversial. I totally understand how Russia could have influenced our elections. It makes perfect sense for an army of cyberwariors to be able to do stuff that would be impossible though any other means. They can influence the World around them all from the comfort of their own country and be home with their families every night. Cyberwarfare is an absolute bargain compared with trying to do anything in the traditional military sense.</p>

<p>It makes sense that promoting conspiracy theories that make people distrust the United States Government is in the best interest of cyberwariors. Right now there are more than 500,000 subscribers to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. That&#39;s certainly enough people to influence to make having a presence here on Reddit worthwhile.</p>

<p>Did you happen to have done a Google search for that picture of Jesus Campos that I debunked? It&#39;s all over the place. There are lots of different websites with variations on the story. Such a poisonous story can have millions of people who view it.</p>

<p>I debunked it on a thread on Reddit. Will that truth spread? I really don&#39;t think so. I did get a bot post saying that this thread had been linked to from outside of the sub. /Lasvegasfalseflag linked to it. Not sure why. I didn&#39;t think that they were actually interested in finding the truth. Anything that doesn&#39;t fit with their narrative isn&#39;t welcome. I was banned from posting there on the first day after the shooting.</p>

<p>By the way, thanks for the supportive comment. I did see a few today. I guess there are some people who are actually in finding the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious what picture you debunked, is it the one I linked to with the meta data that has a different date and is marked as run through Photoshop?</p>

<p>You made a bunch of points I agree with. Whether it&#39;s all Russians, or other state actors.. go into a thread here and respond to a post that seems like propaganda, and say something as simple as &quot;Found the Russian!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it multiple times, tons of people show up, put in all kinds of effort trying to prove they&#39;re wrong, attack them.. or just say anything about Russia anywhere. I had a guy telling me &quot;what&#39;s wrong with using RT.com(Russia Today) as a source of info, to see another perspective.</p>

<p>Not completely sure about here, but I&#39;m completely sure t_d is compromised, likely a very long time ago.</p>

<p>But I think, or maybe hope, that most flat Earth people are just shills trying to make us look bad. You made a solid point, most seem far from brain dead.. yet they believe something that could be proven false by simply flying in any direction till you get back where you started. It&#39;s idiotic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not super interested in UFO&#39;s, but it&#39;s probably the one thing I want to be true the most.. hence it&#39;s the thing I&#39;m most skeptical about. I&#39;m all about wanting truth, it&#39;s even more important considering how many ways we are being manipulated, just about everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually there is a way to get the original photo from the first archive of the web page. You just gotta ask for the printer friendly page. The original link will show up at the bottom of the page. I think I can trust that nobody screwed with the data on this picture. </p>

<p>That picture has quite a bit of data attached to it. The date and time seem reasonable to me. October 9th at 21:08. That&#39;s 9:08 PM. Maybe he accepted the award after midnight. </p>

<p>The location is pretty good. It&#39;s on the City Center property. Being inside a building usually screws up a GPS. It&#39;s close enough for me. </p>

<p>Next is the Photoshop CS6 (Windows) tag. I tried to see what I could do with a Photoshop app. It left a tag saying Photoshop for Android. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Q5gutLq.jpg">Test Picture on Android </a></p>

<p>I did succeed in making the test picture match the 72 x 72 pixel format of the original Jesus Campos picture with my test picture using the Photoshop app. </p>

<p>A 72 pixel square picture seems perfectly fine for use on a website. I&#39;m thinking that the webmaster who put up the original page edited the original photo using Adobe Photoshop to lower the pixel count. Uploading a full resolution 12 megapixel image to a website is not a standard practice. Especially if the webmaster is old school as might be the case for such a website.</p>

<p>Any other &quot;concerns&quot; about the picture?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much the same conclusion I came to, most people just stress that the picture wasn&#39;t supposed to be taken till the next day. The relevance for midnight would matter if it was supposed to be taken the day before, but the website says the 10th.</p>

<p>The Photoshop part never bothered me since obviously someone would alter it before publishing, likely as you said.</p>

<p>I really would have discounted it all together if they didn&#39;t make a point to switch out the picture for one without meta data.</p>

<p>Tens?</p>

<p>Hundreds?</p>

<p>Thousands?</p>

<p>You got even a shred of logical proof?</p>

<p>Someone claimed that there weren&#39;t any gunshot victims at any of the hospitals that night. Claims to believe it cause some guy claimed to have called three of the hospitals. Do you buy into that level of bullshit or do you have some limits?</p>

<p>My logic on the gunshot victims at the hospital is that there are literally thousands of people who work there. This shooting was headline news all around the world. Everyone in the hospitals would have known that something was wrong if they hadn&#39;t actually seen hundreds of totally legit gunshot victims. Thousands of doctors and nurses would have noticed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes my logical proof is that if they’re going to pull an event like this it’s actually easier to not kill people but it is really kill them. This is for 3 reasons:  1.  It won’t make people feel like they need to reveal the truth because they have a moral crisis 2.  If an actor tries to speak the truth they can bully and shame them, if they say “hey this is all fake” they can easily say they are crazy.  I think they have a ironclad NDA and threats to stay silent.  3.  They reuse these people with a little makeup and different hairstyles/ prosthetics </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s not logical...</p>

<p>Especially in situations like Las Vegas. Thousands of people saw people who were really killed and actually injured. That&#39;s people who were there, first responders, hospital staff, people who were in the hospital during the aftermath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn’t say thousands saw people hit.  Looking at the video evidence a rough estimate of 100% of people who were recording the incident did not capture anyone getting shot.  ~75% of people in the videos actually went as far as to say they saw NO ONE get shot.  Next you have Dan Bilzerian, with the worst crisis acting I’ve ever seen, recording himself saying “Oh my god! This girl just got shot in the FUCKING head”.  Go back and watch that clip again if you need a refresher on how AWFUL he is at acting, basically reading his lines with a slight rise in his voice.  If you think this is because he is in shock or any other BS excuse then I will accuse you of not having spent enough time around real people.  There is no way ANYONE who watched Blizeran’s video could legitimately think this was a real human experience.  Next, type “Dr. Phil narcissistic girl” for a video of a girl who was on Dr. Phil previously.  She was interviewed right after the shooting and people starting buzzing in this sub with people calling her a crisis actor, ect.  So, immediately after the “shooting”  the hoax theory was soaring around google and Facebook.  I ACTUALLY heard about the hoax theory from a hospital coworker, and I told her that I thought she was crazy to think that.  Loe and behold the next day the media came out blaring “fake news” and google saying they actually had to change their damn algorithms.  Why would google change their algorithms to make it near impossible to find hoax videos if the theory is “so ridiculous “. Last, look up the guy (Bill?) who had a “buddy” who took three high caliber rounds across his chest/sternum.  (Bill?) then threw “buddy” over his shoulder to get him out of there.  If you thought that his  “buddy” would be dead in minutes without pressure on his wounds you would be wrong.  Not only did “ buddy” not die, but he was discharged from the HOSPITAL 3 days later.   He would have had multiple chest tubes at LEAST but most likely would require at least one surgery. When the press went with (Bill?) to visit “Buddy” for their propaganda photos the pictures of “buddy” spoke for themselves.  It being Day 3 post shooting and there being no chest tubes is IMPOSSIBLE.  The picture shows that the ONLY thing he had on his body was 3-4 gauze pads taped to his chest.  Ask anyone in the hospital how long a patient would have to stay inpatient with three center of chest wounds on either side of his damn sternum and they would tell you there is no way he’s out the the door in 3 days. MAYBE out of the ICU on day 3 if he didn’t need surgeries but not out of the whole damn hospital.!!!!  The people that pull these off apparently don’t know how to make the medical stuff look convincing or they don’t care.  Ask any licensed medical professional with any years of ICU/ER/ Surgery experience and they would tell you there is NO WAY he would be going home already.  No way!</p>

<p>There definitely is. There are 2 rooms in the virtual tour. One of them is the &quot;Boardroom&quot; and the other is the &quot;Chef&#39;s&quot; table. Check again. The &quot;Chef&#39;s&quot; table room matches the awards picture.</p>

<p>I get it. Anyone who doesn&#39;t drink whatever Kool-aid is offered is a Government shill. After looking at my post history I hope you agree that I hide that fact extremely well. Either that or I&#39;m not a Government shill. What does the evidence say?</p>

<p>As for you picking on the pictures I provided I took a bunch of screenshots then I started making the original post and wanted to literally lead everyone through the process of going through the virtual tour by the nose. Unfortunately, you can lead a conspiracy theorist to the the truth but you can&#39;t make them believe it no matter what you do. I&#39;ve ran into similar situations arguing with the Flat Earth knuckleheads.</p>

<p>Did you actually take the virtual tour?</p>

<p>Looks like I left out a detail. You have to scroll down through most of the page to find the picture carousel. I should have included that in the original post.</p>

<p>I guess I wasn&#39;t exactly alone with this idea though. Since I put this post together I&#39;ve seen other threads where people say something similar. As far as I know I&#39;m the only one to discover that there is a virtual walk through of the restaurant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Law enforcement hasn&#39;t provided any video. Doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>Maybe they don&#39;t want to glorify what Paddock did. Maybe they don&#39;t want to give the next nut job something more to focus on to fuel their sick fantasies that could lead to another mass shooting. Kinda like how they buried Osama Bin Laden at sea so that his grave wouldn&#39;t turn into a focal point and be a tool for recruiting new terrorists. </p>

<p>It would appear that these sick individuals are in a contest to outdo each other. Paddock most certainly tried to kill on a scale far beyond any other shooter. He managed to kill 58 and wound hundreds but he had guns and ammunition ready to go for a much longer siege.</p>

<p>Paddock was the worst kind of coward. He killed from a distance. He never clearly saw his victims. Then he killed himself because he didn&#39;t want to risk being taken alive and spending the rest of his life in prison. Paddock is a piece of shit... </p>

<p>Even if they were to provide hours of high quality video I have little doubt that whoever is pushing the false flag narrative wouldn&#39;t be satisfied. It&#39;s just how things go around here.</p>

<p>There is no proof to these outlandish claims... im sorry, but until the investigation is closed and evidence is provided, that man is innocent until proven guilty. And since he can&#39;t talk about what happened maybe Jesus Campos should speak up. Just a thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, probably like 20 times or so. I&#39;m an OTR truck driver. We have a local warehouse there. If I make a delivery there I can usually get an overnight. I usually park the truck at the Wild Wild West which is across the Interstate from the Strip and on the same street at the Luxor. I usually park less than a mile from where this happened.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m there I always walk around the strip checking stuff out and basically enjoying not being in the truck. I like walking around where there are a bunch of other people walking around as well. Manhattan is another favorite.</p>

<p>Typically I don&#39;t go towards the Mandalay Bay. It&#39;s not interesting to me. I&#39;ve only been there probably twice. Honestly, I don&#39;t remember much about it. It&#39;s just another casino hotel amongst many. Lots of other places that have much better attractions.</p>

<p>Are you aware that they shoot quite a few movies in Atlanta? I used to live in Albuquerque, NM. They built a big studio there. They do movies and TV. That&#39;s how I figured out how they mark their locations. They use a yellow sign with an arrow with printing that would be upside right no matter which way they&#39;re pointing. I saw this one yesterday.</p>

<p>I saw a set in downtown Albuquerque once. It was being done in a building that wasn&#39;t ever finished. It was like 4 stories and fairly large. The security guard told me that it was for a TV show they used to film there. Later on I found out that they had filmed one of the Terminator movies right around that time. I&#39;ve always wondered if the guard had lied to me. If I had known that it was Terminator I&#39;d have made it a point to hang around. I figure others would feel the same. Terminator would have been really great to watch how they did things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was a kid they took over my elementary school in the evenings to film RoboCop 3. I did go there and watch them film in the evenings on the outside...tbh it was really rather boring. For the action scenes they would clear us out and make us leave. I&#39;m guessing for liability reasons if something went wrong and we were hurt. Any other time you had to be quite and watch a bunch of people while having no idea what you are seeing lol. Some of the extras were standing by me and my grandmother tho...she embarrassed me lol she loved to watch Mr. Rogers...she asked those guys if they did too! Lol. The worst part was the explosions. It knocked our power out and shook our house every time. We were so glad when they left. My daughters ex works on the set of walking dead ...he does lighting. Disney filmed some show at the Mexican restaurant in Little Five that a cousin worked for. It is rather normal in Atlanta now to run across a film crew. Oh..and there would be cars driving by our house all the time that would have cameras mounted on the drivers door on the outside...I always wonder how those &quot;home hunter&quot; shows filmed the drivers from that side lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool...</p>

<p>I walked into a set for The Blacklist strolling through Little Italy in Manhattan. I stopped and quickly took out my cellphone and started snapped pictures. It was clear that the cars were part of the shot but I wasn&#39;t sure what was going on. I didn&#39;t recognize any of the people I could see in any of the cars. </p>

<p>A girl to my left noticed me pretty quickly and managed to get my attention. She told me that they didn&#39;t allow any pictures and encouraged me to continue walking.</p>

<p>She did tell me what the show was, where it was supposed to be and which episode it would appear in. I think it was season 3 episode 18.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/j30XQrg.jpg">The Blacklist </a></p>

<p>The woman in the tan overcoat is one of the main characters. She plays Mr. Kaplan. I was too focused on the people in the cars to have noticed her. There were two cars and each had someone inside it.</p>

<p>When the episode aired I discovered that the girl in the back of the car must have been some kind of stand in. Mr. Kaplan was in the back seat of the car exactly where the girl was sitting. Notice that there was water on the car door. It wasn&#39;t raining. I&#39;m guessing that was what they were checking to see how it would look. The scene they shot only amounted to a few seconds of screen time.</p>

<p>The black table makes it crystal clear that the Jesus Campos picture was taken after the renovation. It&#39;s the only thing that can definitely be seen that can only be seen after the renovation.</p>

<p>Nice catch...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good find....</p>

<p>You are absolutely correct. The virtual tour is in fact outdated. I&#39;m disappointed that a billion dollar restaurant failed to update the virtual tour to reflect the current conditions inside the restaurant. </p>

<p>I tried reverse image search and couldn&#39;t find the yelp review. The picture is on the Internet though. I found it on 3 or 4 different pages.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3CUKjj5.jpg">Entrance Picture</a></p>

<p>Looks like it was taken in July of this year using a Sony camera rather than a cell phone.</p>

<p>This website has details on the renovation. They have two pictures of the new entrance. </p>

<p>They also have pictures of the new leather wrapped tables.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/IPdHYCm.jpg">Leather Wrapped Table in the Other Private Dining Room </a></p>

<p>The leather wraped table is absolute undisputable proof that the Campos Award Picture was taken after the renovation. They are sitting at a leather wrapped table.</p>

<p>Nice work finding the new picture of the entrance. With your prodding I was able to find the missing pieces to totally make this airtight. The leather wrapped table is the last thing that proves without a doubt when the picture was taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a guy on YouTube, End Times something or other, who spent a week on the ground in Las Vegas &amp; giving periodic reports. I don&#39;t know anything about the guy, but he&#39;s called End Times something or other, so I figured he was at least a little bit crazy. But he was actually there, doing actual research, which I think that is great, so I kept up with him. </p>

<p>This guy went and talked to helicopter pilots. They explained how the choppers all fly the exact same pattern, how heavily trafficked that pattern is, and how it&#39;d be impossible, in their opinion, for any chopper to deviate from that pattern even a little bit. If they did, there&#39;d be another chopper just minutes behind that&#39;d be affected, and it&#39;d cascade down the chain. Everybody would know.</p>

<p>So this guy concluded that the helicopter theory is not at all plausible. Which is, IMHO, a reasonable and probably correct conclusion. And the blowback this guy got for it--my god--people wanted to tar and feather him for daring to say that he didn&#39;t think their pet theory was plausible. <em>He was there. He was talking to actual pilots. He had actual facts.</em> And no one wanted to hear it.</p>

<p>Angry mobs can be a fickle bunch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve probably been there at least 20 times. I&#39;m an OTR truck driver and we have a local warehouse there. I usually park at the Wild Wild West just across the Interstate and just a little North of where all this happened.</p>

<p>There are helicopters flying around there quite a bit. Several companies offer tours to the Grand Canyon and lake Mead. There are also tours that just circle the city.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t taken one in Las Vegas but I did take one in NY. The tour follows a flight plan. It makes it&#39;s circuit over and over again. It&#39;s always within a very small deviation from the exact same path pretty much every time. The pilots are doing the same thing over and over again. Customers pay good money to see the sights as advertised and for the duration they paid for. The pilots have it down to a science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed...</p>

<p>I picked that username long before I was on Reddit. The main interest that got me into conspiracy theories was UFOs and aliens.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also into anything related to the JFK assassination.</p>

<p>Since I&#39;m subscribed to this sub I get posts on my Frontpage. Although, I&#39;ve also been taken in by the 911 conspiracy theories I just don&#39;t think that the Government is responsible for every single newsworthy mass casually event. I usually try to argue against various aspects of the theories presented when a new one pops up. I know it&#39;s unpopular to not take the group opinion and buy into whatever bullshit is floating around on a particular day but I&#39;m really not interested in being popular.</p>

<p>I&#39;m perplexed with how some of these &quot;theories&quot; come from. Flat Earth is the one that really makes me frustrated. People will stubbornly argue against the the fact that the Earth is a sphere. In my opinion there are only a few possible reasons. </p>

<p>They&#39;re just stupid. Only thing is that most of them don&#39;t actually seem to be stupid. Some of them are pretty good at defending their own position and they appear to have a good command of the English language.</p>

<p>They&#39;re just trolls. This is the most likely explanation but I just can&#39;t imagine what pleasure someone might get out of claiming to believe such nonsense.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just not getting what people do in conspiracy subs. Maybe it&#39;s kinda like a weird version of the old TV show liars club. Participating in a conspiracy sub is supposed to be about trolling. Most everyone is in on it and they&#39;re just trolling whoever stumbles into the sub without knowing what&#39;s going on. Kinda like how Reddit is full of inside jokes.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where they get controversial. I totally understand how Russia could have influenced our elections. It makes perfect sense for an army of cyberwariors to be able to do stuff that would be impossible though any other means. They can influence the World around them all from the comfort of their own country and be home with their families every night. Cyberwarfare is an absolute bargain compared with trying to do anything in the traditional military sense.</p>

<p>It makes sense that promoting conspiracy theories that make people distrust the United States Government is in the best interest of cyberwariors. Right now there are more than 500,000 subscribers to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. That&#39;s certainly enough people to influence to make having a presence here on Reddit worthwhile.</p>

<p>Did you happen to have done a Google search for that picture of Jesus Campos that I debunked? It&#39;s all over the place. There are lots of different websites with variations on the story. Such a poisonous story can have millions of people who view it.</p>

<p>I debunked it on a thread on Reddit. Will that truth spread? I really don&#39;t think so. I did get a bot post saying that this thread had been linked to from outside of the sub. /Lasvegasfalseflag linked to it. Not sure why. I didn&#39;t think that they were actually interested in finding the truth. Anything that doesn&#39;t fit with their narrative isn&#39;t welcome. I was banned from posting there on the first day after the shooting.</p>

<p>By the way, thanks for the supportive comment. I did see a few today. I guess there are some people who are actually in finding the truth.</p>

That shit don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a brick building.  being a fairly well secured placed doesn&#39;t really matter much, wherever there&#39;s a chance, someone will find it&#39;s weak point and attack.  How many police were there just for this last Vegas incident?  Dude found the weak supposedly, and attacked.  All those people felt pretty damn safe....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was a kid they took over my elementary school in the evenings to film RoboCop 3. I did go there and watch them film in the evenings on the outside...tbh it was really rather boring. For the action scenes they would clear us out and make us leave. I&#39;m guessing for liability reasons if something went wrong and we were hurt. Any other time you had to be quite and watch a bunch of people while having no idea what you are seeing lol. Some of the extras were standing by me and my grandmother tho...she embarrassed me lol she loved to watch Mr. Rogers...she asked those guys if they did too! Lol. The worst part was the explosions. It knocked our power out and shook our house every time. We were so glad when they left. My daughters ex works on the set of walking dead ...he does lighting. Disney filmed some show at the Mexican restaurant in Little Five that a cousin worked for. It is rather normal in Atlanta now to run across a film crew. Oh..and there would be cars driving by our house all the time that would have cameras mounted on the drivers door on the outside...I always wonder how those &quot;home hunter&quot; shows filmed the drivers from that side lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool...</p>

<p>I walked into a set for The Blacklist strolling through Little Italy in Manhattan. I stopped and quickly took out my cellphone and started snapped pictures. It was clear that the cars were part of the shot but I wasn&#39;t sure what was going on. I didn&#39;t recognize any of the people I could see in any of the cars. </p>

<p>A girl to my left noticed me pretty quickly and managed to get my attention. She told me that they didn&#39;t allow any pictures and encouraged me to continue walking.</p>

<p>She did tell me what the show was, where it was supposed to be and which episode it would appear in. I think it was season 3 episode 18.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/j30XQrg.jpg">The Blacklist </a></p>

<p>The woman in the tan overcoat is one of the main characters. She plays Mr. Kaplan. I was too focused on the people in the cars to have noticed her. There were two cars and each had someone inside it.</p>

<p>When the episode aired I discovered that the girl in the back of the car must have been some kind of stand in. Mr. Kaplan was in the back seat of the car exactly where the girl was sitting. Notice that there was water on the car door. It wasn&#39;t raining. I&#39;m guessing that was what they were checking to see how it would look. The scene they shot only amounted to a few seconds of screen time.</p>
