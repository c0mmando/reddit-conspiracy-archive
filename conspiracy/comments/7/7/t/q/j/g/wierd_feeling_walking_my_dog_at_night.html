        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, this has happened twice now (two nights in a row). I work second shift and get off around 10:30 at night, so i usually walk my dog around the neighborhood around midnight.</p>

<p>Past two nights i&#39;ve had a strange feeling of being drunk or high that lasts for almost an hour. The first time this happened my dog looked a little drunk too.</p>

<p>As soon as i felt better i had a excessive Nose and Mouth bleeding (tooth a semi healthy one). Which is really wierd for me.</p>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts or similar experiences?</p>

<p>edit: For clarification- Wasnt Dizzy, no disorientation, no panic attack (ive had those), no loss of time, no wierd noises or smells, no new structures or radio towers, my blood pressure has been perfect my whole life.</p>

<p>Just felt extremely drunk instantly for no reason, not like shitfaced/cant walk drunk... but i definetly had a nice buzz for about 45 minutes each time.</p>

<p>Will walk dog again tonight at same time and report back, Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>Sedating the public is worthwhile if they are doing nefarious things, but it would work better if they sedated people that could whistleblow (like community leaders/cops) not the ENTIRE general public... seems like a waste of effort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Frequencies from new cell phone towers, new 5G network? Not sure whether or where that&#39;s been rolled out yet, but it&#39;s the kind of thing that could cover a whole area and it is also known that it&#39;s not been tested with regards to its effects on humans, and many people have been calling for testing and warning of the dangers of such frequencies. A physicist/engineer who worked on these things in Australia stole a tank and drove it into 6 cell phone towers to destroy them because he was so incensed by what he&#39;d discovered about the health effects and that they weren&#39;t being taken seriously. Interesting how mainstream media reported it as being some guy who was just frustrated with his cell phone company and reported it as an amusing story, when actually he was trying to bring public attention to the dangers of electromagnetic radiation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone posted here fairly recently that they&#39;d been working on some very wealthy person&#39;s land, and would feel very unwell but said nothing to his boss or coworkers - then one day his boss or a coworker (can&#39;t remember which) showed them this big tower disguised as a tree on the land and said it emitted a frequency that made people feel lethargic and dizzy and unwell, and this wealthy guy who owned the property apparently had it installed to keep people away, like unruly teens or would-be robbers etc. And apparently all the coworkers confirmed that they too had been feeling very weird and unwell working there.</p>

<p>So perhaps there is some similar type of tower emitting some frequency nearby? What general area do you live in? Have any towers gone up recently or any of those new 5G towers been installed? Any rich dudes with big property in the area who might have an odd looking tree that recently sprouted up?</p>
