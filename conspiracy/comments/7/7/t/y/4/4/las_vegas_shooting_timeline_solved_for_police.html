        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Las Vegas shooting timeline has been conclusively established to within approximately one second for the emergency Police scanner audio, LVMPD body-cam footage and shots fired.</p>

<p>LVMPD and the FBI are wrong, the first volley of shots took place at 10:06:05 PM , not 10:05.</p>

<p>Shot volleys end at 10:15:20. LVMPD/FBI maintain that no more shooting happened after that. But the police emergency scanner audio at 10:19:57 broadcasted that an LVMPD officer - call sign &quot;765&quot; - took over the channel to announce that he and others were still taking fire.</p>

<p>This transmission followed a prior transmission less than one minute earlier by another officer who reported, &quot;It&#39;s been a while since we heard any shots. Does anybody have eyes on the shooter?&quot; </p>

<p>This was immediately followed by another officer requesting officers to send people leaving the concert East, instead of West.</p>

<p>Seconds later, Officer 765 took over the radio channel to announce that he and others were still taking fire and he warned that officers heading East would be targets for the shooter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not true. As unbiased as I could be, I posted contented that showed a cop. I had a real discussion with another redditor on this same thread and he suggested I slow down the video, which I did.  I saw that it was in fact a cop and his parter (both wearing the same reflective vests) holding a pistol and a flashlight, however, he did not fire.  Did you even watch the video? Not only are you small-minded, but your debate skills need some brushing up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have misunderstood the report. The bodycam picture is a still taken from footage released by the LVMPD, not Evidence.com. </p>

<p>The Axon information page detailing the watermark info is taken from Evidence.com. You are mistaken, my report contains no images of the shooting taken from Evidence.com. </p>

<p>Additionally, I posted all the information necessary for people to recalculate the analysis for themselves. People can validate the infotmation given in my post. Doing so takes credibility of the poster out of the equation. It&#39;s just a question of simple math, addition and subtraction once you understand the watermark.</p>

<p>The rest of this &quot;Report&quot; Looks like a bad cut and paste job straight from google. Page 3 is straight up a cut up screen shoot cut from the first page that pops up when you google axon watermark. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone with his name, on table 32125 (aka floor 32 room 135)  foot the bill also suggest more than one person in the room given the amount that was ordered and the receipt said 2 guest. So that&#39;s places him in that room a few days before the attack. Did MGM even have cameras in the hallways?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slow the film down and watch. At 2:20 the people on the right are illuminated with a flashlight beam.  At 2:23 you see the beam sweep the right again. That light is coming from the left because of the shadows.  At 2:25 a girl in a white shirt is fully illuminated. At 2:27 the shots go off at the same time the security guard crouches. At 2:28 his partner moves from his left side to right in front of him and was illuminated.  I believe you are seeing him carrying a radio and flashlight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the tip! I slowed it down and it appears as though heâ€™s holding a flashlight and his pistol, but not firing. At 2:38 you can see he is holding his pistol (at least thatâ€™s what it looks like). Iâ€™m sure cops use tactical flashlights which are bright as fuck! The blinding light along with the sound of gunfire explains why the people in front of the officers ducked, making it appear as if they were being shot at. My badddd</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still no Shotspotter report. Shotspotter is an acoustic gun-shot detection system that triangulates gunfire in urban areas. According to several articles from 2016 Shotspotter is deployed in 90 cities across the U.S.  According to an article from Gawker from the week follow the shooting Shotspotter is deployed in 89 cities but no one is returning calls to Gawker. I looked into it briefly a week or so ago. Just checked again tonight quickly and the results don&#39;t look like they have changed.</p>
