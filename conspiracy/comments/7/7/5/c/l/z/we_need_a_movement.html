       I'm convinced we are entering into a new era. I've always read a lot of historical books and take an interest in politics and technology. Does everyone get the feeling we are voluntarily giving control to the governments of the world via tech and a complete disregard of immediate history? I would highly suggest people read Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago, I just re-read it and it blew my mind. The rise of all these government monopolies and tech companies sharing our data with them and crazy left and right politics leaves the rest of us in the middle stranded. Personally I believe the only solution for the future lies in a very small Libertarian style government that stays out of our lives, that only has one tax and focuses on personal freedoms and liberty. Why aren't we embracing it?

       You know that feeling you get when you're dreaming, and you know you're dreaming, but you can't do anything about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like that's where a lot of people are right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But give it time. Eventually you learn how to take control of your mind, and forge your own dream. Soon there will be groups of people that finally stand up and say "FUCK YOU" and change the world for the better.

       Amen to that, I've had enough of the bullshit. We should be talking about sport, art, philosophy or whatever the fuck floats your boat, instead we are always looking over our shoulder towards the gov and deciphering what sought of manipulation the media is trying on us this week.

       I think what we should be talking about is PROGRESS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe humanity has the technology AND THE WILL to become fully self-sufficient. I believe that if we really put in the effort, we could replace our gasoline-powered cars for electric cars; acquire AT LEAST 75% of our power from wind/solar/geothermic energy; de-salinate ocean water, and grow our food in more efficient, multi-story greenhouses. (these are just examples)
      </p>
      <p>
       We're living in a fucking golden age of tech, but TPTB are hell-bent on maintaining the petro-dollar system. All they're interested in is fucking money, and it's fucking killing us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to put an end to corporate greed, renew our emphasis on the common good, end war, and most importantly... stop believing in money.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY THE FUCK DO WE NEED MONEY? the planet's resources belong to fucking EVERYONE. The only reason why we're compromising the climate and killing each other is because we've been tricked into believing that we need money to be happy, but the truth is WE DON'T.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need a $30 T-shirt.
You don't need a 2018 Ford mustang.
You don't need a Big Mac
You don't need a 60' TV
You don't need an iPhone X
YOU DON'T NEED MONEY TO BE HAPPY. THAT'S THE BIGGEST LIE THAT YOU'VE BEEN PROGRAMMED TO BELIEVE. WAKE THE FUCK UP.
      </p>
      <p>
       it doesn't have to be this way. The only reason there's a monetary cost to anything is because it's set up to benefit the few individuals that designed the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       (everything in the entire world is owned by just 6 companies, look it up)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think money was bound to be invented at some point, and it served it's purpose. We discovered so many things because we were driven by money to do so, but we've matured. We don't need money anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       (everything in the entire world is owned by just 6 companies, look it up)
      </p>
      <p>
       THE WORLD BELONGS TO EVERYONE. EVERYTHING YOU "OWN" AND EVER WILL "OWN" WAS ALREADY THERE TO BEGIN WITH.

       I appreciate the sentiment, but it seems every movement becomes infiltrated. Imo we don't need a movement but a global awakening, just as Zbigniew Brzezinski says is rising to threaten the NWO's plans.

       I've got one.  It's simple.  TMoney is created out of nothing and loaned to banks and the government at interest, this is called the national debt, it is a total lie. This perpetual debt is used to enslave the people through 'federal income tax'.

       Represents well over a trillion -every- year. Through this immense wealth, with the addition of the ability to basically loan themselves whatever massive amount of money they wish, they are the unseen oligarchy. The USA is a communist nation ruled by a jewish dictatorship.  They don't want you to know the truths on these various ideas that so many write upon in this subreddit.
      </p>

       The idea is called 'everyone versus the world bankers'.  If all we achieved was the ending of our enslavement in the USA and the elimination of that false federal income tax, it would be a cosmic win, but there is so much more potential.  But some really huge objectives relate to the 'everyone' is in other nations.  Nations like Mexico and Canada and under the same tyranny, Mexico lives under especially terrible conditions, in the USA the idea of mass/illegal immigration is a very hot topic.  Aiding Mexicans back and with Mexico is a win win for everyone.

       I think all we can do is divest from corporations that harm and do our best to become self sufficient or reliant on small local communities for trade. This can be done via gardening, harvesting rainwater, and local energy generation (wind, solar, ion harvesting, etc). Any movement to usurp the power structure will just be infiltrated and controlled by the powers behind the scenes. We are moving into a new paradigm where we are the masters of our own destiny. This must be accompanied by a transformation in consciousness as we remember our connection with the whole universe.

       Solve the energy problem and you solve the water problem. 
Water can then irrigate the world's deserts.
