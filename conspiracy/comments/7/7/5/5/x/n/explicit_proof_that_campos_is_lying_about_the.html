        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9ileVYnBQw">this</a> video. Seems pretty innocuous until you realize it shows exactly what we need to confirm the ways the Mandalay Bay stairwells work. In the video shown of the girls running down the stairwells, the first door opens into the hallway, as <a href="https://oddshot.tv/s/Gz6ewg">Campos remembers</a>. Here&#39;s where it differs though (note he says that&#39;s correct when Ellen verifies the right door).<br/>
1. The door isn&#39;t loud like Campos states it is<br/>
2. The second door opens outward, meaning  direction that Campos says(couldn&#39;t have been barricaded from the 32nd).  Let me explain this again: Campos states he sees a barricade FROM THE 32ND. NOT POSSIBLE, Given the SWAT team pried the door open which had a barricade on the other side.  </p>

<p><strong>Let me make this 100% clear. I&#39;m saying Campos is lying about seeing a barricade on the door, facing the hallway. That isn&#39;t possible given the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/storming-room-135/">SWAT</a> testimony. Campos explicitly says he&#39;s seeing the barricade on the 32nd floor already. NOT POSSIBLE.</strong> Skip to 3:57 in the video to hear the officer state &quot;in the stairwell&quot;. Why would he say in the stairwell if the barricade wasn&#39;t in the stairwell?</p>

<p>The video I linked you CLEARLY shows how both doors operate. <del>The outer one, closest to the rooms, opens outward into the hallway.</del>My bad, both doors open outwards. This has no impact on the overlying argument nor point I&#39;m making, that Campos is lying on National Television. Still, how did Campos see a barricade? The inner one, however, opens into the stairwell. This means the door could NOT have been barricaded from the 32nd floor, rather the stairwell! The door opens towards the staircase, not inward, so the barricade WOULD work like how SWAT says, but NOT how Campos says. Campos also says explicitly that he saw the barricade from the 32nd floor hallway, which also shouldn&#39;t be possible given the door opens back into the stairwell and was barricaded on the other side.  </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/nVJMXZr">Here&#39;s</a> how the door works. So tell me Campos, how did you see a barricade? Especially since one that you would have seen would not be an effective barricade, and would also not match the testimony given by the &#39;SWAT&#39; group?</p>

<p>Edit : SOMEONE IS LYING 100%. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/storming-room-135/">This</a> is the video of the SWAT team talking about the breach on the stairwell barricade at around 3:45. ENJOY FOLKS WATCH THE DOMINOES FALL.  </p>

<p>Edit: You downvoters claim the doors open outwards. That&#39;s correct, but not even an important part of the argument. How did Campos SEE the FUCKING barricade! He couldn&#39;t have, it was in the stairwell. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m not wrong, I&#39;m not an idiot, stop personally attacking me and watch <a href="https://oddshot.tv/s/f6ZZ6t">Campos</a> lie about where the barricade was. He says he sees a barricade, which isn&#39;t possible given SWAT testimony about how they pried open a door, and literally said verbatim that the barricade was &quot;in the stairwell&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people understand just yet how incredibly, incredibly HUGE this is. I&#39;m almost laughing IRL because I can&#39;t find the words to describe it lol </p>

Here&#39;s a huge lead for you that I can&#39;t follow until tomorrow: Look at the audio of the scanner, and look at Campos&#39;s voice. Does it match with the Ellen interview? I took a quick look and found it doesn&#39;t. At all. Maybe look into that?</p>

<p>Before we move onto the next piece of evidence, we should exhaust what you&#39;ve uncovered first to cover all our bases. This is a huge find which has massive implications, especially if the MSM somehow picks this up. </p>

<p>We need to fully examine this before we move on. This is no small find. This is probably one of the biggest uncovers I&#39;ve seen yet from this LV Shooting fiasco, and I&#39;ve been following this from the very start.</p>

<p>He completely misunderstood the set up of the barricade and is stuck on his idea. Read through this entire post and look at blue prints and layouts of the door and hallway. Campos and authorities are pretty aligned in how they describe it, and it makes complete sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Link me.</p>

<p>All I can find is he gets an open door alarm from the interior stairwell exit being propped open, hears drilling, possibly disengages whatever propped open the door, notices the &quot;barricade&quot;, open door slams shut behind him, Paddock hears the door shut since he was barricading his room, probably expected more time (who knows) so he rushes, looks through the peep hole, sees Campos poking around, and fires through the door. Seems pretty basic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more interested in who Paddock was than Campos. Campos is a liability for MGM because they failed to identify Paddock and respond in time.</p>

<p>They said they pried the door open. They didn&#39;t say they pried a barricade off.</p>

<p>The door would not open, so they used a prybar to pry it open. </p>

<p>They say nothing about prying off the barricade, this is because it was on the inside (hotel side) of the door and they had to pry from the outside (stairwell side) of the door. </p>

<p>I am sorry, it would be an awesome find if you were right. </p>

<p>Jesus saw the bar screwed into the wall and the door from the inside (which means the shooter didn&#39;t need to go down or up the stairs and take an elevator back to his floor), the swat team tried to open the door, it would not open, they pried it open. </p>

<p>Their stories are totally consistent. They both say that the door nearest the stairs was barricaded by a piece of metal and screws. You have asserted that the piece of metal was on the side that police were, even though the police never say that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;ve provided the explanation numerous times to the OP in this thread. He won&#39;t listen to reason or basic common sense.</p>

<p>The SWAT team never said the barricade was on the stairwell side of the door. They didn&#39;t explicitly claim it was <em>not</em> on the stairwell side of the door, but from context it is pretty clear the barricade was on the hallway side of the door. This corroborates Campos&#39; story; it doesn&#39;t refute it.</p>

<p>The best way you can fight TPTB is with logic, reasoning, facts and research. Not by completely illogical theories based on provably false premise. It makes you (us?) look like irrational lunatics detractors wish to paint us as.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you think this. I believe that &quot;the masses&quot; are more open than ever before in human history to hidden corruption and agendas. Even the &quot;mainstream media&quot; are openly positing questions about the official narrative of the Vegas shooting. But again, the way to &quot;wake people up&quot; is not to claim that every minor inconsistency or every time someone sniffles or coughs at a press conference is something to be &quot;read into&quot;. If everything you read/see/hear is evidence to you of a greater plot or cover-up or conspiracy, you&#39;re not enlightened; you&#39;re a lunatic.</p>

<p>He had the outer door to choose from, which could have been barricaded like a normal barricade. Yet it wasn&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>i dont know what the door or barricade is alleged to have looked like. im just saying that because it opens inwards does not make it unbarricadable. picture a flat rectangular piece of metal, bend it in half length ways so its at a 45 degree angle, place it in the corner flush with the door and the frame/wall, screw it in place. a very simple and effective &quot;barricade&quot;.</p>

<p>His entire theory hinges on this and he refuses to accept this simple, clearly-stated fact. From my reading of Campos&#39; statements, and that of the SWAT team, neither claims there was a barricade on the stairwell side. SWAT claims there was a barricade, and it seems pretty clear from context that it was on the other (hallway) side. Which is what Campos said. The two accounts actually corroborate each other; they don&#39;t conflict in the least.</p>

<p>Could have been something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2szMTyvPLvU">this</a> or something as simple as an angle bracket screwed into door and the frame. In the police video they said the SWAT officer popped the door open not pried the bracket off. Campos also said he didn&#39;t see the &quot;bracket&quot; until he went through the door from the hallway. If Paddock had assumed that police would have brought a battering ram to get through the door it would make sense to barricade the outswinging door to prevent them from bashing it in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And how did the swat team see it too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hindsight is 20/20. They didn&#39;t explicitly state that they saw the bracket upon reaching the door, only that it was barricaded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m with you on this. When you think about it a barricade on the opposite side to the direction a door opens is a better barrier. It can’t be rammed or kicked open, it has to be pulled by the handle. This seriously increases the force needed to open it and localises where the force has to be to the door handle. You’d probably pull the door handle off before you got that door open. </p>

<p>TIL how to properly barricade a door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So seeing your comment makes a little more sense for how he could have baricaded it.   You have this layout :
Stairs doorII. Open space steelbaricade on second doorII then hotel floor.</p>

<p>Those on the floor cant get out, and once you get through the door on the stairwell you see the second door leadong to hotel floor is blocked shut.</p>

<p>But still brings up my main concerns.  First.  You&#39;re security for a hotel. You come across a door that has a piece or metal blocking a door that should never be blocked.  You should be calling that in asap and having other security check out why and who blocked the door.  That is a big red flag.</p>

<p>Second to block that door with a piece of metal you need to have some strong drill bits, a solid drill, and also know what the hell you&#39;re doing.  These doors are all steel, with cement on both sides.  These doors are meant to take a beating and still stand.  Screwing into these is not like putting a shitty spoiler on the back of your Honda.  Plus you&#39;re going to need to haul around the tools and metal, so that&#39;s an issue(but then again you got 23 guns into a room with out anyone seeing sooooo should be easy)  then you also have to worry about noise, since you&#39;re right next to the floor entrance anyone walking by will definitely hear it.</p>

<p>Then you have to head to anothrr floor to catch the elevator since you blocked you&#39;re only way out or into the floor.  So this has to be done well in advance or justs before and your rush back so you can start shooting before any one sees your handy work(but I don&#39;t think the latter is what happened based off of the timeline for the events)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since both doors open towards the stairwell, it makes more sense to barricade the door closest to the stairs because it makes the barricade more obscure from your average hotel guest.</p>

<p>Most people are not going to try to take the stairs so they will not likely become aware of the barricade. If he had chosen the hallway door to barricade, its much more likely to cause suspicion since it would be more easily noticeable. </p>

<p>Campos: &quot;There was a metal bracket holding the door in place&quot;.</p>

<p>Police officers: &quot;He had screwed shut the door with a piece of metal and some screws. ... Thankfully, Levi had a pry bar and was 
able to easily pop that door.&quot;</p>

<p>Note that the police say that they <em>pried</em> the door. It was door opening toward the stairwell. This is exactly what Campos said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this guy was able to screw a piece of metal into the door frame with out anyone saying something about that.  And the fact that he had to do it in the emergency stairwell, then go up or down a flight of stairs, then take the elevator from the floor he just walked to.  He had to have set that up a head of time.  Plus he would have had to screw into a steel door frame and concrete.  These are emergency/fire doors they sre meant to take a beating and still hold up.  So this man was prepared with a drill, strong drill bits, a piece of strong metal, a way to get it up and down the stairs, and still no one heard anything or thought something odd.   Plus this detail(baricading the door) is not something most people would have thought to do or taken the time to get the right parts for.</p>

<p>And if Campos came up to this emergency exit and saw it was barricaded with a piece of steel across it don&#39;t you think that should be called in and investigated asap.  Thats a big red flag in my book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it shouldn&#39;t take long. I get that. But its something you have to plan for and still know what you&#39;re doing.  Then he has to leave the stairwell and go up or down a floor and wait for an elevator. So a few minutes would still pass. Then he can start shooting. But I dont think it went like that based off of the time line.   </p>

<p>Any way there&#39;s still a lot of stuff that is odd.  Campos story, plus the details he has said vs the swat vs the fbi, plus the other facts that have come up and also the videos are just not adding up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going off the video&#39;s that OP posted I don&#39;t think he placed a bracket on the inside of the stairwell but in the area between the 2 doors. Campos said he didn&#39;t see the bracket until he went through the door from the hallway and the police said the popped the door, easily, with a pry bar not the bracket. When I think of police coming through a door I picture them using a battering ram, which would be useless against a door that swings out towards them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea that&#39;s what everyone is saying. </p>

<p>He rented the two rooms basically encapsulating the stairwell. My guess is no one takes the stairs. And no one was there or at that end of the hall. </p>

<p>That explains it. It&#39;s fishy to me, but for other reasons...</p>

<p>He never had to even do that. In fact, doing that supposedly alerted authorities earlier than the start of the massacre. </p>

<p>So some one actually did notice. Prior to the start of the shooting.</p>

<p>No, there are two doors leading to the stairwell. Paddock opened the first one [from the hallway] and entered that little room in between the hallway and stairwell. He screwed the stairwell-side door shut, turned around and walked back through the hallway-side door and back to his suite. Really simple to pull off without anyone seeing him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why doesn&#39;t he say &quot;we pried a locked door, only to find out it was actually barricaded on the other side&quot;. He doesn&#39;t. You have no evidence to suggest the barricade was on the hallway side, you&#39;re just arguing with my point for the sake of it. His words describe everything, and the way he talks about the barricade indicates it was in the stairwell. Nice personal attack to go alongside your shitty and ill-informed conclusion!</p>

<p>There was  no barricade across anything, it was just a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/43H2bca.jpg">small piece of metal</a> and a couple of screws.  It&#39;s actually easier to do from that side because you have a corner to work with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The officer doesn&#39;t say he encountered a locked door that needed prying. </p>

<p>The officer knew that you can&#39;t lock a fire door, so it had to be held shut by something else.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t say that after prying the locked door he found a barricade on the other side.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure he would if you asked him.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to prove a negative, but there is no evidence that he worked for the concert&#39;s security. The only &quot;proof&quot; of him working for the concert was a guy named <strong>Larry</strong> Jesus Campos that showed up on NILB.</p>

<p>This claim has been &quot;debunked&quot; as in: if JC was really <strong>L</strong>JC, there would have been evidence of it by now. This is what has been &quot;debunked&quot;. There is no evidence that his name is Larry.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>None of the entry level security officer job openings at MGM list an NILB license as a requirement.</p>

<p>A little research into this leads me to believe that their security guards get their license through their own channels (corporate vs individual licensing).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% positive, as there&#39;s a lot of legalese, but I&#39;m pretty sure he would be licensed through the casino, rather than individually.</p>

<p>Can confirm this statement. PILB licensing is required for contract and non-gaming security. Casino security requires a much more thorough vetting, done by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and is referred to as a Gaming License. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt have to watch the video to one I that he didn&#39;t get the door set up right.</p>

<p>First they are emergency doors so they have to open in the stairwell(meaning they shouldn&#39;t slow down your motion. You should have to stop and pull the door open.  You should be able to push right through.  It should also have a push bar in the front so you don&#39;t need to use your hands.  You can hip check it)</p>

<p>Second these are emergency doors/fire doors.  In high rise buildings the stairwell is suppose to be used as a safe location to wait, and also be safe to go up and down during a fire.  The doors are solid steel and are not allowed windows.  So theres no way he would have been able to see the baricade, until he pulled open the door(from the emergency stairwell).  Maybe after he opens the doors he sees a barricade but I doubt it was a solid barricade, because you&#39;re in a hotel and something like stacked bags, or anything that&#39;s enormous and sticks out would be called in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The door was &quot;barricaded&quot;. They couldn&#39;t open it.  Campos wasn&#39;t overly suspicious of a door that wouldn&#39;t open so he called maintenance to fix it.  But once he saw it on the other side, it was clearly done for malicious reasons.  </p>

<p>From the link you posted of the CBS interview:</p>

<p>SWAT said the door was barricaded and they &quot;popped the door&quot;, probably forcing the door open with some kind of SWAT breaching tool.</p>

<p>You are taking their speaking of what happened as a literal recounting of their steps.  They said the door was barricaded with screws and metal.  They saw what barricaded the door after they got it open.  They did not say they saw the barricade as they approached the door.</p>

<p>How can you not say you&#39;re wrong?  You claimed to find &quot;explicit proof&quot; of this conspiracy with a video, only to have it pointed out to you by everyone that the video wasn&#39;t showing what you said it did (the doors opening in different ways).  You missed that HUGE detail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched it right at 3:45 like you posted to.  They said that was what Paddock used to barricade/secure the door.  They didn&#39;t say that&#39;s what they literally saw as they approached the barricaded door. </p>

<p>They said the door was barricaded (secured shut), and they used a pry bar to pop the door.  The door would open towards them (from the stairwell), so you would insert the pry bar into the gap between the door and the jab (where the lock is) and force it in and PRY open the door.  With a large enough tool and enough force you could tear apart the frame there enough to get the door open.   If the door opened the other day, they could have had a much easier time with a ram or brute force.</p>

<p>I get what you are saying but I think you are taking some of their words as too literal.  Like they say &quot;stairwell&quot; so you feel that means as they are coming up the stairwell to see the first door, when it sounds like he means the entire stairwell (as opposed to the hallway).  They never even mention the small exit room and the other door that leads from the stairwell to the hallway but its clearly there. This wasn&#39;t a tactical debrief but a recounting of what happened in general terms.</p>

<p>This means the entryway was secured in a way to prevent entry when normal entry should have been possible.  </p>

<p>Since the door opened towards them, it could not have been barricaded with furniture or heavy items (like if you were to barricade yourself in a room if zombies were attacking you).  So the door is secured in some other way way.  </p>

<p>They used a pry bar to literally pry open the door (to try to bypass the lock or device that was preventing the door from opening).  <a href="http://c8.alamy.com/comp/E5R56H/burglar-trying-to-pry-open-door-E5R56H.jpg">LIKE THIS</a>.  </p>

<p>So you think it makes more sense for a door to be secured on the side where the people you want to stop will be coming from (as opposed to the side that you are on)?  So Paddock would have to secure the stairwell door from the stairs then go up or down a flight then down the hall, up/down the elevator, then down the hall again, back to his room, just so that when SWAT arrived they would see the door was instantly barricaded and then immediately open the door with little time lost?  That makes more sense to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He explains the barricade as being in the stairwell, indicating it&#39;s next to the stairs. Which would make sense, because that is how a normal barricade of a door works. You&#39;re implying a non-effective barricade on the hotel-facing door, which wouldn&#39;t make sense. The officers describe the plate before they describe the need to use a pry bar, indicating they saw the barricade. A barricade shown in your diagram does not work.

<p>The barricade is a metal bracket probably like <a href="https://cdn.instructables.com/F5V/G0VV/GYUY18C4/F5VG0VVGYUY18C4.RECT2100.jpg">these</a> screwed into the door jab and the door.   It&#39;s effectively a permanently locked deadbolt.  Do you usually find people ripping open deadbolted doors with their hands?  You could try if the door opened away from you (so you could kick it open).  But if you had to pull it open, good luck.  You&#39;d rip off the handle first (there are only thin machine screwed there).  Only other option would be to angle grind the hinges if possible but you&#39;d still probably have to pry the door away.  </p>

Still, even if it did work perfectly, that doesn&#39;t explain why they immediately resorted to a crowbar on the door, knowing instantly through a wall that the door wasn&#39;t locked, but rather, that there was a barricade there they needed to break. </p>

<p>Ok, well I guess if we can just say things and use that as evidence then I say that this bracket would have been perfectly fine.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>that doesn&#39;t explain why they immediately resorted to a crowbar on the door, knowing instantly through a wall that the door wasn&#39;t locked, but rather, that there was a barricade there they needed to break.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Common sense.  They tried to open a door that doesn&#39;t lock and it appeared to be locked.  They tried more and determined that the door was secured some other way.  These are SWAT guys.  Sure they have breached a door or two.</p>

<p>Again, you&#39;ll filling obvious details that they left out of the interview as proof of things not happening.  Like how did they even get to the hotel if they didn&#39;t mention waking up that morning and and driving to work that day. Must mean they weren&#39;t even at the MB.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kinda done.  There is no convincing you that you could be wrong on this one.  Keep investigating.</p>

<p>Hmm, isn&#39;t that what you&#39;re doing too saying the bracket would have worked perfectly? 1 two inch 4-screw L shaped bracket can stop someone from opening a door? I don&#39;t think so. Maybe 5 of them would, not one. Most sources, Campos and SWAT are referring to one thing that held the door closed. TBH I don&#39;t think either of us can prove one way or another without seeing the bracket itself. </p>

<p>SWAT is FBI.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all you need to know really.</p>

<p>But if you want, go research Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Pulse Nightclub shootings. Check out what kind of involvement the FBI had with each of these gunmen before the shootings took place. Check out what weapons (and sometimes body armor, grenades, trip mines, spike strips, thousands of ammo rounds) were used by the gunmen every time. Here&#39;s a hint - it&#39;s standard SWAT gear. Check out what SWAT was doing during each of those shootings.</p>

2-The door opens down the stairwell the barricade is described as a brace. That could easily be made to hook around the doorknob which looks like a handle, and lock against the doorframe from the inside preventing anyone coming up the stairs. Completely plausible. He never says which way the door opens actually. Your just getting hung up on the term barricade. It was an inside brace from the knob to the frame that actually makes the most sense. If the door opens into the stairwell the brace would have to be on the other side or people coming up the stairs could just remove it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a question!</p>

<p>They say it was screwed shut with a piece of metal, my question is why do you think that it couldn’t have been don’t to barricade the door. The door open the opposite way-pulling as opposed to pushing, I believe is what you’re saying. Why couldn’t he have just screwed something to the wall, and the door. In such a way that it goes along the door, and then bends and goes over the frame then bends again and goes over the wall. Wouldn’t that also prevent the door from being pulled open?</p>

<p>Aside from this solid find!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where I kindly disagree with you. Your assumptions are wrong about the general population and I believe the majority of people on this sub.

<p>That&#39;s interesting because the overwhelming majority of people never even questioned the events of the Las Vegas shooting, in fact, most have probably moved on. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>. Your argument is why give facts cause people will dismiss them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is a fact? What physically is a fact? Are the statements about what happened not a fact? How you give a fact if it can&#39;t be a statement? You keep saying that the public deserves facts but refuse to admit that facts could be a series of words, a sentence perhaps, composed by the people that witnessed it. Just because you don&#39;t believe it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a fact. Honestly, your idea of what this subreddit is in relation to the rest of the country is off. It seems like you think that the majority of the country doesn&#39;t believe what happened in Las Vegas or isn&#39;t satisfied with the facts about it. Your statements don&#39;t read like that of the normal citizen, they read like that of a fringe conspiracy theorist. The facts have been released, the public is satisfied, conspiracy theorists are not, because they will never be satisfied, as I said, they&#39;ll always say what they have isn&#39;t enough, or isn&#39;t real, or they&#39;re suspicious of the validity of the evidence, and they&#39;ll always demand just a little more, because they cannot accept what they don&#39;t want to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have yet to actually talk to a live person who does not have doubts. Sure most believe it was just one shooter. Yet everyone seems as confused as I am as how this has been presented to the public. I&#39;m talking real people. Face to face conversations during this whole month. It amazes me that you have not encountered this same disbelief. Who the hell do you converse with? A selected few. I am lucky enough to engage with a wide variety of the public daily. People are concerned about this. If your part of government then listen to what I am saying. If not find new friends. I believe that when people begin to doubt those that rule them it is an omen to bad things. We should trust those who are there to protect us. I am seeing a very widespread distrust of the powers that be. I am sure some of that is my own prejudices, but that accounts for just a little bit. The FBI needs to give the public a detailed account with physical evidence. Until then a very dangerous situation is brewing. A situation that has seemed to be stirred by media since the election. As long as there are powers trying to divide us there will be questions. The majority of the public wants to be United. The coverage of this event is not doing that. So this is reddit. A conspiracy sub. If you take this all to serious I&#39;m sorry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would love to have pictures of every square inch of the room, simply because I would find it interesting, not to satisfy any doubts that I have. I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s important to see what the piece of paper said, unless you think it says &quot;the CIA made me do this&quot;. The official policy of virtually every police department is to not release evidence during a pending investigation, it&#39;s pretty simple. The rule isn&#39;t, &quot;don&#39;t release any evidence during a pending investigation...unless you really want to or unless it&#39;s a mass shooter&quot;. Maybe they will eventually release it, maybe they never will, but the fact that there is no official picture of &quot;the range card&quot; doesn&#39;t make me think that the official story is not true. I can&#39;t even think of what the lack of photo of the range card could somehow indicate some conspiracy. And just because I&#39;m not specifically demanding a release of official photos doesn&#39;t mean that I am specifically advocating that they never be released, or that they shouldn&#39;t, because I think they should, because I want to see them, but after the investigation permits it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But this implies that the official narrative is false. The narrative is the stairwell was barricaded. I can totally accept that!  But if I want to believe it just show me a picture. I cannot imagine how releasing a picture of a piece of metal and two screws could be harmful to the ongoing investigation. Quite the contrary. It would reinforce the narrative. The &quot;cryptic note&quot; same thing how would this hinder the investigation? Notice I did not say range card. I find that explanation to be bullshit. Just because I have spent my entire life around guns. So why would the FBI not want to alleviate doubts? I&#39;m not wanting detailed pictures of every square inch. I just want evidence to collaborate statements. This sentiment is not just my own but also that of people I come into contact daily. The fact that the only interview Campos gave is on &quot;Ellen&quot; disgusts me. I really don&#39;t care if he is a hero or not. It won&#39;t bring back 58 people. I do believe the families of 58 victims along with countless wounded deserve more. When things don&#39;t make sense I feel it is imperative to seek the truth. So why the secrecy? That is the dangerous question. I don&#39;t like danger in my society. I like a safe society. When a majority of people begin to question authority it makes me nervous. This is what I&#39;m seeing. And it&#39;s not in the internet. Far from it. This is from people I deal with everyday. So I&#39;m pleading for the release of evidence. That&#39;s all I got.

<p>I&#39;m am unsure if you thought I was serious or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So why the secrecy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s policy. Policy is policy for a reason. You don&#39;t just get to break the rules because you want to. It doesn&#39;t matter what the reason is. It doesn&#39;t matter what the effect is. It literally does not matter at all, what matters is the rules. And I want my law enforcement to follow their rules, not break them when they see fit, even if the perception is that it would be beneficial, because that opens up the door to breaking other rules, because why not? &quot;We literally always followed that one rule, that same rule virtually every other police department has but then we said it was okay not to because well, it couldn&#39;t be that bad, what would happen?&quot; But then you say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So why would the FBI not want to alleviate doubts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is, it doesn&#39;t matter. That&#39;s the rules. You don&#39;t get to make excuses to break them. The rules don&#39;t exist based on context or circumstance. The rules are what they are, and what you are asking if for them to break the rules. </p>

<p>But seriously, we have no information to go off of here. We don&#39;t know what the barricade looked like, or where it was placed.</p>

<p>Possible explanations:</p>

<p>Barricade was on both sides of the door.</p>

<p>Campos found the door wouldn&#39;t open and assumed it was barricaded.</p>

<p>There was no barricade and it&#39;s all fake.</p>

<p>Campos was in on it and spoke of the barricade because he knew it would be there.</p>

<hr/>

<p>There are too many unanswered questions right now. Especially to make the claim the you have explicit proof. You are using information that has only been released publicly. Don&#39;t get upset that people question this post. In many minds, you are waaaay less qualified to make this determination than authorities.</p>

<p>And I get that we question everything. You did a great job of providing a question. But you should have left it at that, just a question. Not claiming proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my point here. We have information about SWAT describing the barricade. That is it. We have no other information about the barricades. </p>

<p>Like I said, you came up with a great question, but that does not mean you have &#39;explicit proof&#39;. </p>

<p>Another question would be:</p>

<p>&quot;For a barricade to be truly affective, why wouldn&#39;t he place it on the side of the door facing the hallway? Did he barricade the door then make a walk around to the elevator to get back to his room?&quot;</p>

<p>If it was only placed in the stairwell, and it was only a panel, he would have had to of known that the SWAT responders would have no trouble dealing with the barricade. Again, here is another question that begs answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, the title says, &quot;explicit proof.&quot; You don&#39;t need a video to find out that fire code mandates they open inward. And the Ellen video it specifically says the door was shut and he had to take an elevator, then he went toward the room and looked into the stairwell entryway and saw the metal bracket from the inside. That seems to indicate that he had been on both sides of the door so either you or I is misunderstanding something.</p>

<p>Point is, I&#39;m not bashing your theory, I&#39;m pointing out that this video isn&#39;t crippling evidence. The snarky &quot;try and go in&quot; thing you said and that this is all you have to go on doesn&#39;t change the fact it&#39;s not hard evidence, is not conclusive of anything, and that any discussion on this is not made or broken with it.</p>

<p>Theorizing is about making guesses that might fit and seeing if they hold up to scrutiny, not making leaping jumps on inconclusive, incomplete data and calling it fact as you did. As much as I don&#39;t want lies or inaccuracies from authorities, I don&#39;t want them from others either.</p>

<p>Given the SWAT team pried a bar off the other side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They did NOT say they &quot;pried a bar off&quot;. They say they &quot;popped the door open&quot;. At not point do they indicate a barricade was on the stairwell side of the door, which would have been notable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Especially since one that you would have seen would not be an effective barricade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would it have been optimal? No, but it would deter a single guard/police officer without gear (like Campos). And to set up a barricade in that way would require Paddock to go to the floor above or below, return via the elevator or other staircase. That is a lot of lost time. If he did it from the hallway, he could be back in his room in seconds.</p>

<p>According to your theory, both the SWAT team AND Campos lied. The SWAT team lied by omission, as they did NOT specifically say there was a barricade when they came to the door from the stairwell. It would have been the first thing they saw, the first thing they remembered seeing. Then Campos actually lied TWICE (according to your theory): first, he said he came to the stairwell door to enter the floor, but it was locked blocked. So this was a lie, as the metal barricade was right in front of him (apparently). Then he lied saying he saw it on hallway side of the door when he was on the floor.</p>

<p>Assuming these lies, what would this accomplish, in your mind? Covering the involvement of others? Campos could have installed the barricade on the other side (at least, its feasible that he could). Also, any others assisting him could have installed it on the hallway side of the doors. I don&#39;t know what you think you&#39;ve found here, but it sure seems like a big nothing-burger.</p>

<p>No they do not. Have YOU seen the video? From the transcript:</p>

<p>Joshua Bitsko: He had screwed shut the door-- with a piece of metal and some screws.</p>

<p>Matthew Donaldson: In the stairwell.</p>

<p>Joshua Bitsko: In the stairwell going out to the hallway right by his door.</p>

<p>Dave Newton: &#39;Cause he knew we&#39;d be coming out that door to gain entry into his door. So he tried to barricade it as best he could. But thankfully Levi had-- a pry bar and was able to easily pop that door.</p>

<p>That exchange in no way definitively states the barricade was on the stairwell side of the door. I find it highly unlikely that they wouldn&#39;t just say &quot;we saw a piece of metal on the door in a makeshift barricade&quot;, had that been the case. Any reasonable reading of that transcript would indicate whatever was barricading the door was on the other side. The door opens towards them, but was secured on the other side. They &quot;pried&quot; the door open towards them, against the force from the opposite side. They also would said they pried &quot;the barricade&quot; off and opened the door; not that &quot;they pried the door&quot;. </p>

Also please explain to me the rationale of having a barricade on an outward opening door, from Paddock&#39;s point of view from the 32nd. He couldn&#39;t effectively barricade the door from his side, as it was both indented into the wall, as shown in the video, and any barricade set up could be easily pulled off by a goddamn SWAT team. They wouldn&#39;t even need a crowbar to open the door, they could have just pulled hard. The fact that they had to pry it open indicates they KNEW something was barricading it.

    <div class="md"><p>4:00. Two officers corroborate that it&#39;s in the fucking stairwell. And you&#39;re right, they don&#39;t directly say that the door is barricaded but it&#39;s a completely correct insinuation to think it was based on what they said, here&#39;s why:  </p>

<p>A barricade on an indented doorway, of a door that opens away from you, is not helpful at all, to anyone. SWAT wouldn&#39;t have even needed a crowbar. Tell me why Paddock would have barricaded a door opening away from him, rather than just barricade a metal plate over the door frame of the stairwell. THIS is what the SWAT team says! they say it&#39;s in the stairwell, and you&#39;re purposefully misinterpreting that to disprove my point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do not know what happened yet because they keep lying and have shut up completely now. </p>

<p>They claim Jesus went up the stairs, saw the door was barricaded, so he went up a floor and back down to the internal hallway.
What happened after that has not been explained, but it does explain him seeing the door barricaded on either side. </p>

<p>What I find odd is that Campos got an award for something he didn&#39;t do. Read what it says on the award plaque they gave him. It was the first timeline that has since been rejected two times.</p>

<p>The official narrative makes no sense.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Swat guys says &quot;door directly going into the hallway, right by paddocks room because he knew we would have to come through there&quot; - you have to interpret that as the OPPOSITE door than Ellen pointed to / conflicting stories.</p>

<p>Lombardo also said recently that Campos upon going up the stairwell finding the door locked then when he tried to approach it via the hallway that he checked on the open door alarm first that he was originally sent up there for and then proceeded to tend to the barricaded door that he was sent up there for - but Campos makes no mention of this original door open alarm that he checked on.</p>

<p>Another reason we needed someone different than Ellen interviewing, but it&#39;s America they have an orange reality star as president, we weren&#39;t expecting much.</p>

He could have simply changed his story to say he &quot;walked to the door and couldn&#39;t open it.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re intentionally playing dumb, and everyone is buying it. This post is for anyone else sorry enough to read through this thread. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The girl in the video closes the door with care to prevent it from slamming. You are not able to determine whether the Mandalay Bay hotel firedoors are loud when they slam by watching this video, however fire-doors ime are very heavy and often slam loudly, so it&#39;s very unsurprisingly that someone would claim this. It is also irrelevant whether they are loud or not, as the shooter had <strong>cameras</strong> set up to detect any presense in the passageway.</p></li>
<li><p>According to Campos, he came up the stairwell to find that the door could not be opened. He dropped down a level, and came back up another way to gain access to the hallway. It is upon entering the vestibule/chamber from the hallway, that he was able to see how the door had been secured shut (apparently via a screwed on metal bracket).</p></li>
<li><p>The ad-hoc SWAT team came up the stairwell and tried to get through the stairwell-door but found it was secured shut. It is not clear whether they knew this before getting to that door. The door, as you acknowledge, opens <strong>out into the stairwell</strong>, and according to their interview on 60 minutes, the team were able to pry the door open. <strong>They never said they could see the bracket from the stairwell</strong> - stop insisting that. You are misquoting.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>They pried the door open, entered the vestibule, and then entered the hallway.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying that the words of JC, the engineer Steven (?), or the ad-hoc SWAT team are <strong>actually true</strong> (and given how many times the official narrative has changed, I have no reason to) <strong>BUT</strong> don&#39;t misquote them, and don&#39;t try misrepresent the depictions in the video you posted (doors obviously opening towards stairwell.</p>

<p>Posts like this are an enormous waste of time and energy for all involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a couple things wrong about your post. If we&#39;re quoting the SWAT team, they say this in regards to the position of the barricaded door.<br/>
Guy 1: &quot;He had screwed shut the door, with a piece of metal and some screws&quot;<br/>
Guy 2: &quot;In the Stairwell&quot;<br/>
Guy 1: &quot;In the Stairwell, <strong>going out into the hallway right by his door</strong>&quot;<br/>
Guy 2:&quot;Cause he knew we&#39;d be going out that door, to gain entry to his door&quot;  </p>

<p>This clearly indicates they&#39;re talking about the door that enters into the hallway. This can&#39;t be possible given that Campos said he had access to that doorway. Tell me, why would Paddock choose to put a L shaped barricade on a door opening backwards, rather than just putting a metal plate over the outer door that DOES open outward, being a much more effective barricade. Also for that matter, if Paddock was equipped to barricade a door in the first place, would he pick an L bracket to bring rather than a plate of metal that actually is meant for a barricade. You&#39;re train of thought also implies that the door is only quiet because the girls closed it quietly, but that itself is bullshit! Why in the hell would Campos close the door loud if he knew there was an active shooter on the floor. He would be closing it JUST like the girls are. As for the cameras, no where in Ellen&#39;s interview does Campos talk about the cameras being the reason Paddock shot at him, but rather the loud door sound. Please explain the rationale of Paddock shooting after seeing Campos, an unarmed guard working not for Mandalay, but for event security(noticeable difference) , walking <strong><em>away</em></strong> from Paddock&#39;s room (Ellen vid proves this). Paddock wouldn&#39;t shoot at an unarmed guard going the wrong way, and Campos clearly couldn&#39;t discern the location of the gunshots. Paddock would&#39;ve known this if he saw Campos <strong><em>walk away, because it would&#39;ve told Paddock he didn&#39;t have a clue where he was.</em></strong> Also, have you noticed how much changed from the original story of the gunfire that hit Campos? Originally, the story was that the approach to his room and the subsequent camera spot by Paddock was what caused him to shoot. Completely plausible and I wouldn&#39;t doubt that could happen. But then Campos goes ahead an fucks the whole thing up, recalling on Ellen. He goes through it step by step, and it includes him coming out of the stairwell and walking away from Paddock&#39;s room. That doesn&#39;t sound too plausible to me considering Paddock would&#39;ve known the risk of revealing he had automatic rifles in the room before the shooting. Dumb move and I don&#39;t think we can just infer Paddock was stupid.</p>
