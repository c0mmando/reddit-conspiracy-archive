       Let's see what has happened leading up to this news breaking out. May not be in order and I may have missed out a few. So help me out and I'll update.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Mandalay shooting. False flag. Maybe to try and get civil war started.
       </li>
       <li>
        Cryptic Trump Calm before the Storm. Trump is pissed. They've crossed the line.
       </li>
       <li>
        Hillary mad dash to be relevant again in the UK. Apparently hurt her toe. There's been rumors she collapsed again. Probably knows the Urainium One news is about to break and has a mental break down.
       </li>
       <li>
        Larry Flint offers 10 mil on any dirt on Trump. Desperate.
       </li>
       <li>
        McConnell now working (supposedly) with Trump to get the president's agenda going. RINOs and Never-Trumpers have given in.
       </li>
       <li>
        News break out! Dems/GOP/Congress/Hillary/Bill/Obama Uranium One deal. Even Mueller and Rosenstein are involved. They all sign up on it. Most of them made money from the 140 million allegedly taken. Mass firings and resignations soon. Top deep state aka the Obama/Bush admin is going to be gone.
       </li>
       <li>
        Soros transfers 18 billion to his Open Foundation. He's going to use the billions to get civil war started. No joke.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Maybe this is why they ALL tried to get rid of Trump because ALMOST EVERYONE at the highest level prior to Trump was involved in profiting from selling Uranium. ELEVEN MONTHS OF BS and wasted tax payers money
       </strong>

       they are just not directly.  for years under obama isis was some huge oroblem and after trump gets in office suddenly they are no longer relevant and are losing ground...there is certainly something there.  Also hollywood covers up and helps those that made this mess

       I agree.  Just as the idea that Trump had nothing to do with it is completely ignorant.  That is my point.

      <p>
       There is a middle ground. The stopping of weapons and supplies from going to terrorists is in my opinion one of the biggest steps that the current President made and combined with planned military operations and alliances with unfriendlies completed the campaign.

       John Kerry admitted that Obama's administration 'watched ISIS grow'. Obama's CIA, helped by McCain and McMullin, funded the 'moderate' Al-Qaeda rebels. Once Trump was elected he stopped funding the 'moderate' Al-Qaeda rebels, and actually went after ISIS, rather than 'watching them grow', like Obama did.
      </p>
      <p>
       One other point of note is that Obama micro-managed his generals and made decisions for them. Trump trusted his generals and let them make the decisions. When the generals started making the decisions, ISIS started being decimated. No coincidence. Just common sense.

       Huh? ISIS wasn't active eight years ago because it was still a part of al-Qaeda. Also, the US has been fighting ISIS since 2014; Trump has only been in office for ten months.

       But that undermines your claim earlier that Obama "couldn't get rid of ISIS." Things only heated up in Syria and Iraq after the Arab Spring led to the Syrian civil war and after ISIS split from al-Qaeda, eventually invading Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, ISIS had already lost the majority of its territory before Trump came into office, so the conditions for ISIS's defeat were already present. Trump just had to keep the pressure on to ensure defeat, but he surely wasn't responsible for suddenly defeating ISIS.

       That's the earliest Wiki date given, I have seen it before, but they really didn't become a factor until they were a part of AQI during the US occupation of Iraq under Bush, and they didn't become ISIS (or ISIL) until later after splitting from AQI.

      <p>
       ISIS had lost most of its territory before Trump was even in office due to the campaign Obama had been running against ISIS. The campaign to capture Raqqa, for example, was launched last November.

       Bullshit. The US never support ISIS. Other jihadist groups? Yes, but not ISIS, who were part of AQI, al-Zarqawi's group, while fighting the US in Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       in fact, since the Syrian government allowed AQI to operate in eastern Syria against the US, in addition to releasing jihadists in an attempt to undermine the FSA, Assad is also complicit in ISIS's rise to power.

       Do you even read or watch your own links? The first one is anecdotal evidence, which is useless for our purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second one from the NYT talks about the failed train and support effort that the CIA attempted with some non-ISIS fighters, which supports my previous assertion that the US hasn't supported ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third link talks about the well-known support of jihadist (but non-ISIS) anti-Assad fighters, including ones linked to HTS, which, again, supports my previous assertions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russia accusation is a bit ridiculous since the US-supported SDF had liberated more territory from ISIS than the SAA (until this summer), and it isn't as if we should take everything Russia says to heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       The picture of the US "special ops at ISIS positions" is meaningless since the SDF, with its US advisers, had just liberated the position from ISIS in the eastern portion of Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I have ALREADY said that the US, as well as Gulf States, have been supporting Islamists/jihadists, but all of these groups are NOT ALL ISIS. In fact, many of them, such as HTS/al-Nusra, are enemies of ISIS. That's the issue that you don't seem to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not going to waste my time on "anonymous" pages.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Times link discusses HTS, which, again, isn't ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Again, the issue here is that you don't seem to understand Syrian Civil War, which is why you have continually lumped other jihadist groups with ISIS, which isn't an accurate way of studying this war.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       While jihadist groups share some commonalities, they all aren't one and the same. In fact, as I said before, many of them are deadly enemies, which is why ISIS and HTS have been recently fighting once again. (Though it has to be added that HTS and ISIS used to be part of the same group since ISIS came from al-Qaeda in Iraq).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the US should be supporting any jihadist groups against Assad, but it is a matter of poor scholarship to make claims about ISIS without nuances and without supporting evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spreading unsubstantiated propaganda is the precise sort of thing that useful idiots do, and that's all that I see in your reply.

       They are correct. The Dow tripled under Obama to nearly 20,000 after it plummeted to nearly 6,600 after the 2008 market crash. You can see a trend of the Dow's recovery here:

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course. As far as the US efforts go, ISIS lost most of its territory under Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, with ISIS's territories in grey, here's the map from Oct. 20th, 2014, which is around the time the Obama administration became military active against ISIS:
      </p>
      <p>

        http://www.agathocledesyracuse.com/archives/128
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is a map of ISIS's territory the day Trump was sworn into office on Jan. 20th, 2017:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://isis.liveuamap.com/en/time/20.01.2017">
        http://isis.liveuamap.com/en/time/20.01.2017
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can clearly see the differences between the two maps. In fact, ISIS's biggest loss in territories since earlier this year has come about from the SAA's efforts in central and eastern Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the victories in Tabqa, Raqq, and Mosul that happened under Trump have been extremely important victories, and he gets credit for allowing the military to add pressure onto ISIS, but the campaign to capture these cities all began under Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all factual things that exist as part of recorded history.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Unemployment down? Obama did that.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, yes, that's true, too. When Obama came to office when the economy was in death throes losing tens of thousands of jobs per month, the unemployment rate was 7.8, fell to 10.0 later that year, but then it was 4.8 when he left office:
       <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000">
        https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What, do you think Trump magically fixed unemployment when he took office? Did you actually try to research this topic before posting?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Aren't you guys even a little embarrassed when you realize Obama was there for 8 years and nothing good ever happened?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a completely absurd statement. Were you even politically conscious when Obama took office and when people were screaming that the next Great Depression was around the corner?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an example of the turnaround that happened under Obama, going from job losses to job gains (which is why unemployment dropped):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/embedded_image/public/6.5.15.2.jpg?itok=Gs1LTAo6">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, a net gain 11 million jobs were created under Obama during the longest and one of the largest job gains in US history:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        GDP never broke 3%?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, sluggish GDP growth was one of the weakest areas under Obama. It's still sluggish under Trump as well.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Unemployment remained at record levels throughout?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is an absolutely false assertion as the quantifiable information I posted earlier demonstrated.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        National debt rose to 20 trillion?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Obama inherited a deficit of $1.3 trillion dollars. If Obama had done nothing, the deficit still would have been $10 trillion dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, half of this $20 trillion debt came under Republican presidents, who are responsible for $10 trillion of it, so the problem has definitely been a bipartisan spending issue. And it isn't getting better with Trump, who wants to add another $100 billion do the DOD budget.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fucking gave Iran 1.8 billion in CASH?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He didn't "give" cash to Iraq. The money comes from decades old arbitration claims between the US and Iran, plus interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, it is funny to hear right-wingers freak out about the Iranian money when they didn't say jack shit when
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/08/usa.iraq1">
        the Bush administration lost over $12 billion dollars in Iraq.

       Considering it's been pushed under the rug for those decades, I'd say it's relevance is dependant on the circumstances of its effect. We can talk about the agenda behind it all we want, the fact that it's out there and a lot more people are receptive to the idea of elite deviancy, that's a plus to some degree.

       I am still of the opinion that trump is the puppet that will "Save the day" and ake it seem as though these nefarious factions have been dismantled.  Dont fall for it, trump is just as bad as the rest.  I think Trump just made a better deal with TPTB being that he is a billionaire he could have made any kind of deal with them.

       I think that there are age old factions fighting for control. Illuminati, Freemasons, etc. The two factions want different things for the US. The old one wanted "globalism" and to do that would need to weaken and possibly destroy the US and let the UN, EU and other globalist organizations take control. The one fighting for control, which Trump is a member of wants a meritocracy and the return of US nationalism. I really believe that is what we are seeing.

       If any group operates secretly trying to manipulate people in power to fulfill any agenda, it's pretty safe to say that whatever the end result they aim for isn't something we want. Think about Nazi Germany being white nationalists.

       im not holding out much hope.  People think the simplest answer is the most likely but i think that bull.  If I were in the elite team I would pay the smartest people to figure out multi level manipulations and tactics for control.  When you dont operate within a framework of society you can think in ways that most of us just dont.  For example most people wouldnt be willing to murder thousands of innocent people for a profit, these people do it every day.  To think that what you see is what you get is too easy.  theu have been in power too long and have learned too many lessons to be tripping up.  This is all for show, nothing will change for the better unless the mass of society gets up and says something but most are too comfy in thier recliners despite the house burning down around them.

       Serving the already wealthy(and those who inherit their wealth) doesn't do much to foster a meritocracy. Trump's already told you himself numerous times--he likes the guys who are already at the top of the pyramid.

       Google? DuckDuckGo? Whichever you prefer. Check the frequency of 5G. Then check the frequency of microwave ovens. Both between 30-30,000 ghz, if I'm not mistaken.
A frequency not used for communication until now. 
You can find the frequency of the 5G towers on Spectrum's website. You can find the frequency of microwave ovens just about anywhere.

       Yup! For all the sleeper cells among us that aren't doing anything except burying their head in the sand out of fear, its time to rise up. We need every single person to do just a little bit of work and we will move mountains by our combined strength. A little really goes a long way but more is better of course.

       Remember Trump is a billionaire. He also ordered Flint to go to the Vatican to get a so called ped o file list of American politcians. So with that in context it is possible he is playing some sort of 5D chess where he and his family can't be touched and Soros can't be touched. Something like that.

      <p>
       But you are right, it is possible he may be in that position for a reason because what's to stop them from another JFK moment.

       I think the JFK files will show:
      </p>
      <p>
       The deepstate Hi-jacked the government by killing JFK because LBJ's war profiteering was a better long term fiscal plan than defunding the CIA; and people like George H.W. Bush had a hand in it. This collusion helped create the Clinton-Bush crime syndicate who basically operate behind the scenes using the false paradigm of partisan politics to manipulate Geopolitical Climate by using US foreign policy via lobbyists, Thinktanks, NGOs and Global Elite Banking &amp; using interventionist Military tactics to rule the world; ESPECIALLY those who do not implement the US Fiat currency as their reserve for trade.

       100% agree with this. But I think all truth comes up eventually. Average age of an Empire is 250yrs, probably extended now due to technology. But it is always from corruption and truth withholding that great empires fall.

       ok fine.  my confusion comes in where you guys get the idea that trump wants to do or change anything against the status quo.....seriously.  what makes you guys think trump is somehow different.  i'm legitimately curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       all obama did was continue bush era policy. and all trump is now doing is continuing obama era policy.

       Once everything is destroyed somebody has to rebuild it. The people with capital in other places will be able to move in and build how it suits them. Then noticing how all the capital and production facilities have left our corner of the world, supplies could be shipped from overseas just like so many of our things already are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the US - huge war that they are sure to win but that would wipe out huge amounts of debt (or could be used to leverage debt-cancellation) could be doubly beneficial. War is a racket.

       This is not true. They DID use Trump but it backfired on them. This was Assange was referring to as Trump being a Machiavellian plot by the Clintons. They wanted to use Trump to pull all the other conservative candidates to the far right, they wanted moderate Republicans to be forced to never be able to make a pitch to the center so they would lose undecided votes. They told major media sources that Trump was a serious candidate when everyone else said he was a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       They made a huge mistake. America was a ready for a candidate willing to speak his mind, who wasn't politically correct, and America was tired of a smooth talking "center right" liberal like Obama and Clinton. It all blew back in their faces gloriously.

       Yes. I’ll never be convinced that Trump was the chosen candidate. You had Washington DC, Wall St., Silicon Valley and Hollywood campaigning against him almost unanimously. They threw everything they could at him.

       Why do people attack account ages?  It has no bearing on what they say nor does it show you how long they have actually been on reddit or this sub.  I just created this new account because my 3 year old account was getting to the point I was worried about having too much personal info in it, and I have another account older than that one that I haven't touched in years.

       It's a easy way to dismiss someone's opinion that you don't agree with. The same reason for all shill accusations. There's no point in even engaging with someone who's response to anything they don't like is, "well, you're a shill."

       When all the Uranium One news breaks and Clinton is clearly implicated what will TD do or say when Trump doesn't LOCK HER UP?

       Just like "Build the Wall"  "Lock her Up" was and always will be an empty promise.

       I was fooled by the D as well.... there's still a tiny glimpse of hope Trump might be anti-globalist-saviour-figure, but it's dwindling each day. I'm afraid TPTB might be able to fool a majority of the people into thinking "any day now!" until it's 4 years later...then 8 years later...and then we'll be not far from being microchipped, not able to voice our opinion at all and surveilled without being able to evade at all... I'm thinking microdrones, merciless police-robots and all that spooky shit. And most people will welcome it until it's too late... I'm still subscribed over there. As I said, glimpse of hope ;)

       She would have to have been proven, or at least alleged, to have committed a crime first. None of the stuff yesterday is even remotely criminal or even unethical unless you can point to an instance of her or Bill personally offering quid pro quo. Shit, nobody can even produce evidence that the Clintons profit in any way from their foundation.

       This is why I've been throwing up a great big "meh". Even if I were inclined to think there was a cover-up happening, I would actually think that this news was part of that cover-up. So everyone stops talking about the Awan case and testimony.

      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the Trump supporters I speak to seem infinitely more rational than the brain dead lemmings that STILL would prefer HRC to be our President. Male, female, black, white, hispanic... smart people that want a better country and less corruption. And yet ALL Trump supporters are made out to be racist and hate-filled monsters.

       The liberal folks I engage with tend to live in a fantasy world where money materializes out of happiness and everyone can skip to work, holding hands. Unless of course they don't want to work, then they get paid the same amount!
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the leftists are rational and just want a more fair system (not realizing that the current system is mostly fair, but poor decisions simply lead to poor outcomes). Just like some of the right-wingers are actually myopic and run on stereotypes.

Trump is a narcissistic, sociopathic billionaire who wants to use his position to make life easier for himself and other sociopathic billionaires.  Hillary is a lifelong criminal involved in the worst crimes known to humanity and has murdered dozens of people.

       This is why RT changed their name, to hide from the idiots that read their news, that they're literally posting news on behalf of Russia.

       If you believe RT (Russia Today) is going to be honest about anything involving Russia, you're nuts.

       Absolutely not, WikiLeaks has only leaked one Russian source that I know of, very recently, that goes into detail about a government funded propaganda company that is used by the Russian government. It was pretty well known before it was leaked, that's why they leaked it.. to look like they aren't protecting Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's safe to say, that anything Russia says about anything Russia related is going to be complete bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the article I linked, it even shows the reporters being used as spies to gather information (only valuable to the Russian government, never used in news stories) from government officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe anything that Russia Today posts, you're eating propaganda full force.. while most of you sit there and claim our media are doing it, you accept a source that's
       <em>
        actually

       It's an international network now you plonk, so they changed the name as to not sound retarded with your "Russia Today America" strokes. For that matter

        yes they do say on their website that they are Russian-based
       </a>
       . If it doesn't say it's Russian it's because it's not the Russian outlet you're reading/watching, it's the American or British one. Hence why the hosts and anchors tend to be American or British, or whatever other outlet you're watching...

       Anyway, RT America's independent shows such as Watching The Hawks, Redacted Tonight, The Big Picture, Crosstalk and others are some of the best news programs I've ever had the pleasure to watch and utterly eviscerate the trash corporate media churns out.

       Honest question, what country do you live in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Read some of your comments, you seem rather intelligent, like that one post where you proved in multiple ways that Communists aren't responsible for millions of deaths, even though that's specifically what he wanted you to debunk.. he shifts the goal posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you're educated, you're not afraid of reading, you're not afraid of putting in a lot of effort to prove someone wrong, even knowing they'll dismiss you.. you're anti Trump, but you're sitting here spending far too much effort trying to correct me on why they've rebranded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you click my link? I'm much less interested in the reason they rebranded, than how you'll debunk the wide variety of evidence of the Kremlin directly interfering in an American reporters news reporting, even going as far as to add an entire paragraph to an article after he submitted it, without his permission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the parts that have to do with reporters being used to spy, why Russia has specific guidelines on how they must report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, click the link, and show me that it's worth the effort. And also please tell me what country you live in.

       While I agree, I think it's more beneficial to at least stay hopeful, instead of assuming nothing will happen. I saw this because I know the power of collective thought, and we are approaching a critical mass, where every person's will and belief counts. There have been experiments on this... hard to dig up, but look up the thought experiment on Coast to Coast that they've done a couple times. They got calls from agencies asking them to not do it anymore. That's just with some radio listeners in the middle of the night.

       Cool, I’ll try to find it. I agree one should keep hoping. I think we are far enough along at this point that all we can hope for is revolution. They are well aware that it’s all we have left. Trump was installed as a safety valve to placate the disgruntled, and as you can see by the OPs post it is working. Obama served the same purpose for a different group. In the meantime militarize the police and chip away at our liberties in reaction to manufactured scares to make it easier to surveill the dissidents and suppress the revolt should it ever come.

       Before you downvote me, let me ask if you have read George Orwell's
       <em>
        1984
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not simply about a 'dystopian future'. It is in fact a story about human civilication and the human condition; it is a book about human nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       In it Orwell explains why the proles will always be proles, and why they will never reach for more. In fact they will tear down those who want better.

       According to George Webb, its not just Uranium. But also drugs (HRC) and depleted uranium weapons (McCain). They are trying to claim only Uranium, but it's the shadier shit that is coming directly into US ports that's the issue. Pakistan is the middle man between the US and Russia (Awan Contra).

       Trump is one and the same as the swamp.  He is a billionaire who got vetted to run for office by going to Epstein's parties.  His ONLY hand gestures are known Illuminati hand gestures (666 with his hand while gesticulating, and triangle steepling while sitting).  He is meant to be an opposition candidate because the elites saw how the right carried beliefs such as them wanting to take away our guns ect.  He is their Trojan horse to get these believers to think things have changed.  Do you really believe the all powerful elites would allow anyone but one of their stooges to be chosen as their party's nominee, let alone president.  I don't think so.  Everyone says "he's playing 6d chess!!!!" Yet it's been a year.  He's not exposing shit.  Start treating him as an enemy one and the same.

       Is there any way for the common man to demand justice from those who have abused the public trust. We need to stop theorizing and start mobilizing, and I feel like a lot of us would if we knew of any way to get any tangible results.

       As someone who followed the 2016 Dem primaries like a lunatic, I’ve heard how HTC “is toast”, going to jail, finally going to get what’s coming to her, so many time that it just seems silly that all of a sudden some of the same old shit is going to actually stick this time.  Care to enlighten me as to how this is any different than any of other open and shut cases against her?  This woman will never be held accountable for one damn thing.

       I was kind of thinking Soros's money move was to prevent its seizure from creditors.  Like from a lawsuit settlement or a criminal lien on assets or some kind of patriot act type asset forfeiture/freezing type thing like we did with Iran.  It just doesn't make a bunch of sense otherwise.  Soros?  Charity?

       It is like these NFL players that all establish a charitable foundation after they sign their first contract.  Everyone sees its a tax dodge and that no actual "charity" goes on....

       Yup! For all the sleeper cells among us that aren't doing anything except burying their head in the sand out of fear, its time to rise up. We need every single person to do just a little bit of work and we will move mountains by our combined strength. A little really goes a long way but more is better of course.

       I think the JFK files will show:
      </p>
      <p>
       The deepstate Hi-jacked the government by killing JFK because LBJ's war profiteering was a better long term fiscal plan than defunding the CIA; and people like George H.W. Bush had a hand in it. This collusion helped create the Clinton-Bush crime syndicate who basically operate behind the scenes using the false paradigm of partisan politics to manipulate Geopolitical Climate by using US foreign policy via lobbyists, Thinktanks, NGOs and Global Elite Banking &amp; using interventionist Military tactics to rule the world; ESPECIALLY those who do not implement the US Fiat currency as their reserve for trade.
