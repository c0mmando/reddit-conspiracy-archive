        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Can we start a thread to highlight conspiracy events where video footage has been confiscated and held from the public? We could highlight the official reasoning that is given for withholding the video footage evidence. I think if we had a long list of this basic information people could get a better sense of how often the public is forced to accept &quot;official narratives&quot; because there is a lack of evidence to prove alternative theories to be true even though video evidence actually does exist and is being kept from the public.</p>

<p>A short list to get started:</p>

<p>Stephen Paddock walking by a front desk camera at the Mandalay Bay</p>

<p>gas station footage of the Pentagon and airport footage of the hijackers on 9-11-01</p>

<p>police body cam footage when Seth Rich was shot and still alive</p>

<p>helmet cam footage of the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden</p>

<p>Even though literally everything can be faked nowadays, I still think that with a lot conspiracy event situations a short clip of &quot;official&quot; video footage evidence would answer a lot of questions. Should the public have a right to see video footage evidence of controversial public events if it exists? Could public demand for video footage evidence be a good way to address the seemingly growing concern over conspiracy theorists? Right now lots of people want to know more about the Las Vegas shooting situation, but the media has stopped reporting on it. The LVPD is giving press conferences even though the FBI is in charge of the case. Perhaps right now is a good time to use the current information vacuum to start a public movement to demand video evidence in order to silence conspiracy theorists. The only thing that conspiracy theorists want is answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone think that in the three weeks following the &quot;biggest mass shooting ever,&quot; which allegedly took place in front of thousands of witnesses with recording devices in the most video surveilled city in the world, that literally no video would materialize whatsoever of anything or anyone being shot? </p>

<p>The power of suggestion is strong. Show video of people running and screaming with the sounds of &quot;gunshots&quot; in the background and people&#39;s imaginations will do the rest. As far as I know there isn&#39;t even a photo of anything on the scene riddled with bullet holes which would be a common sight if this were real in any way -- which it is not, merely a made for TV movie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still don&#39;t know that that dude exists, the only thing for certain (to me) is that people got shot.  I know of one girl who&#39;s dad plays baseball with my dad up in Idaho but was here for the show with her friend that died and she had to go identify the body.  I also know a couple different people that were there but grazed.  I know me telling you isn&#39;t proof...go on some vegas peoples facebooks or someshit and read real people talking about it before coming here to throw wrenches into the already muckedy murky muck muck of this place.
Everything else about the story has gotta be bullshit, but they definitely shot at some motherfuckers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something I&#39;m still trying to figure out, but of course random images and fake names can be used to crate the illusion of a real dead person. Some of them could have traveled back to Tel Aviv, also. </p>

<p>This aspect does make me hesitate and really think it through, because even where I live which is nowhere near Vegas I know people who know someone who knows someone who knows someone who was killed and have seen Facebook pictures from the funeral procession. But, this should not distract from the fact that there is simply not the 3D appearance and evidence for a real shooting having taken place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tel Aviv? What does that have to do with it? Is that another conspiracy theory? </p>

<p>Also if what you were saying were true it could never be a secret for long. It’s got to be impossible, there were 20k people at the concert alone. Faking something to that magnitude would be near impossible. People got shot and people died..they weren’t actors. Now who shot and why they were killed is definitely debatable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a fair point. I haven&#39;t seen all the videos but I&#39;m convinced that the Sandy Hook event faked deaths so I&#39;m open to the theory that it happened here as well. I haven&#39;t decided one way or another what I believe in relation to the Vegas shooting, but I found a link to an article discussing the fact that many of the names of supposed victims in Vegas were not producing records when searching for them on a database called Intelius. I&#39;m not sure what that site is normally used for or by whom, but the person doing the searching made a great point that a lot of the names don&#39;t point to anyone in existence. The search results contain similar names but there&#39;s always a few details to suggest the victim isn&#39;t any of the people coming up in the database that the author of the article used. It was a fair point, imo. Definitely not getting the whole truth when it comes to the victims. Let me close with saying that I&#39;m not saying nobody died and I&#39;m not saying that people who knew people who said they were there are lying. The default assumption to make is that people did die, but if you do research and red flags start to pop up, then you have to face facts at that point.</p>

<p>&quot;Yet while Paddock’s extensive time in Las Vegas as an avid gambler — which would make him probably one of the most visually surveilled people on Earth — has given investigators a massive amount of evidence to sort through, little of it has apparently been fruitful in helping establish a motive.</p>

<p>Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said investigators had compiled 200 “instances” of Paddock moving around Las Vegas before the attack, but he was always alone.&quot;</p>

<p>There are 200 “instances” of Paddock and we are forced to believe that he was alone.</p>

<p>&quot;We fought hard to obtain this video because we felt that it was very important to complete the public record with respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11,&quot; said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.</p>

<p>&quot;Finally, we hope that this video will put to rest the conspiracy theories involving American Airlines Flight 77. As always, our prayers remain with all those who suffered as a result of those murderous attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>The Pentagon attack killed 184 people: Fifty-three passengers and six crew members on board American Airlines Flight 77, and 125 military and civilian personnel inside the building.</p>

<p>Some conspiracy theorists have maintained the aircraft was shot down in flight, and that the Pentagon was struck by a missile. (Watch fireballs engulf ruined parts of the Pentagon -- 0:55)</p>

<p>Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request, but the government refused to release the video until after the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the convicted al Qaeda conspirator who was sentenced earlier this month to life in prison.</p>

<p>Sources said in 2002 that the FBI confiscated a hotel security camera video that showed the attack on the Pentagon. It&#39;s not known if that tape is being released.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The family has full confidence in the Metropolitan Police Department’s ability to proceed with this investigation,&quot; said Brad Bauman, a spokesperson for the family, the Daily Mail reports. &quot;But given the large amount of hearsay and conspiracy theories surrounding the case, maybe it’s time for the police department to be more forthcoming with information regarding the investigation and to update the people of Washington, D.C. on the status of the case.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/06/dc-police-body-cam-footage-seth-rich-death-shooting-murder-wont-be-released/">http://heavy.com/news/2017/06/dc-police-body-cam-footage-seth-rich-death-shooting-murder-wont-be-released/</a></p>

<p>The Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police, in response from a request from Heavy, acknowledged that body cam footage from Seth Rich’s shooting does exist, but they don’t plan to release it. Heavy wrote the DC police, asking if the footage was ever released or if there were plans to do so. Officer Hugh Carew of the Public Information Office responded in late May:</p>

<p>&quot;MPD has not released body worn camera footage from this case.  At this time, there are no plans to release any footage.&quot;</p>

<p>We are forced to believe that it was a botched robbery without getting to see and hear what Seth Rich thought happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Trentadue&#39;s belief that the tape exists stems from a Secret Service document written after the bombing that describes security footage of the attack that shows suspects exiting the truck three minutes before the bomb detonated. A Secret Service agent testified in 2004 that the log does, in fact, exist but that the government knows of no videotape.&quot;</p>
