       Well look at that. Trump plutocracy fighting the rest of the plutocratic families. Obama and Bush suddenly coming out and shouting Trump down. Looks like Trump broke the Oligarchy code. Never prosecute the past actions of another president.  These past sitting presidents must have a lot to hide, OVER THE LAST 16 YEARS. They seem very worried, so much so, they are back in the public eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our suspicions about Trump being part of the deep state has cooled down for now. If he does get to prosecute Hillary and land her in jail, my spidey senses tells me he is the real deal. If he is, he can roger me raw until red in the butt. No qualms. I'll take one for the team.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a long waaaaay to go. I feel a JFK moment coming up. Pray it will never be like that.

       Inside joke. Trump's uncle was the person who discovered Tesla's notes when the inventor died. It is said that Tesla had the plans to build something ... wonderful. Trump's uncle, a scientist, discovered time travel from Tesla's notes, and some speculate that is why Trump has been winning so far, against all the odds. Fascinating idea, true or not ...

       I know this might come as a shock, but multiple events can happen in a similar time frame and not be connected to each other. The entire world isn't limited to what seems to be a few people's very narrow and limited attention spans.

       The big news is Trump and bootlickers trying to rehash old propaganda in order to deflect away from Trump's criminal conspiracies. Like pocketing the American taxpayers money, collusion with Russia, and past financial crimes.

       Glad to see there's some out there still pushing this bullshit. Mueller hand-delivered a Uranium sample to Russia,  and that's the person you trust to give you "truth"??

       Mueller hand-delivering a sample of Uranium to the Russians and part of the illegal Uranium-One deal, and then going on to "investigate" whether or not they "interfered" in our election is
       <em>
        not

       a conflict of interest? Especially since he is investigating the very people who are investigating

       I agree with you. This is meaningless drivel. Seeing patterns in anything. A great linguistic scholar said all statements can be true, false or meaningless. Nothing presented be op is verifiably true or false - just meaningless shit, intuition, Spidey senses etc.

       LOL!  "the feeble minded"?!?!  What's with this evil villain's bad day?  What's the matter, did you run out of wax for your skinny handlebar  mustache?  I know, more "meaningless drivel". A great linguistic scholar once said, "Even if you only suck one cock, you're still a cock-sucker."  I imagine this doesn't apply to you though, am I right?

       pby1000 is correct.  In judicial appointments alone he has done more than these other two frauds in 9 months.  He may get more appointments than anyone since 1950 if congress can get off their collective asses.

       2 for 1 executive order on regulations is huge.  He stated that 'for every new regulations enacted, 2 must first be removed.  This is, imho, the single-most important factor when considering the unemployment rate is down to 4.4%, the inflation rate is very low, around 1.9%, the Dow and S&amp;P are setting record highs every day, and American manufacturing production is at a 30 year high.

       Oh yeah, Raqqa, the capital city of ISIS has been liberated.  Perhaps you didn't hear about it because Trump didn't do it himself like when Obama killed Osama Bin Laden with that flair-for-drama knife throw, like Schwartzenegger in Commando, but more limp-wristed

       I didn't want to, but I did vote for Trump because there was no other choice.  As it turns out, I was completely wrong but still right - Trump has been a great president so far and I don't think any of the other R candidates could have weathered the storm as well as he has.  So, as it turns out, there really was no other choice.

       Doesn't matter when we were the ones funding ISIS the whole time. Though maybe their defeat means Trump recently stopped funding them as much as he could. I'm still a little pissed at him for letting the Kurds hang but I don't really care that much so whatever.

       I'd agree with you on every other point though.

       The NFL was going to continue to let the players destroy America's favorite game.  Ratings are down, attendance is down, merchandise sales are tanking.  Even the Saints, my beloved Saints, managed to ostracize me during this ordeal.  Trump made comments, knowing Americans were pissed about this thing, knowing the owners were gripping hard about this thing, and made Roger Goodell look like the asshole he is.  Next thing you know, owners were emboldened to take charge and make needed changes.
      </p>

       The pipeline fight, if it is what you say it is, definitely had everything to do with "us".  If it is as you say, then you are OK with an administrations insider-trading to a vulture-capitalist, quasi-capitalist, neo-liberal, robber-barron on the export of oil for the American people than you are an administration using it as a foreign policy ace?

       Iran is a threat to everybody.  They subjugate liberty and fund terrorism.  No theocracy, let alone a fundamentalist, dictatorial theocracy, should have access to a nuclear device.

       "We" were not funding ISIS, the deep state was, including John McCain.  That (those) bastard(s) does (do) not do my bidding.

       Why would you be pissed about the Kurds, they are one of the few reasonable factions in the middle-east, and the only one with balls.

       Also in regards to ISIS, yeah we've been gaining more ground under Trump but the civilian casualties are also up 60%. And it's really not like we were losing under Obama, we bombed the shit out of them. Also it's about 9 months in weren't we supposed to win using Trump's secret plan in 30 days?

       No!  Americans don't secretly love Trump.  It is not a secret.  Americans wanted someone who is not a politician and not an attorney.  Trump also acts like he is not being blackmailed, so he probably is not.

       Additionally, I said 9 months he has done more.  You may notice that I touted Trump's regulatory reform as an accomplishment.  There are times when doing less is actually doing more.  But then, I wouldn't expect you to understand that concept, Jeb!.

       Well let's see, Obama in 8 years at a minimum: got a deal with Iran, passed a healthcare bill, and ended a war. Has Trump done any of that? Well no. He's tried 3 times to get a healthcare bill yet had to make an executive order because congress couldn't agree on what he wanted. Is that not also what Obama did and was so heavily criticized for?

       There was no "deal" with Iran.  Obama acted unilaterally.  It didn't go through Congress.  He gave Iran $1.7 billion and we got nothing.

       No one wanted Obamacare.  The Republicans didn't want it and not a single one of them voted for it.  The Democrat voters wanted, and still want, single payer.  It was also rammed through with a filibuster proof majority in the Senate and control of the House.  He could have passed anything, but he gave us Obamacare.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also didn't end any wars.  We left Iraq because Bush and the Iraqi government had already agreed to the timeline.  Obama couldn't have stayed even if he wanted to.  Then ISIS took over half of Iraq and 2/3 of Syria.

       How many of dubyas judicial nominees are corrupt pedophiles who are owned and controlled by the New World Order globalists?

      <p>
       Think of it this way.  If dubya nominates 334 judges who betray the American people and Trump nominates one judge who is loyal to the American people, then hasn't Trump done more?

       Well the main point was trump did more which he didn’t. And your point is a GAINT if about some pedophiles with nothing backing that up except an of statement. And who is to say Trumps judges aren’t globalist either I mean Trump himself makes money around the globe using the same practices that all the globalist use. Globalism allowed him to make shitty hats in China and sell them at an extreme high markup in America same with Ivankas clothes line. The whole time bemoaning how the manufacturing should be brought back.  So no Trump hasn’t done more and your rebuttal to that statement was a joke. I just listed 100+ thing Bush did and you went to but everybody who was nominated before trump is a pedo. Guess what trump is in the same class as all those people you cry foul about. President Donald Trump's secretary of labor, Alexander Acosta,while he was the top federal prosecutor he cut a sweetheart plea deal in 2008 with a billionaire investor accused of having sex with dozens of underage girls. And Trump is quoted saying  I’ve known him fifteen years terrific guy. So yea rethink your position on trump, if your so concerned about pedos.

       Trump wouldn't put Hilary in prison. It was an empty promise he used to win. He is a longtime friend of the Clintons plus his staff has been pulling the same crap with emails. He is entrenched into it just as much as the rest of us.

       I like how much people knowingly or unknowingly stop this from happening. The left has used social movement and public opinion for a few years now to change law, to enact change the way they see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now tell me this much, why would you disuade a movement seeking nothing other than the truth? What is it about the continued push for justice to be served that dissuades some of you?
      </p>
      <p>
       These posts carry the intention of spirit breaking. Whether you’re knowingly or unknowingly doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that one voice asking for the truth to present itself daily is more powerful than any attempt to try and silence it.

       The biggest crime here is wishful thinking. There's no charges filed, there's no absolutely condemning evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say "movement seeking nothing other than the truth", when in reality everyone is hoping for a very specific truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, please don't talk like everyone is the same mindless robots who all want the same thing, most of these "people" are just politically driven and pushing and agenda. That's why there's 300+ posts about it in 3 days.

       I didn't call you a shill. You're trying to bait responses. There's plenty of reddit accounts on other forums used by real people, or paid people, or maybe bots that do nothing but take ideas and arguments and destroy them by acting this way. You seem extremely interested in splintering the point that Bush is a shill for the CIA. All you need to do is look at his history and his families history. There isn't much of an argument here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can make me the focus of this if you like. I assure it's quite pointless. I'm more than willing to let you have the last word here. The truth is just simply the truth, it doesn't require my admonishment.

       The problem I see in this sub, is people using certain key words to actually avoid discussion, shut it down with zero effort. Projecting. Shill. Bait. Straw man. False equivalency. Etc. No one elaborates and proves their points, and half the time they use it wrong anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Take ideas and arguments and destroy them this way" by what, simply making an argument that something isn't true? Nothing is destroyed unless someone admits they're wrong, and there's nothing wrong with
       <em>
        being wrong
       </em>
       . It's called a discussion, the focus shouldn't be about being right or wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know anything about Bush being a shill or anything to do with the CIA, I mentioned his lack of relevance until he does something relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The truth is simply the truth." Okay. And I guess you have the absolute truth, that's why you didn't respond to anything I said, but instead accused me of being the alt for some random comment you replied to.

       No that's pretty much just false. It was only made illegal to have a private email after Hilarys got hacked and guess what, half of Trump's staff are using private emails.

       When was it made illegal? Hillary's use of a private email server wasn't a crime, it was suspicious. What was definitely a crime, however, was knowingly sending classified information over a private server.

       he refers to this quote as having been published by Sarah McClendon in her newsletter
       <em>
        The Spotlight
       </em>
       on October 16th, 1995. My next step would be to contact Donald Jeffries regarding this claim, and depending on how helpful he is, contact a public library or archivist. My care levels as this point have reached a low, but perhaps that could point you in some useful direction if you really are that curious.

       In my defense, google has the virologist pinned as the author of this book as well. It's an easy mistake seeing as Google had the information presented incorrectly, which I had to catch as a result of due diligence.

       It's not an appeal to authority, it's a recognition of the character behind a person and what motivates them/what kind of actions seem plausible or not. An academic is unlikely to fabricate information completely. That's not an appeal to their authority, it's a consequence of academic standards for writing. Now you're just being unnecessarily aggressive on this matter.

       Bush Sr. was saying it, followed by a laughter, then it cut to something else. I noticed the quote was missing before this topic, when I tried to look for it a month or so ago.
       <br/>
       But, I guess it's there somewhere since it seems to be a famous quote. Tried to look through Youtube with no luck but close hits.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have to go now, don't have time to search for it. Hope someone finds it somewhere.

       My point is that there's no evidence that there's even a source. Unfortunately I don't believe you literally saw a video of it, because I've been looking for this quote forever and you're the first person who has claimed they saw it on video and of course the claim is vague and can't be substantiated.

       I remember seeing and hearing him say it in a vid and it being quoted elsewhere, but if anyone doesn't think Bush couldn't have had second thoughts and had that scrubbed since or gotten anyone to disavow that it happened, then they have no idea of just how true that statement really was or why he was amused rather than fearful of saying it.

       His father was a Nazi sympathizer, financial collaborator and supporter throughout the war but was never personally charged for that involvement. So don't ever kid yourself about the "Deep State" that exists to serve the elite and war profiteers who don't care which side of any conflict they can make a pile of money off thanks to the controllers within the government itself that sees to that they're assisted and protected.

       If you think any members of the federal government (especially former member of the top 3 spots in the executive branch) are going to go to prison, you're sadly mistaken. Doing so would break the barrier of being untouchable, the politicians would now be held responsible for their actions. Politics would become a witch hunt of the last guy you didn't like. That will never happen. It's all theater, and you guys are buying in.

       You have a president with decades of working directly for/with powerful politicians (that he's now somehow going to lock up according to posts like these) and mainstream media networks. Attitude and reality are two separate things, so I'm judging my post on the reality of the situation. If we lock up Obama and Clinton you think they're just going to ignore all the other illegal shit that goes on in politics? You think they're going to after Bush and Cheney? CIA/FBI/3 letter agencies? They're not. It would bring them down to our level, the government have to admit to too many crimes. Trump is a puppet like the rest, they wouldn't let him in if he wasn't. This is theater.

       Then obviously that comment didn't include you under the umbrella. The point is, people on both sides of the isle get attached to promises of equality and hope and justice etc. People talk about how bad TPTB are and then fall in line once they hear the promise that sounds good to them.

       This feels more like separate factions of TPTB are in outright war for control.  The 'new' faction is in power and trying to trash the outgoing faction, hence all this dirt hitting the streets right now and the old guard trying to make the dirt go away.  It seems the MSM is tied to the old guard as none of the uranium news is being covered.

       That link mentions Punished Trump but on the basis that he was opening the door on the Jewish Kabal. But he has done the opposite of that. I'll have to look more into the actual story of him being exiled from the elite, which is what I assume it's meant by punished Trump.

       Trump has all the ammunition he needs to put away Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein, both Clintons, Debbie Wasserman, top 10 DNC leaders and even Obama.  He should be focusing on Uranium One, Comey's premature exoneration memo, Awan, additional emails found on Abedin laptop, additional Hillary email found at the State Dept.
      </p>

       But instead, he's busy fighting the media about what he said to a Gold Star Mom.  WTF?  Sometimes, I think he's brilliant, but other times, he's dumber than a goat.

       I think what he is trying to do is a long term plan, which is bringing the country together, the
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       country together. I think he knows the other side are ideological subverted and he is taking baby steps like releasing truth because truth always trumps propaganda, no pun intended. As for fighting the media, I think it is just a show because again, it is them that is showing their true colors and not him.

       Saying he was banning transgenders in the military. Calling nfl players who kneel sons of bitches and they should be fired. Claiming you can now say Merry Christmas because he's president.

       Exactly nobody cared until Trump acted like he was a victim because people say Happy Holidays. Thats a decision for the military to make. They've decided having trans troops is perfectly fine. Plus the president has bigger things to do than call out Nfl players for non violent protests. I know you'll swallow any bullshit Trump puts out because you agree with him l. There's a reason he keeps pushing the button on these wedge issues and it's because hes sitting at around 35% approval rating. If he keeps bringing up issues that are divided 50/50 all he has to do is pick whatever side he wants and 50% of the people will side with him

       35% number is from MSM polls. If you still believe that shit then you need to think more.

       So polls said Trump had a 5-10 percent chance of winning? I didn't know the number they gave out was zero. Just because he won doesn't make them wrong. He just beat the odds. Nobody said it was impossible for him to win. You've never taken a statistics class have you? Yes I still believe actual scientific polls. So does your daddy Trump thats why he's trying to get his approval numbers up by taking a side on these wedge issues.

       Yes and that means they gave Trump a 5 to 10 percent chance. Nobody says it was impossible. Just because its a billion to 1 odds I can win the powerball doesn't mean those billion to 1 chances were wrong if I win. Please take a class or course in statistics. It will really help with how badly you're misunderstanding this simple concept

       "the msms" are not polls. No poll said trump had a 0-10% chance of winning. The msm reads poll data and makes predictions based on it, so that has 0 bearing on the accuracy of an approval rating poll.

       Your truth? Wtf kind of alternative facts logic is that. Theres just the truth man. Truth is no msm said it was impossible for Trump to win. The said the odds we're not in his favor. Just because he beat those odds it doesn't make them wrong because they still give him a chance to win. This isn't as complicated as you're trying to make it

       Yeah, but there are big wedges and small wedges, no? Then you need to take into account MSMs using propaganda and making small wedges into big wedges.

       And before you say wedges are wedges, Obama created wedges, Bush also. Heck, when my kid doesn't eat his veggies that's a wedge.

       He may have that, however the web of corruption goes deeper. I'd say he is doing well considering he has the whole DNC working against him, half or more of the Republican party is also working against him. He has to extremely vet with whom he works with.  we have leaks getting whistle blowers ousted and killed. Positions of US Troops being compromised and killed. What is going on right now is the Storm brewing behind the scenes/ not so behind the scenes if you can connect the dots.

       Because not a single sentence says anything conclusive. If you have something to say then you might as well say it. Vague references to the oligarchy, deep state and your spidey senses mean nothing to me.

       Jasenlee, if you are interested in learning more about this case I could point you in the direction of George Webb, he has been on the case for a year to the day now. Multiple videos, if you are truly interested in searching for what is going on.

       Well, if you want something I personally found that would be nothing. However if you want me to parrot what George Webb has discovered in his own investigation, and the investigation that Judicial Watch is conducting I couldn't possible do it. There is too much information to delve into in a single comment. Or a single post.  George Webb has been at the helm of his investigation for a year. If you really want truth dig in friend. If you want to remain ignorant then by all means do so it is your prerogative.  I'd be happy to provide links for which you can discover the information yourself. Me sharing the information won't help you decide for yourself what is going on. Of course if you are just asking for my opinion on the matter I'd be more than welcome to give that.

       You literally said in your last comment if you could point me to more information. Why the hell is everyone being so vague? I asked a question and I get shadow answers. I'm not asking you to wipe my nose and be my teacher but when I type in "George Webb" to try and figure out what this shit show is I get this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       So I don't know what the fuck everyone is talking about. Maybe I need to go post this over at

       or

       I would think it is pretty clear I don't since I'm asking questions about it. I imagine other people reading this post feel the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Final thought...
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about posts like this is people sometimes just assume everyone already knows the complete backstory and if they don't they are lazy or can't google. The fact is how can anyone know everything about anything and still functionally operate? People miss shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       One solution would be to step back and take a moment to think about the post you are about to make and ask yourself what are some of the questions people might ask about this. If you can get even 20% of those knocked out you are on your way. Making vague references and playing keyword bingo don't really work.

       you can start here. I can't provide concrete evidence because I haven't informed myself fully. I merely suggested you look into it yourself because only you or the the person deciding to look will be able to take off their biases glasses and look. This scandal cuts past the party lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to thank you for discussing this and presenting your point of view. I do understand that it might seem as if I was trying to make the case that some one is lazy since they don't know about it. But I'm not the only reason I kept suggesting to review the information yourself is so you can formulate an opinion not skewed by my own biases.

       And this is the problem. There should be some definitive documentation that you guys can point to. A few pages that anyone could read and say "oh wow. x,y and z are all super evil" (And no, those "infographics" do not count.)

       Instead the only way you can believe these things is by subjecting yourself to their programming over a long period of time. Maybe if you have to spend hundreds of hours reading / listening to these beliefs before you can believe them... they're not worth believing?

       Just take the uranium deal, for example. That subject alone you could read about and study for the next year and still be unraveling information.

       . Trump and the Clintons have the same friends, they rub the same elbows with the same people, and both have had personal relationships with Jeff Epstein. I'd like to see changes in our government too, I'd like to see our public officials held accountable. But I'm not going to waste my breath believing that a rich trust fund plutocrat is going to get us there. He is simply a master in the art of media distraction and illusion.

       I actually don't think that Obama has said anything against Trump.
       <br/>
       However, these articles are attempting to spin something Obama said recently to seem otherwise.  Using words like 'indirectly' and 'implied.'
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like Obama would just come out and say these things instead of allude to them.  So I doubt he said them.

       The establishment is so predictable now. Stories coming out of real Russian collusion concerning Dems and all of a sudden Obama and Bush give speeches attacking Trump while some no-name Congresswoman wanted to become a "rock star" (her words) by politicizing a call of condolence to the widow of a fallen soldier. Now's she saying Kelly's "empty barrel" comment was racist. They're shtick is played out.

       Yeah, the politicizing of Trump's phone call was sick. Truly evil. I think the torrid of information was held back by Trump and was in a bottleneck. It was only a matter of time the Clinton Russia Uranium thing came out. Now, it seems clear what the path is.

       It's funny though how the Congresswoman was trying to call Niger Trump's Benghazi when I thought Dems said Hillary and Obama did nothing wrong regarding Benghazi. She obviously doesn't think very deep.

       It's a typical MSM tactic. Take snippets of the whole story, repackage, and push out a narrative. Notice how they report on what Trump said in one word or one phrase, and then spin it without giving the whole context.

       Trump did not even specifically say that “this is what he signed up for,” in a condescending tone.  He basically said if Gen. Kelly is to be believed something along the line of, he choose to give his life for his country.  Now she refused to repeat what was said verbatim.

       The widow has said she felt offended by what he said, I think the point to take from kelley's statement was that he told trump a personal story, and then trump tried to emulate it and mangled the delivery.

       But all you do is blindly defend Trump and Pence in your comments, in fact thats nearly all your comments are cock gobbling trump and you want sensible discussion? You act like trying to discredit a "conspiracy" is a bad thing when that is the first thing that should always be done, if it cant stand on its own two legs then its bullshit, you guys are just creating these stupid fucking narratives then circlejerking to death, good conspiracy conversations should have for and against arguments, Im sorry this isnt the echo chamber you want it to be.

       Another Trump worship post and the top comment is a moderator...

       Las Vegas was done for Trump to give him a distraction from his many scandals. Somehow he gets to comment on Weinstein another famous pussy grabber and gets no attention but worship posts on conspiracy themed websites.

       I think the difference between Trump and Weinstein is that Trump said, "THEY LET YOU GRAB THEM BY THE PUSSY" as opposed to simply grabbing them by the pussy because you forced yourself on them.  Not that I think either of them is appropriate, but one is certainly more appropriate than the other.

       but isn't not reporting it and not removing yourself from the situations be like allowing it to happen. if I got stabbed at my friends house and didn't report t and kept going over and kept getting  stabbed isn't that my fault?

       Stabbing is different from rape. You usually live after a rape... unless you get stabbed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why some stayed silent. I've lost a relationship over this argument in the past. I say they should speak up and they just feel like they can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still different from being stabbed.

       I meant returning to the abuse time after time without telling authorities. I believe they had everything to lose. Courtney love spoke out and was blackballed from the industry but it doesn't mean they should have stayed quiet.

       Definitely. Some of these women took the money and never said shit. Some like Laura Dern was just notified she was raped because she was 14. Which means she was under the impression that was a career decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Methinks the abuse isn't as bad as it's being emotionally put out there. Yeah some real rapes occurred with underage teens but some women and men really did use the casting couch for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the part they don't want out. They want to stop the abuse but keep the fact they blew dick for a part.

       Or this is a whole lot of old shit being brought up because Trump is about to be crushed by Mueller. The obsession with no power Clinton over a sitting President with just as much or more evidence against him is hilarious. If you are pissed at Clinton you should be just as pissed at Trump. But now everyone of these posts are a political red herring proven by the one sided bias. You list all Democratic issues like there's actually two sides. You don't belong on this sub with this partisan bullshit.

       On the contrary, Mueller is about to be crushed.  The uranium deal is a clear case of collusion and abuse of power.  We really have virtuatlly nothing establishing Trump-Russia collusion.

       George Bush should go down first.  He and Cheney.  Then Obama Lynch and Clinton.  Followed by all the elites who sponsored their deeds.  All highly unlikely but I hope for at least 1 career politician to rot in jail for some corruption.  Have yet to see it ever happen.

       Us plebs can wish but if Trump is not sincere then they will just sacriface Clinton and make her the fall guy, and that would be it. So a long way to go to see if Trump is truly honest and working for the people. Maybe he just has a beef with Hillary, because you know his ego.

       You have a president with decades of working directly for/with powerful politicians (that he's now somehow going to lock up according to posts like these) and mainstream media networks. Attitude and reality are two separate things, so I'm judging my post on the reality of the situation. If we lock up Obama and Clinton you think they're just going to ignore all the other illegal shit that goes on in politics? You think they're going to after Bush and Cheney? CIA/FBI/3 letter agencies? They're not. It would bring them down to our level, the government have to admit to too many crimes. Trump is a puppet like the rest, they wouldn't let him in if he wasn't. This is theater.

       When was it made illegal? Hillary's use of a private email server wasn't a crime, it was suspicious. What was definitely a crime, however, was knowingly sending classified information over a private server.

       That's not the right attitude.

       We

       I actually don't think that Obama has said anything against Trump.
       <br/>
       However, these articles are attempting to spin something Obama said recently to seem otherwise.  Using words like 'indirectly' and 'implied.'
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like Obama would just come out and say these things instead of allude to them.  So I doubt he said them.

       Sure.  The Franklin Scandal is a good start, but there are many more.  Before you dismiss it, you should understand that these behaviors are part of their religion.
