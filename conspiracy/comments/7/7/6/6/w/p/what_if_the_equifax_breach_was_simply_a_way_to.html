       this is such a misconception. do idiots in the MSM make stupid mistakes, sure. Do politicians have stupid gaffes, sure. Was George Junior a moron? Sure.

       <strong>
        they

       (them) are not stupid. They control most of everything, and are capable of shutting down anything they don't. That's why people have been digging at uncovering this for decades and cannot convince the public, or expose

       why, voter ID's goes against what they need. they dont want people voting. identification however gives them things they need. info, trends and identification.

       How they end up claiming these Chip IDs are not valid enough for voting will be an interesting spin.

       I do think we should rule out that the Equifax "breach" was a look-the other-way arrangement between Equifax and the US Deep State/ intelligence community. The Government has a lot of information about people, but the vast amount of commercial/credit data from Equifax will have given the intelligence agencies a much more 3D profile on just about every citizen in the United States (and hundreds of millions in other countries).

       Well, Occam's Razor shouldn't be used when human nature is involved.  In scientific setting, it's a great tool, you can't really apply it if someone is trying to obscure or do something in secret. It's just a way of controlling people's thoughts and to brow beat them for thinking outside the box. If you use Occam's Razor on most conspiracies before they were discovered, it wouldn't work. You think people in the 70's &amp; 80's could have believed the CIA was selling weapons to Iran, then buy drugs in South America and shipping them in... "Well according to Occam's Razor, the easier explanation is it's just drug cartels." The powers that be must love it, how about the Nayirah testimony, you think most people could have thought that she was trained by a PR firm to sell the idea Iraq soldiers were killing incubator babies?

         In states that don't comply with Real ID, citizens have to get passports, which already are national IDs.

       SSNs being obsoleted just opens up another avenue for a national ID. Once this happens, bank accounts will be tied to a single personal identifier. Control the money, control the people.

       If you go to the Equifax website and type in everything about yourself, they will enter you into a sweepstakes where the prize is they will tell you if your personal information was hacked already or will be hacked later.
