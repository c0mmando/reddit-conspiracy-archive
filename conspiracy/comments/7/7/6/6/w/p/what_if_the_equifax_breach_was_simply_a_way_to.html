    <div class="md"><p>this is such a misconception. do idiots in the MSM make stupid mistakes, sure. Do politicians have stupid gaffes, sure. Was George Junior a moron? Sure. </p>

<p>But <strong>they</strong> (them) are not stupid. They control most of everything, and are capable of shutting down anything they don&#39;t. That&#39;s why people have been digging at uncovering this for decades and cannot convince the public, or expose <strong>them</strong>. </p>

<p>Underestimating your enemy is the most critical mistake you will make. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think we should rule out that the Equifax &quot;breach&quot; was a look-the other-way arrangement between Equifax and the US Deep State/ intelligence community. The Government has a lot of information about people, but the vast amount of commercial/credit data from Equifax will have given the intelligence agencies a much more 3D profile on just about every citizen in the United States (and hundreds of millions in other countries).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Occam&#39;s Razor shouldn&#39;t be used when human nature is involved.  In scientific setting, it&#39;s a great tool, you can&#39;t really apply it if someone is trying to obscure or do something in secret. It&#39;s just a way of controlling people&#39;s thoughts and to brow beat them for thinking outside the box. If you use Occam&#39;s Razor on most conspiracies before they were discovered, it wouldn&#39;t work. You think people in the 70&#39;s &amp; 80&#39;s could have believed the CIA was selling weapons to Iran, then buy drugs in South America and shipping them in... &quot;Well according to Occam&#39;s Razor, the easier explanation is it&#39;s just drug cartels.&quot; The powers that be must love it, how about the Nayirah testimony, you think most people could have thought that she was trained by a PR firm to sell the idea Iraq soldiers were killing incubator babies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has already been in the works with Real ID. Some state IDs are no longer accepted on flights, and several more will be dropped next year.</p>

<p>This ultimately creates a de facto national ID:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>State licenses that are Real ID compliant are now in a federal database.</p></li>
<li><p>In states that don&#39;t comply with Real ID, citizens have to get passports, which already are national IDs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>SSNs being obsoleted just opens up another avenue for a national ID. Once this happens, bank accounts will be tied to a single personal identifier. Control the money, control the people.</p>
