        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>OK so here&#39;s a photo of the broken out window in Room 32-135 <strong>(the suite.)</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/eW13iA5">photo</a></strong></p>

<p>Only the bottom  two thirds of the window are broken out and most of the glass near the bottom is gone except for that thin strip along the bottom window sill.  </p>

<p>I came across a video that was allegedly taken sometime in the early morning hours of October 2 before the sun came up.  It&#39;s basically a guy trying to zoom in on the window of <strong>the adjoining room</strong> 32-134.  I grabbed a screen shot, then cropped it and sharpened it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/ZU4kx4e">Broken window Room 32-134</a></strong></p>

<p>Pretty much the whole window has been knocked out except for that piece in the upper third part of the window that juts out from the left. and a big jagged piece at the extreme bottom left.  If I was a shooter, I would have at least finished off the piece at the top.  You wouldn&#39;t want that falling off and hitting you.</p>

<p>By the next morning when only the bottom half of that adjoining room window had plywood over it, it looks like someone <em>had</em> knocked out that dangerous piece.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/wBB03E1">Daytime photo Room 32-134 broken window</a></strong></p>

<p>Also, what are those white spots at the bottom left of the window where there is still glass?  Are those bullet holes?</p>

<p>Finally, there was an account from a hotel guest that was staying in the room directly below in 31-132.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article177047656.html">Kansas man was in the hotel room right below the Vegas shooter during the massacre</a></strong></p>

<p>His name was Floyd Conrade and after hearing the gunshots, he was using an app on his phone to listen to the police chatter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He heard officers over the radio announce the gunman’s room number. It was one digit off from his: 31-134 and adjoining room 135. Stephen Paddock, the shooter, was in 32-134 and adjoining room 135.</p>

<p>That’s when he knew the gunfire he’d heard had been coming from directly above.</p>

<p>Conrade felt safe through it all because of the concrete between him and a mass murderer.</p>

<p>The explosion above that signified officers breaching Paddock’s room startled Conrade more than the gunfire did.</p>

<p><strong>The gunfire was surprisingly quiet from within his room.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If most of the shots were being fired from Paddock&#39;s suite instead of the adjoining room above Conrade&#39;s room, then they wouldn&#39;t be as loud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The footsteps of investigators combing the room seemed loud. <strong>Glass crunched beneath their feet.</strong> The footfalls padded across his ceiling through the night. Conrade could tell their probe was intent, thorough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Archived story in case original disappears.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://archive.is/ozPxX">http://archive.is/ozPxX</a></strong></p>

<p>The glass crunching beneath the police&#39;s feet is what I don&#39;t get.  If a shooter had knocked the glass out with a hammer in that room, wouldn&#39;t most/all of the glass have fallen <strong>out</strong> of the room rather than being on the floor inside the room?</p>

<p>Is it possible that the window to Room 32-134 was shot at from the outside?  If someone was shooting from the outside, they may not have been able to see that the jagged piece in the upper left part of the window was still there.  Someone inside the room would have known, though, and it seems like they would have knocked out that piece so it didn&#39;t later fall on them.</p>

<p>I dunno.  What do y&#39;all think?</p>

<p>The shills are especially bad in the regular subreddit I normally post in.  It&#39;s political in nature, but our mods have seldom banned anyone.  It&#39;s mostly Bernie supporters over there, but we don&#39;t ban supporters of Hillary or Trump.  We&#39;re not a very big forum 11.4 k subscribers.  There&#39;s generally 200-300 readers at any given time, but late at night in the wee hours we can have as many as 2,000 readers and in five minutes, its back down to 200-30 and most of the posts that make Establishment Democrats look bad are the ones that get downvoted.</p>

Those floor to ceiling windows are fairly high.  High enough that you&#39;d have to raise your arm to get at that glass at the very top of that window, yet you leave that big  jagged piece near the top just hanging there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone know if the shooter stood AT the window?  If this attack was planned out to do maximum damage, surely the shooter would plan on shooting from inside the room...you know, like snipers do.  I realize snipers do it for concealment, and obviously that wasn&#39;t the goal here, but they also do that for protection from return fire.  My first thought about this whole event was why there apparently was no attempt to shoot back.  Maybe it&#39;s because there wasn&#39;t a clear shot because he was too far back in the room.</p>

<p>You have a dude reigning bullets down into a defenseless crowd for like 12 straight minutes.  That&#39;s a LONG time.  You mean there&#39;s not a single police officer on that strip or nearby area with a rifle in the trunk because he&#39;s on the sniper team? Yes I realize that shooting at the side of a hotel with innocent people in it is generally a bad idea.  I&#39;m talking about a trained officer with a sniper rifle taking a calculated risk.  Apparently my idea of how many cops are part of these special SWAT/sniper teams is off.  Where I live, in the quiet midwest, it sure seems like about half of them take part in that special training and have that military equipment in their patrol car.  We all are aware of how police departments have been so heavily militarized and how there are lots of cops that love to pretend they are rambo on these teams.  But apparently of the hundreds of security personnel and cops in one of the most heavily patrolled parts of this country, there wasn&#39;t a single one trained a sniper with his rifle in the trunk?  </p>

<p>Dude is actively making hamburger out of a dense crowd and the response is to carefully take 45 minutes to make it to his room like this was a passive hostage situation?  Or maybe attempts WERE made to take him out and they don&#39;t want us to know how badly that turned out (maybe that&#39;s the cause of the second broken window?)?  </p>

<p>Is there a single thing about this whole event that makes sense?  This is vegas, there is hours of security footage of this guy from the days and hours leading up to this that they aren&#39;t releasing.  Why not?  Only non-conspiracy reason I can come up with is that they are looking for an accomplice or two and don&#39;t want want to spook them so they flee the country or something.  Hard to imagine that being the situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>id really love to see a video of someone firing an AR-15 from 400 yards at the rate the shooter was firing and still hitting the target. </p>

<p>as has already been said, just move the barrel by an inch in any direction and he&#39;d completely miss the crowd.</p>

<p>ive never fired an AR-15, i have no idea how easy or hard it might be, but it does seem like you could control it, especially on a stand, but i wonder how accurate it is at this speed from that distance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say for certain what did or didn&#39;t occur that night, but I do have some thoughts on the information you&#39;ve linked.</p>

<p>Regarding rate of fire, total mass of the firearm will have an impact on the rate of fire. A few years back, a handful of folks in the AR community started tinkering with the &quot;Bump SAW&quot; concept. One of the lessons learned was that, due to the reciprocating nature of the firearm, things that increased mass (like drum magazines) tended to reduce rate of fire. The counter to this, of course, is that as the larger magazines run dry, the rate of fire tends to speed up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you just hit on something really important.  </p>

<p>With the mass changing between a full vs empty magazine of that size, a bumpstock wouldn&#39;t fire at a steady rate.  It should slowly and measurably speed up.</p>

<p>I totally agree - which is why the FBI or whoever removed it the following day.  And yes - those shards could have fallen out and hit someone on the ground.  They also could have hit <strong>the shooter</strong> if his head was poking out the window, so my question is - why didn&#39;t the shooter make sure he got that last piece?</p>

<p>If you were the shooter and you were firing from that window, would <strong>you</strong> want that glass shard hanging over <strong>your</strong> head?</p>

<p>And why was there enough glass in 32-134 for the man in the room below to be able to hear it crunching underneath the investigator&#39;s feet?  If you were breaking it from the inside, as the shooter was alleged to have done, wouldn&#39;t most/all of the glass be <strong>outside</strong> the room?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying ur thought is wrong bcuz it does make great sense, but if you were to smash glass towards the bottom which it obviously wasnt smashed from the top, glass from above is destined to fall straight down(on to the floor/window sill) so it could give a reasonable amount of glass around the window but thru the room?

    <div class="md"><p>boots pick up glass so any officer who walked over to peer out the &quot;vantage point&quot; and then back across the room might happen to pick up small ammounts of glass and track it.. </p>

<p>also when you break a window, doesnt really matter the size past about 1ft x 1ft depending on the vibrational frequency with which you break the glass some of the glass may actually &quot;snap&quot; back INTO the room while the rest would naturally go out. Glass rebounds, especially the larger pieces to allow for: expansion, contraction, wind gusts, the everyday idiot who bumbs/pushes on those huge resort windows; this rebounding effect <em>could</em> have &quot;tossed&quot;, if you will, some glass back into the room. </p>

<p>certain &quot;breachers&quot;  will shatter glass within a certain space, resorts have a decent ammount of glass in their rooms that would break in the event of a &quot;breach&quot; into the room. </p>

<p>Granted... why is there not much glass in the &quot;leaked&quot; photo&#39;s, hearing an abundant ammount of footsteps &quot;all over&quot; the room after a crime is slightly irregular since most of it would have been &quot;taped&quot; off after the swat &quot;secured&quot; the area until forensic investigators arrived at which point 1-2 highly trained individuals would systematically comb through the room not walk all willy-nilly over it for hours on end.  </p>

<p>I would imagine that the second breach into the adjoining room would have to be stronger, because they have to blast through two doors.  If Paddock opens the connecting door from the suite, there&#39;s still another door behind that and it has to be opened from the other room.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe they opened the door on Paddock&#39;s side, and then blasted through the other door.</p>

<p>BTW, I did the virtual tour of the suite and found the connecting door.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/tx15gcS">Connecting door</a></strong></p>

<p>It seems as though the suite in the virtual tour has the reverse layout from Paddocks suite, so I mirrored it. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/XF145ur">Mirror Image</a></strong></p>

<p>That matches the <strong><a href="https://imgur.com/aXYePUf">floor plan of Paddock&#39;s Suite</a></strong></p>

<p>The connecting door is between the bathroom to the right of the double door entrance and that living area where the courch, chairs and TV is.</p>

<p>Have you seen this video yet?  Before you play it, you have to set the speed at .25 or you&#39;ll miss it.  I&#39;ve started it at 0:44.  Between 0:45 and 0:46 thered a flash and all the windows in that suite light up.  At least I think its that suite.  It looks to be at about the right level.</p>

<p>If you were breaking it from the inside, as the shooter was alleged to have done, wouldn&#39;t most/all of the glass be outside the room?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have an inside version, nor am I going to try breaking my window.</p>

<p>But I googled a video of someone breaking a home window if that helps!  A decent amount seems to fall on the side of it being broken.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZC16AkIWIY">Video</a></p>

<p>Hopefully the video helps show that, I don&#39;t have sound and simply watched glass fall a decent amount on the side he was breaking from.</p>

<p>Now hearing footsteps of crunch, don&#39;t know.  I can hear people walking around in some hotels above me.  So I suppose crunching glass is possible.  Haven&#39;t walked on glass, don&#39;t know how loud it goes crunch.</p>

<p>What I thought was interesting is that initially, I didn&#39;t see any kind of listing for Vista Suite which is the 1,705 sq ft suite that Paddock had, but when I changed &quot;resort-queen&quot; to &quot;vista-suite&quot; in the URL, it came up.

<p>Well supposedly he was.  I guess we&#39;d know more if he could see crime scene photos from the adjoining room.  There should be evidence if shots were being fired from there - like casings.  We don&#39;t even know if the police found any guns at all in that second room.  </p>

<p>And I&#39;d <em>still</em> like to know why that Brian Hodge guy says that <em>he</em> was the registered guest in 32-134, but the police and the media are reporting the adjacent room was rented to Paddock.  </p>

I know that the big room had a name and not [just] a number, so perhaps the small one labelled as 32134 is actually 32135?  I appreciate the effort man, but I can&#39;t make any judgements without good evidence.  The fact that the suite and the room next door were joined by a door could be a factor though.  It seems as if both the suite and adjoining room are being referred to as &#39;Room 32135&#39;.  More research needed, I think.</p>

<p>No because the smaller room 32-134 is the one that had the room service cart in front of it.  Most of the photos of that room service cart don&#39;t go up high enough to show the room number by the door, but I found one that did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, as stated in my OP, Paddock was supposedly running back and forth from window to window. That would have produced even louder footsteps never mentioned. If police walking around seemed &quot;loud&quot; surely a man frantically running back and forth between windows possibly with weapons/ammo in tow would be &quot;loud&quot; as well. Why weren&#39;t these &quot;loud&quot; footsteps during the &quot;quiet&quot; gunfire mentioned? </p>

<p>Why was it surprising, though? Is this guy a weapons expert who would expect the sound from that type of gun at that distance to have been much louder? Or is this a guy who has never heard a real-life gun fired in his life, therefore has nothing to compare it to?</p>

<p>There are other items in the room that could have broken, or been broken by the SWAT breach. Also, those are gigantic, double- or triple-paned glass.</p>

<p>Is it possible that the window to Room 32-134 was shot at from the outside? If someone was shooting from the outside, they may not have been able to see that the jagged piece in the upper left part of the window was still there.</p>

<p>Maybe? I think you&#39;d need more evidence than &quot;the glass wasn&#39;t broken all the way and there were some odd-colored dots that look like they may be bullet holes but I&#39;m not sure&quot;.</p>

<p>There are a lot of legitimate questions and oddities surrounding this incident, but a lot of the stuff that&#39;s getting posted is just confirmation bias. People are looking for any little clue or inconsistency that will PROVE their grand theory and BLOW THIS WIDE OPEN! Its notable that, rather than doing more research into previously noted inconsistencies, these posts are NEW info/stuff no one has thought of before/&quot;Why isn&#39;t anyone talking about X?&quot;.

<p>Glass falling to the inside of the room makes sense, just like when a car window gets smashed from the outside, plenty of glass falls on the outside of the car, it doesn&#39;t all fall into the car. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s where things don&#39;t make sense. Look into the windows. There is video and picture evidence that it&#39;s possible the suite window was not broken until at least 3 volleys of fire. And perhaps as a late as the last 2 shots heard (when the bus stop video, they hear glass falling on the 2nd to last shot) - if that evidence is correct, that only leaves 32-134 if there is indeed a lone gunman. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s run with that for a moment.</p>

<p>Now, contradictory to that, the undersheriff claimed only semi-automatic fire came from 32-134. How he can make that assumption, who knows, however, that&#39;s his claim. A witness was interviewed who was staying in 31-134. His claim was the first round or two sounded like fireworks going on. The third volley he claimed was extremely loud and he could tell was directly above him; even had debris hitting his window. </p>

<p>For one, that discredits the undersheriff claim. The witness describes automatic fire coming from directly above his room. For 2, if the first shots sounded like fireworks 1 room up, and 1 room away, were those shots coming from 32-135? </p>

<p>If his testimony is true, as well as the photo/video evidence of 32-135 not being tampered with until at least 3 volleys of fire had expired, then we could only conclude the first 2 volleys were NOT from 32-134 OR 32-135 of Mandalay Bay, UNLESS, they were down the hall towards Campos and Co. </p>

<p>Why would he close 32-134 and then run back around to the suite to kill himself by shooting himself in the <em>chest</em> is a great question. Maybe the wind blew it shut and it has some sort of automatic locking deadbolt? Who knows. </p>

They tried knocking them out with regular claw hammers and couldn&#39;t even chip them.  They needed to get 10 lbs. sledges to break them and still had to beat on them multiple times.
