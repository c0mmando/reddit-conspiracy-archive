    <div class="md"><p>I use in the sense given by one of the premier Liberals of the 20th century, Bertrand Russell, who prized, almost as commandment, the thought: &#39;Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.&#39;</p>

<p>Along with the likewise characteristic liberal notions: &#39;When you meet with opposition...endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this exactly what I mean, all under the cover of ostensibly extending liberalism, when it is, in fact, its inherent opposite: identitaranism implies the denial of universal liberalism on the grounds that to argue for universalism is in itself to practice a form of Western hegemonic control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultural Marxism was The Frankfurt School&#39;s critique of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">The Culture Industry</a>. It was an early critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism. Adorno had things like this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Culture Industry not so much adapts to the reactions of its customers as it counterfeits them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ruthless unity in the culture industry is evidence of what will happen in politics. Marked differentiations such as those of A and B films, or of stories in magazines in different price ranges, depend not so much on subject matter as on classifying, organising, and labelling consumers. Something is provided for all so that none may escape&quot; -Theodor W. Adorno, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">Enlightenment as mass-deception</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile Marcuse warned everyone that &quot;progressive politics&quot; could also become repressive and regressive in it&#39;s own ways:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs</a></p>

<p>...and The Birmingham School warned that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#The_.22drift.22">culture was drifting away</a> from local culture. Due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#Massification_of_culture">Massification of culture in the form of the globalization of media + tabloid journalism.</a></p>

<p>This was a pre-internet critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism, and ended around the time media became more democratized in the 80s, when the internet began to be foreshadowed with Zines, DIY culture, and public radio/TV. That&#39;s when the tail end of the Birmingham School declared the need to critique mass media <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication">to be kind of over because everyone could talk to everyone.</a></p>

<p>....of course, the right wing conspiracy theorists will say it&#39;s SJWs and a jewish plot that runs the media... but it was actually critiquing the media.</p>

<p>the alternative - a total free market - is worse as there are hierarchical structures that will manifest out of this that are retarded and generally deadly to the tree of human potential.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultural Marxism was The Frankfurt School&#39;s critique of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">The Culture Industry</a>. It was an early critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism. Adorno had things like this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Culture Industry not so much adapts to the reactions of its customers as it counterfeits them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ruthless unity in the culture industry is evidence of what will happen in politics. Marked differentiations such as those of A and B films, or of stories in magazines in different price ranges, depend not so much on subject matter as on classifying, organising, and labelling consumers. Something is provided for all so that none may escape&quot; -Theodor W. Adorno, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">Enlightenment as mass-deception</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile Marcuse warned everyone that &quot;progressive politics&quot; could also become repressive and regressive in it&#39;s own ways:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs</a></p>

<p>...and The Birmingham School warned that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#The_.22drift.22">culture was drifting away</a> from local culture. Due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#Massification_of_culture">Massification of culture in the form of the globalization of media + tabloid journalism.</a></p>

<p>This was a pre-internet critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism, and ended around the time media became more democratized in the 80s, when the internet began to be foreshadowed with Zines, DIY culture, and public radio/TV. That&#39;s when the tail end of the Birmingham School declared the need to critique mass media <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication">to be kind of over because everyone could talk to everyone.</a></p>

<p>....of course, the right wing conspiracy theorists will say it&#39;s SJWs and a jewish plot that runs the media... but it was actually critiquing the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultural Marxism was an early critique of &quot;Mass Culture&quot; by The Frankfurt School who essentially saw capitalism as a unifying ideology found within all mass media.</p>

<p>They saw mass culture as being produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">The Culture Industry</a>, a term they coined. They claimed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The inherent danger of the culture industry is the cultivation of false psychological needs that can only be met and satisfied by the products of capitalism; thus Adorno and Horkheimer especially perceived mass-produced culture as dangerous to the more technically and intellectually difficult high arts. In contrast, true psychological needs are freedom, creativity, and genuine happiness, which refer to an earlier demarcation of human needs, established by Herbert Marcuse. (See Eros and Civilization, 1955).[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need a solid example, Marilyn Manson is essentially performing a Cultural Marxist critique at 1:50 of this clip:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/oeQ4HWhPEdA?t=1m50s">https://youtu.be/oeQ4HWhPEdA?t=1m50s</a></p>

<p>As Adorno puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Culture Industry not so much adapts to the reactions of its customers as it counterfeits them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s some further reading in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jobrot/sandbox/Cultural_Marxist">this Wikipedia draft article</a> and in this <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">Adorno essay.</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting, other&#39;s have gone even further than The Frankfurt School. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq8A_8gUc3Y&amp;amp;t=500s">Here is an educational resource</a> which claims people used to think of themselves as serfs of an empire, identifying with a small geographical region and localized traditions... and then at some stage (around WW1) the idea of &quot;The Nation&quot; was created by homogenizing those local traditions into national songs, traditions, and a national character - often for the purpose of going to war (ie for nationalistic propaganda).</p>

<p>This tradition of questioning and rejecting the messages of capitalism stems all the way back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandervogel">The Wandervogel</a> - who were youth groups that would hike across Europe trying to escape the noise and pollution of city life during the early industrial revolution.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough Cultural &quot;Marxism&quot; is only really called that because it&#39;s a critique of capitalism (The Frankfurt School also critiqued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Marxism:_A_Critical_Analysis">Soviet Marxism</a> and were closer to humanists and Social Democrats than Marxists).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Contemporary_Cultural_Studies">The Birmingham School</a> could also be called &quot;Cultural Marxists&quot; but for some reason there&#39;s less criticism of them (they were specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#Massification_of_culture">worried about losing localized British culture</a>).</p>

<p>....and it goes without saying it&#39;s ALSO a conspiracy theory about how Gays, Subversives, Jews and Communists run Hollywood and Academia. As right wing kook <a href="http://www.marylandthursdaymeeting.com/Archives/SpecialWebDocuments/Cultural.Marxism.htm">William S. Lind</a> has it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, when the cultural Marxists want to do something like “normalize” homosexuality, they do not argue the point philosophically. They just beam television show after television show into every American home where the only normal-seeming white male is a homosexual (the Frankfurt School’s key people spent the war years in Hollywood*).</p>

<p>The next conservatism needs to reveal the man behind the curtain - - old Karl Marx himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>*Lind is factually incorrect here, no one from The Frankfurt School went on to work in the Hollywood media industry.</p>

<p>For some reason the right side of politics (and particularly the alt-right), believe the people who were warning of mass-cultures manipulations - were actually fond of mass culture (a 180 from what The Frankfurt School were actually saying).</p>
