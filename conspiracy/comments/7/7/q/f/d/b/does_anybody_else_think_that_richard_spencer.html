       Spencer and his little Nazi followers seem so obviously fake to me. Just like the neo-Nazis that Soros funded in Ukraine and elsewhere. Spencer strikes me as controlled opposition, whose purpose is to start a race war. Claims to be a Trump supporter, but has done more damage to Trump's image than anyone else. People would not be so afraid to say they support Trump if they weren't afraid of being labeled Nazis like Spencer and his dumb sig heiling minions/actors. That whole film was a very effective op. His background is quite suspicious, too... I think CIA

       Pretty sure I read someplace he voted Obama and/or donated to the DNC in the past so I agree. This dude is just here to stoke some coals and smear the right.   A quick google found this

       Yeah exactly. The more you read about his background, the more obvious it becomes that he's a total establishment crony. It's all an act and he's serving a very clear purpose

       Yes. His speeches are strategic in location.  He always wants to associate Trump with his movement, which I find odd. Most white supremacist are anti Catholic and anti Jew and Trump has a Jewish son in law and Catholic wife.  Nothing adds up with this guy.

       For sure. And he claims to be such a Trump fan, but all he does is make Trump look bad, stir up anti-Trump hysteria, and continue fueling the "Trump supporters are Nazis" narrative. I also find it very strange that the most incriminating stuff he and his followers could possibly do, like freaking sieg heiling each other after the election like a bunch of lunatics and marching around with tiki torches chanting about Jews.... somehow that always manages to get recorded by in crystal clear, professional quality film by CIA-run news orgs like Vice. Like why are news outlets invited to events like the crazy tiki torch march but no one else who attended that protest knew about the march? It was an exclusive, secret march supposedly... yet Vice was invited? It's just so obviously fake

       I was absolutely thinking Spencer, and many of his supporters, are part of some op.

        this story
       </a>
       about 3 Spencer supporters being arrested.  Two of them egged on the other to shoot his gun at protesters.  That strikes me as COINTELPRO agent provocateur behavior.

       Exactly! I was just seeing that story pop up all over my fb too which is why I was driven to post this theory again. I'd been thinking this about Spencer for a while, then Charlottesville with the tiki torches just like other Soros ops made it pretty obvious this shit is all staged. And now, once again, there are these ridiculous Nazis fighting people in the news. Like who are these guys? No one ever knows them. Their background stories never check out. It's all just so cinematic and perfect for the establishment narrative when this stuff happens. Maybe there's a small number of alt right people who are awful enough to actually like/follow Spencer and who don't see how they're being used, but for the most part I think the vast majority of these "Nazis" are hired and Spencer absolutely is working for the CIA.

       Yup. They push him on the public so hard. I guess they do that with anything that they think will make Trump look bad though. But the Spencer stuff is different because he knows he's making Trump look bad, yet we're supposed to believe he actually supports Trump? And his background and family connections... so suspicious

       Looks just like the Ops as they started in Ukraine. I'll have no sympathy or compassion for any group that arms up and takes to the streets if they fall under this freak or antifa.

       Absolutely seems like an FBI or ATF informant, more leaning FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI is well known to infiltrate groups and convince people to agree to crimes, and then bust them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing as this guy was at Occupy and an Obama campaigner, and now he's is some matzo, that screams FBI informant

       Really? CIA has done all the most evil shit throughout history and are the ones with all the main connections to the gloablists like bezos and soros. CIA was using Clinton Foundation as a front,  trafficking weapons and people, laundering money, toppling regimes, and George Webb's research showed that CIA plan was to create basically a race war in the US next. So I'm confused why people are commenting and saying someone like Spencer would be FBI, that doesn't make sense to me. This isn't FBI's mo as far as I know. It is CIA's

       And yes part of his assignment is to make not just Trump look bad, but to make the entire right wing look bad in the yes of the left. But if you think Trump isn't part of the same project, then you're dead wrong. Part of Trump's assignment is also to make the right look bad. And Clinton's assignment is to make the left look bad to the people on the right.  They're all players on a stage whose main goal is to keep us angry and pointing fingers at each other so their masters can continue to keep us docile, productive, and above all under control.

       Well, we shall see. So far the god-emperor looks pretty dang good to me ðŸ‘Œ But I agree with your sentiment- the establishment wants us to fight and hate each other. The best thing we can do for ourselves and for the country is to get along, have empathy for each other, be level-headed and rational, and not allow society to plunge into the violent chaos that they want. These obvious plants like Spencer piss me off so much

       Come on, man. What are you even doing in a conspiracy sub if your thinking doesn't extend beyond the most mainstream, heavily pushed narratives we hear on every news channel and read in every newspaper, everyday? I mean the second sentence you wrote is word for word what the "commentators" on all of the mainstream news channels have been saying for over a year now... Do you actually believe that? If so, then again I wonder what brings you to a conspiracy sub of all places- one of the only forums where you don't expect to see blind acceptance of the mainstream arguments. If that's what you believe and that's all that you want to even consider being possible, then you can post pretty much anywhere else on the internet about how Trump is magically sprouting white supremacists across the land and everyone will eat it up. But in this sub, people tend to think a little harder and question a little further.

       What? Nice try, but what you just wrote is nonsensical. The sentence you quoted is literally a statement about feelings that I and other Trump supporters I know have experienced. So yes, that specific sentence IS based entirely on feeeeelings. The theory that Spencer is working for the CIA, however, is based on logical reasoning  and analysis of Spencer's family history, schooling, career, political and social affiliations prior to the Trump presidential campaign, locations where he was living, timing and locations of his publicity stunts, funding sources, and more. You can read the evidence, yourself, if you'd like- people have posted plenty of links to it in the comments section here.

       How many have you met in real life? All I see on my social media feeds are stories about these Nazis everywhere. I've yet to actually meet a single neo-nazi or a single person who even remotely likes Spencer. You don't see any support for him on Pol. No support for him on T_D. No support for him from Trump supporters on Twitter or any pro-Trump forum of any kind. So again, I wonder, where are these young nazi guys coming from who are in all of he news pictures and Vice videos? Who knows anyone who knows anyone who knows anyone who knows any of them?

       Ok well I appreciate that you're discussing this like a rational person rather than calling me crazy, racist, etc.. I'm not posting them here, but I have other sources that haven't been posted yet. I will try to post them later. But what I'll say is there is something... a lot of things that are off about this guy. The title of my post was a question, not a statement of fact. And I just think he's working for someone, maybe it's not the CIA, maybe it's a different intel org like other commenters have suggested, maybe it's Soros, maybe it's Russia, I don't know.  My larger point is that his shit seems super staged and his entire persona appears to be manufactured and doesn't align with his family and his past. And all of it is being used to cause a lot of hatred and fighting and chaos, which serves a purpose for certain nefarious institutions whether I can prove they're orchestrating it directly or not. Either way, it's benefiting those entities and hurting the American people. Anyway I'm simply raising a question and getting people to consider this possibility. And I'm writing it in a conspiracy sub for discussion, not printing it in a university text book. If this isn't the forum for these types of questions and discussions then what is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when my post gets linked in the top of Minds sub then downvoted into oblivion, it certainly raises my suspicions further. Because there are only really these few reasons why people would do that: (1) they're protecting Richard Spencer or (2) they're protecting the CIA or (3) protecting both. Who would do that? Why?

       How so?  The fact that he voted for Kerry?  He says he didn't like the Iraq War, a position which is consistent with his American isolationism (and Trump, fwiw).

       There are two problems with this.  First, the enthusiasm for speculative and counter-intuitive claims masquerades as an actual
       <em>
        argument
       </em>
       for these claims.  That's an issue for many conspiracy theories.  Second, there are people literally shouting that they are nazis, and you're trying to suggest without evidence they aren't actually nazis - so we should do nothing about the fact that there is a living, breathing nazi movement in America.  That is one hell of a risk to take, based entirely on a gut feeling.

       Or 4) they think your claim is funny.  Look at it this way: an easy way to discredit someone is to make them a laughingstock.  Your theory is that Spencer is a plant, so shouldn't part of the effect be to make him (and causes associated with him) look ridiculous and therefore funny?  Your own theory entails that this all this funny to someone, somewhere.  Of course, the reasoning in this paragraph is redundant, since it is much easier to say that people just find your claim funny without having to explain that through CIA influence.

       I get that you guys posted this to Top Minds because you think it's funny/entertaining. What doesn't make sense is that you would then come directly to this sub and downvote my original post as much as possible because you think it's funny. Really? That's a completely illogical justification for why your group is downvoting this post. If you guys really thought this theory was hilarious and made Trump supporters look so stupid then, if anything, you'd be upvoting this. Try again.

       1) You're right, and you have evidence of this.  So, tell the admins and get Top Minds spanked for breaking site wide rules.

       2) You're right, but you have no evidence.  If you've got no evidence, why do you believe it in the first place?

       I've been searching for people talking about this because it seems insane to me, something else is going on. Maybe it's my imagination, but the people he is supposed to represent, the people who march, are usually not fans of homosexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he is trying to impress daddy, stay in the will or something. That is the most obvious answer, if we use occhams razor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or he's CIA. But to me sending Spencer in to the white supremacist movement to subvert it or make it look bad is along the lines of sending Martin Lawrence to Big Momma's House. It makes you wonder who he is fooling, driving to the hoop like that.

       Half of America isn't racist, but the media likes to portray it that way. That was my point. If half of America was so racist, why does this no name clown get all the attention? No one ever heard of the guy before a few months to a year ago and now he's the spokesman for all the white supremacists, which is half of America according to media. Nonsense is what it is.

       How big is his following? How many people showed up in DC when around 50 media members showed up? Like 200 I think. How many in Charlottesville because not every person there was part of his "movement"? He is a NOBODY and is of NO importance except to spread this false narrative. Why no coverage of black supremacist groups in America? Why no coverage of muslim supremacist groups? Now GFY and sleep well.

       They were indeed part of the movement of they showed up for the cause and weren't there to protest. He is a somebody, as he gets coverage, his speeches has an audience, and he makes people like you apparently uncomfortable enough to try to make anything other than the racists he is. :L

       Spencer is very likely an intelligence agent. I theorize he's being used to smear any far-right opposition to the current globalist narrative by constantly having his rallies/speeches associated with Nazis.

       Once again, a post masquerading as a conspiracy but in reality just wants to embolden Trump support. Fuck this noise. WAKE THE FUCK UP. Trump is the controlled opposition. This is all a fucking game and we're the pieces.Why on earth has that point been lost on this sub?

       It couldn't damage Trump's image if he didn't align himself with them.  Sorry guys, but this is pretty irrational and delusional.  The dude is a white supremacist, and yes he is pretty stupid and silly.  But the correct conclusion to reach is to say, "wow, maybe the president should do more to sh5it these people up and not "oh man they must be dem plants."

       Trump doesn't align himself with Spencer- quite the opposite, he's publicly disavowed the neo nazi idiots over and over again. Spencer is the one who aligns himself with Trump and publicly praises Trump every chance he gets. And by doing so, he riles up anti-Trump craziness and feeds the MSM "Trump is a Nazi" narrative. That makes perfect sense for someone who has an agenda to sabotage and destroy Trump. It doesn't make sense for someone who is actually a Trump supporter. It's that simple.

       Except they align themselves with Trump because of his rhetoric and beliefs.  They aren't aligning with him in a vacuum, they have reasons.  Also, it's worth noting Trump specifically wouldn't reject David duke' s endorsement of him, instead saying that he didn't k ow who the person was so he couldn't comment, which is obviously a bunch of nonsense.  Trump invites this stuff, case in point, there are fine people on both sides...

       That whole Charlottesville thing with the tiki torches looked 100% like a movie scene. The number of actual white supremacists in America is so minute it's not worth anywhere the amount of time the media and politicians give them.

       What? Nice try, but what you just wrote is nonsensical. The sentence you quoted is literally a statement about feelings that I and other Trump supporters I know have experienced. So yes, that specific sentence IS based entirely on feeeeelings. The theory that Spencer is working for the CIA, however, is based on logical reasoning  and analysis of Spencer's family history, schooling, career, political and social affiliations prior to the Trump presidential campaign, locations where he was living, timing and locations of his publicity stunts, funding sources, and more. You can read the evidence, yourself, if you'd like- people have posted plenty of links to it in the comments section here.

       Yeah, anyone who doesn't think that they're actual Nazis in the United States are lying to themselves. What the news/gov/whatever does about them or shows them is questionable.
