<p>Anyone who suggests that information should be dismissed <em>because</em> it came from Snopes is committing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">ad hominem</a> fallacy.</p>

<p>If someone provides a link to an article from a disagreeable source, it is the <em>information contained within the article</em> that must be argued for or against; not the source itself.</p>

<p>The problem with discussion in r/Conspiracy is that posts or replies that link to <em>any</em> source are often brigaded with people attempting to disregard those links due to the source, rather than provide arguments against the information. This is <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?IntellectualDishonesty">intellectual dishonesty</a>.</p>

<p>May I suggest it be considered as a rule? &quot;<del>Posts</del> Replies discrediting a source that do not argue against the information provided by a source may be deleted.&quot; You&#39;d get a nice bump in quality control.</p>

<p>What I&#39;d like is for people to stop attacking sources instead of information. I&#39;d like people in r/Conspiracy to be able to think critically and to understand logic, fallacy, and argumentative theory. If that requires quality control in order to &quot;promote&quot;, why not?</p>

Why hide your authoritarian desires through calling it &#39;Quality control&#39;. Don&#39;t censor that which you disagree with.

Obfuscation and cherry picking by sources will muddy the waters, skewing information to suit a particular agenda or hypothesis that itself has been carefully worded in an obtuse manner.

<p>Oh. You are.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like Inception but with ad hominems... Any ways, I have found that snopes will take an issue, look for the most ridiculous claim, and then debunk that while not actually addressing the main issue.  Sometime they will even straight up claim something is false and never change it.  For instance, google &quot;9/11 Put Options&quot;, for me the first link is Snopes, who claim the 9/11 put options were false.  But that&#39;s a flat out lie, Jim Rickards invetsigated the trades with the CIA and claims it&#39;s one of the largest insider trading deals in history.  Yet Snopes, a site dedicated to providing the supposed truth, hasn&#39;t reevaluated their own article since 2005 (even though the topic comes up every year).  They clearly have a bias on various topics, so I use them occasionally for their sources and that&#39;s it.  RecoveringGrace is right in their approach with Snopes, although I also think that&#39;s how one should approach most news or fact checking outlets now a days.  </p>

<p>Because the argument is not provided that if an argument comes from Snopes it is wrong.  The argument was that Snopes has a bad methodology and states wrong conclusions.  Because of this one is justified in dismissing Snopes, one is not justified in dismissing a particular argument that is published in Snopes.  Therefore Snopes is not relevant. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is <a href="https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/3681/does-the-ad-hominem-fallacy-only-apply-when-used-against-individuals-or-is-it-a">debatable</a>, but I see no reason ad hominem would not apply to organizations. Ad hominem is, at its core, an attack on the <em>source</em> rather than the argument. Nothing about its function inherently restricts it to individuals, and the fact that it is classified - more <em>broadly</em>, I might add - as a genetic fallacy, makes it any less appropriate in this case.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What is <em>correct</em> is that when considering an argument, <em>the fact that it came from Snopes</em> is what should be dismissed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The first point is that you are equivocating.  Information is not the same as an argument.  Fallacies pertain to arguments not generic sharing of information.   Secondly it is not an ad-hominem organizaton, as it is a website, not a person, or a group of persons.  It is a fallacy of irrelevance, but not an ad hominem.
