        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) HRC intentionally used a private email server to house all her emails so they could disappear if need be.  This would help cover the tracks for dealing with Russian bribes, kickbacks, &quot;donations&quot; to the Clinton Foundation with respect to uranium deals.
2) Those involved in the uranium deals were also heavily influencing the oversight of her e-mail investigation.
3) HRC knew those who were investigating would happily bury this investigation because it would mean self-incrimination for all parties involved.
4) Comey, through guidance of Mueller, already knew that he wasn&#39;t going to charge HRC with any crime...hence him making a decision before all the facts were in.  Additionally, there&#39;s no way the FBI poured through the countless hundreds of thousands of emails in such a short amount of time.  They didn&#39;t even try.</p>

The actual donations to the Clinton foundation were made in 2008, during the W. Bush Presidency. </p>

<p>Remember how all the W Bush Administration emails were hosted by the Republican National Committee and all &quot;vanished.&quot;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the alleged wrongdoing isn&#39;t that Clinton helped the people who gave donations to the foundation, it&#39;s that she failed to oppose them, something that the secretaries of defense, treasury, and all the other agencies also failed to do, with or without donations to foundations controlled by members of their families.</p>

<p>Also, there will be more details released in the next few days.  We haven&#39;t received the document dump from Wikileaks yet.  However, I&#39;m going to refute the next statement you included, based on logic alone, because I think you are just trying to muddy up the waters.  &quot;Failing to oppose&quot; something which will ultimately result in a &quot;YES&quot; is the same thing as just saying &quot;YES&quot;.  Inaction does not absolve responsibility. </p>

<p>Selling uranium to Russia while taking bribes is treasonous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A motive that goes beyond her wiping her email server to avoid being slapped on the wrist for &quot;storing classified e-mail on it.&quot;  </p>

<p>Also, I am far from an expert on the Clinton Foundation, aside form knowing they are &quot;pay to play&quot;...but when the Clintons can donate their yearly income to their own charity and use it all as a tax write-off...WHILE they can use the Clinton Foundation to pay for private events like their daughter&#39;s multi-million dollar wedding...it&#39;s completely corrupt.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Last year, the State Department said it would need about one year to comb through and release Hillary Clinton’s 30,000 emails, or the 55,000 work-related pages she handed over in March 2015. Yet, we’re to believe the FBI can evaluate roughly 650,000 emails in just eight days.
Either the FBI is incredibly efficient or — more likely — partisan politics has corrupted two departments in our executive branch.</p>
