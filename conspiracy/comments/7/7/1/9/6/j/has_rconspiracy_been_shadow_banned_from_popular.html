Did I miss the part where we were shadow banned ala T_D?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there is an excellent chance i have this wrong, so I welcome any who can explain this apparent disparity.  Thanks in advance!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there was proof we could do something about it. I live entirely in new though, and everything is downvoted out of the box. I see posts that are &lt;30sec old at 0. The My <em>theory</em> behind this is that there is some general suppression technique used to slow our posts from making it to the front page, by hitting quick downvotes to exclude them from the rising algorithm. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean that none of our posts ever get to the front page, it just lessens the chance. Whether that is a server side script, or some kind of group that downvotes everything, or just some bots...I have no idea. I am just describing the behavior pattern I see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I see the confusion, I need to characterize this. I am not saying there is a huge army of bot squatters with a 500 vote swing to completely destroy posts. I am thinking something along the lines of just 3-5 downvotes applied over the course of the first 10min a post is live. If it was instantaneous it would trigger the admins, as would a huge block of 500 downvotes hitting all new posts.</p>

<p>If I set it up, I would hook it into something that records when something is posted and used an RNG across time of post+10min and throws like 5 or 10 downvotes on the post during that 10min window at random intervals. That would keep the bulk of the posts out of Rising and /all, and would probably look mostly organic to anyone with access to the complete data. </p>

<p>So, when something is posted that we really like, it will still break out from this interference and get ranked high enough to trigger rising and /all. Because there are dozens of upvotes coming in on time to offset that little push from the suppression bot, or whatever it is.</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Hit with 3-5 downdoots in the first few minutes so that it can never catch fire? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean front page of subscribers? A post from here that gets into the 500-1000 range very likely won&#39;t be within the top 100 of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. If you subscribe here and you click &quot;home,&quot; you might see the top post on this sub, but there have been days where I don&#39;t see any <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts there. </p>

<p>As for making it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, the post will need a lot of upvotes early on, like within the first 2 hours. You might see a post at 1,500, then after it hits <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, it could gain many thousands more upvotes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, not sure. We get some that have over 1k, that is probably subscriber front page, like you say. So, the ones with 3k+ are probably the ones that get to /all? They don&#39;t happen nearly as often. </p>

<p>And it is the voting in the first 10min that really gets a post moving. So, downvotes at that time are very effective at suppressing posts.</p>
