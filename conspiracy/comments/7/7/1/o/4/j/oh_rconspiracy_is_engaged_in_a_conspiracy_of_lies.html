<p>I agree, it&#39;s kinda fun toying with them at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are pretty strange. I specifically was reminded of their song Owl With Knees (play on words for hours with ease) and All Our Base Are Belong To Them. </p>

<p>I have my reservations on Trump and believing in him in any way, but to each his own and that&#39;s why both of us are here. Trumper or not, reluctance in believing Snopes is a gooooood thing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first voted in 1984, so yeah, I think I&#39;m older than most here.</p>

<p>Today, I looked up what % of the popular vote Clinton actually got because I did remember that Ross Perot took nearly 20% <em>and</em> the electoral college was close.  Turns out, Clinton won with 43.1% of the popular vote, Perot got 18.9% and Bush got 37.5%</p>

<p>No way would Bill have won if not for Ross Perot.  He attracted a lot of the same type of populism as Trump did in 2016. </p>

<p>Anyone remember the &quot;giant sucking sound&quot; of our jobs being vacuumed into Mexico by NAFTA.  His VP, Admiral Stockdale, was a real shit show too.  LOL.</p>

<p>Imagine a third party taking <strong>20%</strong> now?</p>

Its strange to even talk to someone who knows about them, my impetus behind inquiring about that username in the first place, haha. </p>

<p>After googling, I see the cellist also has a solo album. I got some damm research to do, lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like if anything the Clintons suckered the Russians.  lol. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the evidence in Clinton&#39;s favor? Even if Clinton had wanted to make sure the sale was approved, it wouldn&#39;t have been possible for her to do it on her own. CFIUS is made up of not only the Secretary of State, but also the secretaries of Treasury, Justice, Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense, and Energy, as well as the heads of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of Labor are non-voting members, and CFIUS&#39;s work is also observed by representatives of other agencies like the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget. The idea that Clinton could have convinced all those officials and all those departments to change their position on the sale, even if she had wanted to, borders on the absurd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the official who was the State Department&#39;s representative on CFIUS at the time, Jose Hernandez, told Time magazine that Clinton did not participate in the evaluation of this deal: &quot;Secretary Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter,&quot; he said.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Viktor-Yanukovych">https://www.britannica.com/biography/Viktor-Yanukovych</a></p>

<p>Begin reading at paragraph 6 </p>

<p>As president, Yanukovych promptly demonstrated his pro-Russian leanings. In April 2010 he struck a deal with Russian Pres. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dmitry Medvedev to extend Russia’s lease of the port at Sevastopol, the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, until 2042. In exchange, </p>

<p>Ukraine would receive a reduction in the price of Russian natural gas. The parliamentary debate over the agreement devolved into a melee, with some members of the opposition throwing eggs and lighting smoke bombs, but the measure narrowly passed. Yanukovych drew additional ire from his opponents when he stated that the Great Famine of 1932–33 (a Soviet-era famine in which four to five million Ukrainians died) should not be considered an act of genocide carried out by Soviet authorities against the Ukrainian people, as former president Yushchenko had declared.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The media’s focus on Trump’s Russian connections ignores the much more extensive and lucrative business relationships of top Democrats with Kremlin-associated oligarchs and companies. Thanks to the Panama Papers, we know that the Podesta Group (founded by John Podesta’s brother, Tony) lobbied for Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank. “Sberbank is the Kremlin, they don’t do anything major without Putin’s go-ahead, and they don’t tell him ‘no’ either,” explained a retired senior U.S. intelligence official. According to a Reuters report, Tony Podesta was “among the high-profile lobbyists registered to represent organizations backing Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.” Among these was the European Center, which paid Podesta $900,000 for his lobbying.</p>

<p>That’s not all: The busy Podesta Group also represented Uranium One, a uranium company acquired by the Russian government which received approval from Hillary Clinton’s State Department to mine for uranium in the U.S. and gave Russia twenty percent control of US uranium. The New York Times reported Uranium One’s chairman, Frank Guistra, made significant donations to the Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 for one speech from a Russian investment bank that has “links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.”  Notably, Frank Giustra, the Clinton Foundation’s largest and most controversial donor, does not appear anywhere in Clinton’s “non-private” emails. It is possible that the emails of such key donors were automatically scrubbed to protect the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>It has been described as &quot;an operation controlled by Yanukovych&quot; (Viktor Yanukovych, president of Ukraine from February 2010 until February 2014) [1] and tied to Yanukovich&#39;s Party of Regions. In 2012 it had contracts with the American lobbying firms Mercury, who received $560,000 over 2 years, and the Podesta Group, who received $900,000 over 2 years. However, the source of the funding remains unclear since ECFMU listed its budget for the financial year ending in November 2012 as only 10,000 euros.</p>
