       I have noticed this for a while, but after studying up on the teachings of Satanism and the Satanic Bible, I have noticed a lot of the media agenda for the last few decades has centered around some pretty overtly Satanic teachings (Sexual ambiguity and expression, individual rights, denial of supernatural beings, Carnality, self-indulgence, hatred as tool for personal gain, using psychological tactics to manipulate people for personal gain, etc.). Now that I have started noticing it I have a hard time NOT noticing it, as is usually the case. Anyone else know why this might be?

       Unsure why but I don’t see it as a bad thing. If you put the satanic bible up against the Christian Bible, you’ll see that the tenants held therein are similar aside the fact that the satanic bible has more respect for women and gives power to the individual instead of the church. If I were to be at all religious, and was forced to choose between the two, I’d pick Satanism in a heartbeat. Seeing as though I know both are a complete sham and are nothing more than a way for people to make tax free money, we won’t have to worry about me joining the ranks of either.

       Theistic is moreso just following the tenents. Which are comparable to most any religion except with more respect for women and the focus on the individual.

       It seems to me that theistic satanists are always connected to mayhem and abuse. The left hand path is clearly malicious imo, just as the wiki article

       I could argue that the media likes to take certain facts and run with them. In much the same way that people tend to take books the wrong way and run with that. Ya know? Crazy will be crazy no matter which book they subscribe to. In my experience, I’ve met many more mentally stable theistic satanists than I have met mentally stable theistic Christians. But that’s just my perception of the world.

       I can. And that was an honest question. Women are treated like shit in the bible and you know there’s no way to defend against that.
I’ve read at least 10 different versions of the bible, from children’s picture bible on up to the st James version. There’s thousands of instances of slavery, abuse and forced marriage. I have a better idea, prove me wrong.

       Name the verses, be specific, and God isnt the type to desire slavery, abuse, and forced marriage, thats all in the hands of the people. Ephesians 5:24-25 and on is ideally what God would want.

       That's not the same satanism the elites practice. The Satanism that 'normal' people thinkof, the one that's pushed in the mainstream, or is gaining more acceptance in the mainstream, claims to be a type of atheism that is sort of like a form of humanism, it seems to be a sort of okay ideology on the face of it. But I think that it is partly a ruse and a cover for the religion the elites practice, which is Luciferianism, which is actually hideous and really does believe in God and the Devil, and believes that Lucifer was treated badly by God, and basically they actually do do stuff like sacrifice children and practise torture etc, in exchange for power on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the satanists who believe in the type you're talking about have no idea about the other type, and they are sort of there to put forward the argument for satanism, unwittingly as a cover for the Luciferians and the actual evil satanic type cults who practice satanic ritual abuse - they argue that it's all fine and nice and friendly and they have websites and doctrines that all sound quite reasonable to a lot of people. But you'd think if you wanted to practise that kind of a 'religion' you'd call it something else, right? Why do they call it satanism when they claim they don't actually believe in satan or supernatural beings? It basically seems to play on anti-Christian/anti-religious sentiment and gets people who are interested in being a bit alternative/subversive while still being good people, and I think a lot of people use it to try to make points about things like religious freedom and religious influence over politics etc. But it seems to me that the people behind it at its very core, whoever started it or co-opted it as a movement, use it to put a friendly face on something much darker. So that when people try to warn about genuine issues with satanic cults and ritual abuse, others will dismiss it all and say things like 'but Satanism isn't even about any of that stuff, have you even read the satanic bible or looked at their website?' etc. When in reality these disgustingly evil cults DO exist and operate worldwide, as many witnesses and victims have attested to over the years.

       Yea totally understand what ya mean man, however; “Christianity” was once in a similar position in this world wasent it? Ruling elites sacrificing children and goats in the name of god? Organized religion is organized religion, no matter who is at the helm, it’s all a manner of population control.

       I have to agree with u/kittyhasabeard... tho I see your point u/defnotjrossiter.

       I like Jesus' teachings but find Old Testament Jehovah to be terrifying. Frankly I find it disturbing that people still worship him. This site has a lot of Old Testament verses that are blatantly evil.

       I too have a hard time unseeing stuff like this. Partially I think its because the people who own these institutions participate either directly or are indirectly controlled by Luciferians.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is in general alot of indoctrination and programming that people receive from birth by people who have studied psychology and know how to program individuals to get them to buy products, engage in certain behaviors, etc. The people who study this sort of stuff are not your service to others type beings, they are generally doing it to be manipulative. So as a result, our minds are full of programming for control purposes and alot of the themes you mention fall into that type of programming. For example, sexual ambiguity is being promoted to destroy the family unit (thus making people more dependent on the government or other social structures) and to diminish the power of the masculine element in society, thereby decreasing the protection of the divine feminine (the Earth is feminine, the planet is easier to control if you don't have alpha males running around protecting their families). Removing God you get people more invested in materialistic pursuits thus making them more easily controllable through financial incentives. If people were working on their own enlightenment they wouldnt be buying useless crap or working mindless jobs that funnel money to the already rich.

       . . . all the time, everywhere. Once a person learns a little, that's all it takes. You can't NOT see it, I tell anyone that begins to research, once you know --- there's no 'going back'.

      <p>
       I don't intend to watch "Lucifer" on tv, you can't get any more 'satanic' than that. I'm not a "religious" person; it's just too blatant not to 'see'.

       Right. Once you've pierced the veil, once you see what's happening, you can't UNsee it. Then you recognize it everywhere. Then you start to wonder...what the fuck is really going on?

       Satan isn't so bad. All these people twisting the message are bad, but Satan isn't.

       Don't fall for it. It's no different that worshiping God or any other deity.  The response as is the same, the people worshiping are the problem.

       "And this is where today’s Western, somewhat secularized, witch-hunters currently reside: among psychology’s pseudoscientific fringe; feeding delusion to the mentally vulnerable behind the protection of therapist-client privilege, and under the guise trauma therapy. While they revel in their disturbed pornographic fantasies of child-rape and extreme abuse, they proclaim their critics to be demented defenders of pedophilic assault. They co-opt the narrative of victim’s rights to conceal their absurd conspiracy theories from criticism and scrutiny. To question the validity of DID, or even the reality of a Satanic conspiracy, is — according to this defensive ploy — to question the very existence of child abuse itself. In this way, actual victims of abuse are used as human shields to defend our modern inquisitors as they engage in the most outrageous and under-investigated mental health scandal of our time."
