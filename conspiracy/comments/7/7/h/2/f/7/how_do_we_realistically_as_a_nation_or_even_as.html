        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is borrowed from a comment I posted in another thread but I decided to make a thread of its own to generate more discussion on this topic as I think it&#39;s both interesting and important.</p>

<p>Basically some of us go through day to day struggles and mental health can take a toll on us simply from just that. Then add in the stress from all these conspiracies &amp; disclosures and if you go down the rabbit hole enough you suddenly realize you have a society who is on the brink of insanity. A big effort is made to prevent huge disclosures to come out all at once because society would probably collapse as we know it. Majority of people would go mental, literally... Psychologically and biologically the shock value would be way too overwhelming and world shattering for many.</p>

<p>How can we realistically get out of this mess we are in as humanity? If everyone were to learn of the illusion all at once, could that benefit us? As in if we try rebuilding on our own without the sociopaths, if we don&#39;t end up killing each other first? Is such a thing even attainable despite what&#39;s mentioned above?</p>

<p>The idea of a cabal that would dictate the &quot;unveiling&quot; also rubs me the wrong way. I mean they may or may not have humanity&#39;s best interests in mind and I&#39;m leaning more on the side that they don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Are there any other alternatives you can think of? How the F do we get out of this mess?</p>

<p>I mean I know we can&#39;t just draw out a draft and simply get out of this situation. But is there anything remotely realistic that anyone can think of? Are we entering a new Renaissance? Are we led to believe that we are but it&#39;s a NWO trap? Is someone paving that path? Is it happening organically? How much of our will power as humanity do we truly have a say in this? These are the types of questions I hope to generate in this discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the invite!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are we led to believe that we are but it&#39;s a NWO trap? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really interesting point. But I think that if there&#39;s one thing they don&#39;t have access to/influence over, it&#39;s a free/still mind. My route towards this has been meditation, others will have their own routes. </p>

<p>The age-old battle between good and evil can also be seen as the battle between consciousness/awareness/being awake and &#39;unconsciousness&#39;/ignorance/being asleep. Everything in society is set up for the latter to win, everything we are taught is to discourage the former.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is someone paving that path? Is it happening organically?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another great question. From my viewpoint, it&#39;s happening organically. The ideas of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxEvRoAaYBM">Taoism are very interesting</a> on this topic. The Taoists believe that the universe has it&#39;s own intelligence, it is self-regulating. Life happens as a result of the conflict/contrast between yin and yang. Ah, we encounter the battle between opposites again - remind us of anything? </p>

<p>The planet gets is energy by the constant interaction between opposites like yin/yang. It&#39;s possible to consider that good is not really better than evil; they are just another pair of complementary opposites, the battle between them keeps the planet going. </p>

<p>Zoom out a billion lightyears - how significant is all of this, the NWO vs the repressed masses? Yes, it matters very much to us from our zoomed-in human viewpoint, but as far as the universe is considered, it&#39;s relatively insignificant, or to put it more nicely, it&#39;s just a game. </p>

<p>The game the human race is playing is, &#39;let&#39;s all wake up&#39;. How long it takes doesn&#39;t really matter, because once we do, we&#39;d probably shuffle the cards and play the same game again anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man :) I&#39;ve been thinking about one of your questions from yesterday - how did tptb manage to keep independent thought down in ancient civilizations?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just hit me - religion! Organised religion was the biggest institution of all, and that&#39;s how they managed to suck the independence out of public thought. It&#39;s a super interesting one because I believe spirituality has much to teach mankind - the spiritual journey is, after all, one that connects you with truth and reality. Unfortunately organised religion takes genuinely insightful ideas and totally distorts them - probably a big way in which we have been kept down.</p>

<p>These days people throw the baby out with the bathwater and dismiss spirituality because of the false ideas presented by dogmatic religions. But I believe a certain alchemy is taking place - religion as we knew it is dying (at least in the West), but true wisdom - including that gained from spirituality - is rising from the ashes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think the world went insane long ago, that our beliefs and perspectives on history have been manipulated, and we have effectively been made slaves by TPTB for some time now, and that the vast majority of the public has been unaware of all that.</p>

<p>That said, I think people are awakening and that is mostly evidenced by the populist movements you see throughout the world. I think the internet and the free flow of information and ideas is the main reason why that has happened, and that is why TPTB so desperately want to control it.</p>

<p>I think that the awakening is a ripple effect and over time, exponentially more and more people will awaken. So I&#39;m optimistic that the power and lies of TPTB will crumble organically. But I also believe that they wont go down without a fight, and things are about to get worse before they get any better.</p>
