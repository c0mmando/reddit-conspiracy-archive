<p>You&#39;re right though, not much of a choice once you get in office when it comes to killing people, and not just ISIS but including innocent civilians that are just seen as collateral damage. The best of presidents will minimize collateral damage but are still implicated by the strikes they order. A good person doesn&#39;t get themselves in that position, they don&#39;t want it.</p>

<p>Trump just gives it back. If you swing at Trump, he swings back. </p>

<p>I think a lot of people would love to run the country. There&#39;s really only a few things you can come down as to why President Trump wanted to be president:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He&#39;s done everything else and wanted one last challenge.</p></li>
<li><p>He really didn&#39;t like the current direction the US was headed in and wanted to do something about it.</p></li>

<p>Most people are corrupted by money. Trump is super rich. Instead of chilling on a yacht with a stripper in each arm, he&#39;s in the White House dealing with Paul Ryan&#39;s rat ass. </p>

<p>I do think he&#39;s trying, but he&#39;s got his own party working against him along with the Dems and he can&#39;t even take a dump without being criticized. </p>

If you&#39;re arguing about which party or politician did or said this or that, you&#39;re being played. There is no such thing as legitimate politics, and arguing with each other over who should be in charge is what the people who bankroll the political system want.
