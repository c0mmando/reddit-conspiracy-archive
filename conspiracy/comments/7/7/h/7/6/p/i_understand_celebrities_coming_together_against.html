    <div class="md"><p>Not when their careers are still at stake.  Start talking about people... what if it doesn&#39;t stick?  Not only would their careers be gone, but also open to defamation and libel suits.  It is very easy to assume that everyone in the business who has commented and not named names are weird, but it really makes perfect sense to them.  To us it seems odd at best.</p>

<p>And the other people who may yet be accused, they are still influential and powerful in their respective domains.  How many people right now are running damage control, bribing and threatening people who might tell?  </p>

<p>All of this, and no charges as of yet.  How can that be?  Weinstein&#39;s career (might) be finished.  But you know full well he will walk.  As dirty as he is, I&#39;ll bet he has enough dirt on others to stay a free man.</p>

<p>There is no justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was stupid and I genuinely feel for the guy regarding the sexual assault, but I&#39;m relieved we don&#39;t see him anymore. The last thing this world needs is another Trump lover on the world stage. I don&#39;t think he was blacklisted for the sexual assault comments alone, it was a long time coming. And I don&#39;t agree with silencing people but fuck if we needed anyone else fueling the_donald. He got so many suckers on his side just by being a 4chan edgelord half the time. Sure, say he hated the MSM and fought the media. He only did it when it benefitted himself or his peiple. Fuck Milo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a comment I made about what little I know and I&#39;ll add some:</p>

<p>&quot;I grew up in Burbank, though I personally never had anything to do with the industry I&#39;ve known more actors then most. I met both Coreys&#39;on several occasions, they weren&#39;t friends of mine and like some other famous kids had a dark aura about them. I originally thought it was because they were famous they thought they were better, but as an adult I&#39;ve learned that&#39;s not really the case. </p>

<p>During the 80&#39;s most of these kids would go to school on set during shooting and some would go to public school when they weren&#39;t. Public school was terrible for them, I found out from some years later. Since they are TV or movie famous it&#39;s believed in school by people like me they have all these friends, I mean they&#39;re famous. They do have friends from the set, but these same kids are also they&#39;re competition for parts, so that didn&#39;t make it easy. Most of them had crazy parents too. One or two of the kids I knew were them or became household names, most were the kids you see in the background. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about the Hollywood that we know are filled with pedophiles and rapists. But having some insight into the kids lives, these were truly easy pray for these sick fucks.&quot;  Earlier comment</p>

<p>Added -  the bars are filled with want to be actresses and they are going to meet the guy who can introduce them to the guy who can make their dreams come true. Most will get fucked, both literally and figuratively in the journey to making it, if they do. I tend to think Weinstein was sent to the wolves to hide, Vegas and Russia.</p>

<p>I think the kid stars need to come out and say names. Those will open up the Hollywood and DC connections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t need to get kids from bad areas.  They have insiders working for Social Services, these will take kids from the most impoverished families, disabled families (the children of blind, deaf mothers), or arrange shipments of child meat from other countries.  These &#39;orphans&#39; can be used for both sexual gratification of the elites and then they can be slaughtered in the most horrifying ways you could ever imagine and their bones crushed for valuable stem cells for celebrities like Joe Rogan to shoot up his asshole.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought this was &quot;well known&quot; in conspiracy circles along with the pedophile shit. There&#39;s a shitton of orphans out there that are abused even by their foster families. Lots of stories from orphans tell of abuse inside the orphanages/from other orphans/caretakers. On top of that, there&#39;s loads of missing children/people. Again, I figured this was &quot;well known&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree in that I feel like more people could easily be dropping names... but my <em>guess</em> is that, like most sexual assault (or even rape) cases, it would just be a &quot;he said, she said&quot; situation. </p>

<p>If they don&#39;t have a recording of the encounter or if they were raped and didn&#39;t go to the hospital and have a rape kit done within a few days of the assault... they essentially don&#39;t have any real evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, from this point on, everyone talks about how brave they were to say anything at all. They talk about how difficult and scary it is to come forward.

<p>They&#39;re essentially in an untouchable position. And no one&#39;s accountable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Weinstein was tossed under the bus for several reasons the first as already mentioned he is to distract from vegas and russia. Second, Weinstein has been donating for decades to dems.  He is an Obama and clinton buddy. I think he stopped paying, and the dems are hurting for coin.  Weinstein is also in someways the kingpin of Hollywood he is one of only a handful of producers whos name I actually knew from before the scandal.  So, its a message, the dems are hurting and just shilling for hillary and against donald isnt going to cut it... open your wallets. pay up.</p>
