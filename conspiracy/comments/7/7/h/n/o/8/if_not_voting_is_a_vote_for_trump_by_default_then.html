       I don't need another story about the mating habits of the Wannachilldoe Tree Tribesmen - you're supposed to be informing the public. This is getting crazy. I can understand CNN and NYT not covering it, corporate whores that they are. But are we seriously going to ignore the fact that the folks down at NPR, who have some implied duty to the public, are actively asleep at the wheel right now?

       I'm sorry, but can I respectfully ask - is english not your first language? I don't mean that disparagingly, I swear, but when I say "stare down our noses" I mean "to look down upon as though we are in a superior position as though they have something to change and we do not", not simply "to get mad at" or "talk shit about".

       Yep. The phrase is commonly used to mean "view as not good enough." We can view both as subpar, since they both have flaws.

       Also, even English speakers might be unfamiliar with phrases like this. I'm not saying I'm unfamiliar with it, but you shouldn't jump to the conclusion that someone doesn't speak English just because they don't understand an English phrase.

       That's the especially insidious angle they have - people feel like "well if corporate news tries to hide something, NPR will definitely talk about it" but they aren't, so must not be anything to "all of that stuff online". It's their job to sift through all the bullshit noise and put the good important stuff in front of us, no matter who it pisses off, but they don't.

       NPR tries to remain neutral and a bit distant from politics. For instance when the Trump Russia collusion starting coming to light they waited a long time to even post it. Reading just NPR you would have been in the dark for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect that about NPR. There are plenty of political news and it's refreshing to get non-political news.

       They definitely cover political issues, even more obscure ones:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that's my complaint. That they're pennywise about what they cover and they definitely don't step on toes, but of all outlets, one would expect them to care less about stepping on toes given their purported independence from those things.

       There are senate hearings and several separate investigations currently going on as we speak.

       Several high level government figures, including the president’s son in law, have been questioned and the subject of interrogation.

       NPR does not keep a distance from politics whatsoever lol. I listen it every day, that's just whole heartedly wrong. Half of what they get into is political. They do try to stay neutral but even as a progressive person I admit that they lean left.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even as an everyday listener I admit that OPs view on NPR is 100% correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way they covered the Seth Rich / private investigator thing was disingenuous as a mf'er. They took that PIs lawsuit against Fox and somehow flipped it into a dismissal of a Seth Rich/DNC/Wikileaks conspiracy. They very sneakily framed it as "well seeing as this PI is suing fox over this, we can conclude Seth Rich was murdered in a botched robbery." Note that the PI never backtracked on his view and/or knowledge that Seth Rich was in contact w Wikileaks and was murdered in relation to that- and note that the 15 minute report and long article never mentioned those views. They framed it so that the listener/reader assumed the PI sued fox for making a conspiracy up.
      </p>
      <p>
       After listening to their coverage of the democratic primary I realized they're as tainted as the rest of the MSM. Still love most of what they do though

       NPR is very sneaky because their stories are quite intellectual and polished.  You have to pay close attention to what they omit to realize that corporate money fuels them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are the best way to keep informed people blue-pilled, while CNN, MSNBC, and others are for the average person.
      </p>
      <p>
       What won't NPR report properly on?  Oil and fracking, war, big pharma, big agriculture, and especially bank fraud.  Again, it's very underhanded and veiled in intellectualism.

       If you think shilling for Clinton makes them "leftist", I wonder what word you would use to describe socialists and communists who are WAY to the left of her. If she's a leftist, what do you call the people on the actual left who hate her for being an authoritarian warmonger who cheats "leftist" candidates like Bernie Sanders.

       Eh I'm left leaning who liked Obama, hates Hillary, and think Bernie has unrealistic plans. It's not just the far left. Seems like all the scandals the past 8 years all have Clinton in the middle while Obama seemed to really want to be for the people and did an decent job.

       Republican voter turnout is almost identical election to election.  It's the democrat turnout that wins/loses elections, so not voting is pretty much the same as voting Republican.
