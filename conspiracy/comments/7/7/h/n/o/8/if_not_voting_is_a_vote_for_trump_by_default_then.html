    <div class="md"><p>NPR tries to remain neutral and a bit distant from politics. For instance when the Trump Russia collusion starting coming to light they waited a long time to even post it. Reading just NPR you would have been in the dark for a while.</p>

<p>I respect that about NPR. There are plenty of political news and it&#39;s refreshing to get non-political news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They definitely cover political issues, even more obscure ones:
<a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/10/19/558836022/watch-kelly-denounces-congresswomans-public-account-of-trump-s-call-with-widow">http://www.npr.org/2017/10/19/558836022/watch-kelly-denounces-congresswomans-public-account-of-trump-s-call-with-widow</a></p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s my complaint. That they&#39;re pennywise about what they cover and they definitely don&#39;t step on toes, but of all outlets, one would expect them to care less about stepping on toes given their purported independence from those things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NPR does not keep a distance from politics whatsoever lol. I listen it every day, that&#39;s just whole heartedly wrong. Half of what they get into is political. They do try to stay neutral but even as a progressive person I admit that they lean left.</p>

<p>And even as an everyday listener I admit that OPs view on NPR is 100% correct. </p>

<p>The way they covered the Seth Rich / private investigator thing was disingenuous as a mf&#39;er. They took that PIs lawsuit against Fox and somehow flipped it into a dismissal of a Seth Rich/DNC/Wikileaks conspiracy. They very sneakily framed it as &quot;well seeing as this PI is suing fox over this, we can conclude Seth Rich was murdered in a botched robbery.&quot; Note that the PI never backtracked on his view and/or knowledge that Seth Rich was in contact w Wikileaks and was murdered in relation to that- and note that the 15 minute report and long article never mentioned those views. They framed it so that the listener/reader assumed the PI sued fox for making a conspiracy up.</p>

<p>After listening to their coverage of the democratic primary I realized they&#39;re as tainted as the rest of the MSM. Still love most of what they do though </p>

<p>They are the best way to keep informed people blue-pilled, while CNN, MSNBC, and others are for the average person.</p>

<p>What won&#39;t NPR report properly on?  Oil and fracking, war, big pharma, big agriculture, and especially bank fraud.  Again, it&#39;s very underhanded and veiled in intellectualism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think shilling for Clinton makes them &quot;leftist&quot;, I wonder what word you would use to describe socialists and communists who are WAY to the left of her. If she&#39;s a leftist, what do you call the people on the actual left who hate her for being an authoritarian warmonger who cheats &quot;leftist&quot; candidates like Bernie Sanders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh I&#39;m left leaning who liked Obama, hates Hillary, and think Bernie has unrealistic plans. It&#39;s not just the far left. Seems like all the scandals the past 8 years all have Clinton in the middle while Obama seemed to really want to be for the people and did an decent job.</p>

<p>Frankly the problem is the establishment and the dealing and wheeling she represents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Republican voter turnout is almost identical election to election.  It&#39;s the democrat turnout that wins/loses elections, so not voting is pretty much the same as voting Republican.</p>
