<p>Really because you can post whatever subject you want.  Liar.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Stifled itself is a subjective assessment.  You can post about whatever subject you like.  Users are banned for using logical fallacies, however.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t, nobody posts that anymore.  There were 2 posters in the past who posted it, and instead of banning them, we debated them.  They revealed that they had only been into it for a few months, and it seemed like just a phase.  So they actually CHANGED by speaking with their peers.</p>

<p>You seem like the kind of person that wants to trap all the nazis in an echo chamber and then bomb the shit out of them?  That&#39;s a stupid plan.</p>

<p>By dominating them in debate, their world views changed.  You&#39;re welcome.  </p>

<p>Sure haven&#39;t seen evidence of people changing their minds after saying &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot;, but nice of you to fabricate some anecdote to somehow attempt to support your point?</p>

<p>No, my plan is for people who say &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot; to be confronted for their beliefs.</p>

<p>Funny, how you&#39;re complaining about &quot;echo chambers&quot; while simultaneously supporting one.</p>

<p>Good for you, I&#39;ll continue to call out Nazi supporters though.</p>

<p>Not making anything up, find the &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot; quote yourself ... see how nobody even responded to it, see how it&#39;s upvoted.  Your argument falls apart as soon as you actually look into the information yourself rather than fabricating anecdotes to support your point.</p>

<p>But you seem to want to police the entire internet.   I will reiterate that I think your idea, and it&#39;s proposed execution, is bad, and that I don&#39;t really even want to talk about it with you.   You seem poorly informed, and manipulative, and comfortable telling lies and propagating hearsay without proof.  I want to get away from you, and I want less people like you in my discussion forums.</p>

<p>Um how was it an unrelated thread?  It was about Holocaust denial ... the &quot;tacit endorsement&quot; is the fact that Nazi and anti-Jew propaganda is allowed on that sub, while people who counter those ideologies are banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just said why people would think your a shill.  Because you actually beleive there was some sort of collusion between Trumps team and Russia.  It&#39;s been a year and a half and I&#39;ve heard about Manafort.  Who Trump let go from his campaign almost immediately when it came to light that it was an issue for some folks that the man had worked with Russians in the past.  And his son meeting with the Russian lawyer that was likely planted by the opposition to be more &quot;proof&quot;.  Then they tried to say facebook sold advertising to the Russians to the tune of 100k.  What? If anything is nefarious about any of that?  I am open to it being a possibility and am still waiting to see some proof of how any of this is some kind of crime or dirty dealing.  Where and what is the proof that Trump was in bed with the Russians?  And what exactly did he gain by working with them if he did?  </p>

<p>In light of recent events it&#39;s clear that the Obama administration was working with Putin.  Or at the very least there is the allegations that our government sold uranium to them and the Clinton foundation recieved kickbacks for it.  There&#39;s the collusion people were looking for.  What&#39;s the bigger issue here?  I know what concerns me more when I weigh it out in my mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>K. Trump and Manafort have been friends for a long time. Manafort owns a whole floor of Trump Tower and his in daughters know he&#39;s a piece of shit. You know with the whole blood money and he&#39;s killed people and Trump and him are the most dangerous couple in America. He isn&#39;t some random. Trump Jr admitted to at the very least attempted collusion. If we want to take his word for what was discussed even though he&#39;s changed his story about the meeting three or four times. Flynn is up shit creek. Roger Stone is a piece of shit. Kushner has no business having a security clearance since he has to update his status of meetings without foreigners every other day. You got Eric Prince, Betsy DeVos&#39; brother and founder of mercenary group Blackwater, back dooring meetings with Russians in the seashells(yeah I know that&#39;s not the proper spelling). Then here I go rambling about conspiracies on the conspiracy sub with things that are all verifiable. Open your god damned eyes. This is a conspiracy sub. Dismissing this shit is insane. This has more proof than most things here but since the_dumbass decided to over run this place I don&#39;t expect much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wealthy and powerful institutions and people have interests they wish to protect. Their livelihoods are at stake and they see opportunities to further quash any challengers and thereby reinforce their power and control.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t call this a New World Order.</p>

<p>I call it... an operation of human nature, an instinct to preserve and survive taken to an extreme. Mechanisms for this control including capitalism, banking/ finance, criminal law, public education, organized religion, etc.</p>

<p>But, in other cultures they take a different form.</p>

<p>For example, the communist revolution began as a struggle against entrenched power, and then the newly empowered vanguard did everything to subvert power structures (church, aristocrats, etc) and create their own. French and American revolutions followed the same path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are now so many places where you can buy it. I bought my first on localbitcoins.com, some on Litebit.eu, Kraken.com. The most popular exchange right now is Coinbase. A new exchange for Bitcoin Cash is localbitcoincash.com, though they only just launched and the site will receive a cosmetic make-over.</p>

<p>You keep Bitcoin in a software wallet, a hardware wallet or a paper wallet.  I have almost all of my coins o a Trezor hardware wallet, though I&#39;ve heard good things about the ledger nano S as well.</p>

<p>A software wallet for Android is Coinomi. But I wouldn&#39;t put much money in that. I think Bitcoin.com also has a decent wallet.</p>

<p>You buy things with Bitcoin (Cash). It&#39;s basically the best form of money ever invented. Right now there are not that many places that accept Bitcoin Cash, but merchant adoption is rising rapidly.</p>

<p>Right now Bitcoin Cash is worth around 5 billion dollars in market cap. I&#39;ve invested a lot of my net worth into it, I&#39;m betting it will go to several hundred billions if not trillions over the next decade. Because everyone is going to want to use it. You can instantly send millions to anyone on earth, there are zero fees, no one can seize it, freeze it or create more Bitcoin Cash coins. Plus if you want to, you can make transactions anonymous.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Cash is money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of them they require you to id yourself to comply with current banking laws. Some allow you to pay via bank wire, others via credit card. </p>

<p>Localbitcoincash makes it so you can meet with someone in real life to exchange fiat for crypto. Though that market is much, much smaller than the volume on exchanges. It will only grow, I think. Because everyone hates id requirements. This is part of what Bitcoin Cash will abolish, the whole know-your-customer regulation.</p>

<p>At first I bought a little to familiarize myself with the wallets and the exchanges. There is a little learnibg curve, but if you can do online banking, you can learn how to transact with Bitcoin Cash in an afternoon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does the value of Bitcoin fluctuate and if so how volatile is it?</p>

<p>I read about it at the tail end of 2014 and was really tempted to dump a fair bit in and then cash out when it increased in value (It&#39;s been years so I&#39;m vague on the finer details.)</p>

<p>All I recall is kicking myself for not doing it and selling on new years because so many people online were talking about how it made them rich overnight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is volatile. More so than traditional currencies. Though this is not stopping people from using it. Bitcoin has more volume than Paypal daily.</p>

<p>I think the volatility will decrease the more people use it. One day Bitcoin value will likely be quite steady. I doubt it will take decades.</p>

<p>I think the best time to get into crypto was 2010. The second best time is right about now. Only invest what you are prepared to lose is not bad advice perhaps. </p>

<p>I think we may see a big ban of sorts that will affect price. But Bitcoin looks to me to be impossible to kill. So we also might see governments start to embrace it. </p>

<p>I would say to people who are on the fence to buy a little. Get some skin in the game. There is a feisty community behind Bitcoin. And, while no one can guarantee profits, it&#39;s fun to invest in what will likely become the dominant form of money over the next couple of years.</p>
