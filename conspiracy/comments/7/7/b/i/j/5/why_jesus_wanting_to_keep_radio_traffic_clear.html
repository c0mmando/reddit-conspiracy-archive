    <div class="md"><p>And thats&#39;s making a fucking statement. Sheriff Lombardo looked like he was about to throwup he was so shook during that press conference. With that hawk son of a bitch FBI Agent Aaron Rouse looming over his shoulder, waiting for him to misspeak. Lombardo was inherently  scared to death, and Jesus was no different. Both of these men know what really went down that night, but are being blackmailed to lie on behalf of the FBI and MGM to cover their asses. We may never see the truth come to light, as this goes down as the largest coverup and conspiracy in American History.</p>

<p>Plus, if that article that says MGM purposely booked him with Ellen because she won&#39;t ask questions, you have to wonder if MGM is causing Campos to lie to the investigators.. I don&#39;t recall many other mass shootings that involved an element that would lie simply to minimize damages from lawsuits.</p>

<p>Whether it was paddock or whoever in the end, they chose their location well, it in itself being a cause of possible misinformation.</p>

<p>I suggested – as one of several possible alternate scenarios – that perhaps he had no choice but to use his cellphone because he didn&#39;t have access to his radio (because he&#39;d dropped it). </p>

<p>Why do YOU think he called in on his cell phone instead of his his radio? Since you haven&#39;t replied to OP could directly, I&#39;m guessing you agree with him premise (that the reasoning Campos gave for calling in via cellphone is BS), but are here picking apart my proposed scenarios, which are based off of OP&#39;s premise. So what is YOUR theory of why he really chose to call down via cellphone, and why he&#39;s lying and saying he did it to free up the channel (OP&#39;s premise)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>?!</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense at all. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what he said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was walking down and heard rapid fire,” he said. “And at first I took cover. I felt a burning sensation. I went to go lift my pant leg up and I saw the blood. <strong>That’s when I called it in on my radio that shots have been fired</strong>.</p>

<p>“And I was going to say that I was hit, <strong>but I got on … my cellphone just to clear radio traffic</strong> so they could coordinate the rest of the call.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He called it in via radio to his boss or whoever, to report the shooting, he didn&#39;t want to spend time talking about his injury because that would take time from a fast response and coordination by the rest of the security staff, sooo he uses his cellphone to call to 911 to report his injury and probably what happened. During this time the shooter is most likely shooting at the audience. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not unusual for cops or security staff to do this just to clear radio traffic so the guys in charge can coordinate a response faster and for  security staff to get to the scene. </p>

<p>Now, I understand a security officer for a hotel may not follow law enforcement procedure.. but we&#39;re talking about common sense here.

    <div class="md"><p>He said he called on his cell phone right after radioing in that shots were fired so it&#39;s not like he stayed up there for an hour waiting to bleed out. If I am right, and they do have a protocol in place, it&#39;s possible that immediately after he radioed that there was a shooter, dispatch was on the channel coordinating and the line wasn&#39;t open. </p>

<p>Could I be wrong? Of course. I don&#39;t know exactly what happened any more than anyone else in this sub. I&#39;ve never been in that type of situation so I have no clue where his mind was at when he radioed it in. It&#39;s not a stretch for me to think that he&#39;s more concerned about a shooter that he can&#39;t see than he is about being hit in the leg.</p>

<p>Seems like kind of a leap to assume the shooter wasn&#39;t planning on targeting the concert at all. Why drag all those guns and ammo up? Why set up hallway cameras? Why seal the stairwell door so that nobody can get through from the stairwell side? Why drill a hole in the peephole for a camera or rifle? The hammer-like object [allegedly] used to knock out the window glass. What else could the shooter&#39;s original plan have been if targeting the concert was never a part of it?</p>

But based on what we know -- that Jesus had spent 4 days prepping for his interviews last Thursday, and then ghosted right before they were supposed to begin... the way Ellen had to guide him through his &quot;interview&quot; and even answer most of the questions <em>for</em> him, and the way he relied on Schuck for cues -- tells me he&#39;s not quick on his feet. That he&#39;s probably not great in high-stress situations. Now with this personality profile, are we really supposed to believe he had the quick-wit and foresight (in one of the most highly stressful situations a human could ever encounter) to contemplate whether to quickly speak into a radio in one click or take several extra/unnecessary steps to as not to clog radio traffic in case this thing escalates into something bigger...?

<p>“And I was going to say that I was hit, but I got on … my cellphone just to clear radio traffic so they could coordinate the rest of the call.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which makes it perfectly clear what he meant. He&#39;s saying that after telling his colleagues of what is happening over the radio (walkie talkie), he didn&#39;t want to go into details that he was shot, because that would take time and block radio traffic from more important stuff, like the communication between his boss and everyone else on security on what to do about this. </p>

<p>So he uses his cellphone and calls it in either to 911 or some other person who isn&#39;t going to coordinate security. It&#39;s not unusual to do this and it&#39;s not that complicated to understand. </p>

<p>Just to make it more clear, if he would spend more time talking about his injury, they wouldn&#39;t have any chance of coordinating with everyone else on staff because that would block the traffic on their frequency. Obviously his injury didn&#39;t seem so bad at the time and so he chose himself to call it in via his cellphone instead.</p>

<p>He said that shots were fired, that&#39;s what&#39;s most important in a call like that so they can coordinate a proper response with authorities and get everyone out safe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah but the only shots fired were at him at this point. If I were in his situation I would say: &quot;Somebody tried to shoot me!!! &quot;
At this point he couldn&#39;t know a massacre was about to take place. (Or maybe he did!!!) And that radio needs to be cleared for that... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His injury didn&#39;t seem so bad???? He has been walking with the aid of a cane for 3 weeks now and looks like he has a hard time standing in some of the pics, yet, his injury wasn&#39;t bad???? I see many other victims that were supposedly shot, apparently more serious than Campos, walking around and doing interviews and such with no apparent effects, yet Campos&#39;s injury was not severe enough to report it over the radio? Keeping the channel clear for other communication was more important??? Looks like a pretty severe injury to me, by the after affects stretching on for 3 weeks now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn’t say it wasn’t bad just that obviously he had it under control. Maybe to him at the moment it seemed less severe (adrenaline) and thought that it was more important to let security coordinate a fast response then to tend to him over the radio, blocking other traffic from happening. When he reported it the shooter had most likely started to shoot at the audience. So he called in his injury with his cellphone. </p>

Don&#39;t know about you, but If I was laying alone in a hallway, shot, and being shot at, with no other apparent victims in sight, I know what my priority would be. It would only take a couple of seconds of radio time to mention it to someone!!!! It&#39;s not like it would completely disable other communication!!!! There is lot&#39;s of radio communication that night with many reports of an officer or a civilian being shot and not once did it so overwhelm the radio communications that others could not communicate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/mandalay-bay-security-guard-appears-on-ellen-video/">No you&#39;e referring to the old timeline of events which was wrong.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>During that initial explanation of events, Lombardo said it was a “miracle” Campos survived. Investigators recovered about 200 rounds in the 32nd-floor hallway where the security guard had ducked and covered while nursing his wound.</p>

<p>When the gunfire stopped, the sheriff said, Campos even helped hotel guests to safety until officers arrived to breach the gunman’s room.</p>

<p>Then, without much context, Lombardo said early last week that Campos had actually been shot at 9:59 p.m., six minutes before the gunman ever opened fire on the festival. He added that Campos never actually helped hotel guests out but he still considered Campos a hero.</p>

<p><strong>Within a day, MGM disputed the sheriff’s new timeline. Then, the hospitality and entertainment company went on to say Campos had actually been shot within a 40-second window prior to when the gunman opened fire on the festival crowd.
A day later, the sheriff agreed with MGM.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. Campos explains it well if you actually listen to what he says. There have been tons of times where cops or security staff have been injured by something big event and then called in to report the event but called their own injuries in with their cellphone instead to not block radio traffic, or to report something sensitive they don&#39;t want broadcasted over the radio because tons of civilians are listening most of the time. </p>

<p>He reported the shooting, the rapid fire coming out of the door, 40 seconds after he got shot Paddock started shooting up the audience. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to understand how it plays out. OP claims that: How could he know Paddock was about to shoot 500 people? </p>

<p>But there had already been rapid fire shooting coming out from Paddock&#39;s room aimed at whoever was close to the door (200 rounds in the hallway) and a bolted door, of course he knew something big was up and 40 seconds after getting shot Paddock starts shooting at the crowd of people.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why did the Sheriff say (at the last press conference): &quot;[Campos] attempted to relay that information via his radio, and it was confirmed because he also relayed that information via his cellphone.&quot; Why did they need to confirm that he called down via radio by checking his phone log? Shouldn&#39;t there have been a log of his radio call somewhere? They had a logged entry for when he called down about the jammed door at 9:59. Why not for his call that shots were fired?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the Sheriff say (in the above quote) &quot;He <em>attempted</em> to remain that information via radio&quot; if he&#39;d successfully gotten through to them? He wouldn&#39;t. He&#39;d say &quot;He relayed that information via his radio.&quot; Inclusion of the word &quot;attempted&quot; in that sentence without the word &quot;successful&quot; implies that it was an unsuccessful attempt. One might claim that it was just poor wording on the Sheriff&#39;s part, but then he goes on to clarify that they were able to confirm Jesus&#39; attempts to relay the information via radio <em>by checking his cellphone log</em>. Can you think of any other explanation for this, other than &quot;He never actually got through to dispatch via his radio&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the hotel release the audio recording of Schuck&#39;s call down to security but not Campos&#39;? If he radioed down, there&#39;d be a recording of him saying &quot;Shots fired! Shots fired!&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Why did Jesus even mention switching devices in the <em>Ellen</em> interview? How was that detail in any way relevant to the story he was telling? Why would the audience need to know about that tidbit?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>1.) I don&#39;t think they NEEDED to confirm he called in on his cell phone but I would suspect that a search of his call history would have been conducted as part of the investigation. I would assume he would have been treated as a suspicious person until eliminated as a suspect. They obviously would have seen outbound calls to MGM Security. As far as his logged call is concerned. It may be there but may have not been released yet (if at all). It&#39;s not like LVMPD/FBI is forthcoming with all their evidence. I would assume evidence being suppressed contradicts the current story and is being suppressed by MGM or the authorities for various reasons.</p>

<p>2.) Sheriff Lombardo can&#39;t keep his lies straight with Rouse hovering at every press conference. </p>

<p>3.) See #1</p>

<p>4.) I think this tidbit tries to play up the hero angle. Campos, even though he knew he was injured, didn&#39;t want to clog the radio feed with his mere flesh wound so he used his own personal cellphone to call in his injury while the security worked on getting police to the 32nd floor. Just like the story of him helping people evacuate until he was ordered by police to seek medical attention.</p>

<li><p>Why do you suppose the hotel released the audio recording of Schuck calling in shots fired, but no audio recording of Jesus calling in? </p></li>
<li><p>Why, in the Schuck audio recording with Security, does it sound like this is the first time dispatch is hearing about shots fired?</p></li>
<li><p>Why didn&#39;t Schuck <em>hear</em> Jesus talking [over the phone] to dispatch when he was walking down the hall toward him?</p></li>
<li><p>Why didn&#39;t police know what room (or even floor) the shooter was in until the shooting was almost over, if Jesus called it in immediately and was sitting on the phone with dispatch providing critical details?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did it take authorities almost two weeks to confirm that Jesus had contacted security dispatch about shots fired prior to the crowd shooting, when there should have been a central call log entry and audio recording?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One possible answer to all of these questions is that he texted someone on the Security team and the recipient didn&#39;t see the text right away. </p>

<p>Is that the <em>only</em> explanation? Of course not. But it ticks off all the boxes for these unanswered questions, and certainly cannot be dismissed solely based on &quot;The fact that he didn&#39;t say he texted...&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Campos didn&#39;t confuse gunfire for jackhammering. Schuck (maintenance man) did. Campos said he heard what he thought was <em>drilling</em>.</p>

<p>Now what&#39;s confusing about this is that the Sheriff said Campos called in the jammed stairwell door at 9:59pm, and that they have a human entry into a log that recorded that specific time. And he said <em>that&#39;s when he heard what sounded like drilling</em> (according to the Sheriff). They don&#39;t have a log recording of even he was shot, but they put it around 10:05pm, estimating it took Campos ~6 minutes to walk down and around to get to the hallway side of the door. </p>

<p>On <em>Ellen</em>, Campos modified the timeline and said he didn&#39;t call Security (to be routed to Engineering so they could dispatch someone to check out the door) until he was on the <em>hallway side of the door</em> – directly next to Paddock&#39;s suite. And he said it was at that point that he heard what he &quot;believed to be drilling&quot; and figured someone was just working in the area. So if we know it&#39;s fact that Jesus called down to Security and Engineering at 9:59, and heard what sounded like drilling at that time, when the crowd shooting didn&#39;t begin until 10:05, was what he heard <em>actually drilling</em>? It had to be, right (assuming Jesus is telling the truth)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These posts are interesting, and I keep seeing them pop up on here. </p>

<p>The one thing they have in common is that they are <strong>easily deconstructed by applying the official narrative</strong> and that should be a huge red flag to all of you. </p>

<p>It is literally making the users of this subreddit apply the official narrative in order to deconstruct a ridiculous assertion. </p>

<p>And if we don&#39;t deconstruct this easily knock-downable theory, we run the risk of seeing users running with it wildly instead. It&#39;s a lose-lose, and it&#39;s clever, but hardly original.</p>

<p>So here goes:
After Jesus was shot, he took cover and radioed in that there was a gunman. He would have reported that he had been shot but he didn&#39;t want to tie up the radio channel while they coordinate <strong>how to deal with a gunman in their hotel</strong>.</p>

<p>Campos never &quot;had to know he was about to shoot 500 people&quot; - he already knew their was an active shooter in the hotel, and that it was an emergency situation for everyone in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Campos apparently had the clarity of mind to use his cell to coordinate a response to his injuries. Maybe they teach you this kind of thing in training, who knows, but it certainly wouldn&#39;t come to me instinctively. </p>

<p>Do I believe Campos, and others? I honestly have no reason to. But posts like this are so easily deconstructable using the official narrative, that they seem only to serve the  purposes <em>of pushing that offical narrative</em> as it really is the only possible response.</p>

<p>Someone makes a claim, and it&#39;s easily <em>debunked</em> by applying the official narrative. <strong>But</strong> it doesn&#39;t mean the official narrative is true - it just encourages users to endorse it unwittingly by reinforcing &quot;what we know&quot; against something that is obviously not true (or <em>less true</em>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you had been following you would know the sheriff had already said the door alarm wasn&#39;t the stairwell. Sheriff states once Campos realised the door wasnt opening and went to check from the other side and on the way tended to the door alarm then went to the stairwell door and noticed the barricade....   Campos made no mention whatsoever of tending to that door ajar first, he made up some bullshit about door notifications but as other security at other hotels have pointed out, the doors leading into rooms dont have alarms and is completely un-practical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re intentionally being obtuse. </p>

<p>Here, let&#39;s apply the official narrative to illustrate my point perfectly that posts such as yours serve only to push the official narrative as it&#39;s the only appropriate response.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What radio chatter is he afraid of tying up?
He has reported an active shooter in the hotel, such radio chatter may include but is not limited to: organising security/leo to the floor the shooter was reported on, ensuring security staff in other areas are aware of the situation and to remain on high alert in their areas, maintaining communication between security personal during a crisis... and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a situation like this, the most important thing to do is to neutralise the threat before more harm can be caused to more people. You put out the fire before you tend to the wounded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just one minor shooting
Not really sure what you mean by this - even a single round fired in a hotel could hardly be considered a &#39;minor&#39; shooting.</p>

<p>...the only person with relevant information is him.
Campos says that he didn&#39;t mention that he was shot at this point because he didn&#39;t want to tie up radio chatter with <em>discussion of his injuries</em>, as it&#39;s more important to discuss the shooter so as to coordinate a response to it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Campos omitted that he was injured, which is not to say that he ceased completely talking about the shooter situation - merely he omitted the one aspect that he was injured in order to free up discussion that <em>he and the rest of the security team would have</em> about the shooter situation.</p>

<p>What kind of information might this be? This includes, I imagine, Campos giving details about his whereabouts, perceived shooter location, perceived weapon type, perceived number of shooters, and any other details that would allow his security dispatch to coordinate a response effectively.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not endorsing the official narrative, and nor am I saying I believe it - but posts like yours only serve to demonstrate that <em>it&#39;s the only reasonable response</em>, and I want that to be perfectly clear to everyone here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Who is in danger of being shot? As far as they knew no one was.The shooter was holed up in his room and supposedly shot through the door. There is no added threat to them getting their wounded to safety while approaching and dealing with the situation. Either way, REPORTING that you are shot is different from necessitating the rescue of a wounded. </p>

<p>Have you even listened to the radio shit or looked at confirmed timelines? You have no clue what you are even talking about. He wasn&#39;t even with his security team. There was no reason for them to be communicating in any capacity because the shooter wasn&#39;t even massacring people yet. They wouldn&#39;t even really know what the hell is going on. And still somehow it takes several tens of minutes for a team to get up to deal with the situation?

<p>Everyone in the vicinity of the hotel. If you&#39;re staying at a hotel and hear gunfire coming from a nearby room (or floor) do you feel like you are in danger of being shot?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as they knew no one was.</p>

<p>&quot;Well he hasn&#39;t techically killed anyone yet, he just firing a gun through a door, I guess no one is danger of getting shot!&quot; /s</p>

<p>There is no added threat to them getting their wounded to safety while approaching and dealing with the situation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, however in terms of communication, it&#39;s better to use different channels of communication to discuss different topics. <strong>Campos called in the shooter on the radio, and called in his injuries on his cell.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He wasn&#39;t even with his security team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said he was, and you know it.</p>

<p>I said that &#39;he omitted that he was injured in order to free up discussion that he and the rest of the security team (<strong>that he was on the radio with, his dispatch, the other security staff in the building</strong>) would have about the shooter situation&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no reason for them to be communicating in any capacity because the shooter wasn&#39;t even massacring people yet.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You frame questions in the most useless way. It doesn&#39;t matter how a nearby person feels about their potential of being shot. It matters what the reality of the situation is. The reality is that the shooter only fired when he was apparently approached by a security guard. But again none of that makes sense anyway, why why jesus there in the first place? He just happened to go up to the room before the guy shot anyone? It&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Well he hasn&#39;t techically killed anyone yet, he just firing a gun through a door, I guess no one is danger of getting shot!&quot; /s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t be dumb. You know I&#39;m talking about the people at the concert. They didn&#39;t know he was about to shoot everyone out his window. Obviously they would want to respond to an active shooter. You are ignoring the point. </p>

<p>The point is that up to this point they have no understanding of what is about to happen so the idea that they need to keep radios clear is absolutely idiotic. They aren&#39;t dealing with mass hysteria and a confusing set of mass violence they dont understand at that point, as far as they know there is just a guy in the hotel who shot someone else in the hotel. That requires a very different response and coordination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed, however in terms of communication, it&#39;s better to use different channels of communication to discuss different topics. Campos called in the shooter on the radio, and called in his injuries on his cell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You just contradicted what you said earlier. Also, no matter what he chose to do, using his cell or not, that is irrelevant. What we are saying is that his STORY doesn&#39;t make sense. It doesn&#39;t make sense that he would feel a need to use his cell in this situation. It only makes sense in hindsight to think that he shouldn&#39;t say things over radio because it is only reasonable in the situation of a mass shooting event. Police and guards dont just call their injuries in on their cell, they call it in so that others know that the shooter means to actually harm with their bullets and that he needs attention. </p>

<p>plus it raises suspicion of just why they go out of their way to frame it like this. It&#39;s like they know things dont really make sense so they are trying to come up with an explanation for why several of his actions dont add up. Saying he used his cell is extremely convenient but still doesnt make sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never said he was, and you know it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t saying that you claimed that. I was making a separate point that his actions and the position he was in don&#39;t make sense. I wasn&#39;t saying that you believed his security team was with him upstairs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here you go again. What sort of hotels wouldn&#39;t be concerned with gunfire on their premises? This was in Las Vegas, not Mogadishu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are misunderstanding. I wasn&#39;t saying they wouldn&#39;t be concerned. Im saying that they wouldn&#39;t have been communicating up to that point where there would be escalated chatter on the radio.</p>

<p>Imagine it like this:</p>

<p><strong>Radio before campos is shot:</strong> &quot;Hey we got a drunk guy here. Ummm we got an issue with someone on 3rd floor someone check it out&quot;</p>

<p>Then somehow campos is randomly on the floor with the shooter outside his door investigating before any shooting occurred. At this point they still are unaware of the danger. Everyone would be calm on the radio. Then campos is shot.</p>

<p><strong>Radio after campos is shot:</strong> &quot;Oh shit we have an active shooter situation. Call the police. What do we do? What is happening?&quot;</p>

<p>From here campos should be directly involved. He should be responding to questions. He should say that he was shot. He should describe what happened clearly and give all the info he can. Instead he just said there was shooting and then he uses his cell phone and lays there? </p>

<p>This makes even less sense when you consider the police response. It&#39;s tens of minutes before anything is done. The security guards dont even breach the room. So why would campos not tell anyone he was shot? The security guards aren&#39;t doing anything, they would at least go help him. It makes no fucking sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading back through my response below, I hope I&#39;m not coming across as a dick, so disregard the tone in places. I&#39;m just trying to get to the bottom of it like everyone else. I think these kinds of back-and-forths are a really bad way to conduct discussion, and things said -and unsaid- can be very easily misunderstood.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You frame questions in the most useless way. It doesn&#39;t matter how a nearby person feels about their potential of being shot. It matters what the reality of the situation is. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You asked &quot;who is in danger of being shot?&quot; and now you say that I&#39;m &#39;framing answers&#39; when I respond with &quot;everyone in the vicinity&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that the shooter only fired when he was apparently approached by a security guard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So therefore, he&#39;s not a danger to anyone? I&#39;m not following.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But again none of that makes sense anyway, why [is] jesus there in the first place? He just happened to go up to the room before the guy shot anyone? It&#39;s ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that the offical narrative isn&#39;t ridiculous, it&#39;s completely absurd. What I&#39;m saying is that you keep making these easily deconstructable statements, whereupon the only possible response is to apply the offical narrative, and that makes me suspicious. It means you are getting users to unwittingly endorse the official narrative, and that should be a red flag to everyone.</p>

<p>So here we go: Why is Campos up there in the first place? Watch the Ellen interview, and believe what you want with a grain of salt. He says it was because he had received a notification that there was an unsecured door that he had to go check on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t be dumb. You know I&#39;m talking about the people at the concert. They didn&#39;t know he was about to shoot everyone out his window.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep trying to undermine the significant threat of <strong>having a shooter in a hotel</strong>. </p>

<p>What you said was: &quot;Who is in danger of being shot. As far as they knew no one was&quot;. The shooter was holed up in his room and supposedly shot through the door&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right - they didn&#39;t know he was about to shoot everyone out of his window, but they did know that there was a shooter in the building, and that the shooter is a danger to everyone in the vicinity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...up to this point they have no understanding of what is about to happen so the idea that they need to keep radios clear is absolutely idiotic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong. Up to this point they have no understanding of what could potentially occur (shooter firing out of window), which is no reason to believe that the shooter was not a threat to the people within the hotel. You keep undermining the threat to people within the hotel, in the vicinity of the shooter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They aren&#39;t dealing with mass hysteria and a confusing set of mass violence they dont understand at that point, as far as they know there is just a guy in the hotel who shot someone else in the hotel. That requires a very different response and coordination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep undermining the significant threat of having a shooter within the building. Campos supposedly wanted to keep his radio channel clear of chatter <strong>about his injuries</strong>, so that they could focus on coordinating a response to deal with the shooter using <em>that</em> channel. If you have ever used a radio as part of a large operation, then you would know that multiple topics on one channel can make things needlessly confusing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just contradicted what you said earlier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use your quotes. But I think you mean when I said: &quot;the most important thing to do is to neutralise the threat before more harm can be caused to more people. You put out the fire before you tend to the wounded.&quot;</p>

<p>No contradiction, but let me make it clearer.</p>

<p>The most important thng to do is to [takes steps towards] neutralising the threat before more harm can be caused to more people. You put out the fire before you tend to the wounded. So, <strong>Campos called in the shooter on the radio, and called in his injuries on his cell</strong> - in that order.</p>

<p>This way he can free up the radio channel for discussion about the shooter, whilst he can use his cell to report his injuries. </p>

<p>Security team on radio channel can coordinate their response to the shooter. Whereas he can describe the extent of his injuries to the infirmary/first aid on his cell -thus freeing up radio chatter- and the medical team&#39;s response to them.</p>

<p>Such medical chatter might include: where were you shot, how bad is the bleeding, is anything broken, can you walk, are you feeling dizzy, are you close to the source of danger, do you have any medical experience, are you carrying any medical supplies (tourniquet etc);also, advice regarding how to stem the flow of blood. All these things would clutter up communication on the radio channel which is trying to coordinate a response to an active shooter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It only makes sense in hindsight to think that he shouldn&#39;t say things over radio because it is only reasonable in the situation of a mass shooting event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;only reasonable in the situation of a mass shooting event&quot;. An active gunman in a hotel should be treated as a very serious matter, <em>so as to prevent</em> a mass-shooting event. As the first shots are fired, you should treat the situation immediately as a crisis, that needs to be neutralised as quickly as possible before it becomes worse. You keep trying to undermine the significance of having an active shooter in a hotel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police and guards dont just call their injuries in on their cell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In some situations, like this one, maybe they do. So as to prevent radio chatter, and make their coordinated response to a active-shooter event more conducive to success.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They call it in so that others know that the shooter means to actually [cause] harm with their bullets...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep trying to undermine the seriousness of a shooter in a hotel. If someone is firing a gun in a hotel, <strong>whether they intend on causing harm to people is irrelevant</strong>. This is a dangerous situation, whether the shooter &quot;means to cause harm with their bullets&quot; or not. A person firing a gun in a hotel requires immediate attention, so as to prevent people from coming to harm. </p>

<p>This is a very interesting point you keep wanting me to spell out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...and that he needs attention. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why he used his cell. To coordinate a response to the shooter on his radio, and to discuss the extent of his injuries and their containment/treatment on his cell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s like they know things dont really make sense so they are trying to come up with an explanation for why several of his actions dont add up. Saying he used his cell is extremely convenient but still doesnt make sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe. I think at this point we have absolutely no reason to believe the offical narrative whatsoever.</p>

<p>And yet, all the points you are making can be absolved simply by applying the offical narrative - and that&#39;s what makes me so suspicious of posts like yours - <em>they are easily deconstructed by applying the offical narrative; despite the absurdity of the offical narrative</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wasn&#39;t saying that you believed his security team was with him upstairs. I was making a separate point that his actions and the position he was in don&#39;t make sense. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My bad, I now understand what you mean. However, his actions and the position he was in <em>do perfectly make sense</em> but whether you believe Campos or not, is another thing entirely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Im saying that they wouldn&#39;t have been communicating up to that point where there would be escalated chatter on the radio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Discussion about an active shooter in the building, and discussion about the extent (and treatment) of Campos&#39; injuries are two seperate topics and should discussed on two separate channels. In this case, discussion about the shooter on the radio; discussion about Campos&#39; injuries on his cell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine it like this: ...campos is randomly on the floor with the shooter outside his door investigating before any shooting occurred.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it odd? Sure, of course it is. With the lack of information being provided to the public, this entire thing is odd and should be called into question.</p>

<p>But the points you are making however - one only &quot;needs to apply the offical narrative&quot; in order to dispell them. What we should all be focusing on, is the gaps in the narrative, and the inconsistencies, and the constantly changing timeline. The points you are making can be easily dispelled by watching the interview with Campos on Ellen - hence my suspicion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From here campos should be directly involved. He should be responding to questions. He should say that he was shot. He should describe what happened clearly and give all the info he can. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know, this is what is so weird - we don&#39;t have a radio transcript with Campos&#39; comments on the radio, at the moment that he was shot - we only have his word.</p>

<p>And yet we have Schuck&#39;s radio transcript of when he arrived on the scene, and also reported (re-reported?) the shooting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead he just said there was shooting and then he uses his cell phone and lays there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We just don&#39;t know what happened here. If Campos is to be believed, I don&#39;t think he was just laying here doing nothing - I think he would have been giving all assistance he could.</p>

<p>However: no evidence; only word. I want to hear Campos&#39; radio transcript. I want to see footage of Paddock bringing multiple bags into the building, before I believe anything. </p>

<p>I have my own theories about what happened, but will not discuss them online. All I will say, is this whole thing stinks, and we all have every reason to be suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not reading through all that. Even the first point of discussion you make is you doing the same thing putting things in the wrong context to twist it into an irrelevant point. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re doing it intentionally but either way it makes it pointless to talk to you. Several times I&#39;ve given you the benefit of the doubt but you keep doing this shit.</p>

<p>I say that you frame questions in the wrong way and you come back saying, &quot;Lol no I answered this question accurately&quot;. First of all, in context, that doesn&#39;t even make sense. I said you framed QUESTIONS in a useless way, not ANSWERS. Your answer to what I asked was fine (though still missed the point). What I was calling you out on was ASKING how people would feel in a situation with a shooter nearby. No shit people would be afraid of being shot in that situation. </p>

<p>If there is any danger of anything even if it isn&#39;t realistic, people will be scared. That has no relevance to what I was saying. Why ask that shit? Why focus on what irrelevant people nearby <em>feel</em> about the danger of hearing gunshots? We were talking about the danger from the guards&#39; perspective and how they respond to the threat. No one was in immediate danger since they knew the guy was shut in his room and MORE SPECIFICALLY TO THE ACTUAL POINT IN CONTEXT no one was being shot up at the concert yet so there wouldn&#39;t be a need for &quot;clearing radio chatter&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just not worth my time and energy to go through this shit with someone like you. You can believe what you want. But if you want people to take you seriously in the future and want them to read long responses (which I am totally fine doing), you should work on comprehending and interpreting what the other is saying better. Almost everything you&#39;ve said is so far off the point of what is being discussed that it&#39;s useless to try to discuss it with you, and I tried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, perhaps he was concerned that there were other people in the room being shot at? You walk near a door and someone starts pumping out rounds and one hits you......then what do you think?</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it&#39;s nothing to worry about, probably just another gun owner practicing in his room.&quot; LOL okey dokey.</p>

<p>You have an armed idiot and you aren&#39;t armed and he just shot at you. You get on the radio getting someone up there asap before he comes out the door after your ass. His wound wasn&#39;t all that bad at the time and his main concern might be getting another one.</p>

<p>Help is on the way to stop him, call and report the wound on the phone to 911 since those are the people trained to handle your wound. </p>

<p>And it could go really quick &quot;on floor x, multiple shots fired out of room y into the hallway&quot; click, dial 911 &quot;at such an such place I have been shot in the leg, shooter is still active&quot; &lt;----- and that is a key thing here.

    <div class="md"><p>So he just lays there doing nothing for half an hour? Even though he thought the guy was going to come out and shoot people despite being able to obviously confirm to himself that wasn&#39;t happening after 30 seconds and especially after the guy starts shooting out the window for 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Again, even if it makes sense to call 911 on the phone, it is his REASONING for why he acted a certain way that people are taking issue with, not that he called 911 on his phone. To say that he wanted to keep radio clear makes no sense when as far as they knew there was an isolated shooter incident in the hotel and not about to be a huge mass shooting out the window. Even ignoring that he needed medical attention, it is important to say you&#39;ve been shot because that adds context to the threat.</p>

<p>And then when you add all of it together and consider the rest of the guards&#39; actions and the police and the other things that were said it just falls apart. Why does it take so long for them to even approach the shooter? If it&#39;s so important to keep radio clear so they can coordinate, why did they not coordinate or do anything for so long? </p>

<p>How do you know they didn&#39;t coordinate? And it took them awhile because he was armed and shooting and the police got involved and then took over. Add in all the chaos after he starts shooting at the crowd - radio traffic both with security and the police. Perhaps at this point, and I am sure of this, they weren&#39;t sure he was the shooter or if they were if he was the only one.</p>

<p>It was chaos. A lot of things going all at once. You have a guy who shoots through a door, cops get called, show up and then &#39;someone&#39; is now also shooting at people at a concert. </p>

<p>We have the benefit of looking at the whole thing after the fact outside the &#39;fog of war&#39; so it is easy to criticize a person.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s not to mention the steps being taken inside the casino to protect others, people running about in panic thinking anyone with something in their hands is a gun and they are the shooter (could be a gun and undercover officer, etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they didn&#39;t. They didn&#39;t even get to campos for ages or approach the shooter. There is no coordination there. Unless you want to argue they coordinated doing nothing for all that time. But that would be a pretty stupid argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps at this point, and I am sure of this, they weren&#39;t sure he was the shooter or if they were if he was the only one.</p>

<p>They would have already approached him by the time he started shooting out the window if they were doing anything. And even if that wasn&#39;t the case they would still have sent ANYONE up to investigate or meet up with campos and check on the situation because then it would become an even higher priority. </p>

<p>The only way that makes sense is if you factor in all the people reporting other shooters around the strip. Only then would there be legitimate confusion and with that in mind, what is even the story with all of that? How are there so many reports of shooters but nope, just one guy up in his room that they take 40 minutes to track down. How is it that the FIRST instance of a shooter they receive is the last one they investigate? The one where they know exactly where he is and has already been reported to security. Like seriously?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how chaos works. You don&#39;t go &quot;Oh hey we have a security guard shot and now he isn&#39;t responding on radio but we didn&#39;t go up and check on him or the shooter he called in. And ummm now we have someone shooting a concert...it couldn&#39;t POSSIBLY be the guy who fired 200 fucking rounds down a hallway who has a camera setup ooutside his room...let&#39;s leave and come back later&quot;. Like...no. Fuck no. That&#39;s not what happens. At the very least the security guards would have gone up, that&#39;s their fucking job. Yet they didnt..and somehow you&#39;re saying it&#39;s still likely that they &quot;coordinated&quot; something for 40 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! I&#39;m curious to hear the audio of him radioing this down to dispatch, and then hearing their response and what they did next. </p>

<p>Who did dispatch contact upon hearing there were shots on the 32nd floor? It seemed police didn&#39;t know specifics until after the shooting on the crowd began, when they seemingly should&#39;ve known before that. </p>

<p>I will say that this conspiracy started with me wondering whether Campos was in on it, but now I&#39;m realizing that we can attribute these inconsistencies to MGM trying to relay a story that does the least amount of damage to them once lawsuits begin.</p>

<p>I&#39;m close to determining this is nothing more than the typical legalese shenanigans.</p>

<p>My advice to any/all those who still have the ability to discern the troubling happenings all around us is to seek Jesus as things are about to go truly sideways I am afraid to say. Time is all but up! I cannot implore to everyone how important this is so please give this like 100 seconds of consideration as it is not much to risk on something so potentially vital!</p>

<p>Oh my god, <em>this</em>. Even if I knew nothing about the context and/or found nothing fishy about the story, the body language, particularly around the touching, was so <em>off</em> that it made me physically uncomfortable. It was supposed to look like supportive touches directed at someone speaking about trauma, but those are transparently control touches, not caring touches.</p>

<p>That way Jesus doesn&#39;t relax into the touches, but visibly tenses up, the first time increasing his nervous hand wringing, another time immediately slumping into himself even more and drawing his hand across his forehead- yet the man continues the unreciprocated and unwelcome touching. These are not buddies supporting each other, the touching is all about being a constant reminder of power and control. I can&#39;t help but wonder why a maintenance man would have such a dominant status over a security guard, and be asserting that status and control so much.</p>

<p>It may have been slightly less obvious than with the LVPD press conference, where the sheriff looks and sounds like he&#39;s about to break down while Rouse of the FBI stands way too close beside him, looking at him like <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/pZae2rUK0LaU/giphy.gif">this</a>, but I don&#39;t see how people can watch this and not see a man being interviewed with his handler. Or perhaps being interviewed while surrounded on both sides by handlers.</p>

<p>Remember how there was surveillance equipment set up by Paddock supposedly to watch for the cops?  I think it was actually an early warning system not set up by Paddock but the buyer/shooters.  </p>

<p>The FBI is covering up the botched sting along with MGM because Campos, when he went to investigate, was mistaken for a cop by the buyers.  They thought they were being double crossed, offed Paddock, shot Campos, and  then committed the attack.  Boom, FBI sting goes horribly wrong and everyone goes into CYA mode.</p>

<p>If campos is actually on the floor of the shooter why are the police reporting they are on a different floors, wouldnt they know exactly which floor he was on. </p>

<p>Where is the call from Mandalay bay to the police about a shooting in their hotel? And the police scanner relay of that info.</p>

<p>Why arent there other hotel guests reporting gunfire in the hotel? Where are their interviews? </p>

<p>The door shown in the picture no way has 200 rounds through it. Nor does it show any signs of an explosion to breach it. No burn marks on the door still connected to the door frame or the opposite frame. The door &quot;blown&quot; off the hinges is the stronger portion of the door and has slide pins that go up and down into the floor and top plate. The door that remains attached in the weaker door and would be the one dislodged if anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen this posted anywhere but here goes: two things from the Ellen show interview that stuck out to me. </p>

<p>First, Campos&#39; use of language. He spoke in terms that are not used by every day people. For example, he stated that he repeatedly told the engineer to &quot;take cover,&quot; instead of get down or get back. He used the phrase &quot;dispersed rounds&quot; instead of he shot more or something equally simple. Either this guy watches a lot of cop and military movies, he is not who he says he is, or he was thoroughly coached. </p>

<p>Second, Ellen&#39;s stretch to call him a hero. Assuming everything is true, which I&#39;m still not conceding, then at most he is a victim. I feel bad for the guy. He was shot and involved tangentially in a horrific event. However, he stumbled on this and told one dude that they were being shot at. The hero narrative is so empty and plainly a distraction that even Ellen couldn&#39;t find the right words to qualify him as a hero. Go back and watch that moment. The hero narrative distracts from questioning what actually happened. I don&#39;t think Ellen is seriously in on it, I just think she&#39;s not that intelligent and takes the bait, and &quot;they&quot; knew that and that she would give a soft interview. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait a minute. Logically. If he “wanted to keep radio traffic clear”. That statement. That one alone. To keep it clear it would mean they knew shooting was going on in the first place. Even before he “checked it out”. There was already chatter on the radios. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is in danger of being shot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone in the vicinity of the hotel. If you&#39;re staying at a hotel and hear gunfire coming from a nearby room (or floor) do you feel like you are in danger of being shot?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as they knew no one was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Well he hasn&#39;t techically killed anyone yet, he just firing a gun through a door, I guess no one is danger of getting shot!&quot; /s</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no added threat to them getting their wounded to safety while approaching and dealing with the situation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, however in terms of communication, it&#39;s better to use different channels of communication to discuss different topics. <strong>Campos called in the shooter on the radio, and called in his injuries on his cell.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He wasn&#39;t even with his security team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said he was, and you know it.</p>

<p>I said that &#39;he omitted that he was injured in order to free up discussion that he and the rest of the security team (<strong>that he was on the radio with, his dispatch, the other security staff in the building</strong>) would have about the shooter situation&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no reason for them to be communicating in any capacity because the shooter wasn&#39;t even massacring people yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here you go again. What sort of hotels wouldn&#39;t be concerned with gunfire on their premises? This was in Las Vegas, not Mogadishu.</p>
