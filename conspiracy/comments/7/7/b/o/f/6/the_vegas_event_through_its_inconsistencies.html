<p>I think they were sloppy on purpose. I think they want the distrust so that they have grounds to censor and clamp down harder. </p>

<p>I’ve never seen so many comment sections calling “BS”. Call me crazy, but I think this Op was crafted to create conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>I know some of you have to see this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know man...I think most people don&#39;t really care nor have they done any LV research, it is all based on the Corporate Media Propaganda machine. It&#39;s gotten a lot of traction in conspiracy circles, and it probably did redpill a few people, but the responses from my family and friends who are not already inculcated in the Conspiracy community is the same as it is towards all mass shootings. The fact that it was so sloppy the MSM has to start ignoring it will likely help further bury it, though I hope I am wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Create more, then turn everything against them.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t wait for some &quot;blatant evidence&quot; or some shit to come out about Vegas/whatever so they can then again label even more people as bat shit conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, now you&#39;re talking like those crazies surrounding the Vegas incident. Don&#39;t be one of those people&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s happened before. One of the first things that alarmed me when people were out and about talking about how they couldn&#39;t believe the story - we all know people we wouldn&#39;t usually expect to be somewhat suspect about the situation. It perhaps has worked out <em>too well</em>, as if intended.</p>

<p>Totally agree with you. I&#39;ve been bringing that up since it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m glad you see it. Here’s a great example of one of the things I believe was done deliberately to sow distrust:</p>

<p>Aaron Rouse stands behind Lombardo looking like a complete spook during every single public appearance. </p>

<p>This was ALL over the web. <em>The FBI handler keeping a stoic watch over the terrified Sheriff to make sure he stays on script</em> </p>

<p>Give me a break. FBI and Metro were well aware of what they were doing, and if they cared about optics AT ALL, Rouse could have simply been moved off-camera. </p>

<p>I’ve never seen so many people overdose on “red pills” in a 72-hour period. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, almost too smacked in the face. </p>

<p>And, and the turn of things, a couple of the co-workers at work who were so glued on every bit of news, mainstream or alternative, has completely shrugged it off now. Not brought up unless initiated, and when I do, it&#39;s always &quot;well nothing ever came out of it right?&quot;.</p>
