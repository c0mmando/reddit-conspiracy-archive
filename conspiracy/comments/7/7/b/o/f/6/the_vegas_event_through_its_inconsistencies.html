       I think they were sloppy on purpose. I think they want the distrust so that they have grounds to censor and clamp down harder.

       I don't know man...I think most people don't really care nor have they done any LV research, it is all based on the Corporate Media Propaganda machine. It's gotten a lot of traction in conspiracy circles, and it probably did redpill a few people, but the responses from my family and friends who are not already inculcated in the Conspiracy community is the same as it is towards all mass shootings. The fact that it was so sloppy the MSM has to start ignoring it will likely help further bury it, though I hope I am wrong.

       Can't wait for some "blatant evidence" or some shit to come out about Vegas/whatever so they can then again label even more people as bat shit conspiracy theorists.

       It's happened before. One of the first things that alarmed me when people were out and about talking about how they couldn't believe the story - we all know people we wouldn't usually expect to be somewhat suspect about the situation. It perhaps has worked out
       <em>
        too well
       </em>
       , as if intended.

       Totally agree with you. I've been bringing that up since it happened.

       I’m glad you see it. Here’s a great example of one of the things I believe was done deliberately to sow distrust:
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaron Rouse stands behind Lombardo looking like a complete spook during every single public appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was ALL over the web.
       <em>
        The FBI handler keeping a stoic watch over the terrified Sheriff to make sure he stays on script
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me a break. FBI and Metro were well aware of what they were doing, and if they cared about optics AT ALL, Rouse could have simply been moved off-camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve never seen so many people overdose on “red pills” in a 72-hour period.

       You have to admit, it sucks up a lot of cognitive bandwidth trying to keep track of all the inconsistencies and "plot holes." If this was a TV show, I'd probably have already concluded the writers screwed up, wrote themselves into a corner and lack any semblance of direction, and quit the show.

       This has been a concern of mine since seeing so many posts about not normally conspiracy people questioning the narrative this time.  My personal theory is they're attempting to link conspiracy theories and mistrust in government to the Republican party and make it what identity politics is to the Democratic party.

       That is a very good point you make, I didn't think of that.     I initially thought this was a FBI sting operation gone bad -- some rogue element interfering with some operation and now they are just sloppily covering up a total fuck-up on their part.   Reports of chaos in other casinos because they were chasing said rogue element.

       It was total chaos by design in my opinion. They wanted conflicting stories. They wanted all of this. This is why you have people saying shots were fired at Bellagio. That’s why u/TheOuterDark posted a video on his YouTube Channel showing video of people walking through the Tropicana,

       , some appearing to be police, some not.

       That is a very good point you make, I didn't think of that.     I initially thought this was a FBI sting operation gone bad -- some rogue element interfering with some operation and now they are just sloppily covering up a total fuck-up on their part.   Reports of chaos in other casinos because they were chasing said rogue element.
