        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Student loans are the greatest conspiracy that barely anyone mentions. The decrease in the disposable income of people between the ages of 25-35 could have an unrecoverable impact on the economy.  If we continue heading in this direction, then the effects on the economy will be permanent.  </p>

<p>My theory: It will consolidate money into the hands of the elites and the banking institutions, and the middle class will be slowly wiped out.  Over the next ten years, you will see the income of the top 1% growing and the income of the  middle class regressing. I expect this to occur more rapidly in later years. </p>

<p>What is conspiracy&#39;s take on this? Am I overreacting?</p>

<p>Already there, Student Loans are just a way to ensure the Millenials have no way to dig themselves out of the mess their parents and grandparents created. The current US Middle Class is a decrepit husk, built on over-stretched collateral with credit card debt, auto debt, and mortgage debt. Wages, when adjusted for inflation, have been stagnant since the fucking 60&#39;s. The edifice is already rotten, all that is needed is one final shake to bring it all down. In my opinion, that will be the next financial crisis, which will likely be a full blown depression. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that this isn&#39;t new, this is something that has been going on for a long time.</p>

<p>My conspiracy theory is that we are at a huge point of anti intellectualism.. educated people are bad, because they&#39;re being brainwashed by the left. Therefore it&#39;s better to just get a job and say fuck that SJW brainwashing bullshit.</p>

<p>Later in life, people that decided it&#39;s better to just make other people money than to get educated enough to have educated responses to the government taking more and more control.. because brainwashing.. can&#39;t make a cohesive argument why they&#39;re being controlled.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a conservative, I got through college without being brainwashed, and if anything, conservative views were the most loud views presented in the public setting. I&#39;m not religious, but I remember walking through a horribly horrific scene depicting how horrific abortions are. Billboards showing how nasty, in the most graphic way, that shit goes.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m also currently unemployed at the moment, because that degree didn&#39;t give me as much upward mobility as I thought it would.</p>

<p>But regardless, I&#39;m educated enough to speak up, even if it wasn&#39;t a magical gateway to a better life.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather be educated and in debt, than be slaving for a horrible ways, without even being able to explain how I&#39;m being exploited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s far worse than OP suspects. People will be in debt from cradle to grave.</p>

<p>Think about this, when you are still a teenager you accrue a massive student loan debt in order to acquire the education for a career/job. Ten or 15 years later you take out - a 30 year - mortgage in order to have a stable place to live and raise a family.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s already 3 decades of debt you&#39;re in and you&#39;re only middle aged.</p>

<p>When your kids become late teens you take out more debt to put them through college, and you&#39;re still paying that monthly mortgage note that never seems to go away.</p>

<p>(Don&#39;t forget all the many insurances, car loans, and credit card payments all along the way)</p>

<p>Then when you become 60 or 65 or 70 your health begins to fail and you need medical care which has escalated astronomically in cost, you get a reverse mortgage on you home (the one you just spent your whole life paying for), or more tragically are forced onto Medicaid to pay for long term care.</p>

<p>In the event you&#39;re forced onto Medicaid, the state will seize all of your assets valued more than $2,000. They&#39;ll take the deed to your house, your car, any assets/investments in order to qualify you for Medicaid.</p>

<p>Your descendants will be left with nothing. There will be no inheritance and no estate, no matter how modest. Government will take all of it.</p>

<p>So the next generations have nothing to start with, no cushion of family home and savings to fall back on in young adulthood. They too will spend all of their lives in debt to stay alive and they too will be wiped out at the end of life.</p>

<p>This cycle of perpetual indebtedness <strong>is an intentional plan</strong> to keep the people on the plantation and the accumulated wealth of generations forever in the clutches of the bankers.</p>

<p>Remember that Dutch banker video? The most revealing thing was in part 2 where he said &quot;All the misery you see in the world isn&#39;t an accident, it&#39;s a business model.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And all this debt with interest rates at ridiculously low levels.  What happens when the rates start to rise?  Do you think people will reconsider their spending habits?  $699 for an Iphone sounds ridiculous but if you package it as $65 a month it becomes a necessity not a luxury.  Besides, our money is now just a number on a computer screen.  One of the most successful things casinos did was convince people to convert their cash in to chips.  This way money loses it&#39;s perceived value and losses aren&#39;t viewed as they would typically be.   We do the same today with debit cards/credit cards.  Most people can&#39;t even tell you what the charge was the last time they bought something.  It&#39;s just a number that flashes on a checkout register.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t afford to pay down your student loans, there are many options to help, including things like income based repayments.</p>
