       Humans have been eating meat and fish for our entire history, it's just not 'sustainable' with billions of people doing it; in a socioeconomic system that only cares about profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sustainability at this point is a joke. We are not keeping this socioeconomic system for much longer, every life support system on this planet is in rapid decline and everyone is just pretending that things are going to be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, the bottom line is if you peg it solely on population your options are:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Somehow prevent people from having multiple children then wait decades for the population to decline.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Wait for the population to decline through mass death from war or natural disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Just cool it with how much meat, dairy, eggs and seafood we all eat by picking out different things at the supermarket and learning some new recipes, i.e. adopting a diet sustainable for the people who are currently alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third option sure does sound a lot more pleasant, and practical, than the first two.

       Long term, the Earth is absolutely fine. Even if we nuke ourselves to oblivion, within a few hundred thousand years the Earth would recover and move well past our pathetic existence on its surface. I would prefer it doesn't come to that either, and as you said, there are ways we can make our lifestyle sustainable, sources of renewable energy,responsible farming, fishing, and resource gathering. It is all within our capabilities as a species. Only time will tell if we can come together and save us from ourselves.

       I will do the math for you. Using the square mileage for Texas: 1 square mile = 5280 x 5280 square feet = 27,878,400 square feet. So 268,581 square miles = 7,487,608,550,400. For simplicity say 7.5 x 10
       <sup>
        12.
       </sup>
       That divided by 7 x 10
       <sup>
        9
       </sup>
       is indeed over 1000 square feet per person. So if we made one giant one-story compound over Texas, land, water, and all, we would each get a 1,000 square foot unit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves a lot of land to maintain those people.  Don't fret.

       Overpopulation has very little to do with how big your house is. There are
       <em>
        overcrowded
       </em>
       cities certainly but overpopulation figures come from our rates of consumption(hydrocarbons, arable land, copper etc) and how many people are living or are trying to live at those rates of consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all land is suitable for food production, or quarrys, or wells or whatever else resource extraction methods. Raw land area is not really a useful metric in this conversation.

       The entire world outside of Texas would be available.
With that, the first world doesn't have a problem with overpopulation.  This is a third world problem, so I'm not sure Reddit has the solution.

      <p>
       Look at the replacement rates outside of Africa and the Middle East.  They are dismal.  We in America will be speaking Arabic and Spanish over English by the time you are in a nursing home.

       And they are all fighting to live like fat americans. It doesn't matter if whitey is gradually dying off, we're still using too much as a species. It doesn't matter if we all lived in texas, I just explained why raw land area is an irrelevant way to measure it.

       Did you miss the part where I said it isn't about how big your house is and that it is about rates of consumption? You could have infinite square miles of land but that doesn't mean anything if it doesn't have copper or hydrocarbons under it. You're being dense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand that not every square mile of non-texas land is going to be suitable for a farm, or a fracking well, or a mine, or have an aquifer? And that the issue with overpopulation is how much we are using resources, not how much land is being used?

       I didn't miss the part, but it doesn't make any sense. You can't stick a well in the ground anywhere on the planet and stuff automatically comes out. You can't mine for gold anywhere on earth just because there is available land there, if there is no gold under it. Are you aware of that? People make good money finding out what resources are under the ground. If it was a simple as you claim "
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       land is being used" then those jobs wouldn't exist, because people could magically get resources from anywhere apparently!
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, none of your impossible claim addresses the fact that there are too many people who want to use too many resources when all the available resources are finite and take a long time to replenish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect you are either an idiot or plain don't want to understand this, because it's pretty simple.

       Or perhaps you have an agenda where you can't possibly see things another way.
Can't find water? There is another part of the world outside of Texas with it.  Can't find gold?  There is another part of the world with it.
       <br/>
       Yes we have to find it, but minerals are being found all the time and water covered much of the Earth (and it doesn't disappear when we use it, it's recycled in the water cycle).  There is no peak oil, that has been disproven by the Russians.  But if a person wants to run around screaming the world is coming to an end, you're the go-to dog.  I got you.
Open your mind and you will be a happier person.

       Do you think I
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to believe what I am arguing here? It sucks, I wish we had infinite everything but we don't. I have looked for evidence that I am wrong about this and I can't find anything that holds up. By all means, if you have information showing me how rare earth minerals and metals are effectively infinite please present it, I would love to be wrong about this. My agenda is: getting frustrated when people choose the comfort of sticking their heads in the sand instead of doing the math.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as water, your thought process is lacking nuance. Yes, water gets recycled but that is not an immediate process and most aquifers in developed nations are drawing down quicker than they are replaced. Desalinization is not a mass scale workable answer because the brine waste product is not easy to deal with and it's energy intensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument essentially boils down to "the world is really big, thus it is infinite".
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't discover gold and copper forever.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFyTSiCXWEE">
        Our ore grades are abysmal
       </a>
       . They are digging deeper, more dangerous, exponentially larger mines not because technology is improving things but because we have to in order to keep going. We can't find gold forever, and if you look at the numbers we are not discovering at replacement rates for current levels of extraction. This will not be solved by "there is another part of the world with it" because eventually that stops being true on a finite planet. We are starting to hit those limits of easily extractable resources already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Abiotic oil is a pretty comforting story, isn't it? I don't blame you for wanting to believe it. If it were that easy, why the
       <em>
        fuck
       </em>
       would we be fracking domestically? The theory that they are pretending that fossil fuels are scarce to keep up profits doesn't make sense if you look at fracking. It ruins waterways nearby and is not nearly as efficient/profitable as if they just kept milking the (supposedly) re-filling wells in the middle east and africa. Why shit in your backyard for pennies IF you already have an infinite, financially viable situation that also lets you nationbuild and bully people to use the petrodollar? Currently fracking is a bubble that could collapse the industry and ruin their ability to secure future funding. Fracking just doesn't make sense if you think the abiotic scheme is real and that they are manipulating the market that much. Why would they risk on fracking and other low grade methods if they already have such a sure thing with abiotic oil from convention wells? The obvious answer is either that abiotic oil isn't true or that it doesn't happen quickly enough for it to cover our rates of consumption, which brings us back to my greater point.

       You're simply not taking into account human technology and the drive forward.  If we run out of the ability to mine copper, we come up with a substitute.
Look, I'm not young.  I've seen the panic spin of "running out" since I was a kid.  It's funny how it never happens.

       It's naive and weak to say the future will solve all problems. It's a great way to absolve any responsibility though; "hey, we don't have to change anything because someone in the future will figure it out! how? I don't know, but we will, because why wouldn't we?" You can hope for all sorts of things to happen in the future but it's silly to rely on those hopes instead of doing something today.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now instead of infinite resources now we can rely on infinite ingenuity. If technology can solve the problems technology creates in a timely matter, why isn't it already?

       re: panic spin, what I'm hearing you say is "because a bad thing hasn't happened yet, it never will happen"

       Because our ingenuity has already overcome so much.  Bad things HAVE happened and we are still here.  To say that just because human ingenuity has overcome problems before this, that it won't overcome problems in the future is silly.
I was born in a time where computers took up full rooms and didn't do the work that your cellphone does today.  The "problems" aren't being solved because they aren't yet problems.  All the things you speak of are used to panic the masses.  It's the "Silent Spring" effect.  Guess a problem with poor science, panic the masses, solve a problem that doesn't need to be solved and cause another problem.
It happens over and over.

       When the trucks stop filling up your grocery store, it's agenda 21 and not grim reality right? Anyway, I encourage you to not prepare for anything(because there are no problems hooray!!) and when things become 3rd world around you to curse the digdog303s of the world for believing that silly stuff about "finite resources on a finite planet" so much that it came true. It'll make you feel better while you starve.

       Overpopulation is a myth. Oil is not finite and does not affect the climate like they are telling you. Climate changes and has for millions of years being that it's cyclical. Calm down. Everything will be fine. The elites want you worried about everything in order to control you. Peak x, y, or z does not exist. It's all about control. You should also stop shopping at super markets.

       It's sad how this sub is not on the environmentalism tip at all. They think every possible detail is agenda 21 and carbon tax scheming. Their arguments boil down to "it's big, way bigger than my house, therefore it's functionally infinite".

       I didn't miss the part, but it doesn't make any sense. You can't stick a well in the ground anywhere on the planet and stuff automatically comes out. You can't mine for gold anywhere on earth just because there is available land there, if there is no gold under it. Are you aware of that? People make good money finding out what resources are under the ground. If it was a simple as you claim "
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       land is being used" then those jobs wouldn't exist, because people could magically get resources from anywhere apparently!
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, none of your impossible claim addresses the fact that there are too many people who want to use too many resources when all the available resources are finite and take a long time to replenish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect you are either an idiot or plain don't want to understand this, because it's pretty simple.
