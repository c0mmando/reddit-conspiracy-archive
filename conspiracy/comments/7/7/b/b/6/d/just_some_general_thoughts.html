        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, i&#39;ve been digging around, watching a lot of different videos, reading things from all around, and... i just wanted to discuss a few things. Not sure if this is the right place to do it, but at least a few of you guys are usually pretty welcoming when it comes to ideas that are far out- just bear with me for a couple minutes.</p>

<p>SO </p>

<p>The world is fucked; 9/11 was an inside job; there&#39;s powers in place that control almost every aspect of our lives here on Earth; yadda yadda, we know that already. </p>

<p>And if you guys have been doing your conspiracy thing for at least as long I have, then you probably know about the occult aspect of whatever is going on behind the veil. Whether it deals with Freemasonry, or secret societies or &quot;satanism&quot; hell, even the pizzag8 thing has roots in the occult i.e. spirit cooking and stuff.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve noticed is this: If you come across a rabbit hole and follow it as far as it goes it usually leads you to a money trail. it&#39;ll lead you to a handful of companies that own everything, and you end up with these extremely rich and powerful people that (this is my speculation) PROBABLY have access to some sort of ancient secret knowledge that goes FAR BEYOND the realm that we call our reality. </p>

<p>While doing all my research, i&#39;ve come to the conclusion that something happened to humanity a very long time ago, and we lost our way, so to speak. We became convinced that we were at the center of the universe, that we were the best, and we knew everything about everything. <strong>We became ignorant.</strong> and some of us took advantage of that, and slowly took control of us. </p>

<p>Now get ready for the kicker:</p>

<p><em>Those in power, are no less ignorant than their slaves.</em></p>

<p>They&#39;re greedy, and they&#39;re narcissists, and they&#39;re blind to it because they&#39;re still trying to be the best.</p>

<p>BUT THERE&#39;S NO SUCH THING AS BEING BETTER THAN SOMEONE. We&#39;re all people, we all make mistakes, we all have secrets, but we all are capable of love and goodness. We&#39;re all playing the same game.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all part of the same energy that flows through space and time, and I may sound like an old hippie, but honestly, nothing fucking matters... </p>

<p>You&#39;re going to die one day. I&#39;m going to die. the god damn Sun will eventually engulf the planet, and our remains will return to the stars from where they came, and the universe will continue to function until it probably goes cold and then it starts all over again (probably).  Yeah, we&#39;re being lied to. Yeah, the corporations have all the power. SO WHAT!? The universe doesn&#39;t give a FUCK about any earthly conspiracy whether it&#39;s true or not. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to tell you to stop caring about your life, what i&#39;m trying to say is, just. relax. Take comfort in knowing that everything is bullshit. Wtf are you anxious about? wtf are you worrying about? Why do we stress over the stupidest little thing like pieces of paper with numbers on it, when there&#39;s SOOO MUCH out there that we can&#39;t even understand yet. chill the fuck out, and just be you. Be the best YOU that you can. Learn things, feel things... Go outside and play! HAVE FUN! and at the end of the day, when you&#39;re ready to die, you will take your experience with you, forever. </p>

<p>I apologize, if it sounds like i&#39;m rambling, i&#39;m just having trouble describing that i&#39;m thinking.</p>

<p>I guess what i&#39;m trying to say is... You have a soul. We all do. Every living thing has some kind of energy/consciousness/awareness that manifests in 3-dimensional matter in the Present moment, and in the 4th dimension you can see how it evolves and transforms, and most importantly how it&#39;s all connected: The chair i&#39;m sitting on, my body, all the atoms that have always existed for billions and billions of years. And that energy has also always been there. You have always been there.  However, you may not remember or realize right now because you&#39;re a human being, and this physical &quot;plane&quot; has biological limitations. Your brain contains memories that you have forged throughout your time here, and because we&#39;re limited to our physical bodies; our personal neural networks, our senses... our human experience is so immersive that we become who we think we are... We are so self-centered! We live our lives in first person, and we tend to always put ourselves first. We focus so much on ourselves that we forget how fucking small we are. </p>

<p>I think, therefore I am... and I am special, just like everyone else.</p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling again. </p>

<p>TL;DR
The biggest conspiracy, is the conspiracy against yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I expressed my opinion a little too literally...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean that everything is bullshit in a nihilistic way, I meant that the way things are set up- the financial system, social structures, theatrical politics, materialism; All these things that were fabricated to psychologically enslave us is bullshit.</p>

<p>And the reason for doing all that is an even bigger pile of bullshit, because  all they get in the end is a really shiny gravestone and bad karma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does it though? Do we make decisions or are all of our decision already made and mapped out on a time line? With so many theories, and the amount of personal jabs you’re taking, you clearly don’t understand the full potential of universe and consciousness in theory. It actually sounds like you know so little about the subject, that you can’t comprehend and understand where he’s going with his statements....</p>
