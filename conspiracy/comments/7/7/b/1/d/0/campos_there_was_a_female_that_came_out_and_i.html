       No idea.. you can theorize all day, but in the end we won't know what the hells actually going in Vegas, I just think none of it makes sense. Drilling is substantially quieter than gunfire. Drilling is a continuous sound, gunfire is pops. So I don't think they could be mistaken.

       Your initial comment that started this subthread was: "If you heard automatic gunfire in your suites hallway, would you come out into the hall to see what was up?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pointing out that Campos and Schuck mistook the sound of gunfire for drilling and jackhammering respectively (although according to the latest timeline, what Jesus heard may have been actual drilling). If you (and others) think it's plausible for them to have mistook gunfire for drilling and jackhammering, maybe guests could have mistook it as well, and that's why they'd be popping their heads out.

       I was being sarcastic with my initial comment. I think you could easily tell if there was automatic gunfire coming from out your front door.. and no I don't think a person would go out into the hall to see what was going on, I think they would be taking cover.

       Jack hammering has a unique sound, gunfire has a unique sound, they are quite distinguishable. Not everyone could notice the difference I guess.

       I love that shit. One thought "drilling the other though "jackhammering".
      </p>
      <p>
       Drilling usually sounds nothing like gunfire or a jackhammer (and shouldn't, impacts/vibration mean you are ruining your cutting tool and part, and fucking up your machine) but I suppose it's possible he was thinking drilling through concrete, maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, who the fuck hears something like that at 10pm in the highroller suites and thinks it's the maintenance guys  jackhammering? Wtf. No. Not unless the floor or at least the rooms next to it were empty and even then it's doubtful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's no smoking gun but shit like this is important to note. It just sounds silly, as if they were instructed to not say that they thought there was gunfire. Perhaps MGM trying to avoid a lawsuit?

       I agree. The only time I heard a gun fired was (naturally) living in Baltimore. If I was in a hotel room by myself, I wouldn't know what it was. I'd probably be so pissed at the loud noise I'd walk out into the hall (screaming, "shut the fuck up").

       Your statement makes more sense than them though about creating her to hype up the hero status. I wonder if they'll reunite her with her savior Jesus in up coming shows with tears and all.

       We can refer to her as madam Mandalay. Her identity will never be revealed. Life does not offer too many certainties, but I am sure of this one. 
What's odd is to me is the type of information they offer up. Pressing some things, like using a damn map of the room, and then omitting ginormous things. He would randomly insert crap that didn't matter.

       That whole interview (or the 4 or 5 minutes I watched before shutting it down due to unnecessary anger) was such a god damn sham. The fact that Ellen came out speaking on behalf of Campos that he would do no more interviews after this one is horseshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why are comments disabled on the video on Ellen's YouTube page?

       Oh, well um, I hate to break it to you, but there will be no future appearances or televised reunions. He said that this was the one and only time he'll ever talk about it. Actually,
       <em>
        Ellen
       </em>
       told him that, and he nodded in agreement.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “You’re talking about it now and then you’re not going to talk about it again, and I don’t blame you because why relive this over and over?” Campos nodded.

       Unreal.
