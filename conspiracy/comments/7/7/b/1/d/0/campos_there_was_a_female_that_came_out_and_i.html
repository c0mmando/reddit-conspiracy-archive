    <div class="md"><p>Your initial comment that started this subthread was: &quot;If you heard automatic gunfire in your suites hallway, would you come out into the hall to see what was up?&quot; </p>

<p>I was pointing out that Campos and Schuck mistook the sound of gunfire for drilling and jackhammering respectively (although according to the latest timeline, what Jesus heard may have been actual drilling). If you (and others) think it&#39;s plausible for them to have mistook gunfire for drilling and jackhammering, maybe guests could have mistook it as well, and that&#39;s why they&#39;d be popping their heads out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love that shit. One thought &quot;drilling the other though &quot;jackhammering&quot;. </p>

<p>Drilling usually sounds nothing like gunfire or a jackhammer (and shouldn&#39;t, impacts/vibration mean you are ruining your cutting tool and part, and fucking up your machine) but I suppose it&#39;s possible he was thinking drilling through concrete, maybe.</p>

<p>Still, who the fuck hears something like that at 10pm in the highroller suites and thinks it&#39;s the maintenance guys  jackhammering? Wtf. No. Not unless the floor or at least the rooms next to it were empty and even then it&#39;s doubtful.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s no smoking gun but shit like this is important to note. It just sounds silly, as if they were instructed to not say that they thought there was gunfire. Perhaps MGM trying to avoid a lawsuit?</p>

What&#39;s odd is to me is the type of information they offer up. Pressing some things, like using a damn map of the room, and then omitting ginormous things. He would randomly insert crap that didn&#39;t matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That whole interview (or the 4 or 5 minutes I watched before shutting it down due to unnecessary anger) was such a god damn sham. The fact that Ellen came out speaking on behalf of Campos that he would do no more interviews after this one is horseshit. </p>

<p>Also, why are comments disabled on the video on Ellen&#39;s YouTube page?</p>
