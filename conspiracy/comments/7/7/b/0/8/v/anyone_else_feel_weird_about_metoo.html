        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What could be an oppertunity to attack hollywood for the culture of the casting couch is kinda being masked by all of the #metoo posts about women being sexually harassed. I dont mean to make light of any sexual harassment, but it has always and will always happen, because there are evil people; however, for most professions, it isnt a prerequisite to entry, the way it is in hollywood. Children are being passed around by these assholes, and as soon as the spotlight is pointed at them, there is a flood of women saying that they were sexually harassed too. It doesnt sit right with me and seems like the people who are known to support the left financially and culturally are being protected by a movement that will never amount to anything. This isnt to say that there might not be some good in the community as a whole opening up and being supportive of eachother, but it really seems like a smoke screen to what could be a massive scandal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i think there have been a few who said that they had similar unwanted attention. The biggest problem is that these huge actors and actresses arent naming the people theyve been abused by, which leads me to think the roots of the whole thing are much farther reaching than one would think, and these blockbuster actor/actresses are either paid hush-money or are worried about not being in anything ever again </p>

<p>There’s no way young male actors arent ran through the same thing, but it’s enough to make me suspicious. They’d have nothing but our sympathy yet it doesn’t fit the narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My nephew posted #MeToo. I already knew what happened. I knew about it and was glad he posted. Then a feminist friend of mine complained in her own post about how men speaking up &quot;diluted&quot; the message about this being about women and the shit men have done to them. I felt that was fucked up for her to say, but I assume a lot of feminists feel that way. My opinion is why can&#39;t we address men and women who have been assaulted?

    <div class="md"><p>Men are less likely to come forward when it comes to being sexually assaulted period. I applaud the few men who have come forward, but the number of Hollywood actors that have been propositioned and harassed or abused we will never know. </p>

<p>Because boys who get raped by older women are told they&#39;re lucky and should be grateful for the experience. Because society views men as sex crazed animals that must always want sex, all the time with everyone. Men are taught to be strong and tough, they can&#39;t come forward and admit because they&#39;re afraid to admit what&#39;s happened to them. They&#39;re afraid it makes them seem like less of a man; a woman rapes you and you&#39;re weak, a man rapes you and you&#39;re gay. If women who are taught to express their emotions have difficulty coming forward it&#39;s difficult for men in different ways.</p>

<p>Not to mention fear of retaliation, just like the actresses faced. A loss of respect for them. It could hurt their career (I.e. People not taking him seriously as a superhero or action star).</p>

<p>Men in Hollywood are not coming forward for different, non-conspiracy reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is to shed light on how often it happens and how many of us it affects every single day.  There are a lot of women who may not encounter the harassment and assault, or the vehement denial that these things happen when they&#39;re brought up, but for the vast majority of women, we DO deal with it every day.  </p>

<p>I work in a social place with a lot of millennial men. Almost every single day I hear my male co-workers deny the existence of sexual harassment as it&#39;s explained to them. I&#39;ve heard them tell each other and the women they&#39;re condescending to that we over react because we&#39;re women and it doesn&#39;t happen as much as we say/think it does.  I see more than a few of them touch their female coworkers while she&#39;s got a wildly uncomfortable look on her face, frantically searching for a reason to step away. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that it happens so much MORE than we say. Just because you don&#39;t see it happen, doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>I urge you to take some time and look into the initial meaning of the campaign.  We shouldn&#39;t need to fight so hard for this to be acknowledged as a problem.  Even now I see posts by guys claiming women are faking stories to be trendy.</p>

<p>Women don&#39;t brag about being raped or harassed, it&#39;s not a thing we&#39;re proud of. It&#39;s a thing we&#39;re so ashamed of that we literally don&#39;t tell anyone about because the social norm is to assume we must have done something to deserve it. AND THATS BULLSHIT. </p>

<p>Sorry you &quot;feel weird about it&quot; but it&#39;s not going to stop just because you say &quot;it has always and will always happen.&quot; That resignation and passive demand that we just accept it is GARBAGE. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t deserve to live in fear when I walk home or go out with friends because the frat bro in his MAGA hat feels entitled to my body.</p>

<p>Even now, all of these comments are so fucking defensive about how DARE we blanket statement this social problem because it&#39;s offensive to you personally because You personally never assaulted anyone.   </p>

<p>THIS CAMPAIGN WAS NEVER ABOUT YOU. NOT EVEN AT ALL FOR ONE SECOND. If you feel personally victimized by women sharing stories about things that happened to them, you&#39;re probably a lot less innocent than you&#39;d like to believe. </p>

<p>People on the internet made comments about your gender because of a recognized epidemic of sexual abuse? How terrible that must be for you.   You feel weird about it? SO DO WE. </p>

<p>I thought about writing a disclaimer to my response, about how there&#39;s exceptions to every rule, but i stand by it and if you&#39;re so willfully ignorant that you&#39;d need to deconstruct what I&#39;m saying by pointing out the obvious, then you don&#39;t have much of an argument (or an original perspective) to begin with. You can stop feeling weird when I start feeling safe.  SORRY NOT SORRY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not disagreeing with you: it&#39;s a huge fucking problem, but do you understand what im saying when im saying that we&#39;re going from what could be an oppertunity to clean up an insanely toxic part of our society (that passes children around as sexual toys for millionares) by taking the focus away from it? I would never deny that sexual assault happens at an alarmingly frequent rate in the workplace, but instead of posting about how it happens to everyone, we should be lighting torches and sharpening pitchforks to bring down the casting couch. You want to talk about a rape culture but not do anything about the culture that has been turning men, women, and children into sexual assault victims since its inception? This is a case where i think more focus would expose a lot more about what is happening, but these huge political donators are barely getting a slap on the wrist for one of the worst crimes imaginable. That&#39;s what puts a pit in my stomach: not that women are coming forward and sharing their accounts, because it&#39;s not invalid, but because we were close to exposing very perverse corruption when all of a sudden a social media campaign shifted the spotlight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of agree with you that it could be used as a smoke screen. It seems that everyone in my FB has been metoo&#39;ed. But it could backfire. First we would need to define quite strictly what sexual harassment is.  Rape is rape. But if pat you on the shoulder and you are not feeling well that day, you could confuse my simple action as sexual harassment. So you would also be metoo&#39;ing allover your FB. Which would overshadow the true sexual harassment cases that do exist. Then. They started the metoo&#39;ed campaign to show the general population how big the problem is. But. If the general population actually learns that the rest 99% of the population has been metoo&#39;ed, it could backfire making everyone think that it actually is a part of every day life. Of every day learning of how to cope with living in this complex game we have designed for ourselves. It could backfire into people thinking that it is so normal, that the amount of true sexual harassment cases might actually grow. Not because people are opening about it, but because people will start to think that it is a necessary step in the path of learning how to live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it is already a necessary step in the path of becoming an actor or actress. That&#39;s what i think this is distracting from. Sexual harassment is a big problem and i dont doubt any of the metoos i see, but saying &quot;yeah it happened to me&quot; isnt going to make any progress towards fixing it, the way that focusing on the toxic foundations of the Hollywood industry could. I want to see more people digging into these rich executives who &quot;discovered&quot; (aka raped) the young girls starring on Disney or MTV. I want to see actresses come forward and say &quot;i was promised my huge role in X movie if i blew Y&quot; i want to see the whole thing topple and all of these rapists locked up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I noticed that too and felt werid too that those posts were happening around the same time that news came out. I find it annoying all the metoo posts flooding social media like all of a sudden it has become a fad to say you have been harassed when before barely anyone tells anyone their story. I have been harassed but you dont see me putting a metoo post up on my fb. I feel that my story is for me only if I want to tell somebody I will I just dont want the whole world knowing and Im sure almost everyone has been harassed at some point in their lives. I just dont see what the big deal is about the metoo thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s deliberate. People love to identify themselves as a victim. People also love to feel like a brave hero.

    <div class="md"><p>Well i think there have been a few who said that they had similar unwanted attention. The biggest problem is that these huge actors and actresses arent naming the people theyve been abused by, which leads me to think the roots of the whole thing are much farther reaching than one would think, and these blockbuster actor/actresses are either paid hush-money or are worried about not being in anything ever again </p>

<p>There’s no way young male actors arent ran through the same thing, but it’s enough to make me suspicious. They’d have nothing but our sympathy yet it doesn’t fit the narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My nephew posted #MeToo. I already knew what happened. I knew about it and was glad he posted. Then a feminist friend of mine complained in her own post about how men speaking up &quot;diluted&quot; the message about this being about women and the shit men have done to them. I felt that was fucked up for her to say, but I assume a lot of feminists feel that way. My opinion is why can&#39;t we address men and women who have been assaulted?

    <div class="md"><p>Men are less likely to come forward when it comes to being sexually assaulted period. I applaud the few men who have come forward, but the number of Hollywood actors that have been propositioned and harassed or abused we will never know. </p>

<p>Because boys who get raped by older women are told they&#39;re lucky and should be grateful for the experience. Because society views men as sex crazed animals that must always want sex, all the time with everyone. Men are taught to be strong and tough, they can&#39;t come forward and admit because they&#39;re afraid to admit what&#39;s happened to them. They&#39;re afraid it makes them seem like less of a man; a woman rapes you and you&#39;re weak, a man rapes you and you&#39;re gay. If women who are taught to express their emotions have difficulty coming forward it&#39;s difficult for men in different ways.</p>

<p>Not to mention fear of retaliation, just like the actresses faced. A loss of respect for them. It could hurt their career (I.e. People not taking him seriously as a superhero or action star).</p>

<p>Men in Hollywood are not coming forward for different, non-conspiracy reasons. </p>
