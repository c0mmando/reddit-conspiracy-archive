       This post is a response to the unsurprising news that
       <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/18/chipotle-downgraded-employee-pay.html">
        Bank of America has downgraded Chipotle due to their wages being too high
       </a>
       .  This will be much shorter than it should be, so I'd urge others to fill in any blanks here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Chipotle's commitment to fresh ingredients and the ethical treatment of animals has helped it achieve massive success over the past two decades. But the chain has hit bumps along the way.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The concept of an Anti-Chipotle Conspiracy has been smeared for years by well known PR pushers associated with Big-Ag.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/3ynh2r/monsanto_found_guilty_in_french_farmer_poisoning/cyf6iy3/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/3ynh2r/monsanto_found_guilty_in_french_farmer_poisoning/cyf6iy3/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Chipotle has been in the targets of big-ag, big-food and big-farmer largely since McDonalds fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        millions of diners, fuelled by concerns about their health and the state of the environment—and propelled by a general distaste for industrially produced and highly processed food—have begun to shun the ubiquitous chains that have long shaped the American culinary character.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The rise of the healthy fast-food chain has been aided by the easing recession, but it comes largely at the expense of traditional competitors. None have struggled more than McDonald’s, one of the world’s most recognizable brands.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The ad, which directs people to the website ChubbyChipotle.com, was printed as a full page in the New York Post on Thursday.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Chubby Chipotle site goes beyond the deceptive marketing claims and takes aim at Chipotle's commitment to antibiotic-free meat, saying it's unhealthy for animals because these medicines are used to treat sick animals.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       slamming chipotle for anti-biotic free meat... that certainly sounds like it would come from a certain lobby that relies on factory farming to keep prices low.  very similar talking points to our "pro-scienceFACTS" friends who show up in every reddit thread with GMO in the title.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ad was paid for by Rick Berman's "Center for Consumer Freedom".

       It was at the time of this hit piece campaign (in September 2015), that Chipotle was at its peak valuation, with stock at ~$700-$750/ share from July-October 2015.

       Soon after the ad campaign launched- you'll notice a huge drop in stock valuation during the latter half of October 2015...  What happened?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 3, 2015-- On the heels of an E. coli incident that was linked to eight of its restaurants in Oregon and Washington state, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has taken a number of immediate steps to assist investigators as they conduct their review of the incident in Oregon and Washington. Among the specific actions the company has taken since the incident began are:
       </p>
       <p>
        Immediately closing 43 restaurants in Oregon and Washington state out of an abundance of caution, even though only eight restaurants have drawn concern, while investigators search for a cause...

       <p>
        There was a lot of money on the table for Chipotle short sellers—as much as $459 million, according to Allen's calculations—before there were any inklings of a food safety problem. "Chipotle short-sellers saw their ambitions rewarded with $55 million in less than one day," he wrote of the latest scare.

       Now check out this little tidbit that I'll end with, regarding the most recent suspicious outbreak in July 2017:
      </p>
      <p>
       According to our beloved Washington Post, and this CNBC HEADLINE:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Chipotle's recent norovirus outbreak was the result of lax sick-policy enforcement
       </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       what did they base that analysis on when the CDC and FDA haven't reached a conclusion?  Ready for this?  let's bring it full circle.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A self-identified Chipotle employee alleged in a Reddit post last month that a manager required them to work while sick.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       hmmm...  An anonymous Redditor in an ocean of identified PR spewers already promoting anti-Chipotle corporate talking points....

       Correct. The outbreaks were industrial sabotage. Very effective too. That attack will be repeated against other co's. I think Blue Bell was also sabotaged.

       we had a local ice cream store have a bunch of issues with listeria as well, had a few outbreaks. from the comments and threads on that, I gathered it was slightly tricky to get rid of once an outbreak occurs. Theyve had to shut their factory down at least twice in the local company im talking about.

       As a Canadian, when I hear "Jack in the Box" I think gross, contaminated food. Never been there. I don't even know any exist in Canada. I wasn't even that old in '93. But when I hear "Jack in the Box" it induces disgust. All because I either watched the news or someone simply told me they were gross. So yeah, health scares, like E. coli outbreaks (manufactured or not) can have a long-lasting effect.

       I lived in the city where those outbreaks happened. I paid attention to the news at the time. Basically the whole company shut down and reformed from the ground up. The restaurants that were responsible were gross and outdated.  If you go to a Jack in the Box today, it's spotless, modern, and has pretty good food. If you look back in the kitchen, it looks like a hospital operating room. You never saw the floor so clean in any restaurant kitchen you've ever seen.

       TLDR:
      </p>
      <p>
       In September 2015, Chipotle was trading at ~$750/ share, when an anonymously financed smear campaign targeted it.  The next month, they started closing stores due to their first NoroVirus outbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, they're trading at half the valuation as two years ago, and it looks like they'll continue to slide.  Banks blame unsustainable employment and agricultural standards- but the issue is clearly due to mysterious food poisoning scares played up by short-traders for massive profits.

       My guess is that the demand for healthy fast food options has inflated their stock price. It's the same reason tech companies have a high P/E ratio-- people are betting that the company's earnings will rise dramatically over time. It's not
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       unusual. Still too high for me, personally.

       After observing recent events involving Chipotle and e.coli, here's my analysis of the situation: Chipotle's e.coli outbreaks are not random chance.
       <strong>
        They are the result of the biotech industry unleashing bioterrorism attacks against the only fast food company that has publicly denounced GMOs.

       This was also a plotline in Billions last season, where they purposely created an outbreak at a juice chain to devalue its stock.  I made the connection right away to Chipotle.

       I always assumed it was just a group motivated to make a dick load of money shorting the stock. There is a lot of questionable stuff related to the people getting sick over the last few years. I'm no microbiologist but I've read that the number of people who got sick was way higher than any natural, accidental,health code violations. Neurovirus was more than likely intentionally placed at restaurants to get a ton of people sick and gain press about it to drive the stock price down. The info you've posted makes a lot of sense.

       I have worked in food and beverage for over 10 years now.

       Employers will lessen hours or fire you if you call out sick at the wrong time(for them/the company ).
      </p>
      <p>
       More over corporate restaurants, cafes, cafeterias etc will require sick notes and even routinely break laws or go against laws until called out upon such practices, also creating a target on said employees back for pointing out said discrepancies between company policies and practices and state or federal laws.

       I am not a shill, despite this being my first post I have been reading here for a long time and had to make a new account.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also am surprised there's not more outbreaks and people getting sick from food from what I have seen over the years at many different establishments. With so much food and oil, prep and serving, little bits of food and grease get thrown everywhere, along with moisture in the air from boiling water and other work related processes there is an abundance of chemicals and the right atmosphere for biologics to grow at any time but especially if great care is not taken to keep up and keep sanitized .
      </p>

       Also I like chipotle although only ate it maybe three times lifetime.

Short Answer: No, Chipotle is not owned by McDonald's. Long Answer: Chipotle became a susidiary of McDonald's in 1999 when McDonald's acquired the controlling stake of the company. At one point, McDonald's owned shares accounting for approximately 87% of the voting power of Chipotle's common stock.

       On the topic of tattoos, what percentage of white people in your area make it to age 30 without tattoos these days? In my neck of the woods we would be lucky if half of people are still clean-skins by age 30.

       Yes ; I actually used to work at chipotle and we talked about how the ecoli was supposedly never found where it truly came from, they just assumed it was on the tomatoes or something. The cases were also in a small area too. But a lot of my managers thought it was something to do with their stocks since after that they never truly recovered and one of the CEOs just recently quit.

       No, because their cost of labor as a percentage of sales was too high. This is usually caused by inefficient scheduling. Every Chipotle I've ever been to had this issue so I'm assuming that's actually a valid criticism. The rest of the post is sound though.

       Excellent post, OP. I love me some Chipotle. Where else can you get a quick, non-GMO fast food vegan meal for cheap that actually tastes good? Nowhere. Fuck McDonalds and all these other companies that refuse to bring consumers what they actually want, rather than what is cheap and convenient for them to deliver.

       I have to say, this is the grade, or close to.. the grade of conspiracy stuff we should see more of posted here. Most of it is tenuous at absolute best, poorly researched- if at all. This, however, is well laid out, good citations, and most/all seems to check out! Good work OP. I think you make a great case, and I think it likely is, or is very close to the truth.

       You know, i was watching monday night football pregame and Matt Hasselback referenced Chipotle in an almost weird way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hostess asked him which team he thought would win and he kept driving the point home that one team, i think the bears?, ate Chipotle the night before. It was really weird off the bat.

       I might be in the minority - but I don't find Chipolte's food to be appetizing nor appealing.  The 'holier than thou' attitude of the customers is a real turn off to most people.  Chipolte fans like to shove in others faces that they eat 'ethical' and therefore better than everyone else, a culture of self-righteousness that is a huge turn off.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the food, each time I've tried eating there, I've never finished my meal as the taste wasn't good and I always felt sick afterwards, and this was WAY before the e coli scare.

       I'm lucky there are (weirdly) actual hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants all over the place in Maryland, for some reason.  My partner is a CA transplant, and was overjoyed at the tiny Mexican food spot we found in the shittiest strip mall ever.  So we're lucky there.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I'll eat the fuck out of a Chipotle steak burrito knowing full well it's nowhere near actual Mexican food.

       I'm having a hard time deciding if people are really just shitty and greedy enough to push our entire society into a downward spiral of shitty health, or its a conspiracy to dumb us down on purpose by degrading our mental state from a young age with processed food. Or....maybe it's both!!

       This post by
       <a href="/u/know_comment">
        /u/know_comment
       </a>
       is too thoughtful and well-done for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       or Reddit in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not sarcasm.  Reddit is designed to flush a writer's work down the memory hole within 2 days or 700 posts, the length of visible threads on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       One year ago, the number of visible threads was 1000, or about 3 days.  Why was this time-window narrowed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Other conspiracy forums, such as Deep Politics Forum or Rigorous Intuition, display "Threads-By-Topic" that last for years and collect new posts on the same topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, Reddit is designed to be a "time sink" and "energy sink" that wastes community effort and energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest that serious writers such as
       <a href="/u/know_comment">
        /u/know_comment
       </a>
       at least cross-post their work to other websites.  If a "Redditor" misses 2 days of an
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       cycle, or doesn't wade through all 700 posts, good work like this is easily missed.

       This feels more like an advertisement for Chipotle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real people don't go to or avoid fast food places like Chipotle because of "fresh ingredients and the ethical treatment of animals," whether the animals had antibiotics, or whether some store out there had E Coli or something. Only advertisers and an extremely small demographic of people care about that stuff (or use those words).

       Wow! I've always always told my friends that I thought it was a McDonald's/fastfood led sabotage against Chipotle but had no idea where I could connect anything to ecoli. I heard other reports they'd taken various hits and it just seemed suspicious as they are so incredibly successful. Nice post man, this validates at least some of my paranoid thoughts

       Great post. Interesting to see how simple it seems. Really unfortunate as I admire their food standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously in the minority here as reddit loves this place, but it's expensive an nowhere near as good as most legit Mexican places. Never understood the appeal to anyone in California especially. Just a little basic spanish and I'm swimming in cabeza burritos for $5.50 the length of my forearm at my local spot, and it's not rare. Guess it's just paying extra for comfort because it's certainly not tastier.

       I live up north, but been all over the state many times and there's incredible Mexican food everywhere. Even way up north in the more devoted coastal towns have surprised me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Been to every state west of the Mississippi tons of times and the same is true. Most areas I've been to in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, etc have awesome Mexican as well. But it's rarely in a mall, or next to a bunch of shops etc so people don't bother or are just scared. Chipotle is more convenient, so people settle. I've had it before a few times, it's more expensive and nothing compared to even barely decent legit spots. But it's the same old battle: people love domino's but obviously the 50 year old mom and pop place in town is probably better. People love burger King but obviously the new grass-fed, crazy styled spot is better. People like Chipotle.....etc etc etc. It's convenience really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why experience an authentic Mexican taqueria or carniceria when you can walk from Starbucks to the Chipotle next door in comfort?

       Did anyone actually read the article? Chipotle workers don't actually make that much money, its just that their labor costs are too high and their revenue is decreasing. Idk about all the stuff with industrial sabotage, that actually sounds pretty interesting, but when OP starts the post with saying Chipotle's "wages are too high", it kind of leads me to question whether he's just looking for things that confirm his ideas. Chipotle workers aren't making that much more than minimum wage

       Chipotle workers earn ~&lt;12% v McDonald's workers.

       Yes, I understand that the BOA downgrading was due to high employment costs as a percentage of revenue- and yes I could have represented that better in my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast casual is still competing with fast-food in the same wage market.   You're right that it's not vastly superior in that regards- my point is that they're being TARGETED with talking points that make people question whether higher wages are a sustainable model.

       So what we're suggesting here is that Monsanto and the GMO food lobby, the chain of companies that rely on Monsanto's cheap food, that is, have all colluded to destroy Chipotle (primarily) with bioterrorism? Very interesting! Someone should make a website specifically for people researching on the internet to collaborate investigations. Not like a google cloud server, something more similar to a web forum like reddit. That'd be great for this community.

       Our immune systems are strong and I always use sanitary techniques don't get me wrong, but in my opinion people have eat off open fire pits and as hunter gatherers, without latex gloves ( can you imagine )  and without any sanitary knowledge for the entirety of humanity until about the last 150 years or so. While I do think sanitation is important and left unchecked or cleaned there will inevitably be problems , like people getting sick and not knowing the causes, I've seen a lot to make me believe usually , what people don't know , doesn't hurt them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a cook and therefor not a scientist, and I will say peoples life spans have gone up by a large percentage during the "pre-sanitary" age of the last 100 years , just not ready to completely attribute it to more sanitary kitchens and more likely a number of other causes .

       I'd argue advances in sanitation (particularly around water infrastructure), and "germ theory" brought about towards the end of industrialization constitute THE most important contributor to the healthcare revolution of the 20th century.

       Chipotle currently #2 on google news. Stock plummets due to "hacking" and "storms".  The company isn't that big. Why would it merit a placement so high in the news if it wasn't a narrative being pushed? Any negative news against a non big-ag company is good news.

       Sears broke a century-long deal and is no longer selling Whirlpool appliances. THIS is a big story and will likely spell the end of Sears.  But Chipotle is higher in the news cycle?  Something's fucky.

       this is the type of contextual critical thinking that I appreciate.  But most people just don't have the context, so they assume that your context is misguided.  But if you have context, it's easy to see that there's fuckery here.

       interestingly- this NYT story (which I'm pretty sure is a Native Ad)is showing up right next to the Chipotle story on Google:

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Promotions including $1 beverages and the “McPick 2” value menu helped lift comparable store sales — or sales at stores open at least 13 months — 6 percent globally in the most recent quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such promotions reflect a revamped effort at McDonald’s to focus more on value-conscious fare — including a plan to introduce a $1, $2 and $3 value menu next year — executives confirmed during a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The value menu at mcdonalds has always been a loss-leader.  It brings in CUSTOMERS, not profit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://business.time.com/2014/01/14/fast-food-chains-are-desperate-to-kill-the-dollar-menu/">

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Fast food franchises have long had a love-hate relationship with dollar menus and other cheapie promotions. Naturally, owners love any deals that drive traffic into their restaurants. Yet as far back as 2007 (per MarketWatch), restaurant owners griped about being forced to sell “loss leaders” such as the McDonald's Double Cheeseburger for just $1. Among other things, the presence of robust dollar menu selections is seen as a prime reason that fast food sales of combo meals have slowed, as have sales of other items that are far more profitable than stuff selling for merely a buck.
