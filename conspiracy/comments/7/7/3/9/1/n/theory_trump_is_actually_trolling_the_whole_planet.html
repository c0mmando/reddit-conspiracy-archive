        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-18 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/MightyJigsaw.html">MightyJigsaw</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have done a lot of research to see if anyone else has raised the theory that Trump is actually a real life troll and couldn&#39;t find anything. People are so focused on your typical political issues and politicians being crooks, that no one actually stopped and asked themselves if Trump is for real. What exactly do I mean by that? </p>

<p><strong>My Theory</strong>
I believe that Trump became the President of the United States not because he wanted power, but because he was bored. Trump&#39;s situation is like when you finish an open world game and have nothing to do anymore and you start just messing around. Trump finished all the main quests of life. He&#39;s filthy rich, has a family, what more can he find to do? Well I think he has a pretty good sense of humor. I think he was so bored that he decided he wanted to troll all of the planet. </p>

<p>There are many reasons that could have motivated him to run for president. Maybe he made a bet with his friends, maybe he was bored as I stated, who knows. But I think it is interesting to analyse the Trump situation and try to think outside the box. If you look at Trump&#39;s past, he has always been a rational person. I don&#39;t recall any controversies involving Trump in the past. Yes, there have been issues with taxes, but nothing out of the ordinary. Also, you can&#39;t build a giant empire and become a billionaire if you are an idiot, as many claim Trump is. I think it is safe to conclude that before running for president, Trump was a normal billionaire. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want this thread to turn into a political debate. Trump&#39;s policies don&#39;t matter one bit in my theory. I think we all know that both democrats and republicans can come up with stupid policies. So there is no point arguing over Trump&#39;s policies. </p>

<p>I think we should rather look at his behavior. Firstly, the way he got elected was out of the ordinary. He used a bold strategy, to get people to talk about him as much as possible. He wasn&#39;t afraid to start controversies just to get people to talk about him. Before even running for president, he criticized Obama a lot on twitter, even over absurd things like his birth certificate. He was planning this election a long time before even running. Also, his wife copied word for word a speech by Michelle Obama. You&#39;d have to be pretty dumb to think no one would notice. How come his advisers didn&#39;t stop them from making that speech as it was clearly going to end in a controversy? Because they knew it was going to get Trump even more talked about. There are so many more instances of Trump doing things that would obviously end in a PR disaster during his campaign that he still did. </p>

<p>There are two reasons why he could have done this. The first one is that he didn&#39;t think he would actually get this far in the campaign and wanted to find a way out. Instead of just dropping out, he tried finding ways to get people to hate him, which didn&#39;t work. Or, maybe he was just trolling everyone again. With no goal of being the president, he just wanted to be in a position where he could literally troll everyone and do so every step towards being the president. </p>

<p>Now that he is the president, it looks like he is purposely doing dumb things. I mean, I&#39;m pretty sure he called North Korea and told him to play along when he pretends to want to start a war. I bet he was laughing the whole time when he was trying to find the new comebacks to Kim. I could find so many more examples of Trump being goofy, like when he threw boxes of towels in Puerto Rico, but there are just too many.</p>

<p>In short, Trump just wants to troll us. He is trying to find new ways every day to do the dumbest things and laughs about it with whoever is in on it. I strongly believe this is what Trump is doing and this is why I learned to love him. At first, I hated him and saw him as most people did. But mid-way through his campaign, it all started to make sense. This guy is the biggest troll that we know. I won&#39;t be surprised that after his term is over, or if he is impeached, that he will come out and say that we all got trolled. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s acting too goofy to seem to be serious. While I do agree that the US political situation was pretty shitty, I don&#39;t think Trump cares enough to be put in a position where he is dedicated to his country for 4 years. Just look at all his insults and comeback, they look like a comedian made them. This guy is trying very hard to be funny and everyone fell for either being a Trump supporter or hater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, nobody here wants to hear my politics. I don&#39;t blame them. Pretty much the internet as a whole is where you either really want to be or don&#39;t want to be. I suggest do a little trolling of your own, then when younger called on it be like &quot;just like Trump!&quot; And leave it at that. Or start your own sub and spread the news on mayonnaise nation wide. I&#39;d probably hang around in there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think we could both start this sub. Or maybe not. I think we should keep Trump&#39;s intention hidden so he can keep trolling. If everyone sees what he&#39;s actually doing, he won&#39;t be able to troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Donald Trump is my favorite fanfic character, he&#39;s a Billionaire  President with a hot wife and a nice family, who has also appeared in movies, has had his own show, has built multiple businesses and is orange. Also he literally has a kooky scientist uncle who has dibs on Tesla&#39;s stuff for bonus points. I just wish the person who created him knew how to make a more realistic and relatable character...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, nobody here wants to hear my politics. I don&#39;t blame them. Pretty much the internet as a whole is where you either really want to be or don&#39;t want to be. I suggest do a little trolling of your own, then when younger called on it be like &quot;just like Trump!&quot; And leave it at that. Or start your own sub and spread the news on mayonnaise nation wide. I&#39;d probably hang around in there. </p>

<p>You have my support. u/MightyJigsaw 2020.</p>
