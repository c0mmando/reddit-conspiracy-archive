    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but still seems ridiculous that there are posts about Harvey Weinstein flooding this sub.</p>

<p>Las Vegas is all over the news...until Harvey Weinstein scandal comes along and frowns out the Vegas talk...seems eerily similar to what is going on here.</p>

<p>Absolutely not. Weinstein is clearly an isolated incident, and he’s just misunderstood. He’s a family man and has changed his ways. It’s also absurd to think Hollywood is rampant with pervs and pedos, so don’t waste your time digging deeper. Occam’s razor says only fake accounts would be interested in something like this. #HollywoodStandsForHumanRights (Am I hired?)</p>

<p>I agree 100%. In my experience, a sizable proportion of people interested in &#39;conspiracy&#39; topics are fascinated by stories regarding pedophilia. They love reading about and discussing this stuff.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t ask me why. Just pay attention and you will see the patterns yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take no enjoyment in knowing how fucked up the world really is, friend. </p>

<p>It has to do with opening peoples eyes and making them realize that the people in “control” are sick and twisted fucks whose end game is to enslave mankind for their own gains without mankind even realizing it.</p>

<p>That’s why we care. We care because the Weinstein story has the ability to red pill a lot of otherwise clueless people at the same time. </p>

<p>We care because we are sick and fucking tired of children being trafficked, raped, and murdered. </p>

<p>The only enjoyment I will derive from all of this is watching these people burn. Quite literally. Does anyone really believe the hive mind won’t click into a mass movement of hatred and violence when our basest instinct to protect children is triggered on a large scale basis? </p>

<p>When 300 million people realize that Hollywood, their Government, and many others are in the game of trafficking and pedophelia, shit will not stay copasetic. Mark my words. </p>

<p>There is <strong>no</strong> mercy or forgiveness for taking the innocence or freedom of a child. None. The shit has to stop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re totally right. We should just keep quiet about it. </p>

<p>You know what’s cool? When a bunch of people gather a shitload of evidence, and then a bunch of other people begin archiving that evidence, and then it snowballs, until one day you have enough to begin dropping red pills on friends and colleagues. </p>

<p>And when they ask for proof, or evidence, or connections, or reading material, you have it to share. </p>

<p>1 person turns into 10, turns into 100. I’ve personally red pilled multiple friends because of things brought up on this sub, because of discussions had on this sub. Because, I mean, to actually figure things out <em>it usually helps to have discussions</em>. </p>

<p>So, by your rationale, speaking of these things on a sub with 500k subscribers, on a website known as “the front page of the entire fucking internet” won’t do any good in helping to wake people up? </p>

<p>That notion is so ludicrous it is laughable. </p>

<p>That is what we call a strawman argument. Also a false dichotomy.</p>

<p>In other words, logical fallacies.</p>

<p>Usually people resort to logical fallacies when they are defensive.</p>

<p>It happens whenever I tell a normie that the Osama bin Laden in a cave story is comical and absurd.</p>

<p>&#39;Of course, Bush flew the planes himself&#39;, they reply. </p>

<p>fascinated by stories regarding pedophilia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually I am.</p>

<p>We all knew it was happening and has been happening.</p>

<p>And by &quot;we&quot; I mean the whole public.  Like it wasn&#39;t much of a conspiracy.  You figure shit went down a lot of time.  Rape, pedo shit, sexual harassment.</p>

<p>So this story is fascinating to look at.</p>

<p>It literally shows you how people react.  Oh, yea figured that happened.  Then it&#39;ll be forgotten.</p>

<p>So as someone who enjoys reading conspiracies time to time it should be fascinating.  How is it going to be glossed over?  No one truly believes that is the only piece of shit in Hollywood.  </p>

<p>We know there is more.</p>

<p>This is the time to watch actually and talk about it.  Keep it in the air long as you can.  I mean I&#39;d prefer the pedos get caught, the rapists, etc.</p>

<p>Your statement seems weird though.  What do you mean by enjoyment?  I don&#39;t enjoy reading it.  This is a conspiracy sub, I enjoy the idea that possibly some more will come out and fight this.</p>

<p>Yes, I enjoy stories catching pedophiles.  Sorry you don&#39;t.  I like scum being caught.  =)</p>

<p>Maybe one day a huge ring in Hollywood will get caught.  That would be great and fun.  But if you don&#39;t find that enjoyable, that&#39;s on you.  Enjoy that only 1 out of how many has been shit on.  Sure let them be pedos, enjoy that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve called them out quite a bit. It gets tiring. It&#39;s probably the same five people, since they post like 12 pedo-wood articles per hour. Yeah we get it, the hollyvoid cabal is loaded with baby fuckers. Now we have to hear about it in r/c every third post.</p>

<p>Mods honestly need to step up. Most other subs/mods are fucking hawks about their sub. Not the case here. They need to parse out the pedo/sex pervert shit into a different column, vertically. And/or tag the shit with color codes. The fucking meaningless noise is too much.</p>

<p>So to recap my aimless rant, it would be nice that, instead of having one stream of posts going down vertically that get washed out with bullshit within minutes, you&#39;d have <em>three</em> columns maybe. One would be politics related, one would be pedo-bear/pizza shit, and the third would be non-pedo, non-left/right political shit, just straight conspiracy. I&#39;ll grab my coat.</p>

<p>Hodge is the guy that was on all the media outlets saying that he was staying in 32-134 right next to Paddock, he later went silent. He also works as a special even organizer for a marketing company, and has connections to Jupiter Hotel &amp; Casinos in Gold Coast Australia, where Marilou&#39;s family is from.</p>

<p>Yes, that fiction has been peddled by all of the liberal fake news outlets. Of course, it isn&#39;t true because Harth dismissed her bullshit suit that was actually an attempt to force Trump to settle a seperate,  business related suit with her partner. </p>

<p><a href="https://lawnewz.com/high-profile/exclusive-inside-the-donald-trump-sexual-assault-lawsuit/">At the time, Trump vigorously denied the charges saying the suit “was a desperate attempt to get me to settle a case they can’t win.” <strong>But then, not even a month after filing the case, Harth withdrew it.</strong> The court record indicates it was “voluntarily dismissed” but “without prejudice,” meaning she could have re-filed the case. The timing is interesting because at around the same time the case was withdrawn, Trump reportedly agreed to settle with her husband’s company, The American Dream Enterprise, according to an obscure 1997 gossip article in the New York Daily News which appears to be the only mainstream media coverage of either suit.</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna get into the Clinton stuff, but no one knows what may or may not have happened there. But it is very different because there was an actual legal case made of Trump&#39;s. The gag order prevents her from saying Trump raped her. This is what happens when you settle but don&#39;t want a public deal made of something. In other words, he probably raped her, and even if you don&#39;t call it &quot;rape&quot;, his actions in her account of what happened are egregious. </p>

<p>Half of this &quot;propaganda&quot; is actually true. But it&#39;s easier for Trump to call anything negative about him fake news. Some of those accusations in that page come from before he was ever even a viable candidate. </p>

<p>I hate this argument so much. This sub isn&#39;t <a href="/r/anti">/r/anti</a>-MSM or <a href="/r/alternateMedia">/r/alternateMedia</a>, it&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. We can all agree that the news media lies, skews facts, and is biased. But that doesn&#39;t mean we stop talking about something once they start, or that we have to automatically take a stance opposite of them every time. That&#39;s just another way of letting them control you. If it&#39;s a conspiracy, it still has a place here. Even if the MSM is talking about it too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s t_d thinking they speak for this sub. They&#39;ve done everything in their power to proclaim &quot;fake news&quot;, and use it primarily to defend Trump, or attack anything that doesn&#39;t agree with their ideology.</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right, skewed information is still information, and what they consistently do is cite their sources, which fake news sites don&#39;t do. I constantly check the sources of information to verify what I can between fact, and interpretation of facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but MSM seems to be using the sexual assault scandal the same way they used Michael Jackson&#39;s abuse case:
To distract us from a very suspicious investigation gone awry.
Once the MB shooting story took a nose dive MSM started pushing the Weinstein story. Once the anthrax attack investigation determined the anthrax could only have come for US military labs MSM started pushing the Michael Jackson case. </p>

<p>MSM not only tells people what to think, they also tell people what not to think about. Keep that in mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is r/conspiracy.  Not news, social justice, or feminism/MRA.  If there was a secret cabal, murdering and disposing any young actresses who want to speak out after getting raped?  Then yes.  That would be a conspiracy.  If there is a vast secret network of pedophiles headquartered in Hollywood?  Yes that is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>A rich, powerful, fat, Jewish producer pulling his dick out every chance he gets and actresses, instead of going to the police, decide to stay silent to get rich and famous?  Only to come out decades later when they have nothing to lose?  This is not conspiracy.   It&#39;s called regret.</p>

I don&#39;t know if people are conspiring with others to commit sex crimes in Hollywood. But I am convinced that it&#39;s pushed aside, ignored, and tolerated to an extent because some figures are too big/important to fall. </p>

<p>It still blows my mind that Woody Allen and Roman Polanski get to make big budget movies. Even with minor public backlash. Hollywood directors seem to be the only ones whose careers aren&#39;t affected by sex abuse or molestation claims. Victor Salva (director of Jeepers Creepers) was even CONVICTED of molesting an underage actor. And he just released Jeepers Creepers 3. Hopefully Weinstein&#39;s case can change this, because there&#39;s definitely a conspiracy to keep these people going no matter what happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weinstein is the first to fall?? There have been many before him. And he seems to be nothing more that a fucking sleeze womanizer, but not some grand conspiracy pedo ring or anything related to pizzagate. CEO&#39;s, executives in high power, they all have money, dicks and like to fuck. Being a sexual predator against the people you work with is not the same as pizzagate, the Catholic Church and any of that other stuff. </p>

<p>It has been extremely strange to me why a sub who usually wont take a single word from a hollywood actor as fact, all of a sudden is parading around everything that every different actor is saying about Weinstein. </p>

<p>Its not a conspiracy the guy is a fucking sexual creep who has acted on his impulses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Says who!?!  This is how dangerous power dynamics work though.  This guy had so much power in Hollywood that he thought nothing of just getting his cock out and straight up asking women to suck him off.  Just like that!</p>

<p>The person who feels powerless against someone is pressured into staying silent.  That and shame.  Sexual assault is a very complicated matter.  There are reasons so many victims stay silent.  Look at the Jimmy Savile situation in Britain.  He was doing disgraceful things for decades and it never got beyond the point of being one of those rumours you heard if you were in entertainment circles.  He was a Knight!  The highest honour which can bestowed on somebody.  He had all the power and his victims stayed silent.  When one or two people came out with their stories, the other victims were given the strength to come forward because they knew they weren&#39;t the only ones and that now people might actually believe them.</p>

<p>This Weinstein business is following the same pattern.</p>

Sex crimes of people of power in Hollywood, extended to stuff like Pizza gate and more.  The connections of Harvey and the Clinton&#39;s is a screaming red flag to me.  So, yes, I care, and I&#39;m tracking on it, because I&#39;m waiting for those other doors to open, and for the secrets to come out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>But I believe r/conspiracy does care about the Weinstein scandal because it&#39;s so closely related to then whole pizzag8 thing.</p>

<p>Note: sexual harassment has been widespread throughout the Hollywood Machine for ages. It&#39;s a thing, it&#39;s always been a thing. I tried to get into the industry after high school, and I soon learned that Hollywood is a corrupt, evil place, and I hated it. I just wanted to make movies... But wherever there&#39;s lots of money, there&#39;s also lots of bad people. Trust.</p>

<p>If you guys think the Weinstein thing is bad, look up Bryan Singer&#39;s sex parties (he directed a lot of the x men movies)
It&#39;s sick what some of these people get away with.</p>

<p>But again, I get what your saying. Vegas is the closest thing we have to a smoking gun, and TPTB are doing whatever it takes to suppress it. It&#39;s gotten to the point where they&#39;re being careless. They&#39;re scared. Keep fighting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What bothers me about the narrative is how the reporting on this is dominated by well-known actresses saying Harvey seriously propositioned them in a very creepy way and they all walked out on him (although I think Rose McGowan is now claiming to have been raped).</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that Harvey&#39;s success rate was 1% -- I think there are a lot of women who made a cost-benefit analysis and went along with Harvey&#39;s demands because they wanted the payoff.  So who are the ones who said yes?  I doubt we will hear from them now because they would be the new enemies, the enablers.  Although I suspect if you could manage a database of actresses who appeared in Weinstein-connected movies and subtract all the ones who have recently complained about Weinstein, you might come up with some possibilities.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to read more reporting on &quot;the casting couch&quot; generally.  Harvey Weinstein didn&#39;t invent it.  I mean, is it a real thing?  Is it an actual thing, where actresses gain some material advantage from sleeping around?  Or do they just get screwed and there&#39;s no benefit to them?</p>

<p>None of this is to say that Harvey wasn&#39;t a pig, but at the same time he didn&#39;t do it simply because he wanted to be rejected 100% of the time, either.   There must be some big-name Hollywood women who have figured out how to make that system work for them, which really makes them major enablers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the big trend now, isn&#39;t it, claiming that <em>everyone</em> was a victim.  It&#39;s no different than feminist criticism of prostitution or pornography -- the claim is made that <em>they were all victims</em> even when some are willing to stand up and say they made a willful choice.  Nobody gets to decide for them whether their choice was willful or the byproduct of manipulation.</p>

<p>I think there probably <em>are</em> women who accepted the &quot;casting couch&quot; as a willful choice and saw the benefits (real or imagined) as worth whatever the cost they thought they were incurring.  This isn&#39;t the first or only industry where women could trade their sexuality for some kind of advantage.  And business is hardly the only realm where this happens -- women make this choice <em>all the time</em> in wooing the rich &amp; powerful boyfriend, keeping the rich and powerful husband, and other social situations where they decide their social advantage is worth more than their sexual favors cost them.</p>

<p>Of course those that went along with Harvey really can&#39;t come out at this point and say &quot;Sure, I gave Harvey what he wanted and got rich/successful, and it was worth it&quot; because they would be pilloried as enablers of his behavior.</p>

<p>The other major irony is many of these same celebrities who complain about Harvey Weinstein wanting to exploit them sexually go on to exploit their own sexuality by appearing nude or engaging in sex scenes in filmed entertainment.  I&#39;m not even sure its a question of &quot;sexual exploitation&quot; as much as it is disagreeing about the terms of the bargain for their sexual exploitation.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to understand how much worse it was for Lena Headey to be propositioned by Weinstein than it was to participate in the infamous &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; &quot;Walk of Shame&quot; scene where she parades nude through a crowd and has garbage thrown on her.  Which one exploited Headey&#39;s sexuality more, Harvey Weinstein or the people who paid her a ton of money to be on Game of Thrones?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I happen to agree that someone who feels coerced into an action is still a victim of abuse.  It&#39;s abuse of power.  Paedophiles pray on children and convince them that if they tell anybody about the abuse, they&#39;ll get into trouble.  Some guy who tells a young actress who has moved away from home to follow their dream, and who has now got into a situation where she is on the cusp of being given all she has ever wanted that she has to suck his dick or she can forget on ever acting in a film ever again, is abusing his power.  It is abuse.  Especially when such provocations are made in situations where the woman is feeling physically intimidated or threatened.  I don&#39;t think that acquiescing to something you are pressured into is the same thing as making a conscious, well-reasoned decision.</p>

<p>Sure, you do get people like Madonna or any of the Kardashians who know that they can take advantage of men&#39;s sexual desires to further their careers.  These are the women who are acting like high-class prostitutes.  They make a conscious decision to go out and use their looks to get rich men to give them lots of money and gifts.  But those prostitutes are not making the same decisions as the girls on the street who are beaten and intimidated and drugged and shipped overseas by ruthless exploiters.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not hypocritical to exploits one&#39;s sexuality and be against sexual abuse.  Posing nude and being sexually assaulted are two very different things.  Especially when you are talking about a scene in a piece of art.</p>

<p>As for Lana Headey, she chose not to appear nude in Game of Thrones.  They used a body double and then CGI to merge the two.  She made a choice.  And even if she did choose to appear nude, it was her choice.  She would not be getting forced to do it.  But again, depictions of sexuality in art is not comparable to sexual abuse taking place behind closed doors.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that Lena Headey has the power and influence to refuse a nude scene, yet there&#39;s someone else perfectly willing to do what she refused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true. Most people don&#39;t care that greasy hollywood guy turned out to be a greasy hollywood guy after years of everyone saying and knowing he&#39;s a greasy hollywood guy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also true that no one is overlaying Somalian flags on their facebook profiles because no one cares about Somalia either. </p>

<p>But the LV shooting is getting blurrier and blurrier.
In my view there is a definite attempt at getting the 1st and 2nd amendments severely tightened or changed. This is an effort to protect the people who have been stealing from the country in huge amounts for the last 50 years. You can&#39;t have the ability to speak out and you can bet that they don&#39;t like the idea of you being able to carry out armed defense of the self and property.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna get into the Clinton stuff, but no one knows what may or may not have happened there. But it is very different because there was an actual legal case made of Trump&#39;s. The gag order prevents her from saying Trump raped her. This is what happens when you settle but don&#39;t want a public deal made of something. In other words, he probably raped her, and even if you don&#39;t call it &quot;rape&quot;, his actions in her account of what happened are egregious. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what? Trump has several news networks dedicated to nothing but spreading negative propaganda about him. The wikipedia page only proves how far the globalists are willing to go to fool their dimwitted sockpuppets.</p>

<p>Half of this &quot;propaganda&quot; is actually true. But it&#39;s easier for Trump to call anything negative about him fake news. Some of those accusations in that page come from before he was ever even a viable candidate. </p>
