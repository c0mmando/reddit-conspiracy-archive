       This is an ancient stone carving, the Sumerians are gathered around the Tree of Life, which is a pomegranate tree.
       <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mxJlIi5sngk/hqdefault.jpg">

      <p>
       Here's another stone Assyrian carving, once again showing the tree of life as a pomegranate tree
       <a href="http://firstlegend.info/babylonian-solar-disk-ashur-tree-of-life.jpg">
        http://firstlegend.info/babylonian-solar-disk-ashur-tree-of-life.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The solar winged god above the tree is the Sumerian god Shemash.
He [Shemash] is usually depicted as an old man with a long beard whose shoulders emanate rays of light but is also represented as the solar disc or, in the Neo-Assyrian Period (c. 912-612 BCE), as a disc with wings.  The Sumerians are showing reverence for the sun, because to them, and ancient mankind's perspective, the sun's rays are giving them and making the tree of life grow.
       <br/>
       <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Utu-Shamash/">
        https://www.ancient.eu/Utu-Shamash/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For futher evidence it's Shemash, know that the Sumerian language often influenced the Hebrews (or possibly vice versa), and the Hebrew name for the sun is shemesh, which is almost identical to the sun god Shemash.  Due to the strong interfluence of these two cultures, this is more evidence that the Sumerian's Tree of Life is the same as the one in Eden.
       <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrew/8121.htm">
        http://biblehub.com/hebrew/8121.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you look at the location of Sumeria, and the location of Eden, you'll see that Eden is within Sumeria.  This further shows, the Sumerian Tree of Life was also likely in Eden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the description and the rivers mentioned in Genesis, it points to Eden being here,
       <a href="http://techbano.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/a_map_of_the_garden_of_eden_48004_768_453.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is within Sumeria
       <a href="https://www.haplogroups.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sumer-578x246.png">
        https://www.haplogroups.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sumer-578x246.png

      </p>
      <p>
       So how can the pomegranate tree save your life in the future?  For one it's highly drought resistant.  This also makes them easy to grow, because they only require a little water and virtually no maintenance.
       <a href="http://extension.uga.edu/publications/detail.html?number=C997">
        http://extension.uga.edu/publications/detail.html?number=C997
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So to people in the Middle East, in the hot arid climate, to them it likely and truly did save their lives, hence the very appropriate name "Tree of Life".
      </p>
      <p>
       And here are health benefits of the pomegranate tree, it helps with:

       As our economy and climate worsens, it could certainly help to grow these as a food backup, it not for yourself, than at least for the children and future generations.

       This fruit was highly esteemed in the Bible.  It was part of the decoration in king Solomon's temple, and adorned the robes of the Israelite priests:
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 28:33 Make pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn around the hem of the robe, with gold bells between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Kings 7:18 He made pomegranates in two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. He did the same for each capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also here's a 4th century mosaic of Jesus, that incidentally shows pomegranates around him

      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible talks about a new Earth, which likely will be similar to the garden of Eden.  If we all start growing these, would we make the Earth a bit more like Eden? :)

       I've heard theories that the tree of life is a metaphor for a device that contains DNA and was responsible for genetic engineering. And that Noah had the DNA of every species on his boat, rather than the actual animals.

       It would make sense that the bible may be written is such metaphors because those before the modern age couldn't possibly understand such phenomena.

       Just so you know, the plant can get ridiculously tall and looks like a tree.  Also, personally I think that the "tree of life" in the Denver Airport murals looks like cannabis a bit more than pomegranate.

       Love me some pomegranate.  This is slightly off-topic, but one thing I noticed when reading the bible a few months back was the set-up of Solomon's Temple.  If you read it, I swear it sounds like the building of a computer processor more than a temple.  1 Kings 7:40-41: "...two columns, two nodes for the capitals on top of the columns, two pieces of network covering the nodes for the capitals on top of the columns, four hundred pomegranates in double rows on both pieces of network that covered the two nodes of the capitals where they met the columns."
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, who would've thought that a Bible passage would mention nodes and networks in the same sentence?

       I use the New American Bible.  Funny, compared to the king James version, a lot of the words have a much milder connotation.  In addition, it gives original Greek or Hebrew words where there is differing translations or interpretations of a word.  I was raised Catholic, and I'm pretty sure I've had this since 9th grade or so.  I do like going online though and checking passages or verses against other versions, though.

       Btw, in the Garden of Eden it talks about two trees.  The Tree of Life, and The Tree of Knowledge.  The latter tree, was the one that was forbidden.  I'll check back maybe in a week, and see if this thread gets enough interest and upvotes, if so, I'll provide info on the the Tree of Knowledge.
