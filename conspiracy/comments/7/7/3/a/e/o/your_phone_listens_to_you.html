       I called a local shooting range to see if the lanes were wheelchair accessible. This evening google asked for a review on accessibility of the range. I never typed anything about wheelchair accessibility, only through voice on the call to the shooting range.

       I bought some boots the other day, with cash. No paper trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on I used my wife's iPad. She has Facebook and I don't, but it's easier to jump on hers to talk to family sometimes than to have my own account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Facebopok had a bunch of ads for the same brand of men's work boots I just bought. She had the iPad in her bag when we were in the store.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be one thing if it was like some cookie cross-pollination from our joint bank account to targeted ads or something, but I paid in cash. Even then, I'm pretty sure she doesn't do banking on mobile devices either.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's disturbed me because I'm pretty secure myself, cameras and mics on computers physically disabled, little snitch running, VPN, TOR, Signal messaging, etc.

       If it was in your bag it was done by GPS. Every time I go get a burrito, my phone goes off and asks if I'd like to leave a review. If the line is long and I have some time, I do. It will follow up a few days later with generic questions like "Does this place take credit cards?" And stuff like that. It also happens when I'm near someplace. It will ask me to review a business that I'm next door to. It's all done by GPS.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, they absolutely are listening in. It's called Data Mining. They do it for "advertising purposes." Look in to the Patriot Act, and the stuff that the NSA is up to. They're 100% listening. To everyone, all the time? No. But they're scanning for key phrases.  They're looking for a specific and ever growing list of words and phrases that "set off the alarm." I'm sure they will review the context and make an "appropriate" decision, but the point remains, they're listening.

       Yeah I'm sure the last time her iOS updated it probably kicked location services back on. That would explain some ads relating to stores we we were in or near.
      </p>

       But the exactness of the brand is what disturbed me, I can't think of how that would have happened without listening to me talk.

       Weird thing happened to me a few weeks ago. I live in a REALLY small town that's over an hour away from any good sized City. There is one gas station/711. My kids go there if they have a few bucks to buy stuff, or I'll give them some money to get me something too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a pretty rare name. To the point that it is SUPER RARE to ever see my name on anything personalized &amp; if by chance I think I see my name, it's usually always spelled with an extra "S".
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, every once in awhile I'd tell my kid to get me a Coke. He brought one home with his name on it "Zack". Neat. He found his brothers name another time. But then one day he brought home one with my name on it. Spelled correctly. I thought it was so cool!! Wow! What are the odds!
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait...What actually are the odds of that happening? It still kind of creeps me out lol. I only ever pay with cash. My phone is either left home or off if I am at the store. HOW DID THEY KNOW TO HAVE MY NAME THERE?! Spooky. Coca Cola has their tentacles spread out far &amp; wide.

       Your GPS and call history is being tracked. Since you've called that specific shooting range, google probably compares it with public phone records and adjusts.
