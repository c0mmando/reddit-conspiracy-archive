<p>Maybe I’m nuts, but I think these recent airport closures are not all they are reported to have been. Perhaps preventing someone from coming into NYC? Or maybe just a flood. Who knows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something&#39;s going on. Not to mention the planes being turned around halfway, like the one to Japan for &quot;a guy without a ticket&quot; and the one to Alaska because there were &quot;rats&quot;.
Do you know how many people they affected by turning back halfway? You don&#39;t just screw over 200+ people because some dude didn&#39;t have his ticket. How did he get on in the first place? Becaus that&#39;s probably not what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone looked into any strange flights that may have been allowed to land or depart from JFK while it was shut down like what happened at Hartsfield-Jackson Int’l in Atlanta a month or two ago? I’m trying to find the original reddit post because I want the guy who posted it to get credit, but he basically said they found an Israeli-owned cargo plane was allowed to depart ATL in the middle of the power outage, when both the Governor of Georgia AND the FAA has grounded all flights. It had arrived in ATL from Mexico just before the outage, and didn’t have to be searched by customs (had some kind of pre-clearance or something), and then when everything was shut down, it took off and flew back to Mexico. It was documented on Flight Aware or one of the other flight tracking sites as well. I’ll post the link to that original post as soon as I have time and can find it. But I’d be curious to see if anything similar happened in NY. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to take into account that the buildings are aging. The older they get, the more likely they are to have breakdowns. Combined with a long period of below freezing weather and you get pipes bursting. 
Used to work in a building built in the 70s. When we’d get extended periods of cold like nyc had last week, the pipes would burst. It was a mess to deal with.
I think it’s safe to say that this isn’t a conspiracy (unless it’s a conspiracy to let our infrastructure fail)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s just recency bias. Especially with how many subs this place got after Mandalay, people are starting to view events in a different lense. But shootings have always been happening, airport malfunctions have always happened, even random weather patterns happen once in a while. It&#39;s just not always reported on the MSM in place of &quot;necessary&quot; PSAs on social issues. </p>
