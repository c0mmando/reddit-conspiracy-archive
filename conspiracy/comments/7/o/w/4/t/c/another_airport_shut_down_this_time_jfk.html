       Maybe I’m nuts, but I think these recent airport closures are not all they are reported to have been. Perhaps preventing someone from coming into NYC? Or maybe just a flood. Who knows.

       Something's going on. Not to mention the planes being turned around halfway, like the one to Japan for "a guy without a ticket" and the one to Alaska because there were "rats".
Do you know how many people they affected by turning back halfway? You don't just screw over 200+ people because some dude didn't have his ticket. How did he get on in the first place? Becaus that's probably not what happened.

       It was an internal water pipe break at JFK. Has nothing to do with climate change. But they will paint it as a climate change disaster. Sure, they broke the pipes themselves. All pipes are weather protected.

       Weather protection breaks down, and maintaining pipes costs money. Can't give the CEO such a big bonus this year if you have to pay a whole construction crew to work around the clocks and pay night shift differentials to maintain them. Is this a conspiracy? Could be. But I'd look at the money before saying it was malice.

       JFK and LGA are fucking shitholes that make Newark look nice.  All of those airports run at 120% capacity when weather is nice.  Throw in a blizzard and water main break and you have complete system failure.

       Has anyone looked into any strange flights that may have been allowed to land or depart from JFK while it was shut down like what happened at Hartsfield-Jackson Int’l in Atlanta a month or two ago? I’m trying to find the original reddit post because I want the guy who posted it to get credit, but he basically said they found an Israeli-owned cargo plane was allowed to depart ATL in the middle of the power outage, when both the Governor of Georgia AND the FAA has grounded all flights. It had arrived in ATL from Mexico just before the outage, and didn’t have to be searched by customs (had some kind of pre-clearance or something), and then when everything was shut down, it took off and flew back to Mexico. It was documented on Flight Aware or one of the other flight tracking sites as well. I’ll post the link to that original post as soon as I have time and can find it. But I’d be curious to see if anything similar happened in NY.

       I get it. It snowed....Im a New Yorker. The Airports are crap. BUT I cant remember so many airport outtages/evacs. Maybe its way more common than i thought and just never paid attention. I just know that NYC has gotta hit with MUCH MORE SNOW and (to my recollection) this has never happened

       There's more to it than snow though. The cold temps make everything work harder and that airport is a shit hole

       You have to take into account that the buildings are aging. The older they get, the more likely they are to have breakdowns. Combined with a long period of below freezing weather and you get pipes bursting. 
Used to work in a building built in the 70s. When we’d get extended periods of cold like nyc had last week, the pipes would burst. It was a mess to deal with.
I think it’s safe to say that this isn’t a conspiracy (unless it’s a conspiracy to let our infrastructure fail)

       I think it's just recency bias. Especially with how many subs this place got after Mandalay, people are starting to view events in a different lense. But shootings have always been happening, airport malfunctions have always happened, even random weather patterns happen once in a while. It's just not always reported on the MSM in place of "necessary" PSAs on social issues.
