        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I got this Idea from an old ass guy i talked in the park to. Trump should do as much faults as possible. This way even the last ignorant people will notice, republican politics is not in  favour  of the american citizen and of course not in favour of world peace. After the old guys theory, Trump will be sitting in jail before his presidency ends (i know nowerdays its kind of obvious but back then trump wasnt even elected). After that there will be some socialistic reforms implemented in the US, like for example in germany. This way people will say &quot;oh, now it is the time of freedom and peace, theres no reason to start a revolution.&quot; And the ignorance continues ans the elite can maintain its position. 
To me it is just not realistic that a US president would behave the way Trump does by himself. What is your opinion in that explanation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that was the idea, to bring people to the brink then walk them back with minor reforms, I have a feeling it will fail.  The time to rise has been engaged, and the American people are tired of being shit on.  The 2016 election offered two choices so bad, so criminal, that there are no winners or losers.  Just a few people that profit and the masses that want change. A complete and total overhaul is in the wind.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you would say he is? I would Love to hear your arguments. But in my eyes even the most ignorant fool knows that he is a cunt, so his image ist rather bad. We know from many corrupt US presidents before, that it is quite easy to form a good image.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ya he&#39;s really bad at it. doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t trying. the apprentice, countless tv appearances before he even ran for president. after becoming president, an obsession with his approval rating and extremely think skinned; compulsively has to tweet in response to suggestions he isnt that smart, or has small hands, or is nuts, etc etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you say am brainwashed? Good joke. Try thinking outside your own perspective. If you would be president would you tweet premature shit like that to make your image better? If you would want to change your image, there are much more effective ways and even Trump knows that If he is not fully mentally disabled. And I can tell you, to make as much money as he did, you need a functioning brain. But you can also stay ignorant, gain your knowledge from Trumps Twitter Account and call other people brainwashed. People like you are really nothing nee to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never said that but i am defenitely not so &quot;brainwashed&quot; to be thinking that someone as retarded as he is portrayed, could get so succesful and also get president of the US.
