       Really funny stuff there.  First, it's spelled 'Israel'.  Second, they aren't suffering in any way that matters.  Just usual whinging.  They are the spoon fed babies of the entire planet.

       I'm talking about denying the Holocaust, that was 70 years ago man.  I'm asking why you seem to be able to laugh at that but have your heart where it should be for the Palestinians.  Why can't you open your heart to their suffering as well?

       This is exactly my point.  So you're saying their is a time stamp on sympathy?  How can you sympathize with Palestinians and their innocent lives being lost and then deny other people that same right?  Who is being the hypocrite here?  And why is it you think I don't sympathize with Palestinians?  Have any of my words given that effect?  No they have not.

       Until recently realizing how absurd it is, I had an ocean of sympathy.  At some point your sympathy does come to and end though.  You realize many genocides have happened throughout history, right?  For some reason, we are
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       to feel sorry for
       <strong>
        one
       </strong>
       group, because they make major motion picture after major motion picture.  9/11 used up all of my sympathy personally, and I don't care if you've got a problem with that.

       Israel did not exist during the holocaust, and furthermore, the holocaust is an emotional plea for nationhood and not a logical one.
      </p>
      <p>
       There really is no Israeli suffering. They have it pretty good as the front-organization for some really rich men. Look at all the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's GDP, size, population, and income distribution. It's essentially a prop. It gets paid to the tune of billions in aid, has rival competitive tech and weapons manufacturing subsidized, and then has total media relations control over narratives: Poor Israel. ..yeah, right.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how I saw though the rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       a) You're not aware Israel became a state in '48, and the camps were liberated in '44-45.
      </p>
      <p>
       b) You're making emotional pleas for Israeli statehood based on the holocaust alone - Zionist dont need anymore help with this tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       -While virtue-signaling about holocaust denial.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Assuming all facts about the holocaust are accurate, given even academic discrepancies; a product common to all aspects of historical narrative meeting later historical research.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         C) how did this suddenly become about Israelis? That's like you asking in regard to this question about Palestinians, "why such disdain for Nazi suffering"?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Think about the logical-structure of the conversation, and your question:
      </p>
      <p>
       He asked about the Palestinians, likening their suffering to the aforementioned Jews of the holocaust, and you ask about the Israelis . . .who are the culprits of palistinain genocide (your words), much like the nazis to the holocaust victims.

       The worst part of the plight of the Palestinians is how antisemites use their struggle in attempt to gain some sort of momentum for themselves. Also antisemites seem to think of anti zionist's as their peers. It's such a mess. Its all so convoluted and avoided on msm so it just seems to get worse and worse. The worst part though, is how little the average westerner knows on this topic, or how they blindly take the side of the zionists because of how horrible the holocaust was.

       That is very true.  As I'm trying to explain to these guys, I am very much pro-Palestinian.  Their houses to razed every day, they are shot indiscriminately.  I shouldn't even have to write these words but just so you all know, I am not anti-Palestinian.  I just don't understand how they deny the Holocaust.  It's really not that hard to understand.

       For me it wasn't the fact that they denied the holocaust, it's just that there are a lot of people on here that seem to be certain that it didn't happen. That bothered me for a bit, but then I realized the consensus on almost every conspiracy that is talked about on here is believed, and in many ways I prefer it that way. Having a large community of people that are always skeptical or deny what is portrayed on msm is actually good because it makes me think more critically. I'm sure many other people on here are the same. Everything should be questioned, including the holocaust, to get a sharper understanding of the world we are living in. Unfortunately most people explore the theories to prove it didn't happen or they don't explore the theories because they are certain it did. Both of those attitudes are extremely dangerous in my opinion. The other thing is that Israel is fucking weird and their behaviour and mistreatment of Palestinians is just going to increase the number of holocaust deniers over the years.

       Ashkenazi Jews (Zionists), are not Semitic people, yet, they make up the majority of those ruling Israel. However, Palestinians
       <strong>
        are Semitic people

       See the problem is that anyone questioning the events and numbers of the holocaust, gets grouped in with the 'deniers'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there were work camps and lots of people died under horribly cruel conditions. Its the official 'facts' that I'm in disagreement with.
      </p>
      <p>
       If my opposition in debate cant understand the difference between the two thought patterns of questioning/denying, i lose interest in engaging with them. I would imagine it is the same for others.

       Saying they were work camps equates it like, ok hon time to go to work.  You are minimizing the slaughter and just by the fact you use that language means you arent big enough to read about the atrocities.  Read Man's Search for Meaning then tell me if you would ever use work camps again in your life.

       Have you got years for a lot of those football photos? I would imagine it was early war years?

       From what i've researched, the majority of deaths (and killings) started later half of the war when the Nazi lines were stretched.  This would explain those photos.

       From research into survivors and from the photos available, it very mouch looks like things went real bad from 41/42 onwards.

       How is it intelligent discourse to say work camps instead of concentration camps.  I don't doubt that powerful people used this tragedy for some ill gain.  Does that mean you think 2 million instead of 5 million dead means anything in the end except the worst of humanity in action?  Why are you saying work camps.  I really want to know.

       Why would "death camps" have hospitals, pools, theaters, general stores, etc etc? Also, how does one survive multiple death camps, and where is the evidence for "gas chambers"?
      </p>
      <p>
       They were work/internment camps, just like how the US had them for the Japanese and others. The only difference is, the US did not get invaded and airstriked.

       This is a perfect example.  So you think Jewish people were using the pools and theaters?  Am I really going to forced to even write that maybe they were for the Nazis entertainment?  Where is the evidence of gas chambers?  Jesus man.  People survived by being strong enough to walk 20 miles a day with half a bowl of watery soup.  Those that didn't were gassed.  If you don't believe this you are believing a lie.

       i like the part where the chimneys were build after the fact by the Allies, to illustrate what crematoriums might have looked like if nazis had actually had death camps and mass crematoriums.

       It doesnt affect intelligent discourse to hold an opinion. Infact without opinion, intelligent discourse cannot happen.

       You're bringing emotion into a debate on fact. I dont care if it was the best or worst of humanity, that is just immaterial BS that's best left to Op-eds.

       Because the deaths attributed are incidental to the purpose they were built for.

       I'm sure you're going to claim that I'm minimising it again. But from my point of view, you're looking at it through a cloud of emotion.

       If you aren't emotional by innocent people being killed, then maybe you aren't the one who needs to be commenting on anything related to the Holocaust.  Incidental deaths makes my point exactly.  Your heart is not where it should be on this debate.  If you think intellectualism is reptile logic and nothing else, than you are just as bad as the people you claim to be fighting against.

       it is a very common mistake for people to make, to assume someone is "crazy" simply because they don't believe the same bullshit you believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       like, should i assume you are "bat shit crazy" for believing men walked on the moon, or would it make more sense to assume you are simply gullible and/or stupid for believing that?

       -mathematical discrepancies, historical discrepancies, and documented forgeries all lead people to necessitating questions of the holocaust and German genocidal atrocities.  Not to support the current narrative, but to challenge it for the the pure sanctity of truth without virtue-signaling or nationhood-authority.

      <p>
       The truth should not be political. So, why are you so scared about questioning the numbers and motives involved in the holocaust; as, valiantly, as much as someone who attacks another who completely denies it?

       For me all I can say is that I really enjoyed history but it's turning out to be a fabrication. I can't say the Holocaust did or didn't happen, I can't say the Earth is flat or round, and I can't say that Jesus Christ even existed. I wasn't there, I haven't witnessed.

       The sub is fueled by skepticism. Both healthy and unhealthy. Were in the age of information and we have to question everything. It's the nature of the Beast. I pick my mission and battles on here and I don't blame anybody for believing in what they believe because we are all in our own bubbles of information.

       The Neo Nazi worldview is deeply dependent on conspiratorial thinking, principally "the great conspiracy" of Jewish/Khararian/Whatever control of humanity. Holocaust denial is part of that. It comes and goes around here and will never be fully separate from the general conspiracy community. But please don't take 3 or 4 users circlejerking over the topic as a comprehensive sub-wide thumb's up on that particular theory and worldview.

       Yes we are being dramatic.  How people can deny the suffering of others, anyone's suffering, leads to some righteous indignation for sure.  It's very upsetting to see.  You're right maybe I shouldn't read it and just ignore, but it's just not in me to do.  These people need to be confronted.

       The Holocaust didn't happen at all like they say, and that's a fact. I think you're right, you don't seem to belong here if you can't comprehend how that is possible. It is a huge lie for sure and you have been conditioned to reflexively reject any questioning of it as "Holocaust denial."

       'if we can't agree on fact'
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point is to not universally agree in the facts as presented to us. If that sometimes leads to some bad ideas or theories, or silly conclusions such as a Flat Earth than that's okay. It's the cost of freedom of thought and speech and the upside of them two things is well worth accepting the downsides. You can't have one withiht the other. If you don't think something is appropriate or well thought out downvote and move on. If you're not willing to even read it or accept that it's okay and allowed, then just skip to moving on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting people in jail for questioning the events surrounding the Holocaust is much, much more of a crime than question the events surrounding the Holocaust itself it. (this isn't just in the case of outright deniers and anti-semetics, also those who simply exercise a capacity to question official narratives.)

       You started by saying that in a post the other night, questions you consider valid about 9/11 were being raised about the Holocaust, which you seem to consider invalid. I think that is a wrong way to look at things in a conspiracy sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of misinformation, disinformation, and outright lies put out by everybody involved in WW2. I can't think of a single group/country who hasn't misrepresented activities during the War to either hide their evil deeds, hide the fact that they looked the other way, hide the fact that they helped the "bad guys" to profit in some way, misrepresent their efforts to do the right thing, or misrepresent their losses for whatever reason. I think I understand your frustration that there are many books on the subject that corroborate the official stories. I personally find it impossible to refute the photographs of the dead/dying, and the personal statements given by people who were actively involved in the events. I will say that for me, personally, I cannot wrap my head around the numbers thrown out there for specific groups. I do know that the numbers for some groups were supposedly ratified/estimated by some of the Nazis themselves. I also know that prosecutors and tribunals will lie. I know that people on trial will often confess to anything if they think they might get a deal. Finally, I have seen how the 5 million or 6 million + numbers have been used by certain groups to benefit themselves even to this very day. This combination of stuff might makes some people question the official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps some people think none of the atrocities happened at all. I haven't seen the post that you're referring to, but I have no reason to doubt that some of the 1/2 million people subscribed to this sub have the views that you described. I simply hate that anyone who questions the official number of the official story is declared an anti-semite, a bigot, or whatever else.

       Even the official keepers of the holy narrative are revisionists now.  You don't have to seek it out because it's headed your way.  You can choose to ignore it nevertheless it's already a done deal and reality will trickle down upon you eventually.
