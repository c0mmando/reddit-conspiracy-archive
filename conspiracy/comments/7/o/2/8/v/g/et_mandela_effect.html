       Recently my mum read an article on why M&amp;M’s decided to drop the opportunity to be in the film E.T and she started to call absolute bullshit on it. The scene M&amp;M’s would’ve been featured in is at the beginning of the movie, where Elliot tries to entice E.T out of his hiding spot, using what is now clearly a bag of Reese’s Pieces. My mum says that she absolutely clearly remembers it being M&amp;M’s (not Reese’s Pieces) since M&amp;M’s weren’t a thing you could buy in England until the success of the movie, when everyone wanted to suddenly buy these sweets. She absolutely did not believe in conspiracy theories before this either, which is why I’m inclined to think she may have something here. Another thing about this is that Reese’s as a brand only came to England VERY recently which I find strange for such strongly received product placement from one of the most successful movies of the 80’s.

       Well that’s the whole point of my post!! I remember Reese’s but I also wasn’t alive in small town England throughout the 80’s to dissect whether other people around that age in England also remember this.

       This is what you let consume your spare time? I don’t even understand what it is you are trying to say. You think originally M&amp;M’s were in the movie, but then they later changed it to Reeses or something? Even if that is true (it’s not), I can not think of a “conspiracy” that would interest me less than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not call this the Mandela Effect, because that would require numerous people who share the same false memory. I have never heard this mentioned before.

       Can I give you a tip? You are kind of overdoing it with the “babe” and “darling” stuff. Its most effective when used in small doses. You start to sound like a grandmother after awhile. Same with the general sarcasm. Subtle sarcasm cuts much deeper.

       No problem, toots. I just checked your history to see how far the conspiracy rabbit hole goes, and I noticed you have zero karma and this was your first post. Your very first comment was to me, yet you have had the account for over 100 days. What’s up with that, cupcake?

       I’m very aware of most mainstream Mandela effects. The thing with them however, is they’re all very American-culture-central, and I was very interested to see if this was an English thing perhaps!

       I was alive at this time and conscious of the news.
       <br/>
       Reese's was in the movie but M&amp;Ms made a lot of news about how they fucked up by turning that down.  I'd say they created almost as much press for themselves by screwing up as Reese's did by taking the deal.

       Interesting!! That makes a lot of sense! The thing that got me very confused about this was the fact M&amp;M’s were non existent before that movie, so this does clear that up. Like I’ve said before, this was nothing to do with me and everything to do with my mum, so it’ll be interesting to hear what she says about this!

       I agree with most of what you said, but the Mandela Effect actually is a real thing. It is just a term for when a lot of different people share the same false memory. It was named the Mandela Effect because a lot of people used to think Nelson Mandela was dead like 10 years before he actually was.
