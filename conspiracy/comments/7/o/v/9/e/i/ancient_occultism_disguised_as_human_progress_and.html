<p><strong>Introduction: Would you want to live forever?</strong></p>

<p>Would you want to live forever? I have written much about death and life, and no matter your spiritual beliefs, this question is quite intriguing – in fact, isn’t this <em>the</em> question. I would say most reading this post have a healthy fear of death, and there are those who pretend they do not (I am kind of kidding), but ultimately, no matter where you are in “acceptance” toward death, most of us have considered the possibility of living forever. </p>

<p>In this post, though, I did not want to argue about religion or spirituality per se. Rather, I wanted to discuss the propagation of a different type of eternal life, one that is built on a foundation of illusion: Transhumanism.</p>

<p>If you do not know about Jason Silva, you have to watch some of his videos. Though some of you may find him exhilarating, I find him a jumbled mess of hubris and contradictions, disguised as truth. Please, please watch one of his “performances”entitled “We Are Gods Now” if possible:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2VrefjIjk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2VrefjIjk</a></p>

<p>If you do not feel like it, here are a few Jason Silva quotes to get you started on some of his beliefs:</p>

<p>“Alesiter Crowley used to define magic as anything in which you can exercise your will in the world through the use of your mind. So what&#39;s the magical way of opening or closing that door? Well, to will your body to stand up and close or open that door, that&#39;s magic. With the iPhone, it&#39;s like you put your intent into it, and it helps you exercise that intent in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>“I do NOT accept the ephemeral nature of this moment. I&#39;m going to extend it FOREVER! Or at least I&#39;m going to try.”</p>

<p>“We are gods. Our tools make us gods. In symbiosis with our technology, our powers are expanding exponentially and so, too, our possibilities.”</p>

<p>Whatever you think of this guy, we will come back to him later. For now, I want to tell you that there is nothing new under the sun. In other words, this seemingly “new” concept that all is one and we can have somehow have eternal, physical life is not really new – just repackaged for a modern audience, and I want to explain how you might be being deceived.</p>

<p><strong>Occultism, Mystery Schools, Gnosticism, and More</strong></p>

<p>Obviously I cannot group all occult beliefs together, and I am not attempting to do that. Rather, I want you to examine some foundational occult beliefs of the past so that later we can compare them to the present. Also, it would be impossible to get into it all, but I will do my best to provide an outline for you to examine yourself.</p>

<p><em>Manly P. Hall – Secret Teachings of All Ages</em> - If you have not yet read this, you should, especially as a conspiracy theorist. It is an encyclopedic outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic, and Rosicrucian symbolical philosophy. You can find it for free here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta04.htm">http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta04.htm</a></p>

<p>Here are some important key points made by Hall:</p>

<p>• <em>Only some can understand the profound mysteries of life.</em> Hall writes, “There are, however, but few mature minds in the world; and thus it was that the philosophic-religious doctrines of the pagans were divided to meet the needs of these two fundamental groups of human intellect--one philosophic, the other incapable of appreciating the deeper mysteries of life.” </p>

<p>• <em>These mystery schools have existed for a LONG time.</em> Hall explains, “In all cities of the ancient world were temples for public worship and offering. In every community also were philosophers and mystics, deeply versed in Nature&#39;s lore. These individuals were usually banded together, forming seclusive philosophic and religious schools. The more important of these groups were known as the Mysteries. Many of the great minds of antiquity were initiated into these secret fraternities by strange and mysterious rites, some of which were extremely cruel.” Further, “Much of the ritualism of Freemasonry is based on the trials to which candidates were subjected by the ancient hierophants before the keys of wisdom were entrusted to them.”</p>

<p>• <em>Gnostic (or hidden) beliefs are central to all mystery schools.</em> Hall writes, “The name Gnostic means wisdom, or knowledge, and is derived from the Greek Gnosis. The members of the order claimed to be familiar with the secret doctrines of early Christianity. They interpreted the Christian Mysteries according to pagan symbolism. Their secret information and philosophic tenets they concealed from the profane and taught to a small group only of especially initiated persons.”</p>

<p>• <em>It is nearly impossible to comprehend some of the dogma of these theological systems.</em> Hall continues, “The theories of Qabbalism are inextricably interwoven with the tenets of alchemy, Hermeticism, Rosicrucianism, and Freemasonry. The words Qabbalism and Hermeticism are now considered as synonymous terms covering all the arcana and esotericism of antiquity. The simple Qabbalism of the first centuries of the Christian Era gradually evolved into an elaborate theological system, which became so involved that it was next to impossible to comprehend its dogma.”</p>

<p>• <em>The fundamental understanding of nature is of the utmost importance</em>, and according to Hall, “The Rosicrucians declared that the material arts and sciences were but shadows of the divine wisdom, and that only by penetrating the innermost recesses of Nature could man attain to reality and understanding.”
Despite the fact that many of the teachings of these gnostic beliefs have vanished or transformed over time, the key teachings are universally still there.</p>

<p><em>Hermetic Tradition</em></p>

<p>The “Emerald Tablet” will give you some basic understanding of Hermetic traditions. Here is a translation by Isaac Newton:</p>

<ol>
<li> Tis true without lying, certain &amp; most true.</li>
<li> That which is below is like that which is above &amp; that which is above is like that which is below to do the miracles of one only thing</li>
<li> And as all things have been &amp; arose from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.</li>
<li> The Sun is its father, the moon its mother, the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth is its nourse.</li>
<li> The father of all perfection in the whole world is here.</li>
<li> Its force or power is entire if it be converted into earth.</li>
<li> Separate thou the earth from the fire, the subtile from the gross sweetly with great industry.</li>
<li> It ascends from the earth to the heaven &amp; again it descends to the earth &amp; receives the force of things superior &amp; inferior.</li>
<li> By this means you shall have the glory of the whole world</li>
<li>&amp; thereby all obscurity shall fly from you.</li>
<li>Its force is above all force. For it vanquishes every subtle thing &amp; penetrates every solid thing.</li>
<li>So was the world created.</li>
<li>From this are &amp; do come admirable adaptations whereof the means (or process) is here in this. Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world</li>
<li>That which I have said of the operation of the Sun is accomplished &amp; ended.</li>
</ol>

<p>What does this mean? You can get an in-depth analysis here (<a href="http://www.levity.com/alchemy/emertabl.html">http://www.levity.com/alchemy/emertabl.html</a>) , but the emphasis on duality and balance is very important. As above, so below, anyone? The checkerboard? All of these aspects of duality are VERY important in occult beliefs. </p>

<p>Here are some other important principles of the “The Kybalion: Hermetic Philosophy”:</p>

<p>• All is Mind
• As Above, So Below (Correspondence, unity)
• Vibration
• Polarity
• Rhythm
• Cause and Effect
• Gender (Unity of the Masculine and Feminine)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#Principle_of_Mentalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#Principle_of_Mentalism</a></p>

<p>Summary: For the sake of generalization, the foundations of these occult and gnostic beliefs rest on the following beliefs:</p>

<p>• We are all one, and everything is connected
• There is certain, “divine” knowledge that only some can obtain
• Duality is a foundational concept (as above, so below)
• It is important that one seeks true understanding of nature</p>

<p>These do not sound bad, right? Well, we will talk more about that later.</p>

<p><strong>Modern New Age Resurgence</strong></p>

<p>While none of these beliefs have ever died, they have transformed over time, and clearly, they have existed largely in secret societies like the Freemasons, though these foundational beliefs have infiltrated many different facets of society. </p>

<p>It is important to note that I did not talk about the Luciferian/Satanic ties to these beliefs, but they are there, though not always “directly” stated as such. In some occult practices, Lucifer “is seen as one of many morning stars, a symbol of enlightenment,[27] independence and human progression, and is often used interchangeably with similar figures from a range of ancient beliefs, such as the Greek titan Prometheus or the Jewish talmudic figure Lilith.”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism</a></p>

<p>Manly P. Hall actually said, “When the Mason learns that the key…is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the mystery of his craft. The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands.”</p>

<p>Aleister Crowley brought this version of Lucifer and the occult to the masses. While many dismiss Aleister Crowley, he had a foundational impact on modern occultism. By the way, Aleister Crowley was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn</a></p>

<p>I could write an entirely different post on Aleister, so I wanted to include a summary of his core beliefs. I apologize for pasting such a wall of text, but I bolded items that you may find important:</p>

<p>“Crowley&#39;s belief system, Thelema, has been described by scholars as a religion,[221] and more specifically as both a new religious movement,[222] and as a &quot;magico-religious doctrine&quot;.[223] It has also been characterised as a form of esotericism and modern Paganism.[224] Although holding The Book of the Law—which was composed in 1904—as its central text, Thelema took shape as a complete system in the years after 1904.[225]</p>

<p>In his autobiography, Crowley claimed that his purpose in life had been to &quot;bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form&quot;, although what he meant by &quot;paganism&quot; was unclear.[226] <strong>Crowley&#39;s thought was not always cohesive, and was influenced by a variety of sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and the Tarot.[227]</strong> He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the <strong>Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</strong>, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done.[228] Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and Tantra into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.[229] The historian Alex Owen noted that Crowley adhered to the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of the Decadent movement throughout his life.[230]
Crowley believed that the twentieth century marked humanity&#39;s entry to the Aeon of Horus, a <strong>new era in which humans would take increasing control of their destiny.</strong></p>

<p>He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship.[231] He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus,[225] and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon.[232] <strong>Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe.[233]</strong> Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one&#39;s True Will to be &quot;the Great Work&quot; or the attaining of the &quot;knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel&quot;.[234] His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th-century grimoire.[235] The moral code of &quot;Do What Thou Wilt&quot; is believed by Thelemites to be the religion&#39;s ethical law, although the historian of religion Marco Pasi noted that this was not anarchistic or libertarian in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism.[236]””</p>

<p>What is really important to note here is that Crowley took from a variety of different mystery schools, many of which were mentioned above. What is extremely important to note is that he DID have a profound influence on modern spiritual beliefs, and many may not even realize it. Whether Crowley was a Satanist or not is not really important. What is important, I think, is to see how his school of thought has infiltrated modern new age belief. By the way, I do not have the time to talk about some of the darker components of his belief systems. Rather, I want to show how many may not even know where some of these modern new age beliefs are coming from - Crowley brought gnostic (hidden) beliefs to the masses.</p>

<p>Again, what is ‘wrong’ with these beliefs? They sound good, don’t they? Before we go on to the next section, here are some important quotes from Crowley to keep in mind:</p>

<p>• &quot;Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.&quot; — Aleister Crowley (Magick in Theory and Practice)</p>

<p>• &quot;Science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness.&quot; — Aleister Crowley (The Confessions of Aleister Crowley : An Autohagiography)</p>

<p>• &quot;Since all things are God, in all things thou seest just so much of God as thy capacity affordeth thee.&quot; — Aleister Crowley (The Vision &amp; the Voice With Commentary and Other Papers: The Collected Diaries of Aleister Crowley, (1909-1914 E.V.)</p>

<p>So, really, why is this &#39;bad&#39;?</p>

<p><strong>The NEW, New Age: Modern New Age Spirituality, Scientism, Godlessness, Technology and More</strong></p>

<p>Before I can answer that question, I want to go back to Jason Silva. Even if you have not heard of him, he exemplifies foundational occult principals, just in new and exciting terminology. With that being said, though, his beliefs are fundamentally the same as nearly all mentioned above. What is important to note here is that Jason Silva takes some of the classic occult beliefs from the ancient mystery schools and Crowley and others (whether he knows it or not), and he takes it to a whole new level. The next step, I suppose, in this evolution, is technology. </p>

<p>I am going to do my best to summarize the beliefs mentioned in “We Are the Gods Now”:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2VrefjIjk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2VrefjIjk</a></p>

<p>• We can transcend our limitations using science and technology – (5:19)
• Technology is our extended phenotype. It is what we are – (5:47)
• We are on our way to becoming gods (8:41)
• Co-evolution of humans and technology. The technology will go inside of us. (15:50ish)
• Death is no longer acceptable (16:10ish)
• Sentience that is not limited by biology (16:48ish)
• He is profoundly haunted by the impermanence of life (20:50ish)</p>

<p>Is Jason Silva’s modern new age transhumanism beliefs just really occult philosophy with a twist? Is it the next STEP in this new age belief that we can actually become Gods through technology? Before, we were all God, and NOW we can be Gods. 
This is the BRIDGE that Jason mentions throughout his videos. </p>

<p>If you really listen to Silva’s beliefs, he is combining the foundations of the occult (everything is one, magick, and “experiencing divinity” with technology, scientism, and transhumanism. In this video creepily titled “Engineering Magical Experiences”, he states, “I am not religious. In fact, I do not even really like the world spiritual.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN9UOkN-LWE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN9UOkN-LWE</a> (4:22)</p>

<p>This video exemplifies the new age, one world religion that I predict for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Who cares? Isn’t this progress?</strong></p>

<p>In the end, only you can decide whether you support this move toward transcendence and transhumanism, but I did want to provide a few arguments before you decide to unite your consciousness with some technological force. </p>

<p>• Technology is not inherently good or bad. Technology has been equated with progress, and I feel people are being deceived. Technology is a tool. I have written A LOT about the downfalls of technology, but I think the biggest problem with it all is that it takes away the element that makes us human. It truly takes away our connections with others and alludes us in a false sense of connection. We are more connected than ever, but we are feeling more alone:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-loneliness-epidemic-more-connected-than-ever-but-feeling-more-alone-10143206.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-loneliness-epidemic-more-connected-than-ever-but-feeling-more-alone-10143206.html</a></p>

<p>All the technology in the world will not replace that human element of connection that we need. I fear a future where people will be lost in virtual reality, not realizing it is all fake! I do not think we can become gods, as Silva suggests, but maybe the next step is that we are really just becoming robots.</p>

<p>• What if there is a God, and what if there is ONE ultimate God? Wherever you are in your spiritual journey, all of the beliefs mentioned in this post dismiss the possibility that there could be one God, and that worshipping false Gods may not be the way to go. In all of these occult belief systems, everything is worshipped BUT the one God that creates everything. Wherever you are in your spiritual journey, I feel you should look into some of the prophecies of the bible. The bible talks about a one world order and one world false religion. Will this mixture of scientism, artificial intelligence, and worship of self encompass this false religion?</p>

<p>&quot;For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect&quot; (Matthew 24:24).</p>

<p>• Earlier in this post, I mentioned the concept of living forever, which sounds appealing to many, I am sure. I love reading “Tuck Everlasting” with my students. If you have not read the book, the overarching theme is that the cycle of life has a great importance, and though this book is written for children, the author does a great job of providing the downfalls of “physical everlasting life”, no matter how elusive it may seem. At the end of the novel, the main character, Winnie, has a chance to either be with her love, Tuck, forever (where nothing really changes), or death. Tuck sadly visits Winnie’s grave at the end of the novel, and I always shed a tear. </p>

<p>Here are some quotes I think exemplify the importance of the natural life cycle:</p>

<p>“Don&#39;t be afraid of death; be afraid of an unlived life. You don&#39;t have to live forever, you just have to live.” </p>

<p>― Natalie Babbitt, Tuck Everlasting</p>

<p>“Everything&#39;s a wheel, turning and turning, never stopping. The frogs is part of it, and the bugs, and the fish, and the wood thrush, too. And people. But never the same ones. Always coming in new, always growing and changing, and always moving on. That&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be. That&#39;s the way it is.” 
― Natalie Babbitt, Tuck Everlasting</p>

<p>When we take away the cycle of life, we take away what makes life worth living, what makes us human, really. Eerily, the bible says this:</p>

<p>“During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.” Revelation 9:6</p>

<p>Again, I feel the problem here is trying to prolong something that does not need to be prolonged based on, perhaps, fear? We all fear death, but there is beauty in living a good life and being remembered for that. Ernest Hemingway said, &quot;Every man&#39;s life ends the same way. It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another.&quot; </p>

<p>Do you really want to live in a world where we are indistinguishable from one another, in some sort of technological singularity?</p>

<p>Besides, what if there is eternal life BEYOND our physical bodies? Transhumanism denies this possibility. Further, I always entertained a thought that aliens were actually our de-evolved future (Maybe that is why they come back into this time period?) Just a thought 😊</p>

<p><strong>One Final Problem</strong></p>

<p>The new age religion that is emerging says that we are all one and love and stuff. It is all founded on the occult if you really explore it. So, what is wrong with that? I see this belief everywhere in every form of spirituality and even in atheism and agnosticism. The issue with this concept is the problem of evil. I apologize that I am taking this from another post I wrote, but I have been writing this post for hours, and I have written on this subject so much:</p>

<p>**<strong><em>Excerpt</em></strong>**</p>

<p>“<strong>Moral Relativism</strong></p>

<p>Before we can move forward, we have to agree on one point. If all is truly interconnected, then “good” and “bad” are illusions and exist only as illusions or constructs. There are many words for this belief, and many subtle distinctions, that we will go into in a moment. But just to be clear, these systems of belief inspire thought processes that there really is no good or evil. Let me give you an example from a forum on pantheism:</p>

<p>“In Divine Science, my preferred flavor of Pantheism, we don&#39;t believe in evil. There is nothing but omnipresent God/Good; though people certainly commit evil acts. People commit evil acts out of ignorance of their true self, divine good, and therefore don&#39;t act accordingly with who and what they they really are. But when we&#39;re afraid, we have to remember that omnipresent God is everywhere, including with us in that moment, and all is really good. You can change many dangerous and bad circumstances by that realization. :) </p>

<p>So evil is sort of like darkness; not really a substance or a power, just a lack of light, or illusion. Whereas light is genuine power and substance with speed and energy. 
Love and Light, 
Josephv”</p>

<p><a href="http://community.beliefnet.com/go/thread/view/34789/13325889/Pantheism_and_Evil">http://community.beliefnet.com/go/thread/view/34789/13325889/Pantheism_and_Evil</a></p>

<p>This new age belief is nothing new, and in fact, it is the foundation of most occultist beliefs. The checkerboard, for example, is an example of this “necessary” duality:</p>

<p><a href="http://exposingthematrix.blogspot.com/2012/03/masonic-checkerboardduality-symbolism.html">http://exposingthematrix.blogspot.com/2012/03/masonic-checkerboardduality-symbolism.html</a></p>

<p>In other words, “we are all one”, and the good and evil must exist together for this oneness. That sounds profound, but what ultimately, many are saying, is that evil is necessary in this world, and through these beliefs, evil can be justified. Are evil and good intertwined? Do they co-exist in some sort of balanced reality? Is there necessary evil? Is it all wrapped up in some type of loving phenomenon of existence? Well, that may be what Aleister Crowley, Lucifer, and the aliens want you to believe!</p>

<p>Still, I will ALWAYS go back to this argument because I have yet to meet one person who can convincingly argue this one point. Is there pure evil? If so, does that not mean there is a chance that good and evil are NOT intertwined? In other words, is there an objective morality? Here is my question:</p>

<p>Is it ever right to willingly rape a child? </p>

<p>Nobody with any moral compass could ever say it is. That would put this on the “pure evil” end of the spectrum and show that moral relativism, the checkerboard, and the “all is good and love” may not be as great of claims as they appear. Is there an objective morality that exists in our universe? Of COURSE, there are shades of grey, and I am not here to argue that. I am here to argue that good and evil are not intertwined as many may proclaim.</p>

<p>Look, I admit this subject is a little complex and up for debate, but I would like to go into some different belief systems that seem to be preaching that evil just does not really exist (or that is a necessary duality). Now before you argue with me in the comments, see some eerily similarities in the next section:</p>

<p><strong>Belief Systems</strong></p>

<p>Taoism - “To understand the Taoist notion of good and evil, it is important to distinguish between the &quot;concept&quot; of evil versus the &quot;reality&quot; of evil. </p>

<p>As a concept, Taoists do not hold the position of good against evil; rather they see the interdependence of all dualities.&quot;</p>

<p>Buddhism - “In cultures with Buddhist spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving Śūnyatā meaning emptiness in the sense of recognition of good and evil being two opposing principles but not a reality, emptying the duality of them…”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil</a></p>

<p>Pantheism - “Because all things are God, all things are connected and ultimately are of one substance. While various facets of God have defining characteristics (everything from different species to individual people), they are part of a greater whole. As a comparison, one might consider the parts of the human body. Hands are different from feet which are different from lungs, but all are part of the greater whole that is the human form.”</p>

<p>We can find this basic “everything is one” belief with many modern religions, but this is nothing new, as explained earlier.
Aleister Crowley Interestingly, Crowley talked a lot about love and duality, and he was influenced by the ancient mystery schools. He once said,</p>

<p>“I was in the death struggle with self: God and Satan fought for my soul those three long hours. God conquered — now I have only one doubt left — which of the twain was God?” It’s all about that duality!</p>

<p>Manly P. Hall If you have not read the “Secret Teachings of All Ages”, you should probably do that now:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/">http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/</a></p>

<p>Manly P. Hall said, “They wander in darkness seeking light, failing to realize that the light is in the heart of the darkness.” -The Lost Keys of Freemasonry: Or the Secret of Hiram Abiff</p>

<p>Freemasons - You can read all about the Freemasons and duality here:</p>

<p><a href="http://pubs.royle.com/article/Dualism+%26+Its+Symbolism+Within+Freemasonry/1283542/0/article.html">http://pubs.royle.com/article/Dualism+%26+Its+Symbolism+Within+Freemasonry/1283542/0/article.html</a></p>

<p>I can keep doing this all night. Even those who are not spiritual or religious have found beliefs in “scientism” and quantum physics to see how “all is one” and “connected” and there is no pure good or evil.</p>

<p>Look, I am not saying interconnectedness is not real. I am saying that there is something suspicious about the constant push of the belief system that all is good because it exists as a duality. </p>

<p>The question is, what is there is an evil, separateness, and what if people are being deceived?”</p>

<p>**<strong><em>End Excerpt</em></strong>**</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>If you read through this entire post, I really want to thank you. Since it is so long, I want to end simply because this is where I feel our society is at:</p>

<p>2 Timothy 3:
“But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.”</p>

<p>We have a form of Godliness, but I do not think we can become Gods.</p>

<p>Remember, there is nothing new under the sun. Are you being deceived by occult beliefs disguised as progress?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went from an atheist to finding God at the end of the rabbit hole. Only my definition of &quot;God&quot; had very much been redefined, and is not to be confused with the western/patriarchal mainstream Judeo-Christian idea of God.<br/>
God is everything. Literally. The Absolute. Brahman. And as we are a part of this everything, we are a part of God by extention. Like individual fingers are to the whole hand. Like leaves are to the rest of the tree.<br/>
People are misinterpreting what the holy books say about God. It&#39;s not too be taken literally, but metaphorically. The words to truly and accurately describe these concepts don&#39;t really yet exist, so metaphor and simile are required to get the message across at this stage. I came to realise this much easier when I started reading into eastern religion and philosophy like Buddhism, taoism, and Hinduism and I began noticing how they&#39;re much more directly referencing the universe as holographic theory describes (shoutout to <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a>). And then once I took that and reapplied it to the bible and the qu&#39;ran etc it made much more sense. Religion, science, language, art, maths... It&#39;s all describing the same thing. Just through different filters and lenses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your time spent here. Madam Blavatsky warned of the scientism or technology being used as a means in trying to achieve a state beyond material consciousness in much like the ancient mystery schools like in Greek, Britian, Euroupe and the Land of Kem (Egypt). But in a more perverted or twisted view like how the Nazis tried to reach it with their scientists to make superhumans. I laugh because reaching this false state of divinity through technology bounds you in the material world because it&#39;s not innate in how you achieves this state of consciousness you need a tool. Nothing natural about evolving in that manner. An insult to creativite essence in all of us.</p>

<p>As explained in The Meaning of Masonry, by W.L. Wilmshurst:</p>

<p>This—the evolution of man into superman—was always the purpose of the ancient Mysteries, and the real purpose of modern Masonry is, not the social and charitable purposes to which so much attention is paid, but the expediting of the spiritual evolution of those who aspire to perfect their own nature and transform it into a more god-like quality. And this is a definite science, a royal art, which it is possible for each of us to put into practice, whilst to join the Craft for any other purpose than to study and pursue this science is to misunderstand its meaning.[1]</p>

<p>Fuck these followers to this New Age Trans humanism bullshit it&#39;s going to end up being something like <a href="https://roadtovrlive-5ea0.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Mark-Zuckerberg-samsung-gear-vr.jpg">this</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the post, I found it interesting! I had a different thought while reading some of the quotes on oneness. Also I&#39;ve had this same similar observation myself, so it&#39;s very amusing to read Alistair Crowley taking a jab at science for doing what seems to be exactly what he does (&quot;Science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness&quot; - A.C) although I&#39;ve never read anything of his so I&#39;m not sure how much truth is in what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>I have difficulty seeing how from his beliefs on oneness that good and evil does not really matter. I am made up of different parts, which drive my desires but my ability to feel and have regret or guilt means that there must be a distinction between good and evil.</p>

<p>If all makes up a bigger more complex organism, maybe it is the same. At the same time I have no desire to plug my consciousness into a larger consciousness driven by AI or whatever else.</p>

<p>Anyway look at me making a big fuss out of basic observations, almost as bad as a scientist. Appreciate the post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I would like to say <em>great</em> post, as always, and I want to thank you for the time, effort, and mental energy exerted to bring this to completion and for posting it to the sub.</p>

<p>Having read through it, I find myself in agreement with much of what you have said. I&#39;ll try and just point out some remarks on a few areas of the post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you do not know about Jason Silva, you have to watch some of his videos. Though some of you may find him exhilarating, I find him a jumbled mess of hubris and contradictions, disguised as truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to be the trend with <em>all</em> Transhumanists...so terrified of death, so willing to abandon the very things which make us <em>human</em>. I recommend people also read up on Ray Kurzweil, a futurist recently hired by Googles AI department who claims similar things and is a massive advocate of the Singularity. </p>

<p>But concerning the Singularity...why do people believe they will gain anything from it? A merging of man and machine is not a &quot;merger&quot; it is a takeover. It is the domination of the biological by the technological, it is a copy of consciousness, and an artificial extension of life. You will <em>not</em> be you by the end of the process. At best, it will be a digital copy of yourself...and if that&#39;s the case, what&#39;s the point? I don&#39;t care if a copy of myself lives on...if I&#39;m dead I&#39;m dead. </p>

<p>And this concept of death is an important aspect of Humanity. I agree- who <em>really</em> wants to live forever? When you consider the ramifications of it? The <em>reality</em> of it? As it stands now, living forever means a <em>copy</em> of you lives forever, not you. And it means you might even sacrifice what remains of your Humanity to achieve it. Death, and its impending arrival for all of us, is what makes us Human. It&#39;s what makes Artists produce Art, it&#39;s what makes conquerors conquer, it is what makes Architects design, it was what makes Politicians and Leaders strive for a legacy and a better future. Death reminds us that life is fleeting, that we must seize the day, because life <em>is</em> short. I would much rather live to be a 105 y/o with a happy, content life, than a 2,000 y/o computer simulation that thinks its me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, it would be impossible to get into it all, but I will do my best to provide an outline for you to examine yourself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On top of all of your links, I would also like to offer a self-post (which I submitted to your sub ;D) that compiled some other good &quot;primer&quot; links for this subject.</p>

<p>Link- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7bqtia/magick_and_the_occult/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7bqtia/magick_and_the_occult/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technology is not inherently good or bad. Technology has been equated with progress, and I feel people are being deceived. Technology is a tool. I have written A LOT about the downfalls of technology, but I think the biggest problem with it all is that it takes away the element that makes us human. It truly takes away our connections with others and alludes us in a false sense of connection. We are more connected than ever, but we are feeling more alone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely, 100% agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, I will ALWAYS go back to this argument because I have yet to meet one person who can convincingly argue this one point. Is there pure evil? If so, does that not mean there is a chance that good and evil are NOT intertwined? In other words, is there an objective morality? Here is my question:</p>

<p>Is it ever right to willingly rape a child?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use the same test question on people. It isn&#39;t an easily answered one by the moral relativists. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, “we are all one”, and the good and evil must exist together for this oneness. That sounds profound, but what ultimately, many are saying, is that evil is necessary in this world, and through these beliefs, evil can be justified. Are evil and good intertwined? Do they co-exist in some sort of balanced reality?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My thought, building off of some of the questions you raised, is that while Good and Evil are in fact separate, I don&#39;t believe one will ever exist without the other. Why? Because the mere presence of Evil shows the pathway to Good, and there mere presence of Good shows the pathway to Evil. There will always be those, as long as we are flesh and blood, biological Human beings, who see these paths, and those who choose each. While I think theoretically one <em>can</em> exist without the other, I feel that in practice it is almost impossible, at least on the Human stage. I think absolute Good and Evil do exist, but I feel that the mere presence of one brings about the possibility of the other- much like the Light and Dark side of the Force. This doesn&#39;t mean they are equivalent, but it means that in human consciousness the potential for one is always there with the existence of the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi.</p>

<p>That post is very, very in depth, and I found it interesting.</p>

<p>I take from it that you believe that the stakes for Occultism and all the related things are real.</p>

<p>I dabbled in reading about it as a teen in the early days of the internet, in addition to the Satanic Bible and the Temple of Set.  TBH I quickly bored of it all.  At the time I was atheist anyway and this, along with Wicca that was big in the 90’s just seemed like a combination of edgy ness and marketing built on half recovered ancient myths that sought to either explain the universe or create social and political power for the priest class.  (Lol, I was a conspiratorially minded cynic even then.)</p>

<p>I still cannot say that my opinion has changed.  There may be “power” in some of this, but I would argue that ultimate “power” is now known as “marketing” and that the only real ultimate knowledge conceded upon those who “understood” is that the whole thing is bullshit, but if you can take that understanding and make other’s believe you, you can gain power over them.</p>

<p>Hell, maybe that is the satanic magic of it all, to realize that nihilism is power over others.  But I generally look at things from a completely non-mystical earthly perspective and if I can find a complete motive and explanation there, I rule out the need for any additional complications.</p>

<p>I would like your thoughts on that part tbh.</p>

<p>Finally, because I am losing my train of thought and there was <em>a lot</em> to your post, most of which I have only a cursory knowledge of occult wise, I wanted to address the question you pose about good and evil:</p>

<p>I am sure you are aware that most of the balance stuff left mystery schools behind and went mainstream in antiquity with Greek philosophers who essentially argued that without evil as a basis of comparison you could not distinguish good.  Of course there were others that argued we have some innate ability to do so and could recognize good or evil even in the absence of the other.</p>

<p>Anyway, that was a digression.  In terms of Christianity and the Bible, God was all of existence before he said “let there be light”.  That means <em>everything</em> that exists either was part of God or was created by him.  This could be made recursive to say that anything he created was part of him anyway for otherwise God could neither create it or be all-knowing.</p>

<p>So God created everything, including Satan.  By creating Satan in full, Satan’s capacity and destiny to become evil was put in place by God.</p>

<p>Since God created Satan and thus Satan’s evil, then evil is subservient to good for if God is good and God created evil, it is the lesser.  Evil created nothing, thus does not have the power that good has just as God created Satan and thus is more powerful than Satan.  Satan may only challenge God’s authority <em>by</em> God’s authority.</p>

<p>However, for God to be all knowing, then the evil that Satan has could only have been put there by God.  For God to imbue Satan with evil, God must possess evil.  This is where the idea of duality comes from.  Nothing that exists or existed or will exist does so without God’s knowledge and authority.  To rape a child came from God.  If it did not, then the idea or act could not exist.</p>

<p>As a creation of God, evil and even Satan is merely a manifestation of God.  Just as man was made in God’s image, we must be a part of God.  So, it is not a leap to claim cosmic unity.  Nothing can exist that God did not create and to create anything he must possess it.  This is told as being all-knowing and all-powerful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm interesting.</p>

<p>I feel I should note that I am no sort of expert on theology or Christianity or such.  I have spent more time reading philosophy than religion, but I have read some of the Bible as well as various theological tales on applying Christianity to philosophy such as Aquinas (who is always on my “get around to reading more” list) and...  I can’t think of the name, but he is a British contemporary Catholic thinker in that sort of area of study.  I also grew up in a loosely Christian family (as in went to Sunday school as a kid and had children’s bible but later we only occasionally attended church) and had much more religious grandparents from whom I heard religious theory for much longer.</p>

<p>Alright, background aside:</p>

<p>1). I don’t see why it couldn’t, but that really sounds more like the pantheistic or philosophical approach to the problem.  Actually, that sounds a lot like... was it Plato?  I will need to look it up but there is a Greek philosopher who essentially argued that from a non-Christian perspective.</p>

<p>To note, my grandparents were fond of listening to preachers on the radio and I recall one part of a sermon that stuck in my mind as a youngster.  I believe it was from one of those “prosperity doctrine” type mega church guys who essentially said “The classic vision of hell as fire and torture and such isn’t what the real hell is like.  In reality Hell is to be separated from God, to understand the truth and to know his love and to know that you are forever outside of it.”  An interesting take and when considered at length a pretty hellish vision...  psychological torture is the most potent.  This could also be somewhat applied to more new-agey beliefs as well and seems to come equally from Buddhist thought oddly enough.</p>

<p>2) I really haven’t given that idea much thought but, now doing so, don’t give it much credence.  For one, if God created Satan to rid himself of evil, this means that he has given Satan a trait that he does not himself possess.  This would implied that Satan could act beyond God’s authority or power or knowledge since to truly be rid of evil, one could no longer comprehend evil.  You must be able possess the capacity for anything you are able to consider; if you can imagine or conceive of the idea of a person willingly raping a child, or understand that this has taken place, you also have the capacity to rape a child.  </p>

<p>This could be said to define free will.  If you cannot conceive of evil you cannot chose not to do it.  This is also where both the ideas of original sin and the idea of animals not having a soul derive.  The free will is clear.  The animal part considers that animals act without malice or understanding; if a dog rapes or kills a puppy it cannot be said to be evil because the dog has no innate understanding of right or wrong, they are merely driven by animalistic urges.  (Note I don’t necessarily agree with this, we are constantly learning that animals possess far greater cognitive function than we gave them credit for and I think we are <em>still</em> underestimating them.  Cetaceans get the focus, but if you are interested I find elephants <em>far</em> more fascinating because they demonstrate advanced abstract thought and are more readily observed interacting with humans and other animals.)</p>

<p>Further, I would ask, what need would God as described by Christianity have for ridding himself of evil?  He is everything and possesses everything and everything comes from him.  Why, at some point in time, would he decide to remove something from himself?  Of course this leads further to asking why any of God’s actions in the Bible take place, why create the enormous test for man with end times and revelations and all that simply to get to a point he could bring about instantly?  Why allow Satan to betray him?  Or man to fall?  Or earth to exist externally from himself?  You see what I mean?</p>

<p>Perhaps a better way to imagine God’s perspective would be an “inter dimensional” approach as seeing people as a uniform object combining all possible past present and futures as a sort of single thing, I suppose much like a branching tree, yet the single path one takes is the free will you exercise.  This is a sort of quantum mechanics view I guess.  When observed at one point in time all other possible locations would collapse, but if viewed from the perspective of God all other possibilities also still exist.  This can lead to an entire rabbit hole in and of itself as to whether all people on earth are actually a single entity expressed across every dimension and we are in fact all Jesus as the aspect of the son of god...  it resolves the population growth problem of ideas about reincarnation.</p>

<p>Anyway, that is what comes to mind.</p>

<p>Oh, one last thing that comes to mind worth noting is that I think it is a common mistake when considering ancient cultures or beliefs to falsely imagine them as less mentally sophisticated than ourselves.  Technology has grown and with it the vocabulary of words or ideas that we use to express concepts, but our ability to think and the way we think has not become any more sophisticated at all.  It is worth the attempt to look at mystery schools and occultism and religions less as something complete or different and more as ways of explaining things we now understand in different words.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the ultimate reality is a wholeness that encompasses everything which no being is separate from. Evil manifests as the desire towards separateness. I also think that evil entities will misdirect and deceive by abusing new age &quot;oneness&quot; type belief systems. I think the push you&#39;ve seen for this idea of &quot;oneness&quot; is due to a genuine awakening to the reality of it through experiences which seem to have occurred around the 2012 time frame (this type of experience happened for me around that time and I&#39;ve seen others on this forum and others discuss similar experiences). At the same time there is tons of evidence for the hippy movement and new age religions such as theosophy being co opted by various factions through the use of intelligence agencies. All is one does not mean all is good. As the Taoists say, one can only conceive of evil once one has decided something is good.</p>

<p>In my personal experience, the feeling of oneness is neither good nor bad, it just is. Everything is at it is, and all possibilities have existed in some conscious realm of experience. The notions of space and time are foundational yin yang aspects of consciousness, without these we could not conceive of and be talking about existence. This is why these themes are so persistent; its because they are fundamental to our conscious awareness. </p>

<p>We can as a society decide on things that are evil, namely abridging people&#39;s free will through your actions. The golden rule is the embodiment of this morality, but even that can be objected on the grounds that you don&#39;t know how others may wish to be treated. This is where sensitivity to other&#39;s emotions and well being comes from practicing awareness of the self and one&#39;s environment; our interconnectedness and connection to source reality (which I would say where the polarization of good vs evil comes from - wholeness vs separateness) is what allows us greater sensitivity to other&#39;s needs so that we can be that good force in the world. When I think of goodness I tend to think of the love of a mother towards her child, the nourishment of a warm soup after a cold day. These are energizing forces, which are embodiments of source reality - the wellspring of all life and energy. </p>

<p>The physical realm which we have come to play a part in will always have its physical limitations. All will decay into dust, and our lives will cease. However, we are not the bodies! We are part of a much greater reality of which our physical universe is but a tiny part. It is an endless play, and after our death we return to source consciousness. Ultimately the words are paradoxical because it is something that can only be experienced. There both is an absolute notion of good and evil and at the same time they are only relative concepts. The transhumanist belief that we can become gods is only a fantasy - anything we gain through technology must come at a price.  Our illusionary physical selves can by definition never play the role of God, even though our basic nature is God. Even the enlightened master is subject to limitations of the flesh - it is the consciousness of such an individual that is expanded to encompass the whole which allows the perspective of God. This one is truly free in the sense that they have shed the notion of the separate egoic self in favor of the reality of oneness - and thus their only remaining purpose for physical existence is to help others along the path towards such awareness.</p>

Our third dimensional existence is fundamentally rooted in duality and the fact is that without &quot;evil&quot;, we have no basis or conception of what &quot;good&quot; is. Now, whether pure &quot;good&quot; or pure &quot;evil&quot; exists has been debated for ages and it doesn&#39;t seem likely that there ever will be an absolute consensus because these are not tangible things, they are abstract subjective concepts and every single person will have a differing opinion on what constitutes good or evil. 
This does not mean that we are inherently justified in doing evil but that evil as it stands is an unavoidable fact of our existence.

<p>I won&#39;t even get into the numerous logical and philosophical problems of the christian worldview but at the very least, where is your evidence of this ONE TRUE GOD that you claim and why do you believe that for some reason the god of the bible is any more real than gods of other religions and where has he been for the last 2000 years? And if your god has created an environment where evil is not only possible, but unavoidable doesn&#39;t that place the responsibility for its existence on his shoulders? After all, you didn&#39;t ask to be born (as far as you know) into this fucked up world where children are raped and entire populations are brutally exterminated, so why are you so devoted to a god who somehow controls all of this and allows it to keep happening?</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to address your idea of us becoming gods. Your own bible states that we are created in the image of god. What does that mean to you? We literally are on the brink of entering a new stage in human evolution where we have the technology to rewrite our own genetic sequence and create artificial intelligence. That is god like power in any sense of the word. Of course, like you said, technology in itself is neutral but how we use it can have either positive or negative outcomes obviously. The fact is, we are already becoming gods and we will need to navigate through the new moral and sociological dilemmas that these powerful abilities present to us, not by cling to outdated mythologies but by realizing and perfecting our own divine potential in a clear-minded and rational manner. </p>

That is god like power in any sense of the word. Of course, like you said, technology in itself is neutral but how we use it can have either positive or negative outcomes obviously. The fact is, we are already becoming gods and we will need to navigate through the new moral and sociological dilemmas that these powerful abilities present to us, not by cling to outdated mythologies but by realizing and perfecting our own divine potential in a clear-minded and rational manner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a bit old, but I still wished to give my piece on the &quot;one true god&quot; questions you brought up. I&#39;m not christian and I detest nearly every form of religious dogma in practice today. Though, I am spiritual, I believe in a Father of the All (one true god), and I have a great feeling of love and respect for Jesus.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think He is in direct control of the world. I think He is very far away dimensionally -- and it would take great effort to reach the plane where He dwells. Actually, dwells isn&#39;t right, I think He encompasses this realm entirely. Its a place of Rest. He is not an active god who meddles in the affairs of this world. He did not create the material earth -- that would be His feminine aspect, who is involved still in our world. She resides, at least partially, in the moon and is responsible mostly for the reincarnation of human souls.</p>

<p>She used His creative power unbeknownst to Him and created this world. He saw the creation as flawed, but saw hope in the human race who carried His light in them. From then on He extended his love towards His light so that it might return to him. This is His only intervention on our world -- a frequency of love for us, or the part of us that is Him.</p>

<p>So, to answer your question He did not create this, therefore there is no burden. Yet we are connected by His light inside of our spirit. The reason He doesn&#39;t intervene in the entropy and struggle of this planet is because firstly, He doesn&#39;t need to. We are fully capable of flourishing spiritually and reaching Him ourselves, as Jesus did. Secondly, He likely wants us to develop more. This is why his feminine aspect reincarnates us -- so we can grow spiritually. Thirdly, it is likely His endgame, so as long as there is hope there is no need to intervene. Really all of our suffering is laughable in the grand scheme of what is happening. Yet while we are here it feels much more important and real, and that is why Jesus wept -- not for his own suffering but in witnessing how deeply pain is felt on the human level, not only physically but emotionally.</p>

<p>You may have wondered my use of gender in referring to the divine, I think this is a limitation of conceptual language and our referential perspective. He is He because he embodies a paternal role -- He creates but He is detached. His feminine aspect physically creates and She can&#39;t help but be attached. Both have great love for us, but very different roles in loving.</p>

<p>I would just like to say, even though this has likely fallen on deaf ears considering its a reply to a comment on a post a month old. I do not claim to know any of this for certain and would not wish to impose my view with zeal, but merely intellectually as I am very fascinated with this subject. It is a working thesis so to speak, and I am always testing my beliefs, adding and subtracting to them based on my own intuition of what I feel is the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are God. Experiencing what it&#39;s like to act as a human. You are only as stuck as your mind assumes to be. No need to fear your Self. There&#39;s only One Being in the UNIverse. You (We) are that Being, intelligently &quot;split&quot; into &quot;souls&quot; (Soles - &quot;ones&quot;), so We/It can experience others or other &quot;selves&quot;. It&#39;s All the same player, with different masks playing different characters. </p>

<p>Now, as the only Being in existence, would it not be wise to love yourself, and all &quot;other selves&quot;? Why fear other selves? Reality is a mirror; if you fear your other selves, they (we) have no choice but to reflect that. If you love your other selves and the experience of existence, then your reality will reflect that vibration. </p>

<p>That&#39;s knowledge that can cancel out any fear-based thinking your mind may project onto your experience. Just choose what you love and choose thoughts that support your well-being. Treat other selves the way you want to be treated. That&#39;s it. Empathy. Period.</p>

<p>The highest form of intelligence is discerned empathy: Compassion  </p>

<p>You are the Creator (training wheels included)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If God = &quot;everything ever&quot; then by extension, since you are a part of that &quot;everything&quot;, you are God.<br/>
A leaf is a leaf. But it&#39;s also the tree by extension. Just as the cells in the leaf contain the DNA to be able to reconstruct the rest of the tree, we contain the &quot;DNA&quot; (the spirit/consciousness) that can reflect the rest of the entire universe. It just takes looking at it from the right perspective and with the right equipment (be that maths, art, literature, science, psychedelics, meditation, etc - take your pick). There is God-potential within all things that exist.<br/>
Sure, from a 3d perspective at a particular given time and place we&#39;re <em>just</em> a human. Limited. But over <strong>time</strong> (from a 4d perspective), factoring in <strong>possibility and probability</strong> (5d), and furthermore factoring in the respective corresponding properties of each higher dimension as you go up you come to realise that the potential becomes infinite. As God is infinite.<br/>
That&#39;s at least how I interpret the statement &quot;you are God&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really enjoyed what you&#39;ve shared here. Thank you for taking the time to post it. It&#39;s thoughtful and thought provoking, and I hope more people will take the time to read through it all. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t understand anyone&#39;s desire to live here on this planet forever. It is beautiful, but it&#39;s also tragic. And there really is nothing to fear in death. It is a natural progression. This body is just a vehicle for this time we have here. It&#39;s no more frightening to step out of it than it is to step out of your car when you arrive at your destination. We won&#39;t need this body where we&#39;re going next. And I&#39;m telling you that from personal experience. It&#39;s really not frightening at all. I kind of hesitate to say this, as I don&#39;t want some younger person taking this the wrong way and thinking it would be better to end it all early if they&#39;re having a hard time at the moment. Because we&#39;re here to learn. And I think what we&#39;re here to learn is something as simple as to love one another. God isn&#39;t some angry being just looking to smite everyone. Just relax a bit and start seeking. You&#39;ll find what you need. It&#39;s not meant to be hidden from anyone. It&#39;s a journey of love and discovery. I think you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head about the way some people are hoping to use tech as people used to, and some still do, hope to use the occult to extend their lives or live forever. But it&#39;ll come to nothing either way, because they&#39;re both selfish paths. You don&#39;t want to take a dark path because that way is self-destructive. Aleister Crowley is the best example for us of that.</p>

<p>We&#39;re born, we live and we leave when it&#39;s our time to make way for the next generations. I&#39;ve never looked at this life as the be all and end all. It&#39;s more of a stop on your way to eternity. It&#39;s a learning experience. Every single person you meet in this life is already an eternal being. The only question is, where will they choose to spend it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I commend you for your willingness to explore these subjects.  The spiritual pathway is the most important path that a person can walk.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m of the belief that it&#39;s an intensely personal matter, which is why I have a hard time joining a Church, group, religion, etc.  It&#39;s also why I try not to judge what others are doing.  &quot;God works in mysterious ways&quot; as they say.</p>

<p>Apparently there are many different sources of &quot;New Age&quot; teachings, and different ideas of what a new age would look like.  From what I have read and gathered, the new age will be one of spirit, where we are no longer bound by biological bodies.  Like you, I find the idea of transhumanism to be lacking, and possibly short sighted.  It&#39;s almost like one is willingly locking their spirit into matter for an indefinite amount of time.  I am much more intrigued by the possibility of living as spirit not bound by fleshly desires etc.  I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s anything wrong with being a human, I just don&#39;t want to be one forever.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to note that the Bible refers to eternal life many times.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be sure, then, to keep in your hearts the message you heard from the beginning. If you keep that message, then you will always live in union with the Son and the Father. And this is what Christ himself promised to give us—eternal life. (1 John 2:24-25)</p>

<p>For what my Father wants is that all who see the Son and believe in him should have eternal life. And I will raise them to life on the last day. (John 6:40)</p>

<p>For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to be its judge, but to be its savior. (John 3:16-17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s many more.  It&#39;s clear that the Bible cites eternal life as something that can be attained.  </p>

<p>Finally, I understand your hesitation about humans becoming one with God.  I believe your reservation is a sign of humility and also reverence.  A willingness to see that Humans maybe aren&#39;t perfect, whereas God is.  Here&#39;s an interesting verse that to me validates the idea that my soul/spirit/self can and will merge with God in Eternity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him.  1 Corinthians 6:17</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds wonderful doesn&#39;t it!  Personally I believe that in God&#39;s mind is a perfect version of everyone.  It is through our own personal shortcomings and tainted perception that we do not actualize this perfect essence.  Christ, as well as many others, have given us pointers to returning to our true essence. May you and everyone else return to theirs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You managed to wrap up an impressive number of non Abrahamic religions and hermetic/alchemical traditions with your legitimate concerns for the rising issue of transhumanism. The latter I also feel is dangerous, to me the crucial element missing from the ancient traditions you mention is the axiomatic status that reductionism and materialism hold in modern society.  </p>

<p><em>e.g. the reduction of consciousness to that of a mechanism, something which I don&#39;t believe is common in hermetic traditions but is foundational for transhumanism.</em></p>

<p>Personally I have gained far more <strong>applicable</strong> knowledge from the Gnostic and non-Abrahamic faiths (particularly Taoism and the various alchemical traditions) than I have from the bible (which is the only abrahamic text I&#39;m even passingly familiar with). I don&#39;t see how you can claim Gnostic faith has no belief in a universal God when the concept of the Monad i.e. the Primal Father is so prominent in many gnostic cults? Even one of the definitions of gnosis is given as the process by which one may reunite their soul with the Monad.</p>

<p>I read all of your post which I had not happened to have read already and I found it articulate and well cited as well as educational, the parallels you draw are very real. That being said I&#39;m afraid your personal faith (which I can only presume to be Abrahamic and most likely Christian) is causing the &quot;ancient occultism&quot; to inherently aquire a dangerous role. From a societal perspective the genesis story was being written for an audience that had neighbors on all sides (Babylon, Egypt, etc...) who in many ways formed the seed of what became the gnostic tradition, so to me it wouldn&#39;t be suprising to find biblical denouncements of the competing religions of the day.</p>

<p>Either way I whole heartedly agree with your analysis of transhumanism and it&#39;s dangers but I&#39;m afraid the connection of this modern danger with some inherent danger in occult/gnostic/alchemical thought has the critical prerequisite of one belonging to an abrahamic faith were these things are deemed evil a-priori. </p>

<p>To me the real evil of the modern incarnation of these beliefs are the axiomatic role of materialism and reductionism: these are enemies of all religions to some degree.</p>

<p>Fair critique.  I think the connection is those who hold and preserve the occult knowledge base are pushing transhumanism on those who are unaware of occult knowledge.</p>

<p>The pushers are for sure aware that transhumanism is a reductionist and materialistic movement.  It&#39;s why they like it for the rest of us.</p>

<p>There is nothing inherently &quot;dangerous&quot; about occult knowledge.  I think the word would be &quot;powerful.&quot;  Occult knowledge is powerful.  Just so happens that today that power is in the control of those who do not wish to share it (thus, dangerous).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m intrigued. Read your post and all of the comments here.</p>

<p>One thing I have to say is this... What if the merger of biology and technology turned out to be the means by which humans broke the cycle? As in, “found God” or were freed from the confines of existence as we know it (reached heaven, from a Christian perspective).</p>

<p>I don’t know, I don’t like religion but am attuned to the idea of spirituality. Personally, I think reincarnation is real. Hence the whole “breaking the cycle” thing. I don’t believe in hell as eternal damnation for sinners after death. I believe souls are recycled. One interesting thing about Buddhism is that it speaks not only of the realms of rebirth on Earth but also within different planes of existence and throughout the universe. I think that if we can believe what science has determined about the universe and trust: a.) that the things that exist outside of this planet or within different dimensions of “time/space” are real and b.) that there’s so much more out there that we know nothing of/can’t study or comprehend, Christianity starts to sound pretty foolish.</p>

<p>Moral relativism is a tricky subject because there isn’t a clear answer and there never will be; most actions don’t approach the extremities of the spectrum (pure good/pure evil, where it becomes impossible to be subjective). Yes, there are purely evil actions. The definition of “evil,” to me, is any action that ignores the autonomy of another being, or transgresses the “greater good” of the collective consciousness, in pursuit of satisfaction for the acting individual. People are capable of utilizing their existence to commit harmful, unethical, compassionless “crimes” against others’ humanity (and their own). Those people will suffer for it, on this planet or possibly after death. None of us can say for sure what’s going to happen.</p>

<p>I don’t know, I feel like I can’t talk about this because of my personal beliefs and bias and the fact that I know nothing and neither does anyone else. Your post was thought-provoking but the fact that your bias is clear makes it kind of a moot point. In the end, your reluctance towards transhumanism is influenced by your belief system and so are the connections you drew to “occultism,” which literally is just another way to say “none of the religions or belief systems that apply to ‘REALITY’ or what I believe to be the truth.”</p>

<p>So bringing it back to the question that I asked in an effort to make a little bit of something out of my ramblings... Throwing away all of the notions that you’ve formulated about the dangers of humanity being enhanced by technology based on what you can perceive or conclude in this place and time as a result of your experiences and your beliefs, what if it ended up being the key to your “heaven” or some other form of heaven/paradise/nirvana that might transcend this planet or even this universe? (Holy run-on... I like words.)</p>

<p>Yes most things dont fall on greater end of each spectrum, but some things do - and people often ignore the concept of evil which is dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no proof for your beliefs either. No one can prove anything, I feel like I said that at least once.</p>

<p>What evidence do I have that reincarnation is real? Maybe past-life recollection? There&#39;s no concrete evidence but I&#39;m not the first person to feel it or believe that it&#39;s true. I&#39;m partial to Eastern religions. Bias. Said that too. Also, in this same paragraph I talked about science and the universe and how existence expands beyond the confines of this planet. What evidence do I have for that? Are you joking? I even said IF we can believe science... Your religion assumes that humanity is chained to this planet forever. Why would God create WAY more than this if we (potentially and &quot;Christian&quot;-ly, the only intelligent lifeforms in space) would never see any of it?</p>

<p>Like a true Christian, I think you don&#39;t really want to discuss anything. I&#39;m talking about hypotheticals and all you want is &quot;proof&quot; and &quot;evidence,&quot; which is paradoxical considering that you&#39;re citing the bible. I try not to confine my mind and that&#39;s why I have a hard time talking to people who subscribe fully to belief systems because they think it says something about their morals or because they consider it &quot;truth.&quot;</p>

<p>No one knows the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, I should have known this was all going to boil down to Christianity. Which is just another mental-box, but one built especially for the Western mind. And I also tire of people lumping all that is &#39;not-Christianity&#39; into one big bowl of porridge, and say &quot;They don&#39;t believe in pure evil, so BEWARE!!1!&quot; Sheesh, that Christian mindset..</p>

<p>Born into a roman-catholic family, I&#39;ll just say the closest thing I&#39;ve ever experienced to evil came from that church, as many others can attest. Not going there,  I am just so grateful I am completely disconnected from that slave-mind belief system.</p>

<p>And I also don&#39;t appreciate when people try to smear Hermeticism, &amp; claim there is something evil about noticing obvious facts of nature, such as that many things about humans, our world &amp; our universe have a built-in, fundamental <em>duality</em>.. it&#39;s just fucking nature, people. I won&#39;t even go into all the different examples of ebb &amp; flow, day &amp; night, breathing in &amp; out, sleep/awake, two poles to every planet/star/galaxy, positive &amp; negative electrical charge, the list goes on &amp; on ad infinitum. It&#39;s <em>just nature</em>, nothing creepy about it.  That the bible has made people quiver in fear at such a basic understanding &amp; observation of our natural world around them is one testament among many of how that religion has warped the mental capacity of the species, as well as obfuscating our obvious connection to the natural world.</p>

<p>Hermeticism is far older than the Abrahamic religions, &amp; all it really purports to do is give people an understanding of the layout of their world and themselves, as they are fundamentally connected. Because we live in a mentally-created realm, it is fractal by design, hence the nature of the universe has repeated patterns, designs &amp; formats that exist in all classes of phenomena, from the most macro to the most sub-Planck and beyond, in both directions. It is literally never-ending, like a Mandelbrot Set.  Included in this is the nature of living things, and especially free-willed sentient living things (people). True Hermeticists do NOT worship this original-thinking Mind, because they do not perceive that it wants or demands that (unlike the gods invented by ancient tribal elders). They do however have deep &amp; utter appreciation for the majesty of the creation &amp; believe that we all are essentially a nano-fractal of this original-imaginer of Reality, via our capacity to think, imagine &amp; be creative, &amp; so they believe their best form of appreciation is to discover their natural gifts &amp; inclinations, endlessly refine them &amp; live as best they can. <em>That is the backbone of Hermeticism!</em> </p>

<p>Admittedly there is not some rock-solid moral code built in to Hermeticism, just like there isn&#39;t one built into nature. People will do with their belief systems whatever they allow themselves to do, just like Christians have allowed the Inquisition &amp; the Crusades. It was culturally acceptable for them to behave that way at that time. Thankfully they are not quite as outwardly violent, as the societies that still practice Christianity have become predominantly middle-class, which typically &#39;tranquilizes&#39; the desire &amp; acceptance for mass violence/atrocity in their societies. Islamic countries as a whole aren&#39;t there yet, in fact there is still mass poverty, so their cultural openness to violence is still strong. There are many other cultural elements at play with these Persian societies, not going into it here..</p>

<p>So yes, there inevitably will be &#39;bad&#39; people who use knowledge &amp; beliefs derived from the Hermetic understanding, to empower themselves, do harm and of course take it too far. But there is nothing in Hermeticism that demands that, unlike with the Abrahamic religions, where so many scriptures can be twisted into doing so. Some with not much twisting required. Most secret societies in the early years were just a place of refuge for intelligent men to come together &amp; discus Hermetic ideas &amp; philosophy without being burned on a fucking stake (though I do believe that over the centuries, these organizations have been infiltrated &amp; turned bad by the worst of humanity, and are now a shadow of their former selves.. ironically the same way that most world-religions have, hell just look at the Vatican). </p>

<p>True Hermeticists wind up being peaceful, wise &amp; deep. They appreciate the creator in such a powerful &amp; profound way, but they are typically quiet about it, as it is a personal journey &amp; are definitely not evangelical about it. Their ability to vibrate with extreme, daily gratitude is on a whole different level. It&#39;s not perfunctory or mandatory, they are not fulfilling codes of conduct, reciting poetic verses, genuflecting on command, or other mindless, meaningless, repetitive nonsense. They tap into a greater understanding &amp; appreciation of reality that is so profound it---   Look, the only modern theory that remotely picks up on Hermeticism, would be the Holofractal Unified Theory of Nassim Haramein. Definitely not Transhumanism lol.</p>

<p>Please stop lumping basic Hermetic philosophy in with all that other nonsense. It is not even remotely lucifarian, sanatic, or any other silly depiction of a comic-book villain super-bad-guy.  This planet has FAR more to fear from the zealots of the 3 Abrahamic religions, those people are <em>truly scary</em>.</p>

<p>Great, I wrote a fucking book when I just meant to write a paragraph. I just get so tired of this shallow fear-porn about a beautiful, powerful philosophy (NOT a religion), that makes far more sense of the world &amp; ourselves, than anything else written  since then.</p>

<p>Many people post on this subreddit from your point of view. I wanted to provide the alternative viewpoints.</p>

<p>As shown in your post, people do not really like Christianity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting stuff, my personal belief is that people should live and die - attempts to extend life at the expense of young life (what under-regulated market capitalism has done to this world, folks in USA get pumped full of pills to live forever even through sloven lifestyle, children across the world die of starvation and simple illness) is morally and wrong and should be punished.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, you could have gone deeper with references but it nicely turned out more of opinion with some citation. I agree with the main point through as this is exactly what I&#39;m researching, finding people to discuss esoteric christianity with can be a pain though.</p>

<p>Transhumanism is the selfish desire to place mankind above his own limit. The romantic notion that our thoughts, ideas, creative works and opinions place us as anywhere near godhood is laughable. These notions are made by narcissistic people, pushed forward as &#39;awakenings&#39; and explained away as &#39;progress&#39;. </p>

<p>They are clever though, placing the tray of infinite knowledge and immortality with technology in front of you, bewildered you aren&#39;t jumping at the chance to join the new age of mankind. At least to those that understand the true value behind systems like that. No more individual, only group hivemind of progress, progress, progress. I scorn the day the mark is forced upon nations for &#39;progress&#39;.</p>

<p>Humanity is sadly ready to give up the God concept, you almost cannot blame them. See the normalization (or Hypernormalization) of tragedy, death, poverty and war. The fear is pumped in, the despair is maintained and the control monitored. </p>

<p>But there is light out there, people are waking up, when the issue affects them personally and reality really hits, people will sit back and think. I&#39;ve seen this with some closed minded friends, even other forums. We must not give up our quest for truth and knowledge, Bill Cooper always reminded us to have our facts straight, because they cannot defeat the truth. So we&#39;ll keep learning, until the point comes that we need to defend our faith and family from persecution.</p>
