       every famous rap artist can be pointed to as enlightening people to the culture of being intentially held down and they should rise up etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean really.  Pick one.  You can point to at least a handful of their songs that ring to that tune.  It's pretty much a staple of rap and hip hop music.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean even fucking Macklemore has songs that could point to black/minority empowerment and he's a white guy.

       Do governments hate it?  I doubt it it bothers them much.

       The government isn't quite the right term for this. This is bigger than the government. You are talking about the people that actually
       <em>
        control
       </em>
       the government as well as the entertainment industry. And the answer is yes- but not just for black people. They hate
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       artist that begins to use their platform to spread messages of real change. That's why they either get bought out with a record deal, blacklisted from radio play spots, or murdered.

       Tupac was targeted by the FBI not because he was woke.
because of his family tree (Black Panthers) and they were afraid that his THUG LIFE movement would become the "New Black Panthers"

       They pushed the narrative of Thug Lyfe. Tupac was classically trained and moving towards a movement of peace and activism, not thuggery. His murder and posthumous albums pushed that narrative.

       Nah... are you crazy? how are you thinking now? Suge knight is a HUGE guy do you really think he would be sitting next to Tupac when the car is being sprayed by a .40 Caliber glock?

       and Suge was powerful back in the days, if he wanted Tupac dead he could've done it without risking getting killed himself. THINK!

       To be honest with you, i think he was planning it! listen carefully to his lyrics. i think he was planning to fake his death, but he did that misstake in Vegas and stomped a Crip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not any Crip, he stomped the Compton South Side Crips leaders nephew, Orlando "Baby lane" anderson. That guy was a known shooter and was being investigated for murder.

       Modern rap, go look at SoundCloud artist who are the new thing..
      </p>
      <p>
       Is full of occultic and satanic referance now...I think they moved it from rock as that faded out of popularity. A lot of these guys have tattoos with satanic ect and songs about it, and totally glorifying things like zanax...even though one of them recently died from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Old school rappers who have spoke out against that stuff, are shut up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or like jay z they become apart of it
They own every genre of music...

       I think so, black ppl are the easiest group to manipulate in America. Democrats in particular would be screwed with actual woke black ppl.

       Tupac made everyone “awake” not just one group of people. His songs and poems had actual meaning and he spoke out against corruption. But it was all about coming together and unifying against the crappy people at the top, not just black power. That’s what makes him the best rapper of all time in my opinion
