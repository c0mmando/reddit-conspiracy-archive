    <div class="md"><p>Things you’ve spoken about and googled are likely to have been shared with advertising agencies. As far as things youve only thought about, its more likely pattern recognition. Like when you buy a new car and all of a sudden you start seeing that same model everywhere, it was already there but now you’re acknowledging it because it has significance to you.

    <div class="md"><p>Ermm, let&#39;s see. I&#39;ll try.</p>

<p>I frequently browse websites like Amazon and craigslist. It&#39;s very strange that whenever I do this, and then I go to another site, I&#39;ll get ads about nearly identical things. And this has been going on for months for me. I&#39;ve also noticed that I will begin to think about things, or I will notice something for the first time, and then it will start showing up everywhere. </p>

<p>Concerning my prior warning, I have no doubt that we are constantly being monitored. Everything on the internet is somehow traceable, so it almost goes without saying that this will relate to things that are not shopping. Say, you recently looked at a tutorial on how to fix a skateboard. Suddenly, you see advertisements for skateboard parts, skate shops, etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s blindly accepting things that is the worst. The reason the vast majority shrugs this otherwise terrifying thing off as nothing, is because its <em>convenient</em>, and that&#39;s all that matters. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very strange. I do not fancy the idea of being monitored for profit. It&#39;s only a gateway to much worse things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in that case, it would imply that they heavily monitor you and can formulate predictions as to what you might think of next. Psychology has a huge part in marketing and advertising, so I could only assume that patterns are being formulated to best appeal to your interests. </p>

<p>I know exactly what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;ve thought of stuff before and within days have ads about those things. It&#39;s creepy, and I suggest keeping an eye on it, maybe try to dig deeper into it. Do a little homework and see if it happens to others, try and figure out any patterns/things in common. </p>

<p>Best of luck to you, and I apologize for being unable to help you further.</p>

I would like to know how its being done... I guess knowing why would be important as well.  It&#39;s just strange, and confusing especially because the ads are trying to be helpful.

    <div class="md"><p>No.  ok here is an example but not the actual situation.
I have a computer unaffiliated with my identity in anyway.
I buy airplane ticket using device on grid.  On the computer suddenly my ads change to things to do in London.  When I never exhibited any interest in traveling to London before.  Or say I&#39;m having panic attacks, I will be offered counseling or medical or dietary things for it.    Again these are examples of what the off grid device would now show more commonly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The computer and device being in physical proximity is enough for the ad service to make the connection that it likely owned by the same person or somebody else might want to take that trip with you.</p>

<p>As for mental issues, you should look up the story about Target knowing a girl was pregnant before she did. Something you googled ticked a check mark for other individuals experiencing those thoughts, even if the google search isn’t directly related to those kinds of thoughts. Simply collating music tastes or something can be enough.</p>

<p>They know <em>everything</em>, and if a computer is connected to a network in any way, identity sealed or not, the location tells all that needs knowing.</p>

<p>Really, in a way, the location services is the strongest part of these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only other explanation is that you have searched for things that are related to your specific ailment. Search companies like Google have insane amount of information and they are constantly studying that information and creating algorithms. With all the data they have its likely they can predict things about you based on what you search and say or buy without you saying exactly what it is based on the data they have gathered on billions of others.

    <div class="md"><p>I think they have that capability. Think about the sheer amount of data they have. Each person they survey is another chance to further perfect their algorithms and better its accuracy. They probably have billions of people worth of unique data and they aren&#39;t just going to sit idly by with that data. They have some of the best minds in the world at their respective fields working for them and companies like Google have generally funded far reaching R and D projects. Its probably more powerful and sophisticated than most people understand by now with what it can predict or even change. I don&#39;t know if its as smooth as you put it but generally I think they have the capability to recognize that habits x,y, and z increase the likelihood of A to so and so percent. So they will take a chance and see if they connect with a targeted ad or suggestion. </p>

<p>Yes, its scary what they can do with the information they have especially since they are probably exploring every single angle thoroughly. </p>

<p>There may be something missing from your profile that is more telling then what you google. You can target ads for things people don’t like or don’t have.... it might be a coincidence that you are actually thinking about this thing though. Or they’ve tapped your neurotransmitters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>why dont you use an ad blocker?</p>

<p><a href="https://adnauseam.io/">https://adnauseam.io/</a> is dope as fuck. </p>

<p>it hides the ads from you, but it also sends fake clicks in the background. this does a few things. </p>

<p>a) wastes the advertisers money. showing ads doesnt cost a ton, but they pay A LOT for when people actually click the ads. </p>

<p>b) since you are &quot;clicking&quot; ALL the ads, it starts to screw with their demographic data of who you are. normally, they can guess your age, gender, and some interests based on history, but when you just click on everything, they dont know what to think. your basically both genders, all ages, interested in everything, and so on. its like if several people in a family or a bunch of roomates all shared the same computer. </p>

<p>now, it blocks most of the ads anyways, but its nice that the few that get through are just random shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ermm, let&#39;s see. I&#39;ll try.</p>

<p>I frequently browse websites like Amazon and craigslist. It&#39;s very strange that whenever I do this, and then I go to another site, I&#39;ll get ads about nearly identical things. And this has been going on for months for me. I&#39;ve also noticed that I will begin to think about things, or I will notice something for the first time, and then it will start showing up everywhere. </p>

<p>Concerning my prior warning, I have no doubt that we are constantly being monitored. Everything on the internet is somehow traceable, so it almost goes without saying that this will relate to things that are not shopping. Say, you recently looked at a tutorial on how to fix a skateboard. Suddenly, you see advertisements for skateboard parts, skate shops, etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s blindly accepting things that is the worst. The reason the vast majority shrugs this otherwise terrifying thing off as nothing, is because its <em>convenient</em>, and that&#39;s all that matters. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very strange. I do not fancy the idea of being monitored for profit. It&#39;s only a gateway to much worse things.</p>
