       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a reality crafted through bullshittery; one scripted deception after another. We are duped by the concept of
       <em>
        democracy
       </em>
       into choosing between our
       <em>
        misleaders
       </em>
       , with our votes displaying our
       <em>
        devotion
       </em>
       to the system of free-ranged slavery. Each face scraped of any sign of individuality, raw to the neck-flesh. Every neck sutured with a suit and tie; the collar and leash we brandish with pride of our slave roles, display our
       <em>
        team colours
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is
       <em>
        all bullshit
       </em>
       and we
       <em>
        all know this
       </em>
       . It begins with what we
       <em>
        call things
       </em>
       , the definitions we accept. We call the
       <em>
        misleaders
       </em>
       leaders. We call the
       <em>
        enemy building the gates
       </em>
       big brother. We call the willfully soulless
       <em>
        successful
       </em>
       . We
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       this is all bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       , for all it could
       <em>
        potentially
       </em>
       be, is one institution guilty of gutting itself of any sense of
       <em>
        semiotic consonance
       </em>
       in the very definitions it accepts. We can begin with the statement of intent of the sub itself:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public's imagination...
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a
       <em>
        bullshit
       </em>
       statement that begins from an emasculated position of uncertainty and subservience. None of the prime topics of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       <em>
        occur
       </em>
       in "the public's imagination," but in the very
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       world that we collectively inhabit.
       <em>
        Conspiracies
       </em>
       do not concern subjective interpretations on "imagined" events, but concrete malefactions for which we have ample evidence in the public sphere, and yet are never prosecuted or investigated for whatever reason.
       <em>
        Conspiracies
       </em>
       refer to the conspiracy to maintain the illusion itself, and almost
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       involve the parties or "authorities" responsible for exposing such misdeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       <em>
        deserves
       </em>
       a statement of intent befitting of the goals of
       <em>
        exposing the lies and semiotic dissonance
       </em>
       at its core. I propose:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The
        <em>
         inversion
        </em>
        that we live within has many lines of defense to maintain it, and many useful idiots who see that it is maintained.
        <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
         /r/Conspiracy
        </a>
        is a place
        <em>
         designed
        </em>
        to be able to discuss and expose the intricate nature of such malefactions, regardless of the perpetrator. In order to create the conditions necessary for the goal of shining a light into all hidden places, respect is expected on all sides of any discussions. Our goals are a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Additionally, I feel that all of the
       <em>
        rules
       </em>
       would be better framed in terms of
       <em>
        goals
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        mission statements
       </em>
       that have conditions which provide the grounds of their possibility. I propose:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        We overstand that we are all in this together, and as such, expect certain community standards that can be summarised by the
        <em>
         Golden Rule
        </em>
        : Treat others with respect and avoid debates devolving into insults; personal insults or attacks of any variety will not be tolerated.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        We overstand that
        <em>
         they
        </em>
        are
        <strong>
         all
        </strong>
        corrupt, and we are not interested in your petty professional wrestling. We are interested in shining our light on those
        <em>
         behind the curtains
        </em>
        , pulling the strings. Partisan political posts will not be tolerated.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        We overstand our role – each and every one – in creating the world
        <em>
         we want
        </em>
        , and we ask the same of everyone who participates in this community. As such, we expect a certain measure of quality of all contributions, explaining your position clearly and without prejudice. Link posts will no longer be accepted without an accompanying submission statement (as per the recent sticky post). We ask that you search for topics before submitting a new post, in an effort to foster debate that will move us all forward. We are all in this together.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Ultimately, we need to
       <em>
        flip
       </em>
       the entire
       <em>
        ethos
       </em>
       surrounding the idea of
       <em>
        conspiracy theorists
       </em>
       to one of – not private – but public, open source investigators. This should begin from a position of acknowledging that our
       <em>
        regulators
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        misleaders
       </em>
       are simply doing a shit job, and should all be fired (from artillery), and offering specific proofs or indications pertaining to each issue that is being ignored by those whose responsibility it is to address. We begin, instead, from the position of:
       <em>
        "Since those in charge of exposing these issues are clearly complicit, if not outright involved, it is up to us as individuals to expose both the crimes and those responsible for covering them up."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       We define what is worthy of public open source investigation based on bipartisan evidence as the first test of legitimacy. 
The second required direction is in
       <em>
        tying it all in to the larger picture
       </em>
       for others. This would require considered and considerate comments left on every post, explaining the players and history involved, and how this
       <em>
        fits into the larger systemic deception
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: a user makes a posts concerning narcopharma/poisons in food/makeup/household products. A top comment to this would include a summary of publically recorded legal payouts for victims by the same or related industries (as
       <em>
        proof
       </em>
       of the legitimacy of the investigations which are being stifled), followed by a summary of
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       this is being done to people. In this instance, they are
       <em>
        knowingly
       </em>
       poisoning us with various natural and industrial waste products, with the intent to keep everyone sick for life, with the same families, fraternities, companies and financial interests responsible for both the poison and the "cure." It does not suit the interests of our misleaders that we are healthy, or of sound body and mind: they wish to keep us sick and confused – just smart enough to make the mcnuggets and just stupid enough to eat them. Another example being that it has been common knowledge since the 1920s that hydrated magnesium silicate (talcum) is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       found co-located alongside deposits of asbestos, with the same metamorphic geological conditions necessary for creating
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       mineral composites, and that virtually
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       talcum powder and derivative products contain asbestos.
      </p>
      <p>
       In doing this, we are assisting people in understanding the larger narrative in which these events (these
       <em>
        conspiracies
       </em>
       ) take place within, while simultaneously laying the grounds of expectation for surrounding discourse, and further investigations. The cumulative result would be exposing the
       <em>
        grand deception
       </em>
       in full, through its pieces. The direction of discourse to follow would naturally call into question the legitimacy of all of our regulators, courts and related institutions, in an exceedingly targeted fashion, whereby people are publically held to account for crimes they have committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       would (quite quickly) change from a cesspit of bickering and competing voices into a continuously building
       <em>
        resource
       </em>
       exposing
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       .  I admit, this would be a right pain in the arse to do this for every post in /new, but after doing it for even a few days I imagine it will inspire others to begin doing this for themselves, as a part of their OP (and as they understand it). Of course, there will always be differences of opinion as to
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       things are happening, and even
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       is really responsible, but this is where we insist on
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       based reasoning, and where partisan political scripts would be obvious and out of place by the very nature of their intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a great deal of power in being able to define the narrative and determine the boundaries of discourse; hence why the mind kontrol machine spends so much effort to such ends. Medicine and technology have largely not improved in well over seventy years now because in that time, all legitimate research has been focused solely on various forms of structural-functionalism, social engineering, and the creation of a false and unnatural culture fed to us through militarised propaganda technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
       The way I see it, we have a choice – each and every one. We
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       have a choice, in spite of what your
       <em>
        misleaders
       </em>
       may tell you. For my choice, I'm going to start
       <em>
        taking back
       </em>
       certain things which have been stripped of me, beginning with accurate definitions of
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality – unmediated by the influence of attempted thought controllers – is that
       <em>
        conspiracies
       </em>
       are an intimate aspect of human societies and culture. Every single marital infidelity in human history involves a conspiracy, by definition. The official history that we are fed is itself a litany of conspiracies – of groups and individuals vying for dominance and
       <em>
        keeping secrets from one another
       </em>
       . To the victor go the spoils, to be sure, but more importantly; to the victor go the story rights – the winner gets to write history. Every detective, every public prosecutor, is by definition a
       <em>
        conspiracy theorist
       </em>
       , as every investigation of a crime involves the assumption of a cover-up. And somehow we have been led to believe that such
       <em>
        secrets and lies
       </em>
       are only possible when the stakes are so low. While a man may cheat on his wife, one in office would never betray his nation. While 19 religious zealots with box-cutters, led by a man on dialysis from Afghanistan using a laptop and satellite phone can overpower the largest technological and military force in human history, demolishing three buildings with two aluminium airplanes, the possibility of the largest military force in human history successfully pulling off something
       <em>
        similar
       </em>
       is simply
       <em>
        crazy talk
       </em>
       . This is the psychology behind (what has been attributed to Hitler, in the supposedly dictated Mein Kampf, though there is very good reason to doubt the authorship of that particular text; 1925: ch X) what is termed
       <em>
        The Big Lie
       </em>
       (Große Lüge).
       <em>
        The Big Lie
       </em>
       suggests that if one is going to lie, that with a "big lie there is always a certain force of credibility," as for the great masses of the population, "it would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously." It is easier to believe a big lie than a small one, and it is easier to cope with the idea of a small-time criminal than it is to accept that the real criminals are
       <em>
        in charge
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So I am taking back the term from the
       <em>
        misleaders
       </em>
       and their theatre. The semiotic dissonance ends here; consider that a threat if it threatens you.
       <em>
        Conspiracy
       </em>
       is not a dirty word; it is simply the thread that can be pulled to unravel
       <em>
        all of it
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So who is with me?

       If we are going as far as you seem to wish to go (fundamentally questioning language, etc.), then it seems patently obvious that conspiracy needs to create an independent website and forum that is wholly under the control of the collective members of conspiracy. I'm not saying r/conspiracy should be shut down, as it attracts many people from the main site, but a parallel forum where the display and organization of information (ie the language of presentation used in the conspiracy community) is actually controlled by us. Reddit is designed as a click-bait feed-pusher, which is antithetical to organized discussion around topics which seeks to build knowledge. The case of many different threads covering the same ground is a perfect example.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: r/conspiracy needs to gently pull away from reddit and fully control its means of presentation through a cooperatively run, fully democratic website. Just my two cents.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Logical positivism and logical empiricism, which together formed neopositivism, was a movement in Western philosophy whose central thesis was verificationism, a theory of knowledge which asserted that only statements verifiable through empirical observation are cognitively meaningful.
       </p>
       <p>
        Logical positivists culled from Ludwig Wittgenstein's early philosophy of language the verifiability principle or criterion of meaningfulness. As in Ernst Mach's phenomenalism, whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience,[2] verificationists took all sciences' basic content to be only sensory experience. And some influence came from Percy Bridgman's musings that others proclaimed as operationalism, whereby a physical theory is understood by what laboratory procedures scientists perform to test its predictions. In verificationism, only the verifiable was scientific, and thus meaningful (or cognitively meaningful), whereas the unverifiable, being unscientific, was meaningless "pseudostatements" (just emotively meaningful). Unscientific discourse, as in ethics and metaphysics, would be unfit for discourse by philosophers, newly tasked to organize knowledge, not develop new knowledge.

       can one empirically verify that the past truly occurred? How can one empirically verify that only empirical observations are meaningful?

      <p>
       Do you mean the past like history or like yesterday? Either way you wade into semantics. Mark your calendar, check it tomorrow, that's empirical enough for me. As for the story of how we came to be, I take everything with a grain of salt as should any person who truly understands the comings and goings of scientific theory.

       "How can one empirically verify that only empirical observations are meaningful?"
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't because they're not the only kind of observations that are meaningful. Even if you get loose with the definition of cognitive. The philosophical elements in the words and definitions you quoted damn near prove my contention in and of themselves.  That's my opinion anyway, but I had to Google a couple different words before I answered so wtf do I know.

       Yes, those points go right to the heart of the problem. To be more clear, what I'm
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       saying is that empirical observations do not or cannot produce knowledge. I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       saying that this sort of dogmatic empiricism cannot justify or verify itself and that this must mean that minds are more than bio-processors of empirical data; logical positivism is self-refuting by its own axioms (ie, the points you make in your last two paragraphs).
      </p>
      <p>
       Or to make this philosophy even more apparently absurd, imagine if someone argued that man has only developed knowledge about mathematics over the millennia through this sort of empirical verification: if it were not written down (or represented through objects, or whatever) would 1+1=2 cease to be true?

       Ok cool, your response tells me I actually kinda understood what we were both talking about and yes I think we are in agreement. Had to search a couple more definitions after reading your last comment before I could put an answer down. At least I know I'm mostly understanding what we are both saying and cementing the meaning of a couple more words whose contextual use alone wasn't enough.

       Exactly - and that's just it: setting aside the concept that it objectively occurred whether we know it or not (and the different disciplines that can provide information, like archaeology), is it not true that without historical information we cannot know the past?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why some information is occulted, and why we all have a tendency to cling to what information we are given. It's incredibly intimidating to look out at the vast oceans of information and realize one has to personally analyze it to build real knowledge.

       yeah, but your brain still have to interpret whatever it spits out. still a tool for YOUR brain. unless it enslaves all of our brains into a hive brain like on psychopass (an excellent anime if youre interested).
      </p>
      <p>
       so, like a supermarket today, you have your ends met, but you dont know the path that it took to get there. without the context, it might be more difficult to evaluate what is important, and why it is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       say you want to know what is the most dangerous thing to mankind, and you throw in all these crazy algorithms to figure it out, account for disinfo/fakenews, unverifiable facts, and find the best possible data to support its conclusion. itll spit out X with a billion reasons why. you still need to know all the other possible things it went through to see all of that in context and KNOW: yeah, this thing is fucking right- X is fucking going to kill us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       without the total context, you really dont know how or why you are where you are.

       Either read it or don't.  It took all of five minutes to read.  People want things reduced into little bit sized bits.  Its probably due to 140 characters and the dopamine hit from scrolling.  Try to overcome your desire to have things spelled out for you.

       Great post...conspiracy is only a dirty word to those in significant conspiracies...the mention is far worse than curse words.  They know that when people get to a certain level of critical thinking about conspiracies, there's no going back, and that break point is what they try and nip in the bud.

       Not sure if this was a slip or an intentional use of the word for a certain effect, but to me "bipartisan" implicitly accepts the notion that what both
       <em>
        sides
       </em>
       of the one party wants or agrees on is good. My experience has been the direct opposite. But if you mean nonpartisan, I think this is a good starting point.

       This is something the sub has been failing to do, and something the submission statements have attempted to address, at least in part. It's easy to forget that many people reading this sub, and certainly the larger reddit/human community, are not particularly well-versed in the history of conspiracy. When such a person sees an argument or piece of evidence against one person/institution, they implicitly read that as an argument
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       that person/institution's chosen (read: controlled) opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't personally subscribe to one of the "single-cabal" theories, its evident that all of
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       connects and extends both spatially and temporally. And none of us really need to know what the whole puzzle looks like to see what pieces fit in with others.

       The bickering is killing this sub, choking out any real
       <em>
        collaboration
       </em>
       towards compiling and documenting the very real crimes and misdeeds that our institutions carry out against the people. It looks like a football game: every time one side has the ball in the other's territory, that side's
       <em>
        fans
       </em>
       (look up the origin of
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       word) jeer and get positively giddy, while the other side defend these fucks who wouldn't give any of you the time of day, and certainly don't care about you or your well-being. It's dopamine-driven schadenfreude and cortisol-driven Stockholm Syndrome mixed into an orgy of reactive neurochemistry.

       Pointing out the bickering only adds to the shitshow, at least within the non-meta threads. Without some direction like you've laid out — evidence-based reasoning and connecting dots in a larger picture — we're always going to be sloshing back and forth in Overton window only barely larger than the mainstream's. We can't just call out the partisans and sliders; we need to make the
       <em>
        positive
       </em>
       arguments, based on evidence, that shows how all these people, organizations, and events intertwine.

       Give me a break. r/conspiracy was incredibly left-leaning: anti-Bush, anti-neocon, anti-Regan, anti-Thatcher, anti-corporate, anti-Koch, anti-neoliberal, exposing the GOP's corrupt generational class-warfare... that is until the Russian bots' invasion convinced a bunch of weak minded rubes that THE RICH are suddenly on their side.

       Ah. So Russians making contact with a member of the Trumo team is treason and collision.

       Members of the Trump team have already been indicted, and it looks like there will be more to come. Don't pretend to know that this is all fine when you don't, you have no idea what Mueller has or doesn't have. All we know is the investigation is ongoing and we will all know in due time. Try to remember that this is not your "team" and if these guys are dirty they deserve the prison time they get. You seem to be more emotionally involved in the outcome (as are alot of people) than is healthy considering you have no involvement.

       I'm merely presenting the facts and again you have no inside information so don't pretend to. I'm happy to let the investigation complete and I'm confident we will one day have answers. If they are innocent fine if they are guilty fine as long as justice prevails.

       Yawn. Commenting on discussions isnt sculpting the narrative. People can still read it, form their own opinion and use upvote or downvotes...
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting up a wall and filtering the discussion before anyone has a chance to comment is controlling the narrative.

      <p>
       You do realize that. Right?

       Conspiracy or alternative forums generally seem to lean anti-establishment regardless of political lean. Think Ron Paul and then Bernie Sanders. This sub is anti-Clinton/Bush and mainstream media. Neither the GOP or DNC is fighting the global elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that only one of the republicans or democrats are working for the elite is a political view and is seen as laughable to most conspiracy theorists.

       I don't disagree with you, but the GOP is the party that passes and protects most laws that favor inequality, nepotism, grift and greed. Like corporate tax loopholes, capital gains, estate tax, Citizens United, oil/ag/teleco handouts, wall st kickbacks and bailouts, etc. The main argument against Dems is Social policy rather than Economic, for example they favor social welfare and civil rights, and restrictions on personal rights like 2nd amendment and religious beliefs like abortion.

       The main argument on r/conspiracy is that both establishment R's and D's serve corporate/MIC/deep state interests. Basically the kind of topics Bernie levied at Hillary regarding corporate well-fare, wall-street, foreign policy, etc, while she points at Republicans. It's similar to how Ron Paul continues to call out the GOP for government overreach while they try to blame the Dems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then establishment R's and D's will come together on controversial trade deals, foreign policy or education reform that actually unites the left and right together into opposing the establishment on both sides of the aisle.

       T_D folks arent too bad. They came here because they literally witnessed a shit ton of conspiracies come true just before their eyes, plus Alex Jones was on board.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my exchanges, they have been not too bad. On the other hand, the influx from r/politics the last month or so has been strange AF because they usually see us as tinfoil nutters and brush us off. So its definitely felt like some sort of concerted brigade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily the Submission Statements have seemed to stem the flow of the r/politics folks. Who figured when asked to write something create and with thought, it would make them go away, lol

       I don't actually have a problem with anyone coming here - I would LOVE for conspiracies to become popular or rather not looked at as crazy. I'd love our rewritten history realized by the masses. A red pill for everyone! However, when one attempts to sow discord in a community of folks who prefer nonpartisan discussion, that's not cool, and that's when a lot of old-timers or regulars here have a problem.

       I don't like soccer, so I don't troll and comment on the soccer subreddit(s). I like conspiracies, so that's where I keep my focus at online. Seems like a no-brainer, but I guess some people really don't have anything better to do.

       Agreed on the sub statements, they do seem to be helping a ton - the mods did good on that one.

       where there is love, there will be hate.
where there is happiness, there will be sadness.
where there is the internet, there will be trolls.

       do not fear hate, as without it, there could not be love.

       as such, do not fear trolls, without them, we wouldnt be able to identify the best and brightest among us.

       you choose how you want to devote your attention. if you wanna chase trolls, you can do that. but i must ask: do you like that more than reading conspiracies? if you enjoy conspiracies more... just spend your time doing that instead.

       i enjoy teaching people. thats why im "wasting time" replying here. i think im offering some substance, but, maybe im trolling a little too. things are never black and white. sometimes a troll can have a bit of wisdom or truth as well.

       PS: you always have to scroll through some bullshit on conspiracy websites. there will always be a: flat earth, or Nibiru is coming tomorrow, or jesus is coming back right now, or whatever type of LARP you want. you just scroll through it. i feel like people here let their ego loose a little too far.

       You got the knowledge and the wisdom to carefully craft each word
       <br/>
       Not to divide but inspire, give these people something to reach for
       <br/>
       Cuz what would happen if we got rid of every one of these trolls
       <br/>
       And didn't have to spend the time playing these played out roles?
Instead of fending off and sniffing out these obvious moles
       <br/>
       We devoted ourselves to pursuing our actual goals?

       What you don't seem to get is that we can already do this

       Focus on our own, not let the shilling consume us

       did not invite them him, he merely said (paraphrase): "We know your here, that's fine, just follow our sub rules". That was basically it. So many people have twisted his post into an open arms invitation, or something. That was not the case...

       I was online that night, I voted to sticky his post, and I'd do it again. It was the night when T_D's mods took the sub private, and we had a ton of people from there showing up anyway. If anyone actually read the post, it pretty much read like
       <a href="/u/Putin_loves_cats">
        /u/Putin_loves_cats
       </a>
       paraphrased. People were making threads left and right, thinking it was an admin action, and he made that post (and those of us online agreed) to let them know that we have very different rules here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, T_D had been in this sub (as had the other side) long before he made that post. I doubt that post had any appreciable effect on the number of T_D users here, certainly not any more than T_D going private did anyway.

       Then this will include the "reminder" posts that so many like to put up. They're great for reminding people, countering the memory hole and putting it out there for noobs. But they are very often partisan. It's the old dig of "whataboutism" which I think is an overused criticism anyway. But often times someone sees a headline, "Politician A lied to congress" or "Politician B is running for re-election," which is invariably followed by a reminder of this person's past transgressions. These posts will always be viewed as partisan. You can't force people to be non-partisan or even to limit them to arguing from a non-partisan view. It's not gonna happen and it's too stifling, it eats at discussion. I think you agree with me when you say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's easy to forget that many people reading this sub, and certainly the larger reddit/human community, are not particularly well-versed in the history of conspiracy. When such a person sees an argument or piece of evidence against one person/institution, they implicitly read that as an argument for that person/institution's chosen (read: controlled) opposition."
      </p>
      <p>
       So do you want to allow new eyes in the sub and new voices to the discussion or limit it to old salty dogs who have agreed not to argue from a partisan viewpoint?

       Good catch with "whataboutism." I first became aware of the phrase last year and it's not even circular logic. It's an illogical forcefield that is meant to shield from the argument from bigger picture.

       r/Conspiracy should be a place to discuss conspiracy theories not have a load of Yes men all the time. It's ridiculous to suggest that all conspiracy have ample evidence to back them up and if you agree with that then where's the critical thinking that separates you from any of the other sheeple? Only difference would be the source of your information.

       Couldn't agree more.  It doesn't do much good to foster an environment where it's not acceptable to be critical of theories.  I think most people are here because they believe that there are perfectly true, valid things happening in the world that are done in the shadows.  It doesn't do the community a service to tacitly accept theories that don't hold up well.

       how when we know then the Party has succeeded?

       In

        1984

       , Orwell wrote explicitly about fake wars and even fake military technology. Many people on this sub reference
       <em>
        1984

       and seem to want others to believe that they have read the book. If this is so, why do so few people on this sub discuss the

        absurd images

       we are shown by our telescreens about 'war' and 'military technology'
       <em>
        today?

      </p>
      <p>
       When people will cite Orwell but refuse to consider the ideas he was explicitly writing about, perhaps the Party has already won.

       The "Missile Hoax" video you link is seriously flawed. The wings or "tail fins" create rotational force. With reference to the linked video sketches it is a clockwise rotational force. This is rudimentary engineering and physics.

       Are you trolling me? I was trying to be helpful rather than ridicule you. I understand how the layman, not familiar with physics and engineering, would not understand aerodynamics (lift and drag) so I was trying to help you. Did you read the link Gimble above?
      </p>
      <p>
       Put your arm out the car window. Pretend your arm is a cylindrical missile. Pointing your arm straight ahead and there is minimal resistance. Start to tilt your arm upward, resistance (drag) increases. Your elbow just performed the task of a gimbled nozzle on a missile.

       Missiles don't need a lot of lift, because they are a one-time use item.  The amount of lift they generate is irrelevant.  The entire video is based on an irrelevant characteristic of SOME flying crafts, namely the airplane he kept comparing it to.  I can't believe people need this explained.

       Why do missiles need lift?  The video is based on an irrelevant characteristic of some flying objects.  That's why he could only refer back to an AIRPLANE to compare it to, or very specific missiles.

       Yes, the force of the bat is transferred to the baseball, which then expends that force while "flying" through the air. Because the bat only transfers a one time force, the baseball will eventually fall to the ground. If the baseball had an engine on it, then it could continue to fly for as long as the engine functioned.

       the only person claiming missiles "fly" is the guy who made the video saying they can't.  missiles are launched, with a trajectory.  they don't need lift like an airplane does.

       It is propulsion dude. The rocket has a canon in its ass, firing hot gass. This propels him forward due to conservation of momentum. The wings are there for stirring not holding him up. Without wings it would still fly, uncontrollably.

       what do you mean? They don't need lift because they are propelled, the fins are ONLY there for aerodynamics. If the force of the propellant exceeds the force of gravity, what the fuck need is there for lift? They are firing a missile from an aerial vehicle down to the ground. For control systems, they have variable fuel sprays, like vehicle fuel injectors, which exert larger amounts of force in particular directions.

       Definitely. I think I decided to read it because it was right before the Iraq war. The connection I mostly make is the concept of newspeak--except that internet newspeak was created semi-socially for convenience. Part of me believes that language is devolving by design though---From Adbusters Magazine: "Klemperer describes the language of the Third Reich as no longer drawing a distinction between spoken and written language. Everything was “oration … exhortation, invective.” Fanaticism became a virtue. We can see this same kind of blurring happening today, but the arena has changed from rallies and talk shows to—where else? —the Internet."

       How do rockets launch into space without wings. This guy neglects the thrust to weight ratio of missiles... if you have a TWR over 1 you don't need to generate lift.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: if you supply sufficient thrust you only would need to steer the object in the direction you desired. I'm guessing that's why they only have fins in the back. I'm also going to go out on a limb and say the fins near the center of gravity or near the 'head' of some of those other missiles are not for generating lift but for adding control surfaces. Those missiles may need to make more precise maneuvers to hit their target (planes, vehicles, etc), where the missiles with only read fins may be directed at stationary targets. I don't know anything about what missiles are used for what and what they look like.. but I know a bit about aerodynamics and flying. The canard fins add a great deal of maneuverability to a rocket or even plane.

       No, he does not. You can have all of the thrust in the world behind an object, but if is directed parallel to the ground (or worse, below parallel) then without lift it will fall like a brick.

       From the YT comments the most sound explanation I saw was that the back fins create a drag, therefore the tip of the missile points slightly towards the sky, and therefore there is vertical component counter-acting gravity that explains the horizontal flight (this is different from the thrust vectors he speaks about in the video).
      </p>
      <p>
       What disturbs me with this explanation is that the air flow would then cause the upward-pointing tip to point even more upwards, and eventually the missile to rotate upwards out of position. I'll have to give this some thought, and read through

       Try to draw a vector diagram where this could possibly work.

       You're forgetting to account for the thrust vector of the rocket motor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back fins create drag, which causes the nose of the rocket to tilt up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This the drag-induced rotation of the rocket's thrust vector away from perpendicular with respect to gravity introduces a vertical component to your thrust vector.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is this y-component in the thrust vector that overcomes the force of gravity and obviates the need for dynamic lift. No need to generate lift because the rocket motor is literally pushing you up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tricky bit is balancing/trimming the missile so that the drag induces just enough rotation that the y-component of the thrust vector exactly cancels out acceleration due to gravity. That's what aerospace engineers are for.

       What you are asking is akin to asking where did the lift come from on the Saturn V.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lift is unnecessary when you can vector
       <em>
        thrust

       to counteract gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the type of missile we are talking about, the thrust is vectored with a drag-induced rotation, which is in turn cancelled out by an acceleration-induced counter rotation.

       You are conflating upwards force with downward force.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a wingless missile flying horizontally, there is downwards force acting upon its centre of mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am asking how these things stay in the air if they do not generate their own lift.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are trying to say it is by the 'vector thrust' at the back, and this presupposes that the vector is also down (to point the nose up).
      </p>
      <p>
       This means TWO forces acting down and NONE up. The logical consequences of this are so obvious and yet the blind cannot and will not see.

      <p>
       Because of where the rocket motor is located in relation to the missile's center of mass and because it is providing continuous acceleration, a rotation is produced that counters the drag-induced rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just about getting your vectors to cancel such that the y-component of the thrust vector cancels gravity while the acceleration induced-rotation cancels the drag-induced rotation and produces level flight. It's fiddly, but not at all mysterious.

       You want me to directly attack the video itself instead of arguing against your defense of it, hm? Ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video's entire premise is "many missile designs shouldn't get enough lift from their wings/fins to fly." The video is correct in this, they don't. Nearly none of them do, including the ones that he thinks may actually be to do so. Any lift they manage to provide is just a bonus, though a helpful one that makes the missiles job much easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the fins is much more akin to the feathers on an arrow then the wings on a plane. The feathers don't keep the arrow in the air, they keep the arrow facing the same direction that it is moving, and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual reason missiles "fly" is because of the fact, as a previous person mentioned, that they can produce more much, much more thrust than their weight and they can either rotate themselves either using control surfaces or thrust vectoring (Most use the latter) to point above the horizon enough so that the vertical component of their thrust is greater than their weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only other hurdle in the video is his claim that using thrust vectoring to point the missile upwards will cause the engine to actually push the missile down towards the ground. The amount a missile can actually "vector" is generally less then 10 degrees, which means that if you pitch more then 10 degrees, or however much you're vectoring above the horizon you'll no longer be technically thrusting toward the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only other thing I'd like to mention is that he's concerned with the fact that the center of lift is behind the center of gravity, but that's actually true of many aircraft, as it promotes stability. It does indeed tilt the aircraft downward, but the increased stability resists this downward turning at the same time, making just a tiny bit of upward steering required to compensate.

       he explains the answer to his question with thrust vectors coming out of the back. that totally explains how they fly through the air. you dont need them to fucking break the heliosphere and go into space. theyre not designed to have crazy ass lift. just enough to hit another plane within, say, 1 mile above their plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       the idiom goes: well, it isnt rocket science.
      </p>
      <p>
       such a phrase exists for a reason. there a lot of factors and math that goes into these things. they are not easily explained, or understood in a 17 minute video.
      </p>
      <p>
       imma try to explain this as best i can, i dont know if its right, but, im no rocket scientist either.
      </p>
      <p>
       imagine youre holding a hose and water is coming out. it has decent force, propelling each water molecule out of the end of the hose.
      </p>
      <p>
       you see your friend walking nearby. you want to spray them, but damnit, the water wont reach them with the tiny amount of force it comes out.
      </p>
      <p>
       so what do you do? you apply a force vector, to the water coming out of the tube, with your thumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       this changes the force behind the water molecules from straight (assuming you are holding the hose parallel to the ground) to a more arched path. go try it outside if you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       sure, the smaller opening creates more force and that helps as well, but, watch the water. it will show more arch than before.
      </p>
      <p>
       missile is kinda reverse of this, but the same theories apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       plus, he readily admits that the weight probably isnt dead center in the missile, but then throughout the rest of the video he ignores this.
      </p>
      <p>
       i always love new ideas, and thank you for sharing this one. it was cool to learn about missiles and how they work. this guy is wrong tho. i dont think he truly understands how physics works. this is how we get flat earthers lol. learn more, do more math, experiment yourself. youll find the truth better that way anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       btw, if this guy really wanted to prove it, he could go to walmart and buy some bottle rockets. he could weight them at various points to prove his theories, and, mess with the fins on the back as well. i think hed see that he is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       lastly, i do totally agree that blue beam and other things prove that there is some exaggeration to certain military technology. that said, remember that keep all the good new tech to themselves. we are probably a good 50 years behind the best and baddest stuff they have. remember gps? they had that shit for fucking years and years. we use that shit every day. the blackbird was made in the 50s, but kept secret until the 80s (or whenever they released it). technology growth is also not a straight line, but a parabolic curve. so, if they were 10 years ahead in the 40's, theyre at least 50 years ahead now. at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS. thank you for sharing this video, and i do think that guy did a good amount of research. he just doesnt quite get how it works.

       So one one hand you say rocket science is too complicated to understand, on the other hand you say it can be explained with water bottle rockets.

       You can easily make a bottle rocket that goes up. It isn't so easy when you want something that can stand being shot out of a airplane at mach speeds, add further speed, and still accurately hit another vehicle more than a mile away going at a different mach speed. Tons of math, both straight physics and material sciences (the drag and the propellant creates heat that makes various components of the rocket slightly change shape or size).

       i really liked my water analogy. if that doesnt make sense, idk how to help you. thats just for force vectors tho, not rocket science as a whole. remember tho, force vectors and not weighted at the center totally make his arguments null.
      </p>
      <p>
       the deal with bottle rockets (they dont use water btw) is that you can see that IRL, and you dont need all the math and things that BETTER explain how these rockets work. you can just go fuck with them IRL and tweak what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       like putting the weight in the middle, or putting it in the back. IIRC, theyre totally back weighted tho. just like those missiles!
      </p>
      <p>
       oh, and for the record, i never said it was too complicated to understand. i understand some basics, but we didnt even bring up atmospheric pressure, or wind shear, or how the weight changes as fuel is expelled... etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       so yeah, maybe too complicated for you and that guy who made that video, but NASA, and space X and all those guys totally do it every day.

       I could perhaps hear an argument about "today's" military technology being misrepresented. But...missiles? You believe that Missiles are a hoax? I didn't watch the entire video you linked, but it seemed to be focusing on center of gravity and the aeronautics of missile flight. I get that these concepts may be difficult to wrap one's head around, but the core concepts of missile flight are the same concepts involved with launching an arrow. Maybe I'm missing something, but I really don't see anything impossible about missiles, seeing as we've been launching them for 10,000 years.

       Arrows do not generate lift. The video in question specifically focuses on lift: how do wingless missiles generate lift?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is physics 101. Bullets do not generate lift. Neither do arrows. Neither, in my opinion, do wingless missiles.

       Well for one, yes they do. It's a very small amount of lift, but the surface area of the shaft does generate lift. But this is beside the point. Arrows and missiles don't need to generate lift. Rocks don't generate lift, but they can be thrown really far and launched using machines even further. The initial thrust gives the object the force needed to overcome gravity. A missile has an engine which delivers sustained force. This force is enough to defeat gravity, the missile trades downward force for forward momentum. So there is no need to generate lift. The little wings on missiles are not wings at all, they are canards

       They are used for control and stability not lift. Exactly the same as arrows, the feathers are not used to generate lift, they're used for stability.

       Us being in a "simulation" or a "thought in the mind of God" (i.e. having a platonist existential outlook) doesn't mean the laws of nature and "objective" reality can't be observed, understood and modelled.
      </p>

       Indeed these two propositions are not mutually exclusive. A great many scientists were platonists. Look into the Kybalion and the hermetic paradox if you're interested. And finally here is something you might find interesting:

        As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together [...] We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter.

       I'm honestly trying to help the guy out. For some reason he's missing the fairly simple concepts involved with the flight of objects. I don't care about the really big existential questions, I just didn't want to waste my time trying to give this guy information and have him turn around and say I'm wrong because the illuminati (or whatever) say so.

       Go outside, pick up a rock, throw that rock as hard as you can, observe that the rock has traveled some distance and that the rock has no ability to generate lift.  Now ask you self the same question you asked me

       How fast would an rock need to be flying to counteract the downward force of gravity?

       Ok, I don't know why I'm bothering with you, but I'm hooked now, and I think I can prove it to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you seriously want to understand this concept just do this experiment with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a standard piece of paper. 
stand up to where you can move around in your room.
drop the paper to the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Observe that gravity has overcome the paper and it drops to the ground freely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok now pick the paper up again.
Place your right hand out flat as if your telling someone to stop, the tips of your fingers should be pointed straight up. 
With your other hand place the paper flat against your right hand, not on top of your hand, but flat against your open palm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now at the same time, begin to turn in place, not walking in a circle, but rapidly turn your whole body in a tight circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that these are not the best instructions, but if your doing it right then the paper will stay flat against your hand and it wont fall to the ground. There is NO lift being generated by anything involved, and yet the paper is held up against your hand, partially by wind resistance, but also by the force of your hand BEHIND the paper. Now imagine that your hand is a rocket engine. Your hand is pushing the paper through the air without holding it up, the rocket engine is doing the same thing. The real life missile is being rapidly pushed trough the air, without the need to generate lift.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it seems silly, but seriously, stand up and try it. There's at least 4 other people in this thread telling you that the video you linked to is wrong, and trying to explain this concept to you, many of us are having difficulty explaining it, because it's not something very many people have to deal with. But I promise you that Missiles are real, and they fly through the air without wings.

       Uh, do you mean to tell me you don't understand the physics of... missiles? I figured this would be military laser defense weapons or Gauss turrets or something. Missiles are proven physics. They're rockets designed to detonate. They don't need much lift surface because of their tremendous speed and low drag coefficient.

       Edit: Before I get the "Real missiles would look like airplanes." argument, missiles are basically like self powered bullets. Have you seen a bullet fly? It works pretty well without any type of wing. Missiles work on a similar principle but employ engine thrust and something known as
       <em>
        thrust vectoring
       </em>
       in order to maintain constant speed and stability.

       Absolutely false. Perfect example of a bullet that does not "drop" out of the barrel is the 223/5.56 round. First 100 yards it actually hits higher than point of aim before dropping:

Because, after reading your entire missile thread, I can't believe you're a real live living breathing functional adult who is being serious right now. I agree with the guy above, I almost certainly thought you were going to point to the new gauss cannons on our latest greatest navel destroyer or the sniper rifles that can shoot accurately over multiple miles, not something as simple and well understood as a missile.

       I've seen multiple people answer your questions, both directly and with extra context. You've either avoided their answers or failed to understand that they had provided answers, which is why I'm having trouble believing that you're a fully functional adult, which is why I asked about your age and education level. I'd love to see you go back and actually engage with those others in good faith, if you want to have a real debate/discussion, but as long as you're not willing to do that I'd love answers to my questions.

       You haven't answered any of the other folks that honestly answered your questions, so why would I attempt it? If you are truly wanting to discuss this in good faith, why don't you make a real attempt at responding to the multiple other people who already have answered your questions, that you seem to either be unable to understand or (more likely) are blowing off because they didn't answer in the exact way you know how to respond to?

       Sorry man, that video you linked is garbage and I'll say why.  Missiles aren't designed to stay in the sky forever, they are long range HUGE bullets.  He keeps pointing to an airplane, something that has continued use in and out of flight, to something that is designed for a one way trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, at 11:30 he says that some rockets have vector thrusts which is true, but he fails to understand that a missile is traveling MUCH faster than an airplane, so even if it was using vector thrust it would still gain upward momentum.  It's the same reason you can pop a wheelie and then pop another one when you're close to returning to the ground from the first one.

        Some  strategists  are  concerned  that  seaborne  robotic swarms  might  do  the  same  thing  for  enemy  nuclear  submarines  by  allowing  states  to  more readily  track  and  target  their  movements. If  any  of  these  threats  materialised,  states  would face  severe  use-or-lose  incentives.  But,  even  if  they  did  not  materialise,  the  very  possibility  that they  seemed  likely  to  could  cause  states  to  undertake  destabilising  action,  such  as  heightening alert  statuses  or  delegating  nuclear  launch  authority.  This  theme  –  that  a  threat  need  not materialise  for  it  to  be  destabilising  –  is  true  for  all  the  technologies  discussed  here.  As  long  as  a state  perceives  itself  to  be  under  threat  –  whether  it  is  or  not  –  it  may  be  incentivised  to  behave in destabilising ways.

       This is a thought-out OP, and well-written.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet for all the glowing goals and aphorisms, if the OP doesn't address the weak, permeable boundaries created in part by compromised agents both within and without r/conspiracy, not real sure how this sub will ever be anything again but a shell of what it once was.  Sorry.  Reality check.

       As someone who owns and runs 2 businesses and am BUSY AF all day long with no days off, just a free hour or so a few times a day, who listens/Watches YouTube videos on 2x, is learning a 3rd language, and is used to this sub keeping most posts to about a few sentences, the ELI5/TL:DR is a Godsend
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading the post now, I really didnt miss much. OP could have summed it all up in 2-3 sentences. The context is nice, but I personally dont need it

       I have time now, r-e-l-a-x. Going through the OP, still could have cut everything down to 3-4 sentences. Also, I was the nice guy and and put you onto to r/C_S_T where folks there regularly write novels about a topic.

       OK, that's good that you do have time to relax. Your first comment however comes off both as a humble brag, as well as a complaint at op for writing so much despite your seemingly too busy life.

       This and these discussions are similar to that which I used to drag my friends through. My friends are not especially gullible fools but they are skeptical. After all when we're taught the belief system of the material science it's  hard to recognize that actual real magik has been mobilized in maliciously intented plans to keep us from owning our own intrinsic glory...
Things have changed though.  Enough that the control systems have been rattled and their flaws exposed.  Last election in particular demonstrated especially to the Bernie/Jill crowds just how, and just how much the supposed most important office and the competition to it is a puppet show, and how when
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       select their candidate they will go to extreme lengths, under all of our noses to make sure their will is done. 
If anyone feels the need to interject "There you have befooled!! For it was Hitlary that

These days my allies too are wary of the narritives spat out by the news, they too question why certain symbols and suggestions hit the pop culture at curated times.
With each passing day the cracks are revealed and hidden,  revealed and hidden.  All it really takes now is to pay attention, people will wake up faster now than ever.
We are all connected in this.
It is my sincere belief that the future

       Lolol thanks, I won't edit it in even though it would take less effort to quietly change it than to post this response, because historically, spelling and words, especially English is ruuil arbitrary and usually cashed in hoyteetoytee elitism.
Not that I think you're doing that, I just think it's important to reinforce and remind that Language is the tool of the users. Not the other way around&lt;3

       I'm late to the party and using my phone to boot, so this will be brief, but I really feel a resonance with the OP and with your response as well.  I'm more of a lurker, not prone to interject on any regular basis, but this sub is of vital importance to me, and I am glad to know that others can see the reality of the unseen forces at work in this plane of existence which we currently inhabit, and are willing to use their time, intellect and energy to bring to light things which are intentionally hidden, and which are conceived with intent to gain power and control at the expense of any and all whom they can subjugate and enslave.

       The march towards "freedom" or emancipation for the "common person" is a long road fraught with potholes.  That which constitutes frredom for one individual, will lay the foundations for anothers prison cell.

       To talk today as if the majority of individuals in the western world and beyyyyyoooond are no more than wage slaves is an insult to those in the past who have stood up to demand the right to representation.

       Reality is what you can get away with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whilst of course we are all prone to be buffeted by the waves of socio-political forces that course through our communities, we alone have the power to make own worlds as free or as helpless as we wish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest giving up all your possessions and going to live in a community with little material wealth whose language you do not speak.

       Perhaps then, you will find what it is that truly enslaves us, and in relief, discover also that which sets us free.

        Ultimately, we need to flip the entire ethos surrounding the idea of conspiracy theorists to one of – not private – but public, open source investigators. This should begin from a position of acknowledging that our regulators and misleaders are simply doing a shit job, and should all be fired (from artillery), and offering specific proofs or indications pertaining to each issue that is being ignored by those whose responsibility it is to address. We begin, instead, from the position of: "Since those in charge of exposing these issues are clearly complicit, if not outright involved, it is up to us as individuals to expose both the crimes and those responsible for covering them up."

       Nice to see it stickied and nice to see the many positive responses in the comments. Maybe things truly can start moving in a positive direction around these parts as well and the depth can move from our smaller subreddits to engulf r/conspiracy....and who knows, maybe even farther reaches of Reddit as well....

       I'm with some of what you said in spirit, and all do respect to a well written and thought out post, but you are being a touch too authoritarian. Take rule #2:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We overstand that they are all corrupt, and we are not interested in your petty professional wrestling. We are interested in shining our light on those behind the curtains, pulling the strings. Partisan political posts will not be tolerated."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what you mean by "overstand" or how it might relate to a requirement for submissions and posting, but I for one, do not think "they" are all corrupt, just mostly. I also try to be independent and non-partisan, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear somebody else's partisan arguments, especially if they are well thought out and polite. People ally themselves with political parties because they feel those parties represent them overall better than the others. If they are making a good point, I want to hear it, if not, especially if they are spewing brainwashed bullshit, I want a chance to tear into their contentions. I personally care little for changing the opinions of "normies" but if you do, you're gonna have to let them have their say and their counterarguments.  If that means putting up with shills and brainwashed mainstream assholes then so be it, let the best theories win, shine that light. Otherwise I welcome "normies" to the conversation and I do not expect them to be anything other than mainstream. I don't go to other subs looking to "redpill" ppl. Tried once or twice maybe, fuck that, let them come here and join in and we'll see what they are made of. But I don't think you can have it both ways, either allow partisan arguments or concede you will turn-off a lot of potential n00bs by disallowing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech and no censorship in spirit...taking down the most egregiously offensive posts in practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, develop your built in filter and if somebody does say something you don't like either argue against it or down-vote and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do want to limit spam, as with the new submission statement rule.

       Correct.  But, what can be done is to model better norms, amplify others doing the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens then, is others will begin to adopt those norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       As little as 10 percent, active users can begin this.  They will be joined in weeks by others, some not even aware, just craving community, and modeling themselves that which they see as resonant, of value.

       You should explain exactly what is meant by "partisan political posts." Does that only include US politics? For example there are a whole lot of partisan political posts and fabricated titles here clearly in support of the arab/Palestinian movement and against Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, I don't see this as a real improvement. There still is
       <em>
        no community
       </em>
       because of a lack of any knowable objective values. Accounts are going to continue shilling and dissenting opinions are going to keep being trolled and buried.

       My suggestion would be for respected users of the sub to participate in crafting a statement of beliefs.

       Not a fan of ppl intentionally using words like 'semiotic dissonance' that they know most ppl will have to look up without explaining it in the post. The English language has things called synonyms and metaphors to make language accessible and precise without having to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       heres an example:
      </p>
      <p>
       semiotic dissonance= when you are told an apple is an orange and u believe the apple is an orange
      </p>
      <p>
       I speak Chinese and Spanish in addition to my native English. I dont post in Chinese on reddit. That would be stupid. could go into a much longer rant here about how the problem is ppl have been programmed to expect politicians, business leaders, and public communications to always be producing 'polished turds'  in their speech and behavior that have the perfect vocabulary and sound professional, however, when u look into the substance, is 90% bullshit. This is pure social conditioning. Happens in many cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly there are a lot of studies about how class and language are used in the US. Basically insecure ppl trying to move up in social class intentionally use language others wont understand the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       response to points made in the post:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        'Consider it a threat if it threatens you'
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       got to be really careful with this one. Ppl have to have a high level of self understanding to truly understand if something is threatening them.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Some one saying you are wrong is not a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Some one who does not like you is not a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       -some one who is prettier or smarter than you is not a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       -some one who says u r wrong because their facts are different than your facts is not a threat
      </p>
      <p>
       -some one who unintentionally makes you look bad is not a threat
      </p>
      <p>
       The above may seem super obvious but, if you have really invested time in understanding yourself, you definitely know how often petty motivations can creep into our consciousness without you being aware of it. That said, fear of not fully understanding your own inner motivations should not ever silence you. Way better to be wrong on interpreting something you are feeling than to just go along with what everyone else is beleiving and saying as chances are that is even more wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are all logical and emotional beings. Emotions provide access to the most powerful of internal in sights in the form of intuition. THIS SHOULD NOT EVER BE DISCREDITED. Logic allows us to connect the two things together. intuition sets the direction, logical research builds the framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest lies being fed to us is that emotional truths are lies. Actual powerful intuitive insights have mistakenly been grouped together with petty emotional responses.  The two are very different, but it is hard to tell the difference within yourself and in others without a considerable amount of training.

       an emotional truth is an ineffable truth that taps into your deeper subconscious knowledge. Additionally, If you believe in stuff like remote viewing as I do, it would also mean insights extracted through meditation or other method of focusing at targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       emotional response would include social emotions like anger, fear, jealousy, pity, compassion that motivate your actions. At the same time, however, emotional response can also be emotional truths. The trick is gaining enough self understanding so you can learn to tell the difference.

       Good post. Yeah, a lot of conspiracy users instead of trying to see things out of the box fall for the same language monopoly the elites try to force on everyone. I get people don't want the social rejection that talking about certain conspiracies gets you but people shouldn't be scared of going deeper into the hole either. There is a reason why the TPTB don't want that information to get free.

       I agree. R/conspiracy used to be so much more than political issues and taught me to explore the illuminate, mind control, pyramids in space and in Antarctica, define cryptids, revisit the JFK assassination, and really made me want to dig. Now, I just go to other places to explore and learn and be respected for an opinion I may have that's way different from OP's. That's what this forum is about, an avenue to define and to solidify possible proof of conspiracies.

       It's a website that is filled with people that many times have very little contact with the conspiracy world or any topic deemed too fringe by the mainstream narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course many other places exist where one can talk about conspiracies, fringe subjects,...etc., even many smaller subs on this site. However r/conspiracy is a unique way to spread awareness about issues that matter. And if this can be done in a well argumented, detailed and concise, yet still easy to understand way, those unaware could be "red-pilled" so to speak, which could make a more significant difference than people with knowledge of topics not covered in the mainstream  (conspiracies...) remaining only in closed off and unknown subs, groups and sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my take on it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, the brainstorming and researching should perhaps mostly be done off-site and in the smaller subs on specific topics. But it should always be presented here as well, since this place has a lot of eyes on it (which is why various provocateurs are so rampant here).

       Outstanding idea. My only comment is that we keep our statement easy-to-understand for those new to the community. 8th grade reading level. Challenge ourselves to communicate this subreddit's principles in a clear, simple, approachable way. Thank you for taking the initiative on this!

       Yeah I know this isn't going to be popular, but there is no way to fix conspiracy. Everyone seems to think it is only outside pressure that fucks this sub. It's not, a great deal of the stupidity is caused by the people that post the most. They use alt accounts and proxies. Happens on every single conspiracy site, I used to run one of the early ones and while it didn't see the numbers some places see (less people on the net back then) I saw it happen there and some of the sysops of contemporary sites admit this as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies attract nutters, sorry but that's the truth. No not everyone here by far is a nutter, but it only takes a motivated few percentage points worth to mess it up completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND then you add the outside pressures.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing to fix, you live in the information age, if you cannot navigate for information with EVERYONE else trying to obfuscate, then you are lost already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is simply data, some is not true, some is, but it is all data and when they lie they reveal important things about themselves. Learn to rise above the argument and become competent in the information age.

       Exactly, the key is not to believe anything. Just accept it as data, eventually that data will correlate with other things and become useful to you, or it won't. We cannot be lazy anymore, gone is the false dependence we had on institutions we could "trust". Now we have to think for ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communication used to be very, very costly and time consuming. Books used to be only affordable by the aristocracy. When communication is so expensive the demand is for the highest quality information possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now communication is accessible and so cheap most don't even consider the cost. This drastically changes the signal to noise ratio. There is no way to fix this as it is not broken. It's billions of people expressing themselves and people trying to get ahead by marketing, lying (but I repeat myself), obfuscating etc. Get enough people to agree and you have some power, many people seek power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main information that really ground this into my mind was just looking at ancient history and looking at modern events. Nothing has changed and it has not changed because human nature has not changed and will not just because we think we're all advanced. We're just a very successful omnivorous predator, a killer ape. No more, no less.
      </p>

       I'm not suggesting you (inclusive) don't dig and learn. If that is what motivates you, then do it. Just my two cents worth after decades of digging ;-)

       you fix it with education. if someone posts something factually wrong, you take the time to correct them. like i attempted to do with the missile guy above.
      </p>
      <p>
       another guy that posted above said something like: remember when this place wasnt just baiting?
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem isnt just this place, or its education level. its with the whole of society. when fucking jersey shore is the news (lupe!) no one wins. society is now focused on clicks, bait to get those clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       just because the problem is daunting, doesnt mean we shouldnt try our best to wake up every single person we can.
      </p>
      <p>
       the cool thing is: if theyre on this site, they already recognize there is something wrong with the world. thats seriously like 75 percent of the battle. the problem with bait is that people fucking like it! so if you get a rat that sees the cheese and says: wait a minute, that shit isnt right. pounce on that fucker and try to get them to see the light. theyre almost there anyway.
      </p>

       now, people with mental illnesses do exist. one of the unintended consequences of the internet is that these people get a chance to connect wayyyyy more than they normally would have in the past. so they can influence each other, and, wreak havoc for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       but, sane people can totally recognize crazies. i do it every day at work, if you work with people at all, you can as well. some people you can know that you just cant save. no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as society goes, i think there is rehab or a pasture environment would be best; but, that wont work on here. you do the best you can until you realize its a crazy. once identified, you try your best to educate and sway them. if it takes too long, or is too trying, let it go.
      </p>
      <p>
       theyre the crazy. you and everyone else, that is sane, knows you are sane. its all good. cant win them all. duality and such.

       Well put, balanced approach.  I left a cult some years ago and have dealt with the repercussions of my family looking down on me, thinking I'm a stupid idiot and deceived by the devil, etc.  I wanted so badly for them to wake up and see that they are the ones in a mental prison, but finally I've come to a place of acceptance, more or less, that they are on their journey and I can't really do much to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now I just see that as a microcosm of society at large, so many of us are in a dream state, walking around half asleep, believing that the construct which has been given to us is "reality".  Everyone is somewhere along the continuum between fully asleep and fully awake.  I feel as though I'm closer to awake than others, but I'm not so proud as to think I have it all figured out, far from it actually.  And, I hope that I can help others along the way, if by nothing else but living as authentically and honestly as I am capable of at any given point, and sharing what I know when given the chance.

       You're splitting a lot of hairs man.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first part, it doesn't sound like you're wanting a solution. All we can do is lead the horses to water; we can't make them drink.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't say: keep going till they believe it as the one truth. I implied: do your best, throw out truth, whatever happens after that is up to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       To your last point, for sure. There are some impressive crazies. Psychology/psychiatry in general is pretty subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there are things that are facts. Proven science. If people can't deal with that, then they're crazy. It's pretty simple. I'm not saying fucking diagnose them. "You're sociopath!" It's more like: know when you're fighting an un winnable battle and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I work in the medical field. I didn't believe this for the longest time, but, it's totally a real thing. You can sense all kinds of things about people. Craziness is one of them. Sure, there are those that slip through, but, for the majority of people: you can tell. You may not be able to say,"oh, they're bipolar." But you can tell they "aren't quite right." However, there isn't science for it. Rather, there's "pseudoscience" that provides answers, but, nothing that any random physics professor would approve. For the record tho, I was totally with you. I called bullshit on my gf. Then I got into the field myself, and, sonofabitch, she was right.

       Disinfo is actually brilliant and it's interesting to watch new people get sucked in at first. That is one thing I wish newcomers could understand, disinfo is 95%+ correct. if it wasn't it wouldn't do them any good as propaganda. First they need enough stuff panning out that people say, "Hey this person really knows their stuff!". Then when is suits they chuck in a bit of disinfo and it gets gobbled right down. Kind of like crushing medicine into a spoonful of honey to get  a kid to take the medicine. If anyone points to the flaw the fanbois shout them down. It is an elegant solution really.

       And, yes, this and other subs are under constant attack by several corporate-sponsored proxies, including David Brock's ShareBlue.

       And yes, you are defensive about the word "conspiracy" just as the CIA intended when that was programmed into the people's lexicon. It hangs around your neck like an albatross.

       But the fact is, capitalist democracies always degenerate into fascism when the people start to notice the patterns and begin to grow cynical. This is a known-known. You'll feel more comfortable if you ignore your lying eyes.

       But think about this. We may be the last line of defense. There is precious little time before we are silenced on the corporate-owned internet. This time is the only time there is.

       I love everything you've said, but face it, this sub is dead and it was doomed from the start. Reddit's voting system is too susceptible to manipulation. The truth of the entire universe could be buried under artificial downvotes and nobody would take it seriously. The vast majority of Redditors have a somewhat neutral perspective on a given topic until they see what the hivemind has upvoted/downvoted. It is the perfect propoganda machine, just look at r/politics and the mindless drones that inhabit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to turn r/Conspiracy into the vessel you've proposed is folly and will be flipped upside-down with artificial voting and algorithims designed to derail open discussions. I've come to believe that sites like 4Chan, anonymous message boards in which EVERYONE has an opportunity to be seen free of a "hivemind" influence, is the best way to reach the truth coupled with an archive of important information.

       Last year (now I have a new user id) I already wrote a comment on a similar subject. I am not sure if I see it the right way but, in my opinion the very terms "conspiracy"/"consiracy theory" are continuously being misinterpreted and used in wrong or distorted contexts and due to being overloaded with spooky tin foil stuff they tend to attract people who are not necessarily interested in real discussions and investigative work, in sensible conclusions and directives. Maybe I am completely wrong - but I wonder if it might be useful to find a new term for this work and open up a new subreddit with strict rules and high demands on quality and depth of the stuff people post. I am a Reddit and also an investigative newbie, and furthermore I am not a native english speaker and therefore sometimes miss the details. But from the first day I joined Reddit
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       seemed to me as the place where the tin foil hats meet. When I tell people in my environment something like "you know.. I don't necessarily believe in all that stuff they tell us on TV" they often respond "oh, you believe in those conspiracies!?" The people mix up terms and concepts. It may be time to introduce some basic concepts into "our" work. Just like OP did. When I started digging into this stuff 18 months ago I soon realized that the most important thing is to understand some basic psychology (of masses) and learn the grammar and vocabulary of deception and.. maybe most important: the reason why we (yes, all of us, sometimes) deceive. Furthermore I am pretty sure that enslavement, deception, fraud, manipulation and abuse must have a counterpart or counterweight. This must be the reluctance of people to, think for themselves, to evolve, to take responsibility, to communicate, to act decisively when things go wrong and to just say "no" when they don't agree. 
I think we should not focus on "conspiracy" but on investigation of things that just don't make sense or that are harmful. This work should have a scientific foundation and it should have a focus on understanding and solving problems.

       I just read a quote this week that really stuck with me; "a 'conspiracy theorist' is nothing more than a derogatory term used to discredit a critical thinker." I have to agree. 
Who labels us that; pretty much the guilty, those that work for the guilty, the brain-washed ..
I'm happy with my insatiable curiosity, learning, questioning everything - getting to what's authentic. Good stuff. Great stuff. I'm in 👌

       But the OP doesn't want to discussion and subjectivity because he believes his theories are objective. That's the opposite of a critical thinker.

       I wholly support this new direction for r/conspiracy. I hope you succeed, and that together we lift humanity to its next stage of development.

      <p>
       I'm building a knowledge representation database/vm but having trouble getting the conceptual basis right. My vision is that it will be the next step in the evolution of mechanical analysis, and greatly aid in making fuzzy subjects clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, I have to wade through the fuzziness of my own mind first. I have the prerequisite programming skills, but I don't yet possess the clarity of mind to sufficiently structure my own ideas.

       If any of you would like to help me brainstorm, feel free to hop by on r/hardnet.

       You kind of lost me when you start using
       <em>
        overstand
       </em>
       to mean
       <em>
        understand
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it, language makes a difference, but surely we can avoid resorting to such fake sounding words??
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally I would recommend
       <em>
        comprehend
       </em>
       to replace understand, but seeing as it’s being used in a format of ‘we understand that x’, I instead propose the word
       <em>
        commitment
       </em>
       , as in ‘we are committed to each other, we are committed to fighting and exposing corruption, and we are committed to our role [as truth seekers]
      </p>
      <p>
       Language is important, but humans exist above language. Refusing to use words like understand and replacing them with nonsense words like overstand, in my opinion and view, is essentially putting humans below language, which is not where we belong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I welcome any discussion about language this may spark, and now I’ll go finish reading the comment cause it’s good so far.

       I believe that for every corrupt figure of no integrity, there is a true patriot of high integrity. I have confidence in this because I believe I am one, and for most people reading this, you will also know that you are one. It is okay to question others, but it is not okay to ignore the evidence and create our own narrative.

       Well written, thank you for writing it. The world could use a lot more people like the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shows me I'm not the only person here that has an appropriate 'critical thinking' world view, who would prefer to talk about genuine definitions instead of paradigms, who would prefer discussion of ideas over statement of opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I make a lot of effort to talk to people. To cut passed the arrogant, ego-driven BS that developed in this internet age and attack at the core of the problem - how people think.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a good start, all this, the problem is, how many people actually read this whole post? One of the problems anyway...

       Taking back from who? The people who you can no longer mention (rule 10) are implementing censorship in a effort to control the subs narrative..
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the rule 10 and massive rule 10 shift these past few months. Not to mention long time contributors getting site wide bands. The Rule 10s are complacent with Reddits leftist agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any censorship. Any walls. Anything that hinders free discussion is terrible. Even in the name of
       <em>
        gasp
       </em>
       spam.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many post have been removed due to the new rules.. A lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any comment that doesnt suit their narrative is an attack now and insta removal. Per rule 10.

       Same for the thread wall submission. Pre screenimg thread submissions LMFAO.

       It is also a matter of picking and choosing battles, determining which conspiracies the public will care about.  If a relatively plausible conspiracy (govt. UFO program) is mentioned with the same gusto as an extremely unlikely conspiracy (

       as great as that would be....good luck with that. i would only argue that some posts are to get a consensus or see what others in the sub think. the current rules are good enough, the mods are on it. its a time where a lot of people are waking up so there will be enthusiastic ops on the basics. dont hate.

       This seems silly and contradicts itself. By telling people everyone is bad, it's as if you are not allowing people to believe there is some good.

       This reads like a dog fart.  I think I get were you want to go with this, but the message is lost in all the metaphor and innuendo.  Tell it to us like we're loafing around the office water cooler, not like its a sermon on the mount.  You'll get more of our attention, and we won't feel like you want to upend our entire subreddit.

       Couldn't agree more.  It doesn't do much good to foster an environment where it's not acceptable to be critical of theories.  I think most people are here because they believe that there are perfectly true, valid things happening in the world that are done in the shadows.  It doesn't do the community a service to tacitly accept theories that don't hold up well.

       You are never going to expose
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       here or anywhere beyond what they want because as soon as you even remotely become a threat (real or imagined from their pov..) they try real hard to murder you and will stop at nothing or no one or no law (laws lol..) to get you.

       This force is the most cowardice complex in existence and they are absolutely terrified any form of truth or freedom or creativity or anything that is not them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sucks and nobody should have to exist in this system of cowardice but we do because God refuses to do anything to stop them.

       Yes, the force of the bat is transferred to the baseball, which then expends that force while "flying" through the air. Because the bat only transfers a one time force, the baseball will eventually fall to the ground. If the baseball had an engine on it, then it could continue to fly for as long as the engine functioned.
