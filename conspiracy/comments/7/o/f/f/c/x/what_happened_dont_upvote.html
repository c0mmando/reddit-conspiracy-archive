Since Reddit doesn&#39;t release personal data and hasn&#39;t i don&#39;t  think they have prepared any reports on this, I wonder if it&#39;s up to us to run some queries and look at the data, then again I bet someone already has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been finding and frequenting conspiracy subreddits since 2004.  I love these communities.  This place was fantastic for a long time. </p>

<p>That said, the shilling has been increasing significantly. It  mirrors the exact same debate tactics and talking points we see in r/politics. Same daily agenda. At first it was just one thread here and there, but now it’s getting to the point where few threads are safe from downvote brigades and these cancerous commenters who think something the Washington Post puts on their front page is a fucking conspiracy. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is being choked and it’s dying. </p>

<p>Praise be to these mods, though. My hat is off. That have not censored anyone’s viewpoint and they have done their best to stay neutral.  Even considering that I think this place is on the ropes, I still do not, nor will I ever, ask that they censor this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the biggest shift in reddit after Edward Snowden. It&#39;s been downhill ever since. This subreddit is one of the few that still had interesting discussions and topics, but it&#39;s definitely become weirdly political in here.</p>

<p>I supported Bernie in the primaries, but I still had my doubts about him. If he was somehow allowed to be the candidate and won, I would have been cautious in my support. I learned not to blindly believe any president or administration (or the media) after the whole WMD fiasco (it was the first time I had actually paid attention to what was going on in the world).</p>

<p>Since I&#39;ve started paying attention to what the government is doing, I haven&#39;t witnessed a single presidential administration that didn&#39;t have a hidden agenda. We&#39;re consistently being fed lies and it&#39;s up to us whether we want to ignore them or call them out when we see them.</p>

<p>One day, we&#39;re going to have to hold our government accountable for their actions. The only unfortunate part of that is that there is also going to come a day when we&#39;ll no longer be able to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without running any numbers, my suspicion is that viewership has died quite a bit over 2017, just based on how active the comments section appears to have reduced. I honestly don&#39;t even pay enough attention to feel very confident in that assumption, which is the reason for my post. There&#39;s a BigQuery database that&#39;s kept up to date which doesn&#39;t contain viewership data, but I think the timeline in participation alone might be revealing enough, especially if the peaks and dips line up (or don&#39;t line up) with various departures or news events. With the same dataset, there&#39;s also an opportunity here to analyze cross-subreddit participation. It would take some hard work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is leftists. I&#39;m kinda a leftist but most are idiots that have started eating up Marxist style conspiracy theories after getting used to CNN&#39;s latest episode of Gotcha! stories to justify why they haven&#39;t gotten everything they wanted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub represents the macrocosm.  The last 2 years especially have been rough socially - politics is tearing people apart, and not just in America.  It&#39;s Conservatives vs. Liberals, Globalists vs. Nationalists, all over the world and it is getting super heated.  So that trickles down into subs like this.  Worse, people are closing themselves off in bubbles of like-minded thinkers, so they&#39;ve lost the ability to debate and have civil discourse.  In a conspiracy sub - that becomes amplified because many are already naturally paranoid.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a fan of conspiracy theories for 20+ years.  Many I subscribe to.  Many I do not.  These days I subscribe to fewer and fewer because I&#39;ve come to believe there&#39;s a conspiracy making machine -  partisan groups creating false flags to create division, fear and paranoia - making people easier to control.</p>

<p>This opinion has lead to me being called a shill more times than I can count on this sub.  I&#39;m not.  I share my opinions for free and with no agenda but to offer rational thought and opinions.  Which is not always popular around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had to delete my original comment since it was just getting me downvotes, thus flagged as if I&#39;m a spammer and preventing my ability to comment more frequently than once per ten minutes, with the warning, &quot;you&#39;re doing that too much.&quot; I wanted to know why all the far right bias had disappeared from the posts and comments in this sub. I have a pretty good idea, but nothing definitive and  the response was not  forthcoming. </p>
