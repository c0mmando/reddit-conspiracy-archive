       Okay. I need to post this somewhere, because it's been an obsession for the past few weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       In light of the
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">
        recent New York Times article about UFOs, and the pentagon admitting that it's been funding UFO programs.
       </a>
       To me, this is the most important story that came out in 2017, and I can't believe it's not being discussed more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's absolutely crazy that mainstream media and the government are coming public with these videos.  This is the beginning of official DISCLOSURE about the UFO phenomenon:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/12/19/luis-elizondo-intv-ufo-pentagon-program-purpose-other-life-not-alone-sot-ebof.cnn">
        Former Pentagon Official Speaks Out About UFOs:
 "We May Not Be Alone."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/19/us/pilot-david-fravor-ufo-jim-sciutto-outfront-cnntv/index.html">
        Former Navy Pilot Speaks Out About UFO Experience
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I never thought I'd live to see the day that the US government started releasing UFO footage in earnest - and this announcement allows us to look back at decades of UFO claims in a new light. Since the 40s, people have been reporting UFO sightings and claiming government cover-ups - and many of the people speaking out on the subject were ridiculed and considered wack-jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the government is officially confirming many of the claims that these people have been making -- which begs the question:
       <strong>
        How many of these UFO stories / conspiracy theories have been true this entire time?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       With this in mind, I've been looking into the "big names" of the UFO world with a different perspective:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tom DeLonge:
       </strong>
       Most well-known as the lead singer of punk-rock band Blink 182, Tom DeLonge has become one of the people at the forefront of modern UFO discussions. After publishing a science-fiction book about UFOs and conspiracy, DeLonge claimed that he was approached by intelligence agencies. They allegedly shared the truth about UFOs with him, and asked for his help disclosing the information to the greater public.
      </p>
      <p>
       In cooperation with a handful of government officials, DeLonge started a company called
       <a href="http://tothestarsacademy.com">
        To The Stars
       </a>
       , which claims to be an organization designed for disclosing the truth about UFOs and aliens through media (TV, Movies, Books, etc).
       <em>
        I highly recommend you visit their website and watch the video, it's super strange.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       In October,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n_3mnJfHzY">
        DeLonge appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast
       </a>
       and shared his experiences working with the government, and the disclosure of UFOs. He made several outrageous claims including that the government has "found a life-form" and that they've obtained technology and metals from crashed UFOs. He also claimed the government was working toward disclosure, and he and his company were involved in that effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time of his interview, nobody really took DeLonge seriously -- the videos on his company's website come across like a cheesy infomercial, and his constant plugging of his books made his appearance  seem like a cash-grab... UNTIL mid-December. This brings us back to the New York Times article I posted at the top of this text. Tom DeLonge's company revealed 2 new UFO videos, which have since been verified by the Pentagon, Department of Defense, and the New York Times. This is the OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT and the vindication for all of Tom DeLonge's outrageous claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       This brings us to the next question:
       <strong>
        Why now?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumably, the UFO phenomenon has been researched and kept quiet for much longer than the New York Time article admits. The program was always a secret before, so why the disclosure now? The videos the government shared are over a decade old, so why are they letting us see them now? Well, I have a few ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          First contact is coming soon:
         </strong>
         This is the most straight-forward answer. If you actually believe Tom DeLonge, then this is all part of a carefully planned rollout of the truth, and the information is being released bit by bit to prevent a panic.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          The UFO in the videos are a super-advanced human technology:
         </strong>
         I've heard a few theories that the UFO is a human technology that hasn't been made public yet. It could be the USA govenrment using this technology, or another country, or an individual un-affiliated with a government. If it's the USA's super-weapon, they could have released the video as a way of letting their enemies know that this technology exists, and we have it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          UFO False Flag:
         </strong>
         One of the popular theories floating around is that the various international government are planning a massive conspiracy of a flase-flag attack - creating a one-world government, and justifying the indefinitely expansion of the military-industrial complex.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Dis-information / Blurring the truth:
         </strong>
         One way to keep control over people is to control the information -- it seems like there is an active effort right now to keep people confused (with fake news, alternative facts, etc). I think the mainstream media acknowledging UFOs could be a method of keeping people in the dark about what's true and what's fake.  In a lot of ways, this seems like the most logical answer, but it's also the scariest. If the New York Times and the government are coordinating to spread false UFO stories, it is truly a smoking gun of the deep state's manipulation of the media and of truth.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There's a documentary called
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbwtYljl1E">
        "Mirage Men"
       </a>
       that's all about the government's effort to spread dis-information in the UFO community. When you watch this documentary, it makes it seem very likely that people like Tom DeLonge and Dr. Steven Greer are briefed with disinformation because their enthusiasm makes them easy targets. But that still leaves the question: if they are being used to spread disinformation, why? And why are there now official government releases that are verifying the disinformation? What's the end game?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the take away from all of this? What does it all mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever it means, it's something big. Either A) UFOs are here, and first contact is coming soon or B) We are all being manipulated blatantly, and on a mass scale. Either way it's terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think that if aliens came all the way here to destroy us, they would have done it already. This makes me inclined to say that if it truly is UFOs run by aliens, they are probably here for a non-violent reason... Whether that's research, culture, materials, or something else entirely, I don't know. But I think if they had malicious intent, it would already be too late, and we'd already be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason, I really hope the UFOs ARE of extra-terrestrial origin. If they aren't, we all have much bigger things to worry about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I'll end this long rant and open up the door for discussion. I've been obsessing over this recently (to the point that it's probably unhealthy)... but it's shocking to me that disclosure is happening, and the world doesn't seem to care. So let's talk about it:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         What do you think is the significance of the recent Pentagon UFO release?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What do you think is more likely: UFOs, Advanced Human Tech, False Flag, or a Disinformation campaign? Or another possibility?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you think Tom DeLonge is credible? Why or why not?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What do you think the government is trying to accomplish by revealing these videos and information?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Thanks in advance for anybody who participates in the conversation. I feel like I've been taking crazy pills, and I need help working through all of this.

       Interestingly enough, since the UFO videos have come out,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IXHnMpdqVA">
        Joe Rogan brought on a skeptic guest again and pushed the same opinion - that Tom DeLonge is full of shit.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Joe's been
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxAxjnzzHXA">
        surprisingly dismissive of the UFO announcement
       </a>
       -- if he is a paid shill, he seems to be pushing the "nothing to see here" agenda now.

       Well that is interesting. I obviously don't keep up with Rogan's podcasts but still, probably the likeliest explanation is that this is some kind of dog and pony show, just building the suspense or setting the stage for whatever "disclosure" or false flag may eventually happen. For my money there's no "if" about old Joseph being a shill.

       What do you think the government is trying to accomplish by revealing these videos and information?
Two things 1st I think private companies like spaceX will be using this "UFO" technology soon and it will be seen by so many people that it can't de disputed so the government can release some info knowing it'll be known anyways and the Government can't be seen as not knowing. 2nd I think this is a great way to show any non ally country what type of weapons the US had years ago as a threat and a warning to not get involved if US goes to war with NOKO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think Tom DeLonge is credible? Why or why not? 
Yes I think he is creditable, he is worth over $100 million dollars $100,000,000 is a lot of zeros and will get you meetings with people in high positions. I think he pieced together a lot of information and came to believe 99% of UFOs are manmade. Then he figured out where they're made, by who and for who. That information made him dangerous so TPTB brought him aboard to manage him and what he says. Before the Podesta leaks TD would be extremely open during interviews and say things that were true but not 100% believed because his sources weren't known. Now that his sources are known TD can't say anything that could get linked to someone who told TD private information. TD called the triangle crafts a variant of TR3Bs and said they were man made 100% and if anyone would've disputed him he would've said more but no one disputed it sadly.

       This Reddit thread was very compelling to read. Personally the motivation behind the slow disclosure is a mystery but the mere fact that the govt/msm are coordinating is quite alarming. I think that at this point in time the average person is so desensitized to the possibility of aliens that unless a grey crawled up on ones lap "we" wouldn't be real alarmed. Sad but true. I hope that it's not a manipulation without some real evidence behind it but this seems to be their( govt) usual signature. Maybe if there truly exists a higher life form than humans they could help us to stop acting like idiots. I will stay hopeful 👽

       Extremely good summary of the topic! Nice job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also can't stop thinking about this. Its seriously the biggest event in our lives, even if people don't realize it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the answer is much more complicated than most could even imagine. Its actually ALL you points together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is about to happen that has forced their hand. When I consider all the reasons why now, this one stands out above any others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strange way they're going about it must be so they can keep control of the roll out while also getting people to accept it without too much disruption. I actually thinks this has been culminating for quite a while now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom's academy is a huge part of their plan. Its packed full of the very people who could have been involved in the secret for a long time. They are gonna use this a the platform to "discover" and develop a bunch of new tech and science. Pretending they didn't already know about it, keeping them out of trouble, and profiting at the same time. Tom might not know exactly what he's gotten into, but I guarantee some on his team do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UFO phenomenon is many things. Some are ETs from far away, some from right here, some are drones, some ate piloted, some are secret human projects, some might be inner dimensional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some are nice, some are nasty, some are interested, and some are indifferent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And some might just be the head honchos around these parts. (Draco)
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess the big question then, is this a good thing or bad thing happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, its both. Good that we're moving into a time where the reality of the UFO phenomenon is being accepted as fact. Bad the the very ones who have been keeping it secret are now the same ones who are telling us what to believe.

       What I want to know is why bring UFOs to light at all, then suddenly and so quickly not hear anything about it again after that? It was pretty much since that day when there were news stories everywhere, now nothing. Why?

       Even without spy devices, they can monitor public speculation on the topic because they can see what people are posting on social media. They're probably more interested in gathering intel on public sentiment and interest levels in regards to the topic right now than they are on trying to bombard people with constant talk about it in the hopes of steering public opinion a specific way.

       . They've got it down to a Matrix-esque science how to manipulate the world. Feed the people a little, scour the internet for data, feed it into their simulation, and look at future predictions. Change some data around and better predict what might happen in several other scenarios.

       So a previous prediction says that

       One mental wall I see people have with the issue of Visitation is the phenomenon of abduction, which is all too real. People focus on dissecting aerial sightings like the Nimitz FLIR footage but dismiss airtight abduction cases like Linda Napolitano in NYC

       Genetics are a currency, and the Earth is full of different life in addition to Homo Sapien that make it a worthwhile destination. What sort of self respecting scientist travels light years to get to a research location and doesn’t do some probing?
      </p>
      <p>
       The trouble is I think some faction of the US government struck a deal with the Grey EBEns allowing continued abductions in exchange for a program of technological diplomacy that is ongoing both on and off planet.

       We humans now have alien tech (TR3B), but divulging the exact mechanisms of power production used by these spacecraft would render oil, coal, NG, nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, all instantly obsolete. The economy would have to transition off its dependency on the petrodollar. There’s many who wouldn’t want that.

       First off, let me say well done on the formatting.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 - Advanced Human Tech disguised used for Disinformation/Distraction. Also think even if the False Flag / NWO scenario we're true at one point, they have moved on and aren't that dumb. ET UFOs highly unlikely but assume they are out there somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - No. I tend to think he believes in what he is saying. Mark Hoppus' dad was in DoD. He is apparently a Mason (which I don't know how they even function anymore). Honestly, his email to John Podesta seemed kind of desperate to me. And I think he is probably being used as a tool for distraction/attention of the masses. It is interesting he chose to go on CNN first...who was responsible for the creation of the term "Fake News". And the same CNN that Larry King told a young Presidential hopeful Sir Slick Willy Cigar-in-Vagina Clinton himself that
       <em>
        Ted Turner loves you
       </em>
       and Clinton could
       <em>
        run the place
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       3 - Distraction. It's old tech they have disclosed at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS - it is all fascinating regardless of what is really going on.

       I honestly think most likely is the mirage men angle, the most benefit for deep state would be to have the truth be so obscured you can't know what's real anymore, they've been doing it with other subjects but UFOs could play well I to it, precisely because you'll have tom delonge come out and start sounding reasonable and believable to general public, only to find out it was all fake, then the last bit of confidence in knowing what's real has been further degraded. Confused people are easier to direct. (Dr. Red anyone? Lol)
That said, another possibility I dont think you mentioned Is that aliens are real, intent is malicious but they DONT want us dead, but rather controlled, just as the deep state wants. To me that's even scarier, that they want something of us but not simply to take our planet.
All that said, I'm really still not sure on this one. A lot of abductions can actually be explained by MK - esque experiments (voice of God attacks) and while aliens statistically have to exist.. I just don't think sufficiently advanced ones would fuck with an undeveloped species like us by sending a bunch of UFOs when we have video cameras.
