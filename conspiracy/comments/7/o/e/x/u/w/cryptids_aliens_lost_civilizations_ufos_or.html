    <div class="md"><p>Man, I keep having to bring this up, but google the McMartins and give Indictment: The McMartin Trial a watch to see how easy it is for kids to be coached into fake testimony en masse. </p>

<p>Basically the TL;DR is that the McMartins owned a day care center and during the “satanic child abuse” craze of the late 80’s they got accused of mass child sex abuse. It went to trial and was later discovered to be a massive case of bullshit with scared mothers and cops and therapists who want to catch a criminal coaching the kids into falsely accusing the McMartin family of horrible shit. They were all stuck in jail while awaiting trial and during the trial as well. Really fucking awful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trial lasted 7 years and cost $15 million. And nothing was found to happen after all that. Children have recanted testimony and it is used as a textbook example of how children can be coaxed to say anything and what not to do when dealing with children who are victims. </p>

<p>The main accuser also accused Ray Buckey of being able to fly in her accusation. She was shown to be mentally ill. </p>

<p>This isn’t even a conspiracy theory that it did or did not happen. It’s something everyone agrees about being part of the danger of mass hysteria in society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a personal story about alien vs demon theory. I used to see a shaman for quite a while who told me he worked with good aliens, ended up getting spiritually attacked;  it sucked. In trying to fix it came back to Jesus through research that only that name has the power to cast out negative entities &amp; demons.</p>

<p>Randomly met this lady that had a health related thing I was interested in buying. Went to her house, she randomly starts telling me how her house is a portal for aliens &amp; her friend sent an alien to protect her from all the lizard things she would see on the walls (in other realms) she was super into new age. I told her I knew exactly what she was talking about, told her a little bit about my experience with the shaman, as I started talking about Jesus &amp; how aliens may be demons the pressure dropped in the room like a big wooooosh &amp; she looked shocked and was like did you feel that. I was pretty surprised &amp; was like yeah what was that. Then she started getting all this energy flowing through her asking me if I wanted her to do a hands on healing to which I said no thank you. She called me later telling me she had to sleep all afternoon because of whatever happened. She called me a few times said she was going to talk to her friend that sent the alien for protection to see what was up &amp; wanted to call me the next day. Never heard from her again. Alien? demon? Trippy to say the least &amp; after quite a bit of experience with the spirit world, astral travel, glitches &amp; things of that nature I lean towards aliens are demons that can be stopped in the name of Jesus &amp; hyperdimensioanl warfare is real. </p>

<p>Where did I say it shouldn&#39;t be discussed? I think the topic of extraterrestrials and crypto is interesting, but discussions on r/conspiracy should center on conspiracies. Discussion of conspiracies can often involve these topics but the topics themselves are not conspiratorial (excepting discussion of cover-ups etc. which would be the conspiracy).</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to discuss these topics in the context of secret/hidden information etc but I disagree with OP suggesting that is what this sub is about. There are plenty of ET and crypto subs already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This pleadian thing has resonance with Valiant Thor. Mr. Thor waltzes onto our planet as a fully physical humanoid with few, if any distinguishing characteristics. Then he drops off the map, nobody gets any more information from him except for channeling.</p>

<p>Perhaps they are simulacrum, the humanoid aliens entirely are about trying to inform man about a definite conflict that surrounds earth. The nature of that conflict is up for interpretation, but I am of the position that it spans multiple planets, many years, and culminates in tampering with man&#39;s mind. Both physiologically I&#39;m a direct sense, and via lies we have been told on all sides.</p>

<p>It is my hope to dig to the bottom of this pile of information and make the most complete network I can. If pleadians show up, great, make sure to try and test their validity in every way. But, we&#39;re talking about humanoid aliens with psychic potential- how exactly do we know the way that&#39;s being used? </p>

I see patterns everywhere I look, I am hyper quantifying information, and I can feel and hear my body changing. There is work being done on my body somehow.

What we call our emotions is sort of like a subroutine, but you&#39;re naturally supposed to be able to create mind partitions to perform tasks. That&#39;s how psychic powers and magic systems work when you&#39;re in a place that is actually conducive to it.

    <div class="md"><p>I am being shown the same things as you, my friend. I&#39;ve tried to relay this message through mathematics, neural net operations, occultism/religious conceptualization, extraterrestrials, interdimensionals, etc. I have been shown that there exists this great duality of things, and consciousness may be abstracted to infinity realizing itself. It is both nothing and something, life and death, black and white. The specific variable nomenclature doesn&#39;t really matter, it&#39;s the fact that we are being SHOWN this vastly, beautifully complex architecture of the universe. Almost like geometry or boundaries or something. The shape of the boundary between X and Y is the same, so you can call the variables whatever diametric concept you want (good and bad, life and death...) </p>

<p>It is a boundary. If you view our timeline like it&#39;s got a structure like DNA, you can personally traverse through the dualism. I did so, that&#39;s when I saw the divine singularity. I do not do drugs of any variety stronger than weed. Never have. </p>

<p>If you are knowledgeable, you can make the same transition with left or right hand path structure, doesn&#39;t matter what you pick.

    <div class="md"><p>woah that is funky looking, however it does appears to be an artifact from his eye lids.  Go in photoshop and take look at the frame while blinking(eyes shut) and the next couple frames when the eyes open right before the eye colors corrects. if you take a look at the RGB values of the closed lids pixels where the blue eye colors are under the lid and the eye color when opened (the weird eye color) you will notice they are similar before correcting... just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>compression strategies include redrawing the previous frames seemingly unmoved/unchanged regions from frame to frame and/or over multiple frames to save space describing the same crap over and over.  example, still shot of a person in front of a white wall that has all sorts of depth of the white color due to shadows, etc, but the person doesnt shift much or any fast movements, you can compress the video by having the region that doesnt change just continue to display from the original frame and save describing those pixels every frame which is a waste.</p>

<p>some times software doesn&#39;t compress correctly when actively processing these colors regions and produces what we call artifacts from previous frames.  Fast moving video (think action scenes) compressed shows artifacts very time, though h.265 makes it smaller and the new algorithms actually do a really nice job these days at making fast moving video look great while compressing better than h.264.  I mention the fast action as a means to recreate artifacts quickly in h.264. Obviously he is not moving quickly in this video and actually he is quite still through the video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if this is fringe by this definition or not, but I do believe if people realized this everything else would fall into place. So this may just be the root and cure for all conspiracies. So here goes:</p>

<hr/>

<p>Beneath all your pain, all your thoughts, emotions and beliefs, there is this stillness, this space, this peace, freedom. Underneath anything and everything that society has superimposed on you, that others have superimposed on you, that you have superimposed on yourself, you simply are.</p>

<p>You are not the body, you are not the mind, on the ultimate level you are nothing that you seemingly appear to be.</p>

<p>On the surface, yes, you have an identity, you are someone and this someone you will remain even after any deeper realization, on the worldly level, your identity is true and real. It is also true that you are limited by your thoughts, emotions, by your beliefs. Which means you suffer, resist and feel pain.</p>

<p>But ultimately this is not the case. Ultimately, on the deepest level you are Freedom itself. You are the boundless beingness, pure space, awareness, love and peace, joy and wisdom, you are life. The source of all life and the end of it. You are the indivisible spark of the Source of all things, Divine consciousness. You are one with God, you are God that has split into many and is now playing a game of hide and seek with himself.</p>

<p>One of the greatest keys to uncovering this is to move out of time. As the great 13th century philosopher Meister Eckhart once said:</p>

<p>&quot;Time is what keeps the light from reaching us. There is no greater obstacle to God than time: and not only time but temporalities, not only temporal things but temporal affections, not only temporal affections but the very taint and smell of time.&quot;</p>

<p>Step out of time and into this moment. You will see that you can do this whenever you wish to do so. You can be free from time whenever you choose to do so. You may encounter peace, stillness, joy, even bliss. But it is also likely you will encounter your own pain. Look into it, embrace it, love it, welcome it, bring to light and seek to understand and unravel it. Let your breath help you along the way. If it helps, write your thoughts and emotions down on a piece of paper or on your computer. Bring your pain to awareness and you will slowly but surely dissolve it. </p>

<p>Beyond all your limitations lies freedom. Beyond all your thoughts, emotions, beliefs, your identity, everything you can know through your mind, beyond it all, underneath it all, as you, there is freedom. </p>

<p>There is not blankness there, there is not a dark void of emptiness. There is a void, but that void is peace and it is the source of all life. It is called many things, from the Tao, to the great Void, from Being, to God. But it is the Source of all things. And that thing is also who you are. Your deepest nature. Being in that place and acting from that place will infuse your actions with the highest truth and you will act in the best and highest good of yourself and the All. You will become a messenger of peace.</p>

<p>Only once all humanity knows this will there be true peace on this planet. </p>

<p>Even a glimpse of this is enough to make you wonder what lies beyond the veil of the mind and is encouragement enough to take you on the journey of your life. This is the final journey, a journey to the Absolute, to total and untarnished freedom, bliss and love. </p>

<p>It is not an easy journey, it can be a bumpy ride, filled with traps and facing one&#39;s own inner demons, it can in many ways be more difficult at first than living the ignorant life, but it is in my opinion the most important journey that you can undertake.  It is the journey that saves you and the whole planet.</p>

<p>Because in life you will always keep searching for happiness, for freedom, for peace and love. But you will never find it in the world, you cannot, because happiness, freedom is the building block of the world, it is underneath and interpenetrates all of reality. It is also the core of who you are.</p>

<p>Thus no matter how difficult it may be, looking within is the only permanent solution. Both for you and for the whole world.</p>

<p>Wishing you all the best. Much love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, what I am referring to is generally the core aspect of meditation. Time exists in the mind. Both past and future. What I am of course mainly talking about here is psychological time, the idea of some past nostalgia or pain and future hope and salvation. Stepping out of time is stepping into the Now. It is being aware of your breathing, of your surrounding, of your senses. The breath alone can be a wonderful portal to the now.
It is also being aware of your thoughts and emotions as they are here now.</p>

<p>You do not become separate from time, you simply see that you are ultimately beyond time. Time still exists on the relative level, but on the ultimate level time does not exist. There is only always now. By letting go of past and future and being aware of what is here now, you effectively step out of time.</p>

<p>There is a whole book written on this subject and one of the most clear and &quot;western&quot; explanations of what I&#39;m talking about as pertaining to freedom, peace and spirituality. I&#39;m talking about the book The Power of Now, by Eckhart Tolle. Although the book is quite &quot;mainstream&quot; (and people generally mistrust mainstream ideas and books, many times with good reason, in this case this mistrust is unneeded in my view), it is an absolute gem of wisdom.</p>

<p>You can buy it, but you can also check it out free in pdf form on Google, as they seemingly haven&#39;t taken it down. Just Google &quot;Power of Now pdf&quot; or something to that effect and it&#39;ll be there. If you enjoy it, buy it, it&#39;s a great book and was my personal introduction to spirituality almost a decade ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. </p>

<p>Time always remains there in a way. It&#39;s just that you see yourself as less &quot;in time&quot; and more &quot;outside of time&quot;. This usually isn&#39;t a one off thing, where you suddenly wake up and &quot;transcend time&quot; (although that definitely happens to some people - happened to the writer of the book I talk about above, Tolle for example). It&#39;s more of a process of letting go of the past and future. It&#39;s a process of technically letting go of time. Or rather - letting go of your entrapment in time, as time still remains present on some level.</p>

<p>For further elaboration on all of this I can also point you to one of my threads on another subreddit, which talks about stepping out of time (with a &quot;Christmasy&quot; twist, or rather using Christmas as an active metaphor):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree.</p>

<p>Once you see beyond it, it simply becomes a plane to navigate in. A part of the wonderful game of existence. However if you cannot and until you cannot see beyond it, you are trapped within it. As long as that is the case, for better or for worse to some degree it is a &quot;Matrix&quot; experience of sorts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not about becoming a God, it is coming back into unity with Being, Oneness, Source - which is what some people refer to as &#39;God&#39;. You don&#39;t come to it through devotion or worship of the intellect, you come to it through awareness. And you aren&#39;t joining any group in the process, because the process is self-exploratory. All of this is something one has to experience for themselves, the peace and freedom beyond the mind is there, but one should never need to believe something or join any group to experience it. There is nobody to control you because you aren&#39;t really becoming part of any system or cult. That is, from my perspective at least, spirituality in its purest form, without any intermediary, without and groups you need to join or devotion to anyone or anything, except the devotion to Freedom, Being, Silence, Stillness and with it Love, all of which is at the core of reality.</p>

<p>But I definitely agree with you that such groups (various metaphysical and spiritual cults that are devoid of true compassion, love and filled with selfishness and self-importance, gurus that are corrupt and filled with ego...) exist and one should be weary of them. I however, don&#39;t wish to promote any such groups and that wasn&#39;t the intention of my post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really glad about that :)  </p>

<p>The more people come to these realizations (to me it has also been through direct experience through meditative practices over the span of the last decade), the sooner the world will come to a place of universal peace and compassion. People not knowing this is in my opinion the root problem in our society and makes any conspiracies and with them conspirators in power even possible. With such inner realizations people would be far more difficult and ultimately,  impossible to control and delude.</p>

<p>My favorite movies the Nolan Movies/Tv show go really deep in the rabbit hole. I posted this comment a few days ago:</p>

<p>Westworld describes humanities creation with Ford being Yahweh, the park being the Earth and the &quot;dream world&quot; outside the park being other dimensions with &quot;other parks&quot; where the puppet masters live and more especially with the symbolism (there&#39;s a scene where ford is with a younger version of himself (his son?) and a rattlesnake appears).</p>

<p>The Batman Series has a ton of hidden truths from the &quot;league of shadows&quot;, the Taoist idea of balance between two polarities very similar to the force with Joker as the dark, Harvey Dent as the light and Batman somewhere in the middle and the necessity of both poles (Notice a similarly to Jediism, to the idea of &quot;rising into the light out of a prison&quot;.</p>

<p>The Prestige, where the entire movie is a actually a trick to redirect your attention &quot;from the real magic&quot; behind the scenes (Nicola Tesla reference was not a coincidence) much like much of popular culture is exactly that. It raises the question is it worth it to know the trick or is it better just to appreciate the mysticism as &quot;magic&quot;?</p>

<p>Interstellar with the amazing scene where Matthew McConaughey guides himself throughout his life from a different dimension outside of time. Do we have a &quot;higher self&quot; doing something similar?</p>

<p>Oh and don&#39;t forget my favorite of all Inception. Being able to create worlds in dreams. The very idea that this post is sharing. Are we all parts of the subconscious one larger concioussness &quot;dreaming&quot;? How many layers are there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one has intrigued me for a long time...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/1twrom/iama_married_mother_of_3_who_has_had_vivid_alien/">https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/1twrom/iama_married_mother_of_3_who_has_had_vivid_alien/</a></p>

<p>There are a few people in the thread who offer up some suggestions about the type of math she suddenly understands and it seems to really ring a bell.   I started learning about the math and found it to be really crazy stuff.   It&#39;s a kind of natural, inherent &quot;math fabric&quot; of the universe.  It&#39;s sort of like numerology but not.  For example, 7 isn&#39;t just 7.   7 is also 6 and 1.   It&#39;s also 5 and 2.   It&#39;s 4 and 3 too.   The numbers 25, 250, 2500, 3400 and 5200 and 6000000001 are all 7 too.   It sounds crazy but I found it fascinating.   There are people on Youtube building electrical coils based on some of this math and they&#39;re reporting strange &amp; unexpected things.   </p>

<p>The hybrid alien thing is pretty damn interesting too.   I&#39;ve seen two UFOs.   The very moment that I saw the first one, I had an epiphany.   It was a &quot;classic&quot; triangle UFO.  I&#39;d seen it a dozen times before on the internet, on TV, in books...   and then I saw it with my own two eyes.    I&#39;ve also seen or heard common stories about bigfoot, alien grays, chupacabras, ghosts &amp; demons... all that crazy stuff...  when I saw that triangle UFO I realized that people might not be lying about all that stuff.   They might&#39;ve really seen those things, like I really just saw a triangle UFO.    So... I&#39;m open minded about the hybrid alien baby thing.   You never know.    </p>

<p>Honestly it&#39;s so perfect that it makes me think it&#39;s fake. The lack of supposed glyphs and schematics, the mathematical jargon, and the almost perfectly played character of the &quot;simpleton small town mother&quot; kind of shows that this is an ordinary reddit hoax. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah I definitely do believe in a lot of UFO shit but I&#39;m a lot more skeptical about abductions and that shit. It seems like she was playing a character with the &quot;small town mother gets wrapped up in weird shit&quot; trope. Not to mention that learning alien math doesn&#39;t make you cognizant of human mathematical jargon. I think she might have read about holofractal and toroid math and shit and just made up a character based on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a thought the other day. Hold with me for a sec - </p>

<p>What if the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs was sent here to prevent Velociraptor from evolving into a more advanced social reptilian species? </p>

<p>It would be easy to redirect a space rock from our asteroid belt, and wouldn’t leave the radioactive fallout of bombing. There’s evidence to suggest that raptors of this type had many of the same factors that contributed to human social foundation:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Pack hunting requiring communication</li>
<li>  Bipedal locomotion, leaving two limbs available for evolving to serve different functions </li>
<li>  They live in groups to defend against predation, save on resources, and rear young</li>
<li>  There’s even the possibility of rudimentary social hierarchies in raptors</li>
</ul>

<p>If some contactees are to be believed, the reptilian threat is very real. Once the potential reptilians were wiped out, The Greys set up camp on the moon and in the Earth’s mantle so that they could guide the expedited evolution of a species in their image, but from Earth’s genetic base. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was very young, like 2nd or 3rd grade, we were out in the back yard having a bbq with the neighbors. As we were hanging out, I saw a bright light pop into the sky somewhat near us. It was about half to a quarter of the size of a full moon and clearly artificial. It hovered for a while, then split into 4 smaller lights and shot off in four different directions. A little while later, it popped back in view and the four lights came back together, then vanished. </p>

<p>Of course I told all the adults what I saw and no one believed me. A decade later my dad was working overnights in a very rural farm area and saw the same thing. </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know what it was even probably two+ decades later, but it cemented my belief that we are not alone in the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not familiar with the acronym. What&#39;s TMOR? </p>

<p>As far as what they&#39;re doing here your guess is as good as mine. The &quot;trying to observe&quot; aspect is valid, as is &quot;We&#39;re in a zoo&quot;. If we do it to less intelligent (and with dolphins/corvids perhaps equally intelligent species) what&#39;s to say aliens wouldn&#39;t? They know we&#39;re sufficiently under-developed to make any real discoveries so they don&#39;t need artificial walls, similar to a safari trip in Africa. </p>

<p>My personal favorite and the one I believe  strongest in, even through I have no solid evidence, is that they&#39;ve been here since the beginnings of civilization and they&#39;ve been influencing/affecting himan policy. If not from the beginning, at least for a significant amount of time. </p>

<p>Two hundred years ago, we were waging war on horseback, living primarily on farms, and heating/cooling our meager houses with fire much like we would have been doing 2000 years ago. and for millenia before that. Today I can use electricity to remotely access my refrigerator to see what items I need to use electricity to have them delivered (more and more using electricity to power those vehicles) and using electromagnets a speaker in my bedroom can tell the electric air system in my car to turn on as I&#39;m getting ready for work or unlock my car door from the other side of the world if my friend/family member needs to access it for some reason. I can even turn it on and allow them to drive it, all (or primarily) with the power of electricity. If I have a solar system and a battery pack I can do most of these things for free using a star 93,000,000 miles away. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve also gone from never having left the ground in 1782 to powered flights in in 1903. We broke the sound barrier in 1947 only 44 years later, and then placed man (assuming you believe the Apollo program which 1 do) on another celestial body in 1969. In 29 years, we went from that to the first permanent base outside of the atmosphere (The ISS in 1998). If everything goes to plan for SpaceX, not even 30 years later in 2024 we will have started the first permanent colony on Mars. </p>

<p>Humans are smart, and some are incredibly so, I still don&#39;t think they&#39;re responsible for our major discoveries. I think there&#39;s a reason the Black Budget exists, and I think there&#39;s a reason that Area 51 has guards with machine guns stopping people from even getting close. Lots of military activity happens at Nellis, including classified research, and I can drive right up to the front gate. Roswell wasn&#39;t a weather balloon, and if anything I believe the things my dad and I saw were either planned tests at night in rural areas where few people would see them or a mechanical malfunction. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with Doctor Who, but I&#39;d compare it to The Silence, minus the magic memory erase thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yeah, I see your point, I just find it kinda hard to believe that an alien race that advanced has made so many mistakes. The problem is that the human mind is both incredibly amazing and infinitely stupid. If you look for something hard enough you will convince yourself that you have found it, regardless of whether or not you actually have. One cannot set out to look for something, but instead set out to look for nothing, if that makes any sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither can I, but you were very young, could have been your imagination, or maybe it was fireworks, but you have to realize that it being aliens is an extraordinary claim, and thus requires extraordinary evidence, I can’t quite account for what your dad experienced and that does bolster your claim, but it’s still just two eyewitness accounts, at least in this instance. It’s certainly interesting, as for the Area 51 stuff, well if they ever had done research on alien stuff there, they aren’t anymore. With how widespread the theory is, it would be monumentally stupid.  </p>
