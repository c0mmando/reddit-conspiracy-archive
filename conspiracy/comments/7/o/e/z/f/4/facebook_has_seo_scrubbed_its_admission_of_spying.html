        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi folks, I was in another sub, arguing with a guy about Facebook. </p>

<p>He insisted that they can&#39;t be and wouldnt be listening to you through your mic. </p>

<p>I told him that last year, there were reports that Facebook listened to your mic, for the purposes of targeted advertising, whenever you were going to post something. When you opened the text box it began listening, and once you hit enter, it stopped. If you left your text window open all day, then they would listen that whole time. Facebook admitted it, and offered a link with a switch that allowed you to opt out.</p>

<p>After exchanging with this guy on reditt, I went looking for an article about that admission. All I could find is hundreds of articles, insisting that they dont, never had, never would, and that it&#39;s a technical impossibility. I went three pages into my Google search results before I found an article that had the position of &quot;maybe they could do it&quot;</p>

<p>Can you guys help me find a page where Facebook admits this program? No matter how I rearrange the words and phrases, my google-fu is not good enough.</p>

<p>I&#39;m speculating that Facebook has essentially scrubbed this information from the net. They sure have scrubbed it from public consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t remember this. I mean people make claims all the time but nobody has proven them. I&#39;d love it if they did and it would be easy to do if it happened, yet...</p>

<p>It will ask for permission to use the microphone if you use its camera or voice recording, but you always have to take an action to be recorded and recordings aren&#39;t used to tailor what you see (but check their privacy policy about how they use this data anyway, might be like Google where it&#39;s stored and not anonymised). Are you thinking about the permissions? I guess if you start recording a voice message in a chat/post it might carry on for a while, I don&#39;t know for how long. But you&#39;d be able to see this going on. Test it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have any knowledge of what Facebook actually does in this regard, but here is their complete statement: <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/facebook-does-not-use-your-phones-microphone-for-ads-or-news-feed-stories/">https://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/facebook-does-not-use-your-phones-microphone-for-ads-or-news-feed-stories/</a></p>

<p>They say specifically: &quot;We only access your microphone if you have given our app permission and if you are actively using a specific feature that requires audio. This might include [list of things omitted]&quot;.</p>

<p>Of course, they could be recording everything you say, and storing it on their servers forever, and their statement would still be 100% true, as all of their features (including the &quot;receiving notifications in the background while you&#39;re not using your phone&quot; feature) could &quot;require audio&quot;.  However, most journalists covering the topic didn&#39;t read their statement as carefully as their lawyer wrote it, thus the misleading headlines.</p>

<p>I sure as hell didn&#39;t imagine this. </p>

<p>I remember the white page with the blue switch. They said it was like a pilot program and wasn&#39;t global. Like a test in a region. They offered the opt out page and a link to it, filled with legalese about the recording. </p>

<p>But I guess they successfully scrubbed it. Thanks for your replies and attention guys.</p>
