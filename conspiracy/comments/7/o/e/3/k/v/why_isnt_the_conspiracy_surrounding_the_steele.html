       Disclaimer: Since I will be accused of partisan hackery, I will state that I voted for Obama twice and supported Bernie Sanders in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a sub about conspiracy, I'm confused why the Steele dossier does not arouse more suspicion around here. I know there has been a migration of users from the politics sub that hate Trump and will defend anything anti-Trump, but this should not be a partisan issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we know already is the Clinton campaign paid for the dossier and only admitted this after Congress had subpoenaed bank records and they knew it would come out. We know Steele met with reporters and briefed them on the information in the dossier, even though he had not corroborated everything inside. The reporters then published this unverified information.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Congress has been investigating the dossier, we've seen Fusion GPS obstruct at every turn. They tried to shield their bank records from Congress and the public, gave their testimony behind closed doors and plead the fifth numerous times. At the same time, the FBI has missed many deadlines to release their documents related to the dossier. Only under threat of contempt of Congress did they finally release the documents a couple days ago, at least six months after the initial request was made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads to the biggest question that isn't being asked here. Was the dossier used as intelligence in a FISA court to get a warrant to surveil the Trump transition team?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you dislike Trump and you don't care, but imagine it was happening to someone you support. If the dossier was used to get a FISA warrant, it's a very dangerous precedent to set. A politician can pay third parties (including foreign agents) to gather information on their opponent and then pass that information to the FBI to have their opponent spied on? This is not a partisan issue, this is about government corruption, the surveillance state and Republicans shouldn't be the only ones concerned.

       The Washington Free Beacon paid for opposition research, but Steele was not on board creating the dossier until after the Free Beacon had stopped funding it and Clinton's campaign picked it up. As for your "No" answer, you're going to have to back that up with evidence.

        During a night of heavy drinking at an upscale London bar in May 2016, George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, made a startling revelation to Australia’s top diplomat in Britain: Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton.
       </p>
       <p>
        The hacking and the revelation that a member of the Trump campaign may have had inside information about it were driving factors that led the F.B.I. to open an investigation in July 2016 into Russia’s attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of President Trump’s associates conspired.

       Yeah, because information received from someone who is drunk totally justify an investigation into a whole political team.   In case you missed it, this makes the intelligence community look worse not better, and all in a short sighted attempt to provide an alibi from messing up with the Steele dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning 'political dirt' the Russians had.   Let us grant, for the sake of the argument, that this story is true.   What emails do you think are being referred to?  Do you think it was the DNC emails, which did the most harm, of which the last one is dated to MAY 25 2016?  You know, after this supposed conversation!  Do you think it might have been the 30,000 thousands emails that everyone was talking about during the investigation, no sorry, during that matter with Clinton?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...Thus, the authors assure us, “We don’t believe the Steele dossier was the trigger for the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russian meddling.” Instead, the dossier that Simpson, Fritsch, and Steele were trumpeting as a smoking gun during the 2016 campaign is now portrayed as having merely “corroborated reports the bureau had received from other sources, including one inside the Trump camp.” That one source? Why, Papadopoulos, of course. (The op-ed here links to the Times’ blockbuster Papadopoulos report this past weekend.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Just one problem: What did the Justice Department and FBI do when the FBI received reports from these sources? They got a FISA warrant for Carter Page.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the FBI had such information about Page, it certainly did not get that information from Papadopoulos.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I explained in my aforementioned column, to get a FISA warrant to surveil an American citizen, the government has to show the FISA court probable cause that the citizen is engaged in clandestine activities on behalf of a foreign power (here, Russia), which activities may involve violations of federal criminal law. If the FBI had such information about Page, it certainly did not get that information from Papadopoulos — that’s clear from the Statement of the Offense filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller when Papadopoulos pled guilty a few weeks ago. To date, the only source we know of for such allegations against Page is the dossier. And at present, there is no basis to believe such allegations were ever verified by the FBI (wholly apart from the fact that they are highly unlikely on their face, and that Page has both vigorously denied them and filed a libel suit over them).
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the significant questions that have been raised about the Obama Justice Department’s use of the dossier, it is understandable that the Fusion GPS founders who produced the dossier would want to downplay its significance in triggering the FBI’s Russia investigation. But that was not the tune they were playing at the time the FBI’s investigation was actually triggered. Back then, they couldn’t say enough about the Trump treachery Steele had purportedly uncovered, and with Election Day fast approaching, they wanted that story told far and wide.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now . . . not so much.

       This.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Washington Free Beacon paid for opposition research that eventually was directed towards Trump Org deals. Based on the discussions during the Republican debates, it is very likely that the Republican dossier dealt with Trump deals with the Italian mafia with a focus on his Atlantic City casinos. I don't remember any Republicans mentioning Felix Sater, Tevfik Arif, or Michael Cohen.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Republicans stopped the finance of the investigation, Fusion GPS was directed to take a better look into his business dealings. It could be possible that Fusion or the original investigators began investigating his business deals with the Russian mafia, such as Trump Soho, but that was left to Steele.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia was also not a focus of the election at the beginning of the election. By the time that Steele was hired, Russia was the main focus of the election.

       Time will tell if the Dossier was used as the basis for the FISA warrant. What is disturbing, in my opinion, is that the two major things being used to justify the investigation behind the Trump/Russia election collusion claims are both based on potential fabrications. The DNC did not allow the FBI to their computers in response to the email hacks. The DNC used the company Crowdstrike who was started by an anti Putin Russian and they are the ones who concluded it was Russia behind the hacks. The other major item is the Steele Dossier which is political oposition research and not an intelligence report. Political opposition research is largely fabrication/ exaggeration and should not be taken as fact.

       Your source is one of the worst offenders of partisan hackery out there right now. Also, Steele was not involved until after the Free Beacon dropped out. They never received any of the information included in the dossier. You are repeating partisan lies.

       I agree, but we can't go back in time and change things. I would have loved Erik Prince and Carter Page to testify in public, but I am perfectly happy getting a transcript of the testimony.
      </p>

       My question to you is, do you want these transcripts to be released? Why do you think they are being hidden from the public?

       You think Glen Simpson, Chris Steele or anyone in Fusion GPS would have access to FISA applications? The only people that would have access to those warrants would be the FBI, FISA courts, and the DoJ, and they are not going to release that info to the public.

       If Strozk leaked FISA warrant info to a private citizen in Britain, then I'd be the first to call for Strozk to be charged. As of now, the claim has no supporting evidence.

       Specifically it requires clearance to the specific case files to access them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A counter intelligence agent working on one case doesn't usually know what the guy down the hall is working on unless it's something they're working on together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well more accurately it's probably a team not individual agents on each case but point remains, you're not likely to have access to other team cases

        From September 2015 to May 2016, Simpson was retained by a conservative newspaper, the Washington Free Beacon, to collect opposition information on presidential candidate Donald Trump.[6][7][8]
       </p>
       <p>
        After the Free Beacon stopped funding the research, the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign's law firm, Perkins Coie, picked up the deal with Simpson’s company Fusion GPS.[7] In June 2016, Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent, to obtain information on Trump. Steele used his "old contacts and farmed out other research to native Russian speakers who made phone calls on his behalf".[9] After November 2016, funding from the Democratic Party ceased, and Simpson reportedly spent his own money to fund further work on the dossier.[10]
       </p>
       <p>
        On August 22, 2017, Simpson was questioned for 10 hours by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a closed-door meeting. The Committee did not release a transcript of the hearing. Simpson reportedly did not reveal the identities of his clients.[11]
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       My take is; the proceeding has not been made public to protect the identities of clients of GPS Fusion. I could be wrong.

       Perhaps the powers that be didn't want their testimony to be public. Perhaps they're under some king of gag order while the investigation is ongoing. They've stated publicly many times that they'd like it to be on the public record. Maybe that's theatrics, who knows. Maybe it'll come to light. What's sure is that this whole thing is far more complicated than the shrill proclamations that it's all Hillary's fault. Not that she's not guilty of a lot of shit.

       After their attempt to block the special counsel’s access to their bank records, meaning that soon their bank records are going to reveal what they’ve been up to, Simpson published that letter in the NYT claiming that they wanted the testimony to be released.

       Statement From 8/23/2017
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yesterday, Glenn Simpson spent the entire day answering questions of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee staff, pursuant to a written agreement from 
the committee's chair and ranking member that was reached some weeks ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr. Simpson told the truth and so far has been the only witness to fully 
cooperate with the committee. The transcript reveals all of Mr. Simpson's 
testimony based on the hours of questioning from staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee can release the transcript, if it so chooses. But after 
spending an entire day answering questions, and zero testimony from any 
other witness, calling Mr. Simpson to a hearing, I think he means an open 
hearing, serves no investigative purpose other than to try to find out the 
identities of clients and sources which are protected as matters of 
privilege and in the case of sources, protected as matters of safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        We appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and will do so. At 
the end of the day, that transcript is the committee's. It's not ours.

       That is Simpson's public statement. He said one thing publicly while behind the scenes he was doing another.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Foy said Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson rebuffed the committee's request six months earlier to testify publicly and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination "to negotiate for a closed-door interview."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Despite his public statements, Mr. Simpson and his attorney demanded during the interview that the transcript be kept confidential," Foy said. "Mr. Simpson has refused to answer dozens of questions voluntarily, and has failed to provide the Committee with documents and responses to follow-up questions after the interview."
       </p>
       <p>
        "The Committee’s invitation for Mr. Simpson to testify at a public hearing remains on the table," he added.

      <p>
       Fusion GPS was up to some shady shit. They were involved with Manafort in his crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Podesta Group got so freaked out about Fusion GPS, they folded up shop and left town. One of the most powerful lobbying firms in Washington DC doesn't just close their doors out of the blue because they want to spend more time with the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that their bank records have been unsealed, the shit is about to hit the fan for Fusion and they're going to take a bunch more criminals down with them.

       This is entirely false. Fusion GPS did no work with Manafort and did no work with the Podesta Group.

       I'm sure that can be true.

       This still doesn't negate Grassley's promise to hold a vote to release the transcripts and his intent on voting for the release. This still doesn't negate Fusion's multiple requests to release the transcripts. We can never tell what happened unless the transcripts get released. I'm sure you would love to see their transcripts to see all of the criminal activity they are involved in, right?

       Do you want to see those transcripts? Wouldn't you love to see Fusion get exposed in their 21+ hours of testimony?

       I think Fusion behind the scenes made a deal to keep those transcripts secret because of the names they named. The names they tried to keep secret by blocking access to their bank records. They could publicly state that they want them made public because they know there is a deal in place to keep them secret. For now anyways.

       Maybe some of those names are why Podesta folded.

       This doesn't make any sense either. Podesta is much more likely to be afraid of relevations coming from Manafort and Gates. Fusion never worked close to Tony Podesta.

       They don't want their bank records out because they were working previously for an NGO ran by Prevezon, which was accused of money laundering. They were previously working for what many would perceive as a corrupt organisation.

       <p>
        After the postelection publication of a dossier by a former British spy into those connections — which included some salacious claims — John Podesta met with Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the firm that commissioned the opposition research, to compare notes on Russia’s involvement, according to an associate of Mr. Podesta.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the general election season, the firm’s research was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, though John Podesta has told congressional investigators that he had no knowledge of those payments. The associate said the meeting came as Mr. Simpson was considering whether, and how, his firm could continue its Russia-related Trump research. A spokeswoman for Mr. Simpson’s firm, Fusion GPS, declined to comment.
       </p>

       Nah. I deserved those downvotes. I was confusing Fusions involvement with Tony Podesta when it was actually John Podesta that Fusion was working with.

       Tony Podesta was involved with Manafort in the Ukrainian Lobbying deal.

       It's not critical thinking to assume that getting a scoop from the people who are literally questioned for this under closed doors is getting a biased opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's called being skeptical, especially based on this entire case. It kinda seems more justified than to blindly accept. However, I guess my critical thinking machine is on the fritz and I need to rely on the kindness of strangers like I'm fucking Blanche.

       On your final point I agree wholeheartedly, the public is starved for information and it's detestable that we're forced to only hear one side of the story.

      <p>
       More to the point, I just thought your reply was dismissive of the information entirely which I wanted to point out was sort of simple-minded.  "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain an idea without accepting it" as the quote goes; I like to think that many of the silent readers here do just that: entertain these ideas, read these articles and consider them without accepting them until they're able to build what they feel is an accurate enough view.

       This is the core of the corruption that occurred in 2016.  If the reports are true, the dossier was used to justify FISA surveillance against Carter Page.   Political opposition research was utilized by one political group to mobilize the surveillance apparatus against their political rivals.   That is easily the scandal of the century.  But it also implicates a lot of institutions that you simply can't criminally implicate in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean just think about this.  The dossier was compiled by an 'ex' British intelligence agent, based on his 'Russian' contacts.  This was shared with an FBI agent in Rome in July of 2016.   Last week you had Downer, an Austrilian diplomat come out, and say, no no guys, what really started this whole think was that drunk Papadopoulos said something about some emails that the Russians had.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing reeks like it is a 5-eyes operation to guarantee a particular outcome in the US election.  I mean we know that Clapper and Brennan acted politically against one political actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real scandal would implicate our own intelligence and the intelligence of Britain, and the rest of the 5 eyes basically running a domestic election op.

       The FISA warrant on Carter Page is entirely justified.

      <p>
       The FBI also had much more intel on Carter Page than what was included in the dossier. If you have an American that was caught up in a SVR spy ring in NYC in 2013 and joins your campaign only to interact with Russian government officials and Rosneft execs to discuss sanctions, then you might have hired a Russian intel asset.

         Manafort was laundering millions of Russian and Ukrainian cash in NYC in the months leading up to and in March 2016 when he was appointed to the campaign.

         Dmytro Firtash has been under intense scrutiny by the FBI and was under extradition orders to the states. Firtash has been arrested since 2014. Based on the FBI's case into Firtash, they would have access to records showcasing the money laundering that Manafort did in that time period. Dmytro Firtash has deep ties to Semyon Mogilevich and the Russian mafia.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There was public knowledge that Manafort was in debt $30 million to Oleg Deripaska going into the campaign. Also in debt to Deripaska was Konstantin Kilimnik, Manafort's Ukrainian deputy that is a well known GRU intelligence officer. If Manafort was speaking to someone that was well known Russian intelligence officer, then his communications would have been picked up legally. We now know that Manafort was in constant contact with Kilimnik during the campaign about their debt to Deripaska and how they would be able to pay it off by selling Manafort's influence.

       That is an allegation at this point that remains to be proven in a court of law.  Why are you bringing up Manafort now,  Manafort could be guilty of all of those things, but if he was indirectly busted by the surveillance warrant that was justified by political opposition research, Manafort is going to walk.

       You don't need a FISA warrant to get people's bank records. This doesn't make any sense. Nothing in Mueller's indictment on Manafort is from a FISA warrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will eventually see more about Manafort's discussions with Oleg Deripaska and Konstantin Kilimnik over their $30 million debt and the events during the RNC platform change. That is where a FISA warrant would be useful.

       You brought up Manafort in a context of a FISA warrent received for Carter Page, now you either meant that there was some connection there, or you brought it up to deflect from the issue being discussed. However, you missed the point, if the investigation into Manafort was in any way justified by a bullshit warrant, any findings afterwards are not going to matter.

       Nope, I purely brought up Manafort's FISA warrant because it was relevant to the topic of FISA warrants. Very simple connection. I still stand by Manafort's warrant being entirely valid.

       If the investigation finds non money laundering crimes committed, like influence peddling to settle a debt to Oleg Deripaska with help from GRU officers, would that be good use of a FISA warrant?

       Yeah they were left alone because those 2 americans that were attempted to be recruited by the SVR never accepted their advances and gave them any documents.

       Again, for people who can read. The dossier claims he met with Sechin, and that lifting sanctions and sale of Resneft shares was discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Page did not meet Sechin, he met a long time friend who is in investor relations at Rosneft and they watched a soccer match.  The corroboration is contained in Page stating that maybe they discussed the sale of Rosneft in passing, it was in the news, he can't recall, but he certainly was not offered shares for a quid-pro-quo.  In other words the key facts of the dossier where false.  At this point the word corroboration is equivocated, and I suspect most sane people can see through the political chicanery.

       You are just making things up now.  We have no idea the extent that SVR interacted with the female in the financial industry.  We do know that Page emailed back and forth and passed documents concerning the energy industry.  Not classified material, publicly available energy information concerning the energy industry of which he is a part of to someone he did not know was an SVR agent.

       Are you trying to say that my claim is that Kalugin left the county because of the relevations in the dossier? That's not what I'm trying to say at all.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The claim from the dossier is that Kalugin fled (pre-dossier release) because Russia feared he would be caught up in the FBI counter intel investigation due to his role in the election meddling. There was no press release at the time of his departure, so there would have been no reason for the public to have known about this. The Russian embassy said that was not the reason for his departure and he was never involved in any election meddling.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The corroboration is that several reports claim that Kalugin was in fact under investigation by the FBI at the time he fled the country for his role in the election meddling.

       No, I am saying that the dossier contains a claim, that Kalugin left, which is made is the middle of September.  He left in August.   That he left is not a confirmation of the dossier, I hope that is at least obvious, as the dossier is written after the fact.  The reason why he left is the claim in the dossier, which is only corroborated later in MSM pieces which cite the dossier itself.

potential intelligence sources being targeted by the SVR.
The potential source referred to as "Female-1" below was a female
employee of a financial consulting firm in New York City.
The potential source referred to as "Female-2" below was another female
recruitment target located in New York City:

questions, answers to which I could not find in open sources.
Due to that I am interested to find information from paid
publications and opinions of independent people who discuss
these topics amongst themselves behind closed doors .
There was a positive response without any feelings of rejection.
But there was a problem with [Female-2]
        <strong>
         I have lots of ideas about such girls but these ideas are not actionable
because they don't allow to get close enough.
        </strong>
        And in order to
be close you either need to fuck them or use other levers to
influence them to execute my requests.
So when you tell me about girls, in my experience, it's very rare that something workable will come of it.

       It's not enough on its, but having SVR agents possess that intel that you are very eager to join Russian oil projects would be used as further pull for them to recruit Americans to become assets. Even this still would not be enough on it's own, but US intel agencies would clearly see this as the SVR using Gazprom deals to recruit Page further.

       The CIA also has the capability to spy on people like Igor Sechin and his associates, and would be able to intercept discussions they have about what Page was doing in Moscow and what he discussed with Rosneft executives. If they were able to determine from intercepts that an American was benefiting from the brokerage sale of Rosneft and was conducting secret negotiations on sanctions that involved Rosneft execs, then they could unmask Page further and legally place a FISA warrant on him.

       To kind of wind down this discussion.  We have seen that my interlocutor can't back up his assertion that the dossier has been verified, when an attempt is made, we find out that corroboration means stating something completely wrong,  or making a claim about an event after the fact, and being quoted itself as evidence that the claim is corroborated.

       This subject is where our investigative efforts should be.  How was the FISA warrant justified, and who is responsible.   There is a scandal underneath to make the laws tremble.

      <p>
       I suggest reading this. From all information I can find, the dossier was not used as justification, but rather a "coffee boy" blabbing at a bar in London.

        This includes approval from the secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor the communications of Carter Page, two of the officials said.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Could it be possible that the FBI was able to corroborate some of what the dossier said Page did in Moscow in July 2016? There was already evidence that was public that showed Carter Page was in Moscow to negotiate Rosneft business deals.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very possible and legal that the CIA was able to spy on Russian nationals that Page was interacting with while he was in Moscow in June 2016 and December 2016.

        Erovinkin was a key aide to Igor Sechin, a former deputy prime minister and now head of Rosneft, the state-owned oil company, who is repeatedly named in the dossier.

       No, because this is meaningless statement.  Was Carter page in Moscow when the dossier alleges, yes.  Did he talk to who the dossier alleges, no.

       <p>
        Speaking in July 2016, a Russian source close to Rosneft President, PUTIN close associate and US-sanctioned individual, Igor SECHIN, confided the details of a recent secret meeting between him and visiting Foreign Affairs Advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, Carter PAGE.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to SECHIN's associate, the Rosneft President (CEO) had raised with PAGE the issues of future bilateral energy cooperation and prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western
sanctions against Russia. PAGE had reacted positively to this demarche by SECHIN but had been generally non-committal in response.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During a night of heavy drinking at an upscale London bar in May 2016, George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, made a startling revelation to Australia’s top diplomat in Britain: Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton.
       </p>
       <p>
        Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear. But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians’ role.

       By the way, that last story is hilarious. In it, it mentions that Clinton was completely against the idea of Russians hacking

       server and denied it... because that would have made her look bad.

       Claim
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Speaking in July 2016, a Russian source close to Rosneft President, PUTIN
close associate and US-sanctioned individual, Igor SECHIN, confided the
details of a recent secret meeting between him and visiting Foreign
Affairs Advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, Carter PAGE.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to SECHIN's associate, the Rosneft President (CEO) had raised
with PAGE the issues of future bilateral energy cooperation and
prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western
sanctions against Russia. PAGE had reacted positively to this demarche
by SECHIN but had been generally non-committal in response.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of the substance of their discussion, SECHIN's associate said that the Rosneft
President was so keen to lift personal and corporate western sanctions imposed on the
company, that he offered PAGE associates the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent
(privatised) stake in Rosnett in return PAGE had expressed interest and confirmed that were TRUMP elected President, then sanctions on Russia would be lifted.

       </p>
       <p>
        "Something may have come up in a conversation," Page replied. "I have no recollection, and there's nothing specifically that I would have done that would have given people that impression."

        MR. PAGE: I didn't I had a brief lunch with Andrey Baranov as well.

        MR. SWALWELL: My direct question to you and the direct answer I want is, what
did you discuss?
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. PAGE: Yeah. We talked about general markets and also -- you know, I was
planning to give a speech, you know, for New Economic School and the media the following
day, and so I asked them for Some thoughts about my speech.
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SWALWELL: Did you talk about the 2016 election that had just happened a
month earlier?
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. PAGE: They expressed general -- yeah, it came up, and they expressed
general interest in it.
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SCHIFF: And when you met with Mr. Baranov, you met with him in July and
you had lunch with him in December. Is that correct?

        MR. PAGE: Yes. .
       </p>
       <p>

        MR. PAGE: I don't believe so. He may have mentioned it in passing.

        MR. PAGE: Yeah. No serious discussions about anything

        MR. SCHIFF: But you may have had discuSsions that you wouldn't characterize as - serious?
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. PAGE: The topic ?just like someone may have mentioned tax policy in
November 2017 in Washington, there may have been an analogous brief mention in
Moscow in July 2016. Briefly, yeah.

       The dossier wasn't used to get the FISA warrant. Plenty of people think all of this is bullshit. So youre kind of feeding the circle jerk with this post. But Papadapulous told an Australian diplomat that he knew Russia had dirt on Clinton months before wikileaks dropped it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even understand why it would matter if the dossier was used to get the warrant. There have been 4 criminal indictments so far and the investigation isn't even over. The dossier was originally paid for by republicans and then the Hillary campaign took over when Trump got the nod. If Trump paid for opposition research and it led to taking down 4 criminals in Hillary's campaign, absolutely nobody here would be complaining. Like let's say after Trump paid Project Veritas to go after Hillary's campaign, imagine if they found criminal activity. Then imagine the FBI looked into it and criminally indicted 4 people, including her campaign manager. There wouldn't be a single person here complaining about how it all went down.

       NO, no they are not justified.  There are minimization rules in place for American citizens, just being caught up in a conversation is not enough to unmask.  And if anybody reads the actual transcript it becomes immediately obvious that it would not be justified.  Nor would it be justified to unmask the other 2 Americans that remained masked simply because they had unknowing contact with SVR.  It certainly would not be justified to unmask them and leak their name to the press.  It is an abuse, it is illegal, it is a scandal, and someone is going to be held accountable for it.

       You are right, there are requirements, like
       <em>
        agents need to demonstrate probable cause to believe that the "target of the surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power."
       </em>
       Manafort has lots of documentation in his indictment showing he was acting as an agent for Yanukovych's Ukraine and for Putin's Russia. There is also lots of documentation showing that Manafort was in debt $30 million during the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, someone who was shown to be paying for Manafort to represent Russia as a foreign agent.

       The thing is, a ton of Republicans and Democrats have reviewed these transcripts and found no wrong doing at all. This was all known back in September. If there was something unjustified, you can bet you ass Devin Nunes would be talking about it.

       At this point my interlocutor really looses the plot.  Chris Hedges is a leftist, who got kicked out of the NYT for criticizing the Iraq war... you know made right judgments and was right about that foreign policy disaster.  Ed Schultz was kicked from MSNBC for being critical of the TPP, Larry King has a show, etc.  RT provides an outlet for the voices on the LEFT, that are not allowed in the corporate media.    But just so we have some points of comparison, here is Abby Martin on the Russian government activity in Ukraine.

       He was unmasked from a case that already closed, (unmasked retroactivly), and it is clear from the transcripts, that there was no reason to unmask him. Folks, don't take my word on this. Read the transcripts.  Something my interlocutor has not done.  After, he was illegally unmasked, his name was leaked to the press, again in a case that was CLOSED!

       False. Australians
       <em>

       </em>
       Papadapulous told them that - coincidentally around the same time that Obama agreed to take the Australian's "refugee problem" off their hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is also false for another reason - prior to this alleged meeting, Hilary Clinton's personal server had been hacked, and there was indications that Russians had been involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember - "dirt about Clinton" can easily refer to
       <em>
        her
       </em>
       email server, rather than the DNC emails hacked later. We know that many of the emails on Clinton's server were intentionally deleted rather than being handed over to investigators. It is very possible the Russians have those emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact that was the big scandal at the time - Trump calling for the Russians to release the deleted emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       This latest load of bullshit is an obvious attempt at "retconning" the reason Trump's team were subjected to surveillance because the "dogdy dossier" has been proved to have been a creation of the Clinton campaign.

       You have billionaire* reality TV show host / pageant owner / pussy grabber telling you what to think, and you're not using your own brain. What would a corrupt billionaire who helps Russian oligarchs illegally launder their money do when he has power over the government? How would he react to federal investigations into his crimes? He acts guilty. Why did they lie over and over about
       <strong>
        never

       having contacts with Russia. Why. You're not thinking with your own brain, you're letting powerful and corrupt people tell you what to think.

       If Hillary was now being investigated just as throurougly as Trump is being investigated and both of them are found very guilty. Then I'm sure there will be this clusterfuk of people supporting their party and saying "well the other side did illegal shit," and then both of them will be set free.  I can almost guarantee you this will happen just judging by how unconventional the whole Trump era has been.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why that these dumbass republicans should wait for Trump's to be done and ask for Hillary to be investigated with actual legit reasons. But they know what they are doing, there's a reason why people are claiming this is just them using it as a distraction. If Hillary did do some illegal stuff, and she walks free then no one can be blamed but the republicans.

       I'm unconvinced by the facts I've seen in this case, though your interpretation seems plausible.  I'd like to point out though that the US state security apparatus using flimsy or convenient excuses to justify surveillance and sabotage of political actors and moments is something that's happened repeatedly over the last century.  Leaving aside the specifics of this situation for a moment, its important to remember that these fears are not new, and state security intervention has had several profound impacts on our political direction, and as long as the US maintains such a massive, self-important, and uncheck security apparatus such intervention will be an ever present threat to our democracy.

      <p>
       Actually, more of it appears to be true than false.
       <br/>
       Note that the dossier predicted a low level Trump staffer would travel to Russia to work on the sale of 19.5% of Rosneft. Low and behold, Carter Page, a low level Trump worker traveled to Russia and met with Rosneft. 19.5% of Rosneft traded hands.  Furthermore, at Trump's foreign policy dinner, all of the principles in the transaction were present, including Sessions, who lied about it under oath.
A second example is the pee-pee tape.
The dossier says Trump had 3 hookers urinate on the bed that Obama slept in.  Trump's bodyguard has testified that Trump was offered 3 hookers in the hotel, but that to his knowledge, Trump didn't accept the offer.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is proof, but at some point, you have to acknowledge the surprising coincidence that this represents.  Even a Trump die hard supporter must acknowledge that his behavior is not that of an innocent man with nothing to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the fact that a high percentage of the sources believed to be connected to the dossier have had unfortunate accidents is at least troubling, right?  The number of coincidences are remarkable in this story.

This story is utter nonsense, not worthy of a wacky conspiracy theory of an alien invasion.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To offer Trump either the entirety of, or a brokerage commission on, the market value of 19.5% of Rosneft shares—even a 6 percent commission on $12 billion worth of Rosneft shares would amount to an astonishing $720 million—would deplete the cash that Putin desperately needed for military spending and budget deficits, all in return for a promise to lift sanctions if—and what a big “if”—Trump were elected. Rosneft, as a public company, would have to conceal that the U.S. president was a party to this major transaction. This remarkable secret-of-secrets seems to be bandied about to an Orbis “trusted compatriot,” a senior member of Sechin’s staff, and disclosed by Sechin himself. I guess there are a lot of loose lips in Rosneft offices.

       I haven't seen any evidence that Trump or his associates have been paid for the Rosneft transaction.
       <br/>
       What has been confirmed is that the Trump campaign was meeting with Rosneft,  and that the transaction predicted by the dossier did happen. 
We don't know if Trump or his associates have received a dime.

       They aren't trying to change our minds, they're trying to astroturf the sub so anyone coming here who doesn't post or isn't into this stuff (surely the viewers outnumber the posters on reddit by a massive margin) will mostly see a consensus of "yeah, Trump is a treasonous moron and I don't know why these crazy Trump fans  think Hilary is in office".

       So you've figured out what the general consensus is on Trump across at least 5 different countries by listening to "real" people? That's that you're going with huh?
He lost the popular vote, and every poll in existence has his approval rating dropping since inauguration. Yea, even FOX. 
I figured your fanaticism was a bit much but holy shit you are just flat out blinded by it.

       No. Among Americans, Trump is the least popular president in history. Among the Western World he is considered a total embarassment, a "monster," has cost us our leadership position in NATO, and has the rest of the Western World wondering wtf is going on in this country.

       Get out of your bubble. Look at what the leaders of other Western countries are saying about him.

       As I said earlier, never trust the polls. Remember, Clinton had a 99% chance of winning. You're a fool to believe them. Those leaders are political prostitutes. Look how much the West has fallen under these stupid fuckers' leadership over the past 30 years.

       Without acknowledging all dodgy stuff Trump and his people have doing to warrant the investigation, to claim this post is non-partisan complete bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was no corroborating evidence of Trump's aide contacting Russia and knowing about Russia having emails from the Clinton campaign, while another a known target for FSB asset recruiting, or that his campaign manager was a long time Russian agent who launder millions, the dossier would have the impact it does. Only in the full context of all the evidence can you judge whether the FISA warrant is justified or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also don't want to set a precedent of Russia hacking into political parties and then releasing damaging information on just one of them to elect the other one, but most people who believe the narrative that the dossier was an elaborate plot setup in case Trump won (an outcome neither Obama, Clinton or Trump expected), just completely close off their eyes and ears to finding any truth to whether Russia was involved in hacking the DNC and helping Trump. Wikipedia was doing good by releasing damaging info (timed for political damage), Republicans using their position to investigate Clinton for years out if political motivation, these are supposedly exposing corruption. Documents that are the starting point to showing that Trump had many connections to Russia, showed that his campaign manager was working for Russia for years while laundering millions, his son met with Russian government lawyer to get dirt on Clinton and talked about sanctions and tried to lie to the public about it, his national security advisor was making deals with Russian and Turkish diplomats, his campaign aids talking to Russians about Clinton emails before the DNC even knew it was hacked - this exposure must be stopped because it's corruption!!!! Where has the OP acknowledged that the Trump administration is a dirty organisation that need to be exposed as much as the Clinton people?

       So far, my experience with you is that of a person who make claims and then doesn't back it up with a real source. Prove that it's otherwise in the other thread first if you want me to invest anymore time in your rambling. Stalking me to another thread after you failed to back your claim and throw a tantrum just takes it to the next level of delusional creepiness.

       Trump supporter or not, the fact that the DNC bought a fake dossiers (proven) and received a warrant to spy on Trump (well known) to 'prevent' him from being president should shake every American to the core.

       The Clinton campaign did not pay for the dossier. A conservative website called the Washington Free Beacon first hired Fusion GPS to gather opposition research on Trump. The Free Beacon is owned by a wealthy Republican donor who supported Marco Rubio's candidacy at the time. Then, once Trump clinched the nomination, Clinton's campaign contacted Fusion GPS, and they picked up where they'd left off.

       So you're saying that Hillary Clinton paid Christopher Steele to contact the FBI and falsely accuse her political opponent of a number of very serious federal crimes -- many of which have been corroborated, and none of which have been proven false -- even though in doing so, Christopher Steele was putting himself at risk for lifetime imprisonment, minimum? How much does something like that cost?

       No that's not what I was said. It was when Clinton's money came into the picture that Christopher Steele became involved. To be honest I'm not quite sure how the dossier was brought to the attention of the FBI. I have heard that McCain brought it to them, but again I'm not quite sure. I do believe that those questions are being asked though.And despite the FBI's reluctance to answer such questions and submit related documents to the committee that oversees them, the threat of being held in contempt lit a fire under their asses and things are starting to be answered behind closed doors. Yesterdays referring of Steele to the DOJ for potential violations by Grassley and Graham is very interesting to me as well.

       Potentially the worst case abuse of the surveillance state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it’s illegal to pay a foreign entity for work on your campaign.  It’s ok if it’s volunteered  like when Ukraine worked with Hillary’s campaign to get dirt on Manafort, but if they are paying them it is not.  Fusion GPS was an intermediary, but how did Fusion come to be in contact with Steele?

       This sub has been a pro Trump sub for  the most part so I'm sure we've seen some people bring up the credibility of the document, as we've seen many on TV/Radio/Twitter do recently but I'm more interested in why
       <em>
        you ignore facts
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What we know already is the Clinton campaign paid for the dossier
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Clinton paid for it
       <strong>
        after Trump won the nomination
       </strong>
       which was long after this FBI investigation was open.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to that GOP opponents to Trump were paying for that. Why do you ignore that fact?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Was the dossier used as intelligence in a FISA court to get a warrant to surveil the Trump transition team?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Potentially but it's been stated that the dossier only corroborated information the FBI was already receiving from foreign intelligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I recall the FISA warrant wasn't issued until the summer of 2016 and we know that Australia had already notified the US in the spring.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Maybe you dislike Trump and you don't care
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think there are a lot more folks
       <em>
        who like Trump
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        don't care if the dossier is true
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the non-Trump supporters see the dossier for what it is and assume that there is gonna be a lot more evidence than that to get anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump is innocent, I hope we find that out ASAP.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        gather information on their opponent and then pass that information to the FBI to have their opponent spied on?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sure, but if all you had was
       <em>
        inaccurate info
       </em>
       the chances of you getting that warrant would be slim.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is not a partisan issue, this is about government corruption
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Please help me understand how this indicated government corruption?

       There are lots of questions unanswered about the dossier, but its really been blown massively out of proportion.  All campaigns do research on the opposition.  They all dredge up any dirt they can from any source they can in an effort to smear or otherwise discredit their political opponents.  Frankly the dossier was just another of countless pieces of oppo-research.  It was deemed so flimsy and unsourced that even the Trump-hating media outlets rejected it when Fusion GPS and Steele tried to shop it around.  It was only after Hillary-friendly intelligence agents in the government briefed Trump that it was deemed legit to report on because it was "potentially blackmail" (whether or not any of it was true or provable).  It was then in turn used by Obama admin officials as an excuse to "unmask" Trump campaign people in wire intercepts that the NSA vacuums up unconstitutionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real issue here isn't the dossier, its that the government and the media can act together to push propaganda that whips up massive segments of society to believe things.  We saw the exact same movie with the run up to the war in Iraq.  We see the exact movie with North Korea and Iran.  Unfortunately most people are empty vessels just waiting to be filled with propaganda.  Things that are otherwise completely unimportant and irrelevant suddenly seem worth slaughtering millions of people over.  Countless millions of Americans are locked in cages, sleeping on the streets, living in poverty, or one paycheck away from homelessness.  We're $21 trillion dollars in debt nationally and much more on every level.  The fact that a single American is concerned with Russia or North Korea or Iran or any country on the other side of the world when our own country is fiscally and morally bankrupt and our people are suffering horribly is a sickening indictment on our society and our population.

       To be fair, the Republicans created the "surveillance state", so they are the last ones that should be crying about it now.

       FISA Courts are the conspiracy. Abuse of them is the rule, and this case with the Steele Dossier isn't the exception. The FISA court exists the abuse the rule of law. I've thought about it and I'm perfectly OK with it.

       Why hasn't the government—the FBI—ever independently verified the hack into the DNC? They solely relied on the findings of a private entity that was paid by the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton's funded Steele and Fusion GPS to come up with the Dossier. We hear claims that parts of the dossier have been verified and when you actually look into which parts you find that none of the allegations about Trump have ever been verified—only that X person did meet with Y person on such and such date. That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many conflate the FBI investigation into Russian meddling—which started in July 2016—with Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign and they are actually two separate things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have the investigation into Russian "meddling" whose basis are findings the government has never verified and then you have the investigation into the Trump campaign revolving around a dossier in which no allegations against Trump has been verified.

       It is like you folks are impenetrable to reading and comprehending what you read.  The dossier was not corroborated, nor did it corroborate previous claims, that were independently made previously.   The dossier is full of false information.   The NYT claimed that parts of the dossier where shard with an FBI agent in Rome in July, and per the BBC article, it states that Steele was feeding information to intelligence as far as back as May.

       At this point my interlocutor really looses the plot.

Ed Schultz was kicked from MSNBC for being critical of the TPP, Larry King has a show, etc.  RT provides an outlet for the voices on the LEFT, that are not allowed in the corporate media.    But just so we have some points of comparison, here is Abby Martin on the Russian government activity in Ukraine.
