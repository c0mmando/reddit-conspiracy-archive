        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When Stranger Things 1&amp;2 came out we literally saw some kids grow up on screen, and it was sweet and wholesome, but some of the fans started talking about some of the cast, namely Finn Wolfhard and Millie Bobbi Brown in particularly sexualised tones. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a39671/model-young-stranger-things-star-call-her/">Here&#39;s an example of how Finn is been talked about among the fandom</a>, he&#39;s asked in interviews who he&#39;s dating ( like wtf does that matter, he&#39;s 14? What kind of relationships do you expect 14 year olds to have? When asked about this tweet in question, he responded in his age-appropriate manner responded: &quot;Ew Gross&quot;. ). </p>

<p>But I&#39;ll get on to Millie now.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LYC_QBKnJM">What about this Youtube clip of Millie&#39;s GG preview</a>.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s not bad enough, <a href="http://www.thisisinsider.com/stranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-mara-wilson-sexualization-2017-11">the whole sexualisation comments of Millie Bobby Brown from the fandom</a> only happened last year, this particular article was late last year, but the commentary of this nature had only begun last year, in between the 2 Golden Globes shows and if you follow her Instagram since then her dresses/red carpet appearances(in particular) have gone from age appropriate to seeming too mature for a girl her age. </p>

<p>I raising this because with all the heat on Hollywood at the moment with the exposure of pedophiles, these are probably the most famous kids in the world right now and I&#39;m starting to wonder if they are making these choices or if they are being told to act in certain ways, or if they are groomed themselves? These things are really subtle too but they make a huge difference in the way they are normalising sexualising children ( specifically the mature way Millie is posing/dressing and even in editorial photos of both Finn &amp; Millie ). </p>

<p>They are just children and I hope that this is innocent but if it&#39;s not and it is darker and deeper than this, that is terrifying and needs to be stopped. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> : She is actually only <strong>13</strong> according to her Wiki.</p>

They&#39;ve already spun the shit out of this to be some kind of &quot;men are pigs&quot; gender war going on in Hollywood and completely sidestepped the pedophilia problem.

    <div class="md"><p>I guess people have different definitions of children. When I was 13-14, I absolutely had sexual urges and had begun masturbating already. I think Finn’s response of “ew gross” when asked about dating is probably a coached answer to keep younger kids interested in the show and adults thinking these are cute little kids. But the reality is, these kids would be in 8th grade already, going into high school next year. Kids I knew in 8th grade were absolutely kissing and having sexual contact- even if actually having sex was still considered too far for 13 or 14. That was in 2005. Kids now are sexually aware much earlier, and I wouldn’t be surprised if the number of kids losing their virginity in middle school has gone way up in the last decade. </p>

<p>None of that is to say we should be sexualizing Millie or making relationships between grown adults and adolescents seem normal. It’s not, it’s disgusting. But a relationship between Finn and Millie involving kissing and sexual touching would be totally normal for adolescents at their ages. For all we know, Millie is going through puberty and becoming aware of her own sexuality, and she’s choosing to dress this way. Like it or not, this is our culture. Kids want to be like adults and adults want kids to be like adults. </p>

<p>I agree with you for most of this. It is totally normal for her to be seen with Finn. And I can understand the obsession because the fans love Mileven onscreen they wish it was real off-screen. </p>

<p>And I was wondering that too about Millie, if these are her choices - still if they are, she still seems like she&#39;s more mature for her age that she should be. Also the fact she was singled out, and came on her own and then when she shows up she&#39;s done up in a sultry way, posing in a sultry way too?</p>

<p>What if she&#39;s feeling pressured to look this way? What if these are not her choice but something she feels she has to do in order to be &quot;big&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can speculate all we want. When I was that age, I dressed and behaved in efforts to emulate older guys I looked up to (skaters at the time).</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s too great a leap to believe she is emulating starlets. Kids take cues from adults, and many don’t want to be stuck in the “kid” box. Hopefully that’s the case here.</p>

<p>My guess?  Most likely pressure from her own parents to do so...  gotta grab headlines and get attentions to keep the cash flowing, right?</p>

<p>I think that is half true and half an illusion.  In high school I knew kids who started having sex early and kids who probably reached their mid twenties still playing Pokémon and thinking “eww gross” about girls.  Most people were somewhere in between, like between 13-16 abstractly being horny and wanting to have sex to be cool but not really devoting serious effort towards doing it necessarily.  There is a wide range and we mostly only hear about the extremes.  I thought I was lagging behind because my best friend lost his virginity at 15 and I didn’t until 16.  Now, looking back, 15 and 16 year olds seem like freaking babies and when you know someone with kids around that age it is hard to imagine them differently or with the sort of grown up thoughts you had back then.  Same as how when you are 8 years old, 13 year olds seem like adults and 25 year olds seem like they might as well be your parents.  But in your 30’s 25 year olds seem like children and 13 year olds might as well be toddlers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mark my words, it won&#39;t be long before a propoganda to normalize pedophilia comes around. This is just the start. She is being marketed as a sex icon in exactly the same way girls in their early 20s have been. Soon we will start seeing it in movies and TV shows. A disproportionate number of adults who are &quot;in love&quot; and in a relationship with children. They will make anyone who disagrees with that lifestyle look like a close minded biggot. The &quot;you can&#39;t help who you love&quot; argument will come into play, and all those men who are instigating sexual relationships with children will be considered early martyrs. Politicians will come out in support of it, and late night talk shows will have Hollywood guests on every other night who are in a relationship with a child. When these signs come to pass, the pedo train will be pulling into the station.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forget the producer?  say to the media?  who do you think the media is?  it&#39;s the producers and politicians and people with money that are normalizing this shit. no one else is trying to normalize this. Everyone else goes along cause their either blackmailed or terrible people themselves.  </p>

<p>and no i wouldn&#39;t support them at all.  If its someone else&#39;s kid and not mine that&#39;s their fucked up decision to let their kid get raped by a perv and they should be thrown in jail.<br/>
Plus were not talking 15 years old here.  Were talking pre teens and toddlers.  Is that normal?  what do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well yeah, unfortunately there are sick fucking psychotic parents that are willing to pimp their kids for money.  Salt Lake City Utah is a hub for child trafficking when the Mormon Confrence happens twice a year.  Poor parents sell their kids to rich political and religious leaders because they think their kid doesn&#39;t know any better.  I&#39;ve heard first hand stories, shit is fucked completely.  They are all paid off from top to bottom by rich ass pedophiles.<br/>
Thats why they can manipulate the media.  They are the media, they are the judges, they are the politicians, they are the FBI.  Our entire world is run by organized crime.  It&#39;s very obvious.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what scares me. No one seemed to notice that a prepubescent kid was showcased like that. Fucked that it even happened. Even more so that no one was disgusted. </p>

<p>Could be, but at what point does it become pathological? I&#39;m of the opinion that one has the right to think the most twisted shit imaginable, and express that through art, music and prose but the moment it starts slipping into reality and actual humans are exploited in any way, we have a major issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Between Millie being referred to as sexy and the matching pizza tattoos I am hoping that this is not but afraid that this is indicative of something more. There is AT LEAST SOMEONE (agents parents themselves growing up too fast in hollywood) most def taking advantage of the times and what this kind of taboo symbolizes in the media and in hollywood right now....that isnt right. The reason for that is the ones that are going to be influenced by these things and possibly mimic such things are going to be the TWEENS that are outside of H&#39;wood but still have the other audience  that will be captive the pedos that will find this titilating and may further pressure kids to also behave this way.</p>

<p>Yes we all had our own escapades and the ages might have been closeish to the ages of these young folks but the pressure from ADULTS and the normalization of adults having these kinds of relationships with kids just WASNT THERE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. It was called abuse and fortunately I was shielded from this horrific shite that is more and more as well as younger and younger now. The goalpost KEEPS MOVING PEOPLE what can we do to help change this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. What&#39;s the matching pizza tattoos about though? That&#39;s really fishy?</p>

<p>To make a point about the minders of these kids, I used to live with a fashion stylist 4 years ago and he&#39;d been working in London Fashion Week quite extensively years before that (and the fashion industry ). He told me back then, there were kids, between the ages of 9-14, young girls who were walking on the WOMEN&#39;s Catwalk, and or modelling WOMEN&#39;s products. (as if that isn&#39;t creepy enough ). He also said that these girls would be just backstage on their own, passing time away colouring in colouring books when creepy men -who were sometimes their minders, would approach them, offer to take them to parties and offer them drugs. He said they had no idea what was going on the majority of the time and their parents weren&#39;t around.</p>

<p>That was probably a decade ago, but you&#39;re right. If it was like that back then, the goal post has been moved so far and it will only keep moving and you can even see people not willing to see this even in this sub!</p>

<p>The photos of Millie look like that of a woman much older and &quot;sexually&quot; portrayed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but if you think I&#39;m a pedophile for raising an issue with the way in which a child star is being portrayed to appear as a sexual icon and not a wholesome 13 year old girl, and how this change has also occurred alongside the comments from some creepy fans objectifying this 13 year old child star.....</p>

<p>Then I think yeah, I&#39;m clearly the pedophile (in case this isn&#39;t clear enough for you, that was sarcasm).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one thing that always makes me shudder when I think about it is how badly I wanted to be a child actor or Disney star when I was younger. Like it was the absolute dream.</p>

<p>As a kid you see all of these behind the scenes features about kids movies and they made working on set for a child to be the most incredible thing ever.</p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s all the candy you could want...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have so much fun with the director...&quot;</p>

<p>What kid wouldn&#39;t fall for the allure of world fame and fortune?</p>

<p>When I think how kids in some of those beloved films were most likely getting the D on the sly, I feel chills.</p>

<p>I would never let my children be in that kind of industry. I think it innately attracts hedonistic narcissists who&#39;ll have no qualms in normalizing their behavior when grooming children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I understand. Even so, though if this is just a teenage girl exploring her sexuality and enjoying her body, she may appear to look  like a Kardashian, but the heart of the matter is that no matter what she looks like, or how mature she might seem, she is still a 13 year old girl and I&#39;m worried that: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The media will normalise portraying her in a sexually explicit narrative ( as a commentator said earlier she was dubbed &quot;sexiest star&quot; in a magazine ), which will normalise sexualising children. </p></li>
<li><p>There already is a presence of an unsavoury audience among her fandom who are literally treating her as a fully grown adult and that they may be encouraged to behave in this way based on how she looks, because we&#39;ve seen her &quot;mature&quot; on-screen.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I&#39;m going to go slightly further down this rabbit-hole and talk about Stranger Things 2. Fans of the show will wet their knickers, but tough.</p>

<p>As an aside, the first season was terrific - great story, well acted and it evoked a convincingly nostalgic 1980s atmosphere (that was reminiscent of say, Spielberg&#39;s &quot;The Goonies&quot;). The second season pretty much gave up on the nostalgia schtick, which was pity, presumably because it was wasted on the core audience.</p>

<p>However, my issue is with the fact that things got a little weird in the Second season. I felt uncomfortable with the plotline that that a 40 something single police chief (&quot;Jim Hopper&quot;) has secreted &quot;Eleven&quot; a prepubescent girl to whom he is not related (played by Millie Bobby Brown) in his cabin in the woods. She cooks him meals, she&#39;s not allowed to leave to the house, and they have blazing rows? That&#39;s a pretty weird dynamic, and perhaps a little bit too...Natascha Kampusch for my liking?</p>

<p>Obviously, the riposte to this is that the relationship is entirely platonic, he&#39;s protecting her etc etc, but if we suspend disbelief and transfer this &quot;unusual domestic arrangement&quot; to the real world into a story you read about in a newspaper, you might not give the police chief the benefit of the doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lover_%28film%29">this movie</a>? I had liked it very much at the time; I definitely found it provocative, but had not doubted it may have a sinister backstory.</p>

<p>Ever since I learned of the systemic and morbid problem of institutional child abuse a couple of years ago, I&#39;ve been revisiting this stuff. And this has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Open_Secret">nothing to do</a> with pizzagate per say (which is merely a symptom, and the evocation of which will cause pavlovian identity reactions with the cognitively less fortunate).</p>

<p>Indeed I&#39;m even having second thoughts about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on:_The_Professional">Léon</a>, an otherwise favorite movie of mine.</p>

<p>Btw your comment was linked on tumor, hence the downvotes, obviously I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All girls feel pressure to be &quot;sexy&quot; as they hit puberty. I remember I started getting cat calls and leers from adult men as early as 9-10 years old (I was an early bloomer.) it made me incredibly anxious and disgusted with my body because mentally I was still a child. If transgenderism was mainstream in the 90s I probably would have been convinced I was truly a boy, in order to escape the creepy looks and comments I wasn&#39;t ready for. As an adult woman I&#39;m confident and happy with my body and gender but puberty was honestly terrifying because of the way adult men to acted. I know I am not alone in this experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a mom, I have been worried about those kids ever since seeing Season 1 and then seeing an interview with the kids. You can just tell they are going to groomed and targeted. On the other hand, it is possible to survive sexual abuse (even the worst imaginable) and be OK with the right support, and it&#39;s also possible to prevent and minimize sexual abuse if you have some adult coaching you on how to prevent situations that are dangerous. So, whatever has already happened or whatever adults have attempted, it&#39;s possible to prevent further damage and to heal. The key is to surround yourself with the right people and learn from others&#39; experiences. I hope older actresses who have been there are helping mentor her. And it&#39;s so easy these days to slip a tiny recording device in your purse or pocket, they could easily catch the &quot;bad people&quot; in action and get them arrested, so in a way things are probably easier now than in the past where it would have been your word against theirs. </p>
