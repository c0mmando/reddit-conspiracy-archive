       Mine have been intense lately because I think I'm sleeping longer and deeper, because of an extended cold. I've been sick for two full weeks. They're all personal issues, especially romantic relationships.

       Soooooo, I had a crazy intense dream last night that I had been dating a guy for about a year, when suddenly he locks me in his apartment and tells me I'm about to be arrested for intent to distribute heroin. Which I had not seen or been involved with, though I was present when he was buying weed. A friend from my real life hands me a packet of legal forms, while pushing her baby away in a stroller. I'm looking at the forms and realize that it's all fabricated.  His mom comes in w a covered stroller and is yelling at me, trying to corner me with the stroller, which I throw out of the way. It uncovers a biracial baby, which I empathically apologize to and the "gramma" talks about "this most precious child". I'm screaming at the guy about that I've committed no crime except using weed and that I'll gladly twll the cops that. His sister and her boyfriend walk in and I woke up screaming and sweating, realizing the whole thing was about simulating an arrest to pressure me into being a sex slave. I knew I was awake and that it was a dream but I was deeply disturbed that the baby was being used. It was totally weird and dark and anxious.

       Tldr, this sub gets into my subconscious.

       I do, I think I know where you're going with this but it's kinda been this way my entire life. The weed did space them out further though and I've noticed when I dont smoke I dream more. I really don't smoke that much so it's kinda personal thing.

       I totally feel that. It's a give in take when I pysch's I have very vivid dreams for a days, but I've never really been a frequent dreamer. I'm sure it has something to do with the weed and your sleep because I daydream a lot and still have a very vivid imagination. So it's a sleep thing

       Not wierd, biological. Weed is an endocrine disruptor, alcohol a depressant. Both keep you from REM sleep, which is necessary for healthy memory processing and healing of muscular tissue. I've been off alcohol for years, weed over a year and no pharmaceuticals, except loratadine. The worst impact on my sleep lately is a bedhog dog or inconsistent heating.

       I recently went from smoking weed almost everyday for about 4 years, to none at all. I have been off it for about a week now. Every single night I have had very vivid, lucid dreams where I am in control and making decisions. I wake up every morning remembering about 80% of the dreams, with a few fuzzy details lost.

       at some point I just got tired of laying in bed and watching netflix, which is what weed defaults me to want to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I stop, I start going to the gym like crazy, and my thoughts and emotions are clear as hell. Plus having the extra money is great. I look forward to my dreams everynight as well. All of this is just great motivation for me.

       Some research into REM sleep and the effects of cannabis might give u some clarity on this subject. From how I understand it Cannabis affects you're memory due its negative effects on your REM sleep pattern. I didn't dream for 8 or 9 years being a consistent smoker. The question I have is, are the dreams more vivid, or are you just not used to them being that vivid due to subdueing them with the weed?. Would I lucid dream anyway if I never smoked the stuff? More research needs to be done on the subject. I've got to a point where I feel I'm in a deep dreaming sleep while also being fairly aware of what's happening around me at the same time. I can recall parts of conversations and activities happening around me while also sleeping and perhaps dreaming at the same time... Or can I? smoker everyday for 15+yrs... For science obvs.

       I would still have dreams when smoking, but now they are vivid, lucid, and pretty damn intense. If dreams were meant to speak to you, now I could actually get the message

       Yeah I think I dream regardless, but if I smoke an 8th I won't remember them. a couple of joints I'll remember, no joints - it's almost guaranteed to be Lucid and really real.. If I've a stressful decision to make I'll only have a little or in some cases none, next morning I've made my decision over night in dream format!! There's lots of impacts weed can make, it's up to the user to use these effects for the positive.

       There is evidence that cannabis can interfere with REM sleep for some people.  If you enjoy using, it's probably best to avoid before bed.

       I've noticed that I will have more frequent dreams if I wake up and fall back asleep and if I consume a large amount of sugar before bed. Maybe increasing your sugar intake could induce more dreams.

       Dreams are spiritual in nature.  Any encounters you have in them come from demonic spirits even thought they can seem very pleasant.  If you ever encounter something bring up the Lord Jesus Christ and see what happens.

       Exactly right.  A friend, a dead relative, an angel, an alien, even some other version of yourself, literally anything you meet in a dream or while on DMT or anything that creates lucid states is a deceiving spirit.

       Yup, I suffered from sleep paralysis which manifested into what felt like an entity in my room and climbing on my chest.. Went down a deep rabbit hole researching this.  acknowledging it's a real thing and that it can be told to leave is what stopped it for me. In my paralysed/dream state I would scream fuck off you can't harm me over and over again.. Never happened again.  Read Jesus Christ works but I honestly think it's just the realisation it's a real thing happening and showing it ur in control is the power that makes it leave. Just don't give into it and let it terrorise you.

       Jesus Christ works because he has power over them.  The deepest part of the rabbit hole is the realization that he is real and that everything we are taught in this world and every conspiracy that exists is there to try to hide the fact that he is God or to push a false version of Jesus that offers no salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many testimonies from astral projection practitioners and the like who have come to realize this.  These deceiving spirits will even give you temporal power if you go along with them.  It's all a deception designed to distract you from your need for salvation which only comes from repenting and believing the gospel of Jesus Christ which is:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       God himself shed his blood to atone for your sins personally.  There is nothing that you can do yourself for salvation.  You can only trust in what he did.  It's really that simple.  Repent and believe that and you will be saved (and you will know that you are saved).

       I grew up in a private Christian school so I was "brainwashed" into being a christian. It wasn't until I went to college that I started questioning the world and diving deep into conspiracies. Once I was red pilled, I came to the conclusion that God is real and this craziness in the world is all part of the plan. I wish more people could open their minds and question the world.

       Amen brother!  The false Christianity that the world brainwashes people into is designed to do two things.  Either push people away from the whole idea of God and especially Jesus Christ to begin with  or create a bunch of irrational unsaved professing Christians and allow the world to straw-man Jesus Christ with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about it.  They set you up as a Child loving this Santa (Satan) character who is a magical omnipotent false god who watches over you and gives you material things if you are a "good person."  Somewhere in your childhood you get to find out your parents were actually just lying to you to make you feel good.  If you were late to figuring out Santa wasn't real then your peers make fun of you in school.  This sets you up for rejecting the idea of Jesus Christ right from childhood.  Yet the so called Christians defend Santa and Christmas like it's part of their religion when it's just pagan nonsense added by the Catholic church.  Nothing wrong with celebrating whatever holiday you want but the whole Santa thing has a very specific designed purpose in this world and it isn't a good one!
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on and on man.  I found God last spring.  Everything this world teaches is a lie and I mean absolutely everything.  Just read the King James Bible and know it's the only truth you can hold onto.  So glad you were able to find Jesus through all of this.  That's the entire point of this life and the end of the Rabbit hole!

       people here will have more respect if the OP makes a good effort to present a clean, logically written post with any grammar mistakes checked and corrected before final posting. when you submit a post riddled with grammatical errors that make it difficult to understand what you're saying (some of which could have been fixed quite easily), you're going to get downvoted.

       not saying that misspelling a word is bad or anything, but you should at least read over your post once or twice before posting it just so you can make sure it has a good amount of clarity to it.

       I usually only member bits and parts of my dreams now. I used to have intense dreams. I'm a weed smoker and this thread has given me some things to think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I've been remembering bits of dreams this past week or so and they are very different than anything I've ever dreamt. I have been dabbling with virtual reality here and there (a very very casual user) but virtual reality leaves a very strange feeling within me I can't really describe. Anyway, my dreams have appeared to be placed in virtual reality lately, like living in cartoon worlds (example) and I have a different vision I can't really describe because it's not human (???)...this freaks me out because I've never experienced it before, why now? The whole "new vision" thing is off the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night I woke up mid dream and re-entered the dream as a lucid dream. I was in a different part of reality (??) with a dreamy female voice-over describing our virtual reality in the here and now (what we see as our physical existence)..I was shown the actual model from the outside, it was like a flat plane that then expanded upward of many many multiple layers (spinning like a merry-go-round), and was then shown that these layers can be manipulated to form our current "waking" reality..I was then "given an example" and I could reenter our reality at any point in time because time doesn't exist as we know it. I entered the year 1999 (personal reasons) and I had my different vision (I really wish I could explain this) and I was extremely disoriented...when I looked into a mirror in my childhood home the dream (from what I can remember) stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though my dreams have been very different, I still have glimpses of recurring themes I used to have as a child. Long story short these always included the same post apocalyptic scenario. I had a dream with the same theme the other night, but different than my dream was all these years. This time we kept walking into puddles, and anytime we would our bodies would start to literally rust over, starting from the feet up. While my dreams like this always felt almost prophetic while growing up, I feel this new imagery is metaphorical to me. That maybe my (or our?) Idea of an apocalypse or even our idea of who we really are is starting to rust away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the extremely long ramble, the dream world has just always fascinated me. I've been frustrated for the past few years because I don't remember my dreams as much as I used to and I really relied on their guidance. I'm strongly considering an experiment of detoxing my body to see how much that helps.
