       There are
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       events Q Anon predicted and has proven his legitimacy time and time again.  But if you're the type of low level thinker that requires:
      </p>
      <p>
       Apples = Apples | Los Angeles = Los Angeles
      </p>
      <p>
       but cannot believe:
      </p>
      <p>
       [RR-out] = Reference to the Ronald Reagan tweet.  Posted before the tweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       BDT fireworks = Reference to the Bangladeshi New York subway bomber who thankfully failed at killing anyone.  BDT is the Bangladeshi currency abbreviation.  The post came a day before the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       then you will not be satisfied with anything Q Anon is saying or is going to say.  These are only two small examples, but the newest wave of Q Anon discrediting post come off like FAKE NEWS cnn spouting about Russiagate.  These post only say Q Anon is bullshit, a LARP, a PSYOP, etc, etc. Q Anon is not here to telegraph the administrations next move, but he or she is keeping the public informed that the administration is in the know, and is winning the war behind the scenes.  If the United States had a real MSM, they'd be covering Q Anon linking timestamped post to POTUS's tweets, but instead they're working hard but failing at destroying the POTUS further diminishing their own reputation in the process.
       <em>
        All

       I remain skeptical but enjoy reading the Q posts. Could be real, LARP, or AI. As for hitting some marks, I, at this point, look at it kind of like the Bible Code.
       <a href="https://www.csicop.org/si/show/hidden_messages_and_the_bible_code">

       It's been proven that the same 'hidden' messages could be found in any work of literature, if it has enough content.

      <p>
       Time will prove Q's legitimacy or illegitimacy.

       Some of it is hard to follow but some of it is quite interesting...there is a video in his collection explaining how his theory works I suggest you start there. Like I said some of it is interesting stuff though I am not sure if I am totally sold on the theory. I still think its interesting that Newton was into it though. Cheers!

       of these accusations is what perks my attention.  The users in this sub are not fickle, and for the most part open minded.  But non-believers calling believers of Q tinfoil-hat-wearing-crazies doesn't seem right in r/conspiracy community.  As a matter of fact it feels coordinated.

       "Free speech" is just repeatedly derailing threads by screaming like a 2 year old?  Add substance, add why you think this whole thing is fake.  99% of the people screaming larp have no fucking clue what they're talking about, that's the issue.

       I'm not, i don't deal in absolutes.  I look at this whole saga though (goes back to early november/late october) and its hundreds of threads and tons of Q posts and i can't see how this whole thing could be a Larp.  If it is, there's quite literally hundreds of coincidences coinciding with it.

        Here's the link to the pen post
       </a>
       - if you go to 8 chan's CBTS catalog, there's a thread a few days ago where it's verified that's the desk Obama had at camp David and Trump kept it.  Also verified that's the pen Trump uses and has used for awhile.

       So a close up picture of a pen, that may or may not be on a desk. How are you sure that’s the desk or a desk at all. There’s no context, no desk in a room, no noticeable window. It could literally be a troll. And there aren’t hundreds of coincidences. Being hyperbolic doesn’t help your case, it makes it more muddied.

       Because I’m not the one claiming that a person or people who’ve created a grandiose political play are to be trusted. I’m not going to look into 8chan posts to find your hundreds of coincidences. If there are so many, you should be able to find them easily.

       I really dislike when people say that. Whenever I had an argument, I presented evidence along with it when I made the claim. You’re the one who wants to stop people from speaking. You can say whatever you want, but until you prove what you claim, you’re the larper, like Q. I’m not going to do research for you. I have more important things to do than substantiate baseless claims and stop free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll summarize this for anyone reading this thread: larper like larpers. Won’t prove his claims that there are hundreds of instances of “Q” spiting truth. Most likely shouts from the rooftops that msm is the devil, yet feeds right from an anonymous teet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know all of the “researchers” here have been trained by the highly reputable hacker 4chan, yet a lot of us asking for truth aren’t shills. We are people who have actually spent hundreds of hours researching like adults do.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think the whole thing is fake because anyone can claim anything they want to on an anonymous internet message board.  If I were to go on 4chan and say that I was a Trump campaign aide and I had proof of Russian collusion, do you think that this sub would be as receptive to my story as they are Q's?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think it's fake because the entire narrative that Q presents is a Trump fanboy fantasy in which the President is the heroic protagonist who bravely vanquishes all of his villainous enemies.  Certain posters on this sub are eager to believe and defend it because it falls perfectly in line with their pre-conceived political biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I think that Q is fake because he's made several predictions that were blatantly, flat-out wrong.  He declared that the Podesta brothers, Huma Abedin, George Soros, etc were going to be arrested months ago and this never came to pass.  Curiously, Q believers seem to avoid discussing this major discrepancy.

       I'll just address the major error in your post and why you're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't understand the fundamental aspect of Q's posts.  You don't just take them at face value.  He never said they would be arrested.  In fact as far as Huma goes, he typed (first name only) HUMA in all caps.  HUMA is the Harvard University Muslim Alumni group...Obama belonged to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the others, how do you know they're not under house arrest?  There are thousands of sealed indictments right now.

       Youre the first person I've seen that's actually cross referenced some claims though. Not all of us have time to look through all the claims. It helps where we have specific things we can investigate ourselves. I've read multiple q posts but I can't remember anything he's said off the top of my head

       Here's my problem:  We're backfilling with bias to these Q-anon posts.  Things happen,
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       we look at Q anon posts and see if any of them fit.  We're giving no pause to the ones that don't have an event applied, and we're ignoring events that don't fit a Q-anon post.  Top this all off with the
       <em>
        vagueness
       </em>
       of it all when it comes to the shit he says.  Why?  Why post "BDT fireworks" instead of "A Bangladeshi dude is going to bomb the NYC subway".  No, instead he puts BDT fireworks because... why?  Is he being charged by the letter to make these posts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just one comment that makes us look in a single direction and see an event occur as predicted.  "Hey everyone, look at NYC tomorrow.  Pressure cooker bomb in a taxi."  Then when it happens he'd be fully legitimized.  But no, all we have is a string of shit words and we're applying events to them like we're testing answers in a crossword puzzle.  What's his game if all of this is legit?

       The political enemies of the side of Q Anon are so arrogant they stay in disbelief of Donald J Trump being elected as the 45th President of the United States.  Evidence of this shows in MSM, r/politics, r/worldnews, and other blogs of the like.  I can't speak for the Q team, but this arrogance is a colossal weakness begging for exploitation and a place you'd want to keep your adversary.  Therefore your messages must be vague, and your enemies will overlook them reinforced with the notion that Q Anon is just a LARP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secretly though the Clinton's, Rothschild's, Obama's, and other members of elite are following Q Anon fearing what he might say next IMHO.

       I'm a conspiracy theorist myself and I'm honestly not trying to be rude but I've caught myself in this situation many times. It's human nature to be subjective. When we believe something we seek out all evidence to confirm what we believe and throw out anything that negates what we want believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, we will invent any excuse to explain away why things don't make sense. Such as, Q has to be vague so his enemies won't be on to him or, Q is waiting to release the video as suspense in the public builds. ( since last November)
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA metadata collection program collects everything. The NSA employs codebreakers that are smarter than you and I will ever be. If you think Q speaks in code and riddles to fly under the nsa's radar so that you may receive codes that will take down the deep state maybe it's time to take a step back and breathe.

       Right; I respect your opinion.  But the point I'm making is not only are there negative post about Q Anon in r/conspiracy, but believers whom post pro-Q comments are being attacked and downvoted.  This is what seems suspect; somewhat coordinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you imagine if post started showing up in r/conspiracy saying "UFO's are bullshit and those that think they exist are crazy"...  When these post do come through, this community does NOT react well to this kind of closed mindedness.

       My stance is that I don't particularly care if he's legitimate. Even if he really is part of the Trump administration he's basically a press secretary for 4chan. People generally listen to insiders because they're spilling the beans on information that their superiors don't want released. Q is just telling Trump supporters what they want to hear.

       Believes it's possible to be anonymous in this day and age and that someone with Q clearance is feeding them deep State secrets..... accuses others of being low level thinkers. LMAO

       As a long time conspiracy theorist and internet researcher I can assure you that if you want to believe something you will find evidence to support what you want to believe. Even a low-level thinker can play connect the dots and if you look hard enough you will always find dots.

       Your condescending attitude is early developed being you've only been here since November.  And for you personally to call others (especially those who believe the Q Anon (person or group) is part of a system working to free the minds of the enslaved around the world) low-level thinkers is pathetically ridiculous.  Just stick to your safe space; COD WWII.

       And the
       <em>
        sudden frequency

       of these accusations is what perks my attention.  The users in this sub are not fickle, and for the most part open minded.  But non-believers calling believers of Q tinfoil-hat-wearing-crazies doesn't seem right in r/conspiracy community.  As a matter of fact it feels coordinated.

       I'll just address the major error in your post and why you're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't understand the fundamental aspect of Q's posts.  You don't just take them at face value.  He never said they would be arrested.  In fact as far as Huma goes, he typed (first name only) HUMA in all caps.  HUMA is the Harvard University Muslim Alumni group...Obama belonged to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the others, how do you know they're not under house arrest?  There are thousands of sealed indictments right now.

       Can you explain that a bit further?  You say "your enemies will overlook them" but then you specifically list that the big players
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       watching them and fear them.  So who is he being vague for?  The general unknowing public?  What would the motivation be to do that?
