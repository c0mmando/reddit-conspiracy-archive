        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As the title suggests, I stumbled upon <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7ogdt1/conspiracy_theorists_will_believe_low_quality/">this post</a> on the front page and was intrigued by the kind of response this post was generating.</p>

<p>The post: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy Theorists will believe low quality footage of UFOs but not HD footage of a rocket landing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Three of the top 4 comments are blatantly spewing the classic &quot;conspiracy theorists are cou-cou and incoherent&quot; shtick. While the few comments actually defending conspiracy theories are buried below.</p>

<p>Admittedly, my mind immediately went to &quot;who would benefit from this?&quot; and &quot;could there be more to this post?&quot; Still, it feels too premature to point the finger. Eitherway, I&#39;m disappointed to see that kind of rhetoric enthroned on Reddit. And to be honest, seeing people not understand the value of scrutinizing the powerful really scares me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be honest, shouldn&#39;t worry about that shit.</p>

<p>Dude I go conspiracy theorist constantly.  So do a lot.</p>

<p>If you read reddit beyond this sub you&#39;ll see people bringing up shit that happens all the time.  They don&#39;t consider them a conspiracy theorist, simply notice some shit and point it out.</p>

<p>I get that the term feels negative.  But I think it&#39;s kind of died a bit since the 90s era of it.  </p>

<p>Go ahead and call me a conspiracy theorist, I think shit happens that those in power control.</p>

<p>See?  I do though.  Collusion conspiracy whatever.  They do it.  And that&#39;s exactly what a conspiracy theorist would say and what a normal working person would say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to say that it makes me angry...but it doesn&#39;t. Seeing that many people in the comments joking about &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; is pretty fucking depressing actually. I guess they don&#39;t understand the core of it...critical thinking or attempting to hold people accountable? Questioning things that deserve questioning? Instead it&#39;s jokes here, jokes there, steel beams, dank memes.</p>

<p>Are we just to live in this world...say fuck it... and just receive data like a damn computer? </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories always arise from the core cause of questioning things...and i fucking applaud that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you offended. Why do you identify as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. That implies that you are theorizing and don&#39;t know. Why not be a conspiracy factist. There are so many conspiracy theories out there. Even conspiracy theories that aren&#39;t even conspiracies fall under the umbrella. Choosing to identify as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; only hurts you. Change and adapt. Don&#39;t let this umbrella term bring down a good group of people who only want to know the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really wish the term &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; and all it&#39;s children such as &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot; would somehow vanish from the language. </p>

<p>Conspiracies are un-doubtedly, un-questionably real. History books are full of conspiracies, mainstream accepted history. Prisons have thousands of inmates convicted of conspiracy, people really do conspire.</p>

<p>The question should always be about the specific theory you are putting forth, the idea of a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; being somehow nutty is a cheap short cut for &quot;skeptics&quot; who don&#39;t want to think about a concept.</p>

<p>And you know what, I think they are often right in a way. Most of the theories I see put forth are junk with a bunch of nothing as evidence. But if you think that&#39;s the case for a specific theory you should either state your objection to that theory, or just view as not worth you time and keep you mouth shut.</p>

<p>Yelling &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; as if that explains everything is lazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have compassion for them. They know not what they do. They are filled with cognitive dissonance. Waking up to these things, to the reality of the world is hard.</p>

<p>But only by waking up can we make a positive change, a positive difference in both the world and ourselves.</p>

<p>We must not remain complacent after seeing the truths in the world, we must act to better ourselves and society with awareness - otherwise apathy and depression will set in.</p>

<p>Apathy + Action to better the world and ourselves, as well as spread awareness is key. Knowledge and awareness without some form of action is of little use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of those comments make good points though, you said it yourself, you immediately thought about shilling.  It takes some serious flaw in critical thinking to think that people shitting on your unpopular idea must be being paid to do so, and people on this sub do it all the time.  Almost every single post has someone accusing someone else of being a shill, everyone seems to think they&#39;re being prosecuted for their ideas when it is more likely that their ideas need to be reexamined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your dialogue was truly two ways you&#39;d be OK.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll likely have this removed and be banned for saying this, which will only prove my point entirely.</p>

<p>You all refer to the same core defence, that you&#39;re simply critical thinkers on a level unlike many others.</p>

<p>Out of the gate you&#39;re telling people you&#39;re better than them, so why would you not expect a defensive turn in discussion?</p>

<p>Secondly just like T_D users you respond to even the slightest criticism, skepticism or questioning of your thoughts with irrational and immediate attacks and alienation. Now by nature of the first point I made, you of all people, should expect nothing less than critical thinking from others considering you all exercise this trait with the utmost importance as you remind us all so frequently.</p>

<p>So why is skepticism and critical thinking only approved in this subreddit and by you people, when it&#39;s under a theme or topic you allow but not when that same set of skills is applied to other topics.. Topics you say are born from critical thinking but that can never be again thought of critically without your backlash? </p>
