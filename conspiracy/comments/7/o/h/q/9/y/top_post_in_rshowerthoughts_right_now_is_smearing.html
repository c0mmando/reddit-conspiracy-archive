       As the title suggests, I stumbled upon
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7ogdt1/conspiracy_theorists_will_believe_low_quality/">
        this post
       </a>
       on the front page and was intrigued by the kind of response this post was generating.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Conspiracy Theorists will believe low quality footage of UFOs but not HD footage of a rocket landing.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Three of the top 4 comments are blatantly spewing the classic "conspiracy theorists are cou-cou and incoherent" shtick. While the few comments actually defending conspiracy theories are buried below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admittedly, my mind immediately went to "who would benefit from this?" and "could there be more to this post?" Still, it feels too premature to point the finger. Eitherway, I'm disappointed to see that kind of rhetoric enthroned on Reddit. And to be honest, seeing people not understand the value of scrutinizing the powerful really scares me.

       I am truly sorry. You are a familiar name on this sub. I like a lot of what you post. I will contact you via personal message if you need to talk. I would lose my mind if I lost my wife. Sometimes the help of a stranger is better than someone you know personally. Again, I am very sorry for your loss. I am available if you would like to talk. Take care bro.

       This is the self-congratulatory bargaining phaseLots of TV show references in the threads. Figures. Notice how most all even sound like the same person. Average IQ used to be 100; I'm guessing 90-92 average in there, quite near developmentally disabled levels: the desired normal avg. A few more years and they can all be cops.

       IQ has nothing to do with which school you went to. In the US and UK you need money and connections, and in most places in EU many/everybody goes to excellent public schools. Both have nothing to do with IQ.

       They see us unraveling mysteries it's taken them thousands of years to crack and then proceed to call us crazy so no one takes us serious when the two witnesses wake up to their destiny and take this fight to the heart of the problem. They're basically insuring that the biblical prophecy of the world hating the two witnesses come true.

       Merely more desperate parroting of the official line because the tide really has turned against it with more people now critically examining and seriously doubting any number of official narratives that never really quite added up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mainstream media is taking a serious ass-kicking and dramatic loss of revenues due to it's complicity in pushing and promoting many of those questionable narratives and that now also includes the narrative that ridicules the people whose suspicions about the media conspiring against the public who have been completely vindicated and were perfectly right about that all along.

       I read a while back that the entire concept of a "flat Earth" was to discredit "conspiracy theorist" as crazy imbiciles, thus all conspiracies were on the same level and not to be trusted. Reddit is inorganic and when I see this kind of shit I see shills, probably propped up by an online click farm

       There are even more posters on reddit that want to say people who disagree with them are shills, before they evaluate the company they keep.

       Um... if you believe aliens visited the planet Earth and all governments around the world are covering it up your grasp on reality might be tenuous. If you believe in that "cover-up" but not the moon landing you might be crazy.

       But half the world's population believes in an omnipresent, all-powerful being just because an old book tells them to.

       People can believe whatever they want and still be mostly planted in reality. It just depends...

       I couldn't make a comment on a front page Bernie Sanders post (mind you, I was supporting him, and the post was from a Sanders-supporting subreddit) without some douche canoe going through my history and pointing out my activity on r/conspiracy. They said because of my interest in conspiracies, I must be a lunatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean...I was supporting the old man, but just because I had association with conspiracy theories, I'm suddenly less of a human being. It was my mistake to go onto a political subreddit in the first place, but sheesh.

       To me it's a classical 'let's stick with low-quality, clueless random theorist rhetorics and claim they're all like that' type of showerthought. Not even mentioning that his statement lacks some precision. If by quality he just means quality of the tape, then it's ridiculous.

       If you read reddit beyond this sub you'll see people bringing up shit that happens all the time.  They don't consider them a conspiracy theorist, simply notice some shit and point it out.

       I get that the term feels negative.  But I think it's kind of died a bit since the 90s era of it.

       Go ahead and call me a conspiracy theorist, I think shit happens that those in power control.

       See?  I do though.  Collusion conspiracy whatever.  They do it.  And that's exactly what a conspiracy theorist would say and what a normal working person would say.

       I'd like to say that it makes me angry...but it doesn't. Seeing that many people in the comments joking about "conspiracy theorists" is pretty fucking depressing actually. I guess they don't understand the core of it...critical thinking or attempting to hold people accountable? Questioning things that deserve questioning? Instead it's jokes here, jokes there, steel beams, dank memes.

       Are we just to live in this world...say fuck it... and just receive data like a damn computer?

       Why are you offended. Why do you identify as a "conspiracy theorist". That implies that you are theorizing and don't know. Why not be a conspiracy factist. There are so many conspiracy theories out there. Even conspiracy theories that aren't even conspiracies fall under the umbrella. Choosing to identify as a "conspiracy theorist" only hurts you. Change and adapt. Don't let this umbrella term bring down a good group of people who only want to know the truth.

       I really wish the term "Conspiracy Theory" and all it's children such as "Conspiracy Theorist" would somehow vanish from the language.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies are un-doubtedly, un-questionably real. History books are full of conspiracies, mainstream accepted history. Prisons have thousands of inmates convicted of conspiracy, people really do conspire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question should always be about the specific theory you are putting forth, the idea of a "conspiracy theory" being somehow nutty is a cheap short cut for "skeptics" who don't want to think about a concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know what, I think they are often right in a way. Most of the theories I see put forth are junk with a bunch of nothing as evidence. But if you think that's the case for a specific theory you should either state your objection to that theory, or just view as not worth you time and keep you mouth shut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yelling "conspiracy theory" as if that explains everything is lazy.

       Not in reality, but there are fake videos of them. It's a shame that any critical thinker can look at grainy UFO footage and be skeptical, even believers of UFOs and/or aliens, but the same people see those rocket-landing videos and believe them without question because of NK-style propaganda.

       We must not remain complacent after seeing the truths in the world, we must act to better ourselves and society with awareness - otherwise apathy and depression will set in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apathy + Action to better the world and ourselves, as well as spread awareness is key. Knowledge and awareness without some form of action is of little use.

       What nonsense, I dont believe in UFOs, that is rhe fake fabricated footage. And I do believe that the rocket landings are real, but that they are not what we are told. Earth is not a globe. Space travel is fiction.

       Some of those comments make good points though, you said it yourself, you immediately thought about shilling.  It takes some serious flaw in critical thinking to think that people shitting on your unpopular idea must be being paid to do so, and people on this sub do it all the time.  Almost every single post has someone accusing someone else of being a shill, everyone seems to think they're being prosecuted for their ideas when it is more likely that their ideas need to be reexamined.

       We all know that everyone who participates here has their own ideas of what is true and what is a cover up.  No two people I've met here have identical ideas.  Unlike /politics which has carefully shaped it's users for years now.

       Who gives a fuck?  Yes, there is and has been an ongoing campaign to ostracize those who question the official narrative.  You can guess where it comes from, and when you react in anger or despair you are giving these folks exactly what they want.

       If your dialogue was truly two ways you'd be OK.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll likely have this removed and be banned for saying this, which will only prove my point entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       You all refer to the same core defence, that you're simply critical thinkers on a level unlike many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of the gate you're telling people you're better than them, so why would you not expect a defensive turn in discussion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly just like T_D users you respond to even the slightest criticism, skepticism or questioning of your thoughts with irrational and immediate attacks and alienation. Now by nature of the first point I made, you of all people, should expect nothing less than critical thinking from others considering you all exercise this trait with the utmost importance as you remind us all so frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why is skepticism and critical thinking only approved in this subreddit and by you people, when it's under a theme or topic you allow but not when that same set of skills is applied to other topics.. Topics you say are born from critical thinking but that can never be again thought of critically without your backlash?
