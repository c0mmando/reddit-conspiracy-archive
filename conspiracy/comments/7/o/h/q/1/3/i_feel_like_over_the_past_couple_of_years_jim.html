       I feel that his more recent personality seems more depressed and nihilistic than thoughtful and genuine. He seems to have really taken a turn when his ex died, and he got sued by her parents for her wrongful death because they claimed he's the one who got her hooked on pills. His new motto is "everything is meaningless", which isn't really a great philosophy if that is the be all end all of what you believe.
      </p>

       I think he is a very troubled, hurting man adrift in his own sadness and mistakes.

       I thought he finally can show the world his enlightened side. I can't disagree with much anything he says lately as I do agree with most all of it. I would say he is the exact opposite of sad and troubled. I think he is finally able to take off the mask he has been wearing since he was a small child. Some of his interviews say this as well.
I find it quite refreshing.

       Aye. I believe the level or spiritual awareness and transcending of the personal ego like he says it possible (as perhaps  anyone who may have tried psychedelics might) but am not sure if it is the case here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember one interview when he was asked about his transition into this way from being one of the most famous people in the world. Only to very quickly snap back that be is 'still' one of the most famous people in the world in such a way to suggest he's still heavily attached to his ego.

       Jim has had a spiritual awakening. most of  hollywood and the music industry has been owned and operated by the same people that own and operate most governments around the world. they are PURE EVIL!

       He hasn’t been the same since Man on the Moon. After watching the Netflix special, I realize why. He went so far that he completely disassociated to the point that when he came back he didn’t even know who Jim was anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also has this curse of an awareness of his role in society as an actor. Jim is not famous. Ace, Lloyd, Truman, Andy, those “characters” are famous. The world doesn’t know who Jim is. When he had famous moments, people really wanted to meet Ace or the Mask, not the real Jim Carrey.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real Jim Carrey either completely died with Andy, or now is on full display as seeking who he really is. Now he waivers between seeming transcendent about it all (Jim is nothing) or very experimental (Let’s find out who Jim is, Andy Kaufman style of pushing buttons).
      </p>
      <p>
       He learned from playing Andy that no one knew Andy. They knew Latka and such. That’s why he probably loved the altar ego, Tony Clifton. Except Jim doesn’t have a Tony Clifton. Andy could live out in extreme confidence under the makeup of Clifton. Jim doesn’t have that. I think he’s too scared to do it, because he may find out he enjoys it too much and then he’d just stay there and be another character.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: Jim has had an existential crisis since playing Andy Kaufman. He doesn’t know who he is anymore and is floundering between denying his existence and seeking to find one via outrageous comments.
