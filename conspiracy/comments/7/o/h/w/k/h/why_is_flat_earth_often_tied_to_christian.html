Sort of a collective mind deal.

    <div class="md"><p>B/c
1. The Bible at least hints at it being a flat plane.
2. One of the most common reasons given for hiding/covering it up/creation of the sphere earth is to hide creation. Basically Gravity is the new big G God of scientism, and without it, no round planet, no random gravity creation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the only two answers I have, that I think deserve their own out of attractive format bullet points.</p>

Only issue is that acceleration due to gravity is said to be 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> (m/s/s). Which means the earth would keep going faster and faster, which is a issue because we observe things not falling faster today than they did yesterday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is. But on objects like a basketball and a bowling ball the difference in mass does mean they have different gravities. Since they are so small they have so little gravity it really doesn&#39;t cause much of a observable difference when both are dropped from 50 meters. The higher mass of the object the higher the gravity. Hence why the Moon has less gravity than the Earth and the Earth has less gravity than the Sun. The Earth does have points if varying gravity due to inconstant density but it averages out to around 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m not an official representative of flat Earth, but some of us/them are in a constant reevaluation of what we believe, and how our, &quot;model&quot; fits with our paradigm.</p>

<p>As of today I&#39;ve seen a new 4th dimension theory of spacetime step up in debate, but I&#39;m currently still hanging on to that simulation theory fall back.</p>

<p>As for gravity, there is <em>little</em> evidence to support it in the real, tangible earth world (most people cite NASA and observations from space probes they can&#39;t prove exist, beyond CGI photographs as proof of gravity) but you&#39;re welcome to discuss that with me specifically if you feel so inclined and certain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flat Earth society (fake front set up to be the first search result or searched organization when people first look into flat earth, and offer them preposterous disinformation to send them running from looking any further into the conspiracy) says the earth moving up is what causes or simulates gravity.</p>

<p>Most real FE&#39;ers scoff at this and lots of other things they post and propose. Personally, speaking for myself, I am a gravity skeptic in addition to being a spinning globe earth skeptic.</p>

<p>Gravity is quite possibly just a combination of density and bouyancy. We can discuss proving gravity, and I am quite aware of the Cavendish Experiment, and vacuum chambers with feathers and balloons in them, FTR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never really considered flat earth to be a &quot;Christian&quot; belief. </p>

<p>as we slowly figure out that the whole establishment is endless deception, we must question everything we are told, because they fill our heads with so many lies that we can&#39;t even think straight. </p>

<p>here is something i once said to a young man, </p>

<p>me: you were taught in school that Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves?</p>

<p>him: yes</p>

<p>me: thats a lie. because we are all slaves today</p>

<p>him: mind blown, sitting there in a state of shock and depression the rest of the night. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;No one is as enslaved as someone who falsely believes they are free&quot;</p>

<p>modern slavery is covert, subtle and it relies more on enslaving your mind than enslaving your body</p>

<p>your mind can be enslaved thru religion, propaganda, brainwashing, emotional manipulations, etc</p>

<p>one of the most important results of a properly enslaved mind, is to have the mind of a &quot;man&quot;, as opposed to the mind of a &quot;god&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm">http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm</a> </p>

<p>322 where have i seen that number before?</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-6.htm">http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-6.htm</a></p>

<p>one way to keep the minds of men &quot;small&quot; is to give them creation myth about a very impersonal Big Bang long ago and far away, billions of random stars forming billions of random galaxies, each with billions and billions of planets, and presumably life forms...</p>

<p>Earth was randomly formed from star dust because stars explode for no particular reason, and give birth to evolution and ultimately the biodiversity we see on Earth</p>

<p>if you look at the is model as a fractal with the big bang at the middle, we are at the other end of insignificance. </p>

<p>so this model of creation is designed to make you feel small, detached, insignificant, </p>

<p>your ancestors were pond scum</p>

<p>someone in this state of mind is much more easy to enslave, than a person who feels more connected to something bigger and better than themself. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>research the word &quot;Zion&quot; which is the root for for Zionism, Zionists, etc </p>

<p>you probably have a &quot;Mt Zion&quot; church in your area. </p>

<p>if you dig deep enough, you should find that &quot;Mt Zion&quot; was literally the place where &quot;God&quot; stood whilst he created creation. </p>

<p>so that &quot;big bang&quot; didn&#39;t happen far away, it happened right here. </p>

<p>we are the center of it all</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>as for whether the Earth is flat or an oblate spheroid </p>

<p>or pear shaped like Neil Degrass Tyson </p>

<p>there is evidence for whatever you look for</p>

<p>seek and ye shall find</p>

<p>if you want evidence that photons are a wave, you can find that</p>

<p>if you want evidence that photons are a particle, you can find that </p>

<p>if you want evidence the earth is round, you can find that</p>

<p>if you want evidence that the earth is flat, you can find that</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>but regardless of the shape of the earth, think of your existence as a &quot;plane&quot; or even the intersection of planes. </p>

<p>in the whole scheme of the universe, your body is essentially dimensionless already. </p>

<p>your height and weight are utterly insignificant in the size and scale of the universe. </p>

<p>the earth too, is small and insignificant, and could be said to be insignificantly small in the size and scale of the universe. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain an idea without accepting it as truth </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FE talks about a lot of the same symbolism as the bible. example:  the dome/firmament/vault of heaven a lot, which is symbolized in basilicas with the dome [which is also semiramis&#39;/isis&#39; hooha, which corresponds to the obelisk/spire/steeple=osiris&#39; wang].  Four &#39;corners&#39; of the earth, that sort of thing. Many religious people shun science categorically, too - not just a healthy skepticism for big money, mainstream, for-profit science, but ALL science.

    <div class="md"><p>Not tied to Christianity in that sense. It’s a target base, that is swayed by <em>faith</em> concepts. Not <strong>FAITH</strong> in God. The two are very different in beliefs. Although extreme fanatics in religion, just like sports, can have <em>blind faith.</em> </p>

<p>When you present irrefutable proof that the 4th round selection, will not secure a Browns Super Bowl. The fanatical fans faith is challenged, causing a psychological tic, to be blinded to the realty and refute it in order to protect the ideas they have faith in. </p>

<p>So the magic of the interwebs now works on these ideas largely. We are not selling advertising anymore. We are selling how many percentile points we can sway views or ideas. And the best targets are those that are noticeably swayed across social media. Fanatic Sports fans, Wrestling fans, Senior Citizenzms, Extreme Religious groups etc </p>

<p>We interject stories/news/memes/ideas relentlessly, cross posted, on both sides. They purposely are tagging friends on the other side to create the divide discussion. Say 1/50 switches sides due family, emotions etc. These targets then replicate 5x more than normies by constantly posting their new fanatical ideas, and we create a false base, with extreme faith. To prop up the propaganda we are selling. Doesn’t have to be true at all to pay off. </p>

<p>FE, PG, Birthers, Dave C, Anon LARPS etc all examples of highly swayed target threads. Those threads are made to cull said targets, and sway new believers to then propagate their propaganda like only special fanatics can. </p>

<p>TLDR; humans are replicators, in a world where points are for sale. </p>
