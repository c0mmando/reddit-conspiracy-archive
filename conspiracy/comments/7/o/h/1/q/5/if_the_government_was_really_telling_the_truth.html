       Because when someone is honest they truthful they no in the end they will have answers to every question. Instead they have loads of classified information that they even scribble through and try to hide. Wouldn't these things be way more open in an honest government? Yes.

       Of course, but honesty and morality is contradictory to what government actually is. All it is, is organized crime which says it has power via consent, whether implied or agreed upon. Why people actually want a government, boggles my mind. It's Stockholm Syndrome.

       Which begs the question why it is illegal to question the Holocaust in multiple European Nations. This is always a dangerous water to dip your toes in, but there are eye opening points made on the denier's side.

       That being said, I still see the Catholic Church, Freemasons, and Knights Templar, Jesuits, etc. as being equal or greater threats to a progressive society. I used to argue that we should send all Abrahamic religious orders to some island, to
       <em>
        cough cough kill off
       </em>
       "share their love" for and with one another.

       Gnosticism is not right. The thing I discovered over the 6 month obsession I had with reading the gnostic gospels is the fact that these books contradict with the rest of the bible. I believe they are false doctrines. The only book I like is the book of Enoch which even then I consider for historical purposes. Keep studying and ask the Lord for wisdom.

       Yes, some things contradict with the book that the evil Catholic Church has had a totalitarian hold on for over a thousand years, and spun to suit their own greedy agenda. Also to note the Bible predicted essentially that happening. Not arguing with that part.

       Yes, of course evil people will spin the bible for control. It's not hard. Pastors spin scriptures to profit and control there congregation. Pretty easy since the people can make the bible say whatever they want when they take it out of context knowing there followers don't read the book for themselves.

       Honestly, I don't have a problem with anybody taking Israel off the map. They are a terrorist state, who has concentration camps to this day, and even though I currently identity as Christian, I must admit that all three of those religions have been exploited to the point of having no dignity or right to hold any authorative power left, and need taken out of all control over any government or army.

       Of course all religion is exploited. That is because people do not read the book. Jesus was killed because he basically said exactly what you just said. Christianity is not a religion. It was turned into one by man adding there traditions into it.

       Which is why I take a liking to scripture that was written in his language, from his time period, that just so happens to be the missing link that the devil church gutted out over a thousand years ago... Only to be dug up in the desert by a poor farmer, and brought back to the world- just like what was prophesied.

       Honestly not sure, don't really give it much thought, since I don't view him as a God. I believe in God, but according to original text, he was just the vessel to pass the wine (word of God).

       6 There was a man sent from God whose name was John. 7 He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. 8 He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.

       Then I guess I'll have to risk offending you by saying I don't believe Jesus is literally the flesh and blood word of God, that needs to be worshipped. I just believe that there is a God, and God occasionally blesses mortals with higher knowledge- but they are still just vessels to pass the teachings.

       I need to look up the actual Nag Hammadi scripture verse, but Jesus says something to the effect of, "I am merely the vessel the wine (word of God) was poured into. We are here to talk about the wine, not the cups that we drink it from." Meaning don't treat him as special, only what he says as special. There is a difference.

       Of course the Nag would contradict Jesus own words in the bible. And this is the kind of doctrine of demons I am talking about. Believing in a God is not going to get you anywhere.

       This discussion is about to veer off into pissing you off at me, b/c you can probably be offended, and I cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
       For starters, no one is going anywhere. There is no literal promise of mortals going to Godly heaven when they die. It is inferred from interpretation of multiple scriptures in multiple places. All we are promised is an
       <em>
        earthly
       </em>
       heaven,
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       Jesus comes back to make it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People preach fire and brimstone, and loved ones being in a better place in heaven as left over medieval scare tactics. If you can't bait the horse with the carrot, break out the whip.

       You seem to be the one getting upset here. I am simply responding to you. You can believe what you want but I don't see how you can believe that "all we are promised is an earthly heaven..." when you don't even know which passages of scripture you believe. And if you are referring the earthly heaven to God recreating the earth a 3rd time and bringing the new Jerusalem down from heaven to the new earth. Then sure, an earthly heaven is just fine with me. If you don't believe that being separated from God would be "hell" then okay, I do.

       I pick and choose, and cherry pick- just like virtually every other person who picks up the book, for one reason or the other.

      <p>
       The irony I see right off the bat is that, that results in most Christians really living lives more akin to the Gnostic Christianity teachings anyway. Most take medicine when they are sick, as is believed in the Gnostic text, compared to more of the faith healing that is actually taught in modern Christianity. It's like a double edged sword. Heal the body and the soul independently but together. Faith, plus God given medicine (herbs) gives real healing.

       Instead, "Christian" politicians outlaw God made plants, but get rich off of man made drugs, and turn death into industry.

       I take issue with what Christianity has been turned into, and have noticed common denominators with the ones I find evil. The problem is those tend to be the ones held to be the most credible and Godly living.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples being I think Jeff Sessions is evil. I think Roy Moore is evil. I think the Pope is evil, and so forth.

       2 Cor 12 But I will continue doing what I have always done. This will undercut those who are looking for an opportunity to boast that their work is just like ours. 13 These people are false apostles. They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 So it is no wonder that his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. In the end they will get the punishment their wicked deeds deserve.

       This just looks like it backs up what I said, and how I've been seeing things. It seems you look at this as meaning the things I've been looking into as teachings from demons, and I look at it as demons/the devil has already held control for over a thousand years.

       You are reading into what I am saying and putting words in my mouth. It is not hard to see that the bible says that Satan is the God of this World and before the end there will be evil people taking control of it. The Devil has been in charge and with every kingdom and government at his feet since Genesis. The bible clearly says this.

       I'm sorry, I thought your argument was essentially things like the Nag Hammadi library being the work of the devil. I'm used to most devout Christians telling me that when I bring it up, but I see it as you just said it- we've just been lied to and manipulated just like everything else that gets discussed here.

       oh no doubt I believe that the Nag Hammadi is completely inspired by demons. Or simply humans that hate Paul. I have read all these books and completely disagree with them. They make absolutely no sense unless you are into new age and are looking for a reason to discredit the bible.

       The investigation was almost 2 years later, under funded, only given the go ahead after families of the 9/11 victims started to make too much of a fuss, no one was ever convicted, no "terrorists" were ever photographed in any airport, on those flights.  We've never been shown but a few frames of what hit the pentagon.  Many in high positions of power just happened to take a day off or be away from their posts, on the most important day of their careers.  Rumsfeld himself was out "helping" for hours instead of you know, running the country.  So helpful to have a geriatric when a base full of military were also there.  War games sent fighter jets into inexplicable places, unable to respond, just coincidentally for something like 2 hours.  There are literally thousands of coincidences, big ones.  The stock market, puts were way off normal levels.  Some leaving the trade center breaking leases, just before.  Ehud Barak just happened to be in London telling the world what the narrative needed to be, before the second tower even fell.  WTC power outages, security changes, etc.  Bush family members with strange close connections to security at the airports and the towers...

       Here's a counterexample: creationism. There's something that has no evidence to support it, and mountains and lifetimes of evidence to contradict it. Yet because some political interests value a belief in creationism, there are hundreds of millions of dollars spent on teaching this bizarre pseudoscience. Much more people today believe in young earth creationism than did fifty years ago. That's not because of evidence, that's because of effort.
