       I think Trump suffers from 1D dementia and is literally only involved with politics when someone needs a signature to pass a bill. He spends more time playing golf or tweeting then any CEO of any profiting company. So he's not busy playing 4d chess he's busy playing golf and tweeting IMO.

       Would you mind connecting the dots a little better for me?  Because a year ago I thought weed was well on it's way to legalization.  As of yesterday?  Not so much.  So how exactly is Trump creating that pathway?

       Basically, Sessions is getting the DoJ to enforce the LAW. This means federally, with cannabis. Formerly the Cole Memo was simply that - a memo preventing federal enforcement at the state level with regard to states where cannabis was legalized. Now the conversation shifts, so if we want it to be legal we just need to legalize it already.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the amount of money and jobs that lie within the cannabis industry, and the fact that it will help curb the opioid epidemic, legalizing cannabis falls PRECISELY under Trump's agenda.

      <p>
       JUST DO IT.

       If that were true, it would require the DOJ to actually enforce the law. Which would mean raiding and shutting down every single legal marijuana shop in all of the states where it's legal. That would mean sending in hundreds if not thousands of federal troops into places like Denver, CO, arresting thousands of people and dismantling an entire industry.

       he believes its a states rights issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       my guess is that he personally looks down on it, but at the same time, recognizes that its no more harmful or potent than booze, and that the laws around it are totally wrong and archaic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would be an incredibly powerful political move to legalize under the Trump Presidency, especially during the first term. Dems are going to really need a rallying cause that everyone wants to get behind so bad they will overlook DNC internal problems and just vote D to get weed legal. thats the only way I see dems winning in 2020 or 2024, but it Trump does it first, it totally steals their thunder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cant really think of any other issue the dems could use to rally that kind of support. they would probably jump to some much more controversial SJW topic that wont sway moderates who voted Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        maybe

       minimum wage increases...people on minimum wage will always tend to vote for their own pay raise...but Trumps economy is bangin, and gas prices are falling. people will get used to that and be scared of voting dem and returning to unemployment and stifled economy.

       I disagree. perhaps that was more true in the past, when it was more full of old farts, but the Republican party is getting younger. sure, the newer generation is not exactly likely to do bong rips after congressional hearings, but many
       <em>

       realize the laws are asinine.

       the idea that Republicans are the "No Fun Allowed" party is, I think, totally fabricated by the left.

       Sessions said that he doesn’t want to enforce it but needs the federal government to make it legal so he can avoid the subject. Honestly it’s his job good or bad to enforce federal laws and he can’t ignore weed while attacking sanctuary cities because they are not enforcing federal law.  It’s like pulling the plug on drug money to enforce the federal laws on the books. Think about it! what would states do if trump pulls funding on sanctuary cities they will use legalization to fund their state. If they can’t legally fund the city using drug sales they will fold.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s going to come down to a choice 
A: ignore federal law and don’t receive federal funding
B: play ball with enforcing federal law and legalization will happen at a federal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question then is pushed onto the population of what makes more money?
A: illegal immigrants 
B: legalization of weed
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I think states are going to play ball and sanctuary cities will vanish.

       I have a feeling it doesn't exist. The 4D chess meme is just Trump fans trying to place intent were there isn't any since they can't face the fact that he might actually have no real idea what he's doing or that his intent goes no deeper than the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead what will happen is the same thing that will happen every time Trump does or says something which contradicts what some of his supporters may want. First, as OP is demonstrating, come the calls that he isn't serious (or he doesn't mean it) and predictions that he in fact has some much more nuanced or even contradictory plan in mind and we just need to be patient and "wait and see." Then over time it becomes obvious that no such master plan exists and that the original and obvious intent was all there ever was. Rather then feel betrayed or disappointed they instead tell themselves "well of course that's what he wanted to do, after all he never explicitly said otherwise, so it was silly of me to think otherwise," and repeat. Either that or they go full doublethink and convince themselves that the thing they were initially disappointed about is now totally what they wanted all along. MAGA.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, legalization will not occur, the feds will crack down (nothing too heavy-handed given the popularity of pot but probably a symbolic shut down or two) state's rights be damned, and Trumpists will claim that of course that's what the plan was, since after all Sessions has never explicitly indicated otherwise, and MAGA because something something law and order.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything approaching legalization occurs it will be due to state protest or non-compliance, in which case Trump will deserve as much credit as a dog does when grass grows out of its shit.

       I think Trump may be playing 4D chess, and the latest about Cannabis is going to bring talks about de-federalization, and possibly State Rights. I'd jump on the Trump train if he actually shrank the federal government's power. Power needs to be returned back to the States, and the Sovereigns (we the people) there within...

       We live in some very interesting times...

       I think a lot of people would. That is why it has always been my thought that he would use this issue in his favor. Just happening much slower than I anticipated.
