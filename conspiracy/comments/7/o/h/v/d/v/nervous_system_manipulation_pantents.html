       Abstract
      </p>
      <p>
       Physiological effects have been observed in a human subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak electromagnetic fields that are pulsed with certain frequencies near 1/2 Hz or 2.4 Hz, such as to excite a sensory resonance. Many computer monitors and TV tubes, when displaying pulsed images, emit pulsed electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to cause such excitation. It is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or TV set. For the latter, the image pulsing may be imbedded in the program material, or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream, either as an RF signal or as a video signal. The image displayed on a computer monitor may be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program. For certain monitors, pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the displayed images are pulsed with subliminal intensity.

         Remote magnetic manipulation of nervous systems

       Abstract
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparatus and method for remote manipulation of nervous systems by the magnetic dipole field of a rotating bar magnet. Reliance on modulation of spontaneous spiking patterns of sensory nerve receptors, and exploitation of a resonance mechanism of certain neural circuits, allows the use of very weak magnetic fields. This, together with the large magnetic moments that can be obtained with a permanent bar magnet, makes it possible to effectively manipulate the nervous system of a subject over a distance of several hundred meters, using a small portable battery-powered device. The method can be used in law enforcement for standoff situations.

         Subliminal acoustic manipulation of nervous systems
        </strong>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In human subjects, sensory resonances can be excited by subliminal atmospheric acoustic pulses that are tuned to the resonance frequency. The 1/2 Hz sensory resonance affects the autonomic nervous system and may cause relaxation, drowsiness, or sexual excitement, depending on the precise acoustic frequency near 1/2 Hz used. The effects of the 2.5 Hz resonance include slowing of certain cortical processes, sleepiness, and disorientation. For these effects to occur, the acoustic intensity must lie in a certain deeply subliminal range. Suitable apparatus consists of a portable battery-powered source of weak subaudio acoustic radiation. The method and apparatus can be used by the general public as an aid to relaxation, sleep, or sexual arousal, and clinically for the control and perhaps treatment of insomnia, tremors, epileptic seizures, and anxiety disorders. There is further application as a nonlethal weapon that can be used in law enforcement standoff situations, for causing drowsiness and disorientation in targeted subjects. It is then preferable to use venting acoustic monopoles in the form of a device that inhales and exhales air with subaudio frequency.

       OP referenced patents that focus on subacoustic frequencies (&lt; 20 Hz).

       Although, there are plenty of patents on the GHz range as well.
For example, I was excited about the implications of US9357970 B2 and WO2017075933 A1.

       Me neither, that's why I got confused and started to wonder about it. They say that patent's can't be trusted because nobody verifies if the proposed technology is actually feasible or not. I'm not saying those patents are fake (the technologies seem very much feasible, and probably most patents out there are the real deal) but it is a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I failed to come up with good reasons for an average Joe to pay for filing fake patents that nobody is going to use anyway. Aside from the obvious "hey, but it's fun," obviously. Checked the typical cost of filing a patent and it's well within the salary of an average Joe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might there be a motive for companies to file fake patents? If it acts as a minefield for competitors, then sure. Aka Amazon's one-click patent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might there be a motive for fake patents filed by the government? Disinfo, confusion?

       Everyone must respect the rules of Free Will, they can't force you, manipulators of reality tend to act on elements that are not linked to our free will, those of which we are unaware/unconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are aware of this knowledge, you can see those manipulations and the connections between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That targets are encouraged to remain naive may appear contradictory to the fact that some matrix agents tend to purposely clue-drop, waving warning signs in the face of their targets before proceeding with further infiltration.
      </p>
      <p>
       The clues can be anything literal or symbolic. Literal clues include warning phrases said in seeming jest, their personal history, and behavior. Symbolic clues
      </p>
      <p>
       are ironic and may appear in their names, word choice, mudras and synchronicities related to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever it may be, it provides a clue that the target is in danger, much like the warning colors of a poisonous plant or the hiss of a snake. If the target ignores the clues, then the agent proceeds with the next step. Each dropped clue is a subtle way of asking permission to get closer. Any ignorance of that clue is permission granted.

       Thank you for the perfect comment.
Although much of this was already familiar, the phrasing offered a new viewpoint on things.

       This is 100% an issue...there are a ton of people are "emf" sensitive, and can feel these pulses. Manifests in headaches, weird feelings, pain, nrvousnsystem problems, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't watch tv, use wifi and be around electronics. More and more people will probably become more sensitized.

       They should find a way to acclimate, meditation would help quite a bit. If they're sensitive, they can change that however you want to with sufficient meditation.

       When Television first arrived there were countless reports of it inducing seizures among some epileptics who tried to watch it and there were studies that confirmed that it was the source of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They, of course were the most sensitive to the frequencies and patterns being displayed but no one ever considered whether or not there weren't less obvious and subliminal effects on the normal neural patterns of ordinary watchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a concern raised in Europe in regards to frequencies that were too close to those in humans which is why they changed their own frequencies from the range being used in US Television broadcasts just in case. US authorities were quick to dismiss that but to this day European television broadcasts and recordings are still incompatible with those used in US for that vey reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also over 250 products any American can find and buy in their local supermarket or pharmacy that are all completely banned in Europe due to serious health concerns pertaining to their use. Something else that US authorities are quick to dismiss and yet such bans in Europe were the result of lengthy and professional tests before imposing those bans.
