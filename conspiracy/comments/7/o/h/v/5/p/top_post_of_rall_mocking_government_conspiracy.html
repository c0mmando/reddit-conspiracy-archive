        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys, </p>

<p>I wanted to make a post addressing the gem of a comic strip which (completely organically I&#39;m sure...) made it to #1 of the front page Friday night, titled &quot;My obsession with the Illuminati has driven away all my friends&quot;, linked below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/7ofv3p/my_obsession_with_the_illuminati_has_driven_away/">https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/7ofv3p/my_obsession_with_the_illuminati_has_driven_away/</a></p>

<p>I mean the idea that a group of people with only their own interests at heart can covertly control a government/society is irrational and tin hat worthy right?</p>

<p>Oh wait... except the time the <strong>South Korean President Park Geun-Hye was discovered to be a puppet of a shadow cabal called the &quot;8 Divines&quot;</strong> (made up eight female heads of the largest industrial families in SK), <strong>and their leader Choi Soon-Sil, a shamanic cult leader</strong> who &quot;had complete control over Park&#39;s body and soul during her formative years&quot;.</p>

<p>This is in a leaked memo (via Wikileaks) from the U.S. Embassy in Korea folks...</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@thepenningtonlens/the-south-korean-puppet-president-77354276c186">https://medium.com/@thepenningtonlens/the-south-korean-puppet-president-77354276c186</a></p>

<p>Nothing to see here though, please move along...</p>

<p>Something like this could never happen in the United States though, right...?</p>

<p>Well I like to remind myself of the largest symptom of overt societal control in the U.S. over the past 70 years, the suppression of the overwhelming amount of evidence from reputable whistle blowers about the existence of non-violent ET contact with humanity. </p>

<p>Linked below is a great graphic with some undeniable testimony. </p>

<p>A couple of which are my favorites...</p>

<p>&quot;I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and that the UFO phenomenon is real. It has been covered up by governments for quite some time now&quot;.
-Captain Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14 Astronaut</p>

<p>&quot;For nearly 50 years the secrecy apparatus within the United States Government has kept the public from UFO and alien contact information. We have had contact with alien cultures.&quot;
-Astronaut Dr. Brian O&#39;Leary</p>

<p>And my personal favorite...</p>

<p>&quot;Look, I have a pension to worry about. I have a family to take care of, and they told me to just back away from this entirely or else.&quot;
-Astronaut James Irwin, Apollo 15</p>

<p>Just remember folks, there are currently 550,000+ subscribers to this community alone, not even counting the lurkers (hell, I haven&#39;t even subscribed). </p>

<p>Together there is no veil of secrecy which can hold us back. </p>

<p>To end on a positive note, below is a nice clip of the honorable Luna Lovegood from the Harry Potter Series about the fear of isolation and the power of unity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Efforts should be focused on providing fact-based summaries of evidence. Most rational people will accept what they are shown if it is meaningfully substantiated (and there is plenty to substantiate with). Unfortunately many have a cognitive dissonance to anything that challenges their worldview even if substantiated, and we must sympathize with them, remain patient and not be discouraged from our efforts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is beautifully said man. </p>

<p>I completely, wholeheartedly agree, both with the meaningful and well argumented substantiation of conspiracies, as well as the empathy needed for those still stuck in cognitive dissonance. Seeing these things is not easy, so people prefer to have their head buried in the sand. </p>

<p>But the only way to make a difference is to bring awareness and light to these issues and then take positive action to change ourselves and the world. If we simply become aware of the issues and do nothing, apathy and depressions set in. However if we simply act, without being aware of how the world functions, our actions will be misguided, in many ways fruitless and even destructive.</p>

<p>On June 12, 
a son of the former founder of the Chung-soo Scholarship 
Fund, established from enormous donations to a Park Chung-hee 
memorial, accused Park of embezzlement and tax evasion during 
her tenure as the director of the fund from 1994 to 2005. 
Perhaps even more damaging to her image as the maiden who 
sacrificed herself in the service of the nation upon the 
assassination of her mother, Park has been linked to the late 
Choi Tae-min, a charismatic pastor.  Rumors are rife that the 
late pastor had <strong>complete control over Park&#39;s body and soul</strong> 
during her formative years and that his children accumulated 
enormous wealth as a result. </p>

<p>Since Park acted as the First Lady of the Blue House, she has kept a special relationship with pastor Choi Tae-min, who is a controversial figure in religious circles. Choi married 5 times and has pretended to be a monk, principal, and pastor at different times under different names. Jeong Yun-hoe, a son-in-law of Choi, was suspected to have unofficially led Park’s campaign for the 2007 Grand National Party presidential nomination. (The Grand National Party was renamed the New Frontier Party in February.)</p>

<p>Something being a possibility due to having occurred somewhere else, at some point in time, does not (seriously) substantiate the claim that it&#39;s happening in the discussed here-and-now.

<p>Wrong, fundamentally. It does. It pulls the rug out under the argument that such allegations are born from paranoid minds, completely implausible, absolutely unthinkable, and thusly not even worth considering, move along, nothing to see here. It&#39;s bunk. Similar stuff HAS happened. It IS happening. It&#39;s a part of history. Do not dismiss out of hand, do not commit the fallacy of argument from incredulity. </p>

<p>like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/opinion/02hotchner.html">ernest hemingway</a>?</p>

<p>flat-earth</p>

<p>given a culture which engages in systematic lying, i would propose that in at least some instances it is rational to question whether the earth is actually &#39;round&#39; (read: &#39;an oblate spheroid&#39;) and healthy to verify the fact for oneself.</p>

<p>at the same time, being paranoid doesn&#39;t mean that someone <em>is</em> following you. there&#39;s a fine line between a false sense of security and adrenaline poisoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Dammit</strong></p>

<p>You were making a good post right up until you went with UFO&#39;s for the real conspiracy...</p>

<p>Maybe they exist, in the alien sense, but i doubt it.</p>

<p>Conspiracy has to be based on skepticism, and there are simply <em>too</em> many logical leaps to buy what you are saying.</p>

<p>Nothing at all to do with coverups or narratives either.</p>

<p>First, a multi-nation coverup requires a level of cooperation between nations that has never been seen on any other level, not just about information, but the idea that none of these nations have attempted to compete for the unimaginable economic, scientific and military advantages that exploiting the knowledge could confer.  It means that throughout regime changes and economic problems and war etc. somehow all these governments are actually <em>winning</em> the prisoners dilemma!?</p>

<p>Second, there are numerous logical motives for any more advanced aliens that encounter us to either enslave, exploit or simply annihilate us.  There are also logical motives for them to ignore us and hide themselves from our notice.  What motive is there to make contact with governments and continue to be secret though!?</p>

<p>And third, the <em>height</em> of abductions and close encounters occurred <em>at the same time period that MKULTRA was at its height and most experimental with new chems</em> (maybe they are just as active now, but they have clearly refined their techniques).  Is it more likely that aliens were abducting random people or that the government was doing so and conducting chemically aided psychological experiments?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is a legitimate conspiracy.  South Korean journalists discovered it and the main stream media of the US, South Korea&#39;s biggest ally, reported on it all over the place.  People who are hunting for the truth discovered it and when it came in to the light there was no denying it.</p>

<p>People who are hunting for the truth have looked in to 911 conspiracy theories, they&#39;ve even looked in to pizzagate, and everyone has rejected the theories as not true.  That&#39;s the problem with some of these conspiracy theories, if they involve hundreds of journalists in the cover up or thousands of scientists being ignorant of something you can discover from a youtube video, then chances are they are wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>comforting lies appeal on a subconscious level. Partly because everyone&#39;s lives have become encompassed with a million different bits of information, and everything that comes from living. But partly because worrying about all the possibilities and pur lives is hard enough without worrying who the enemy is, what the truth is, why they are lying etc. Its just extra thinking and stress nobody wants or needs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Efforts should be focused on providing fact-based summaries of evidence. Most rational people will accept what they are shown if it is meaningfully substantiated (and there is plenty to substantiate with). Unfortunately many have a cognitive dissonance to anything that challenges their worldview even if substantiated, and we must sympathize with them, remain patient and not be discouraged from our efforts. </p>

<p>when thrown thousands of years worth of occult practices</p>

<p>Something being a possibility due to having occurred somewhere else, at some point in time, does not (seriously) substantiate the claim that it&#39;s happening in the discussed here-and-now. Going this route without <strong>substantial real-world evidence that it&#39;s happening here as well</strong> will <em>of course</em> throw your claim and turn (most) people off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. These same people obviously have to acknowledge that people still practice Christianity, Judaism, Hindusim and a plethora of other ancient religions despite the fact that they don&#39;t believe in them. But nope, it&#39;s impossible that people still practice ancient occult practices.</p>
