        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>By now you’ve all probably heard of the Apple battery fiasco. If you haven’t, here’s a quick rundown: Apple issued a software update that seemed to make the battery life of older iPhones worse and were caught doing so. They tried to explain it by saying they were doing something to help iPhone users, but later issued a mea culpa in the form of $29 battery replacements, instead of the normal $89 that it costs. </p>

<p>People were elated and thanked Apple for their kindness. The person who originally caught them on Reddit, even updated his post to let everyone know that “Apple is offering new batteries for <em>only</em> $29 for 1 year.” Wow, thank you so much Apple!</p>

<p>Here’s where this is utterly fucked up – Apple degraded their customers’ product to make it almost unusable in an effort to force them to purchase their new devices (I was definitely one of those people on the brink of just buying an iPhone X because my battery life and performance was awful). Once they were caught, instead of directly apologizing, they made an effort to come up with excuses. After that didn’t work, they pulled off what I believe is one of the most genius business moves ever – they dropped the price of battery replacements to $29 and made it seem like they were doing everyone a huge favor. The problem is, these battery replacements cost Apple single digit dollars. Replacement batteries, for a 6S for example, go for $10 on NewEgg with the toolkit. It’s possible that Apple will generate <strong>hundreds of millions of dollars off this program, considering the weeks-long waiting list at some stores.</strong></p>

<p>…And it gets worse. I believe Apple is now using this public position they are in to try and force all older iPhone users to partake in this replacement program. How? By doing what they just did, but worse. On New Year’s eve, I received a push notification from Apple to upgrade my OS. A push notification I’ve seen countless times and always declined because I don’t like to update my OS too much. However, this time, the push notification was different. Typically, Apple push notifications are set up in the following manner (not the exact text):</p>

<p>“Update to the latest OS”</p>

<p>[ Not Now ] [ OK ]</p>

<p><strong>The one that I received on New Year’s was set up in this manner:</strong></p>

<p>“Update to the latest OS”</p>

<p>[ OK ] [ Not Now ]</p>

<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but having built software that sent out millions of push notifications, I know that changing a standard/templated push like this will trick a large swath of people because of ingrained behavior of hitting the left button. I was one of those people. I hit OK, accidentally, and Apple’s war on my battery began.</p>

<p>I started losing battery by the 10s and 20s. From 55% -&gt; 21% after putting my phone in my pocket and taking it out a minute later. From 22% -&gt; 7% in the same manner. Opening up an app kills battery %s by the minute, or worse. I open up my camera to take a picture in double digit battery life and my phone just dies.</p>

<p>Why does this all matter? Because it’s wrong. Apple, by making that small switch in the push notification is tricking all those who didn’t upgrade to the latest OS to do so in order to punish their battery and <strong>force</strong> them into the $29 replacement program so they can make money because you won’t buy their new iPhone. Wow, thank you so much Apple!</p>

<p>To put it simply – Apple knowingly fucked your iPhone up, and if they didn’t, they are making a concerted effort to do so and profiting off of you to fix it. It’s a $29 tax because you didn’t want to upgrade your phone. It would be similar to Tesla knowingly sending your car an update to ruin the battery life of the car in an effort to get you to buy the latest model, and instead of recalling it or fixing it for free once publicly caught, charging you to fix it and being applauded for it. WWED? What would Elon do?</p>

<p>People who still use Iphones are the real bigtime suckers. You can get an almost new Samsung (2 years old) or other similar Smartphone on Ebay or other places, for under a hundred abd buy a backup battery and you&#39;re good.</p>

<p>What? lol. I&#39;ve had both and worked as a Sys Admin for a type where in our free time we did all sorts of crazy shit to our phones via root kit/apk, custom programs, etc. For the LONGEST time, you couldn&#39;t even use more than 1 app at a time on Apple. This was at a time when I was getting into day trading part time and would have 4-6 apps open simultaneously via Android.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lol, sound sso strange. Most Android users never go back to apple.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t. Plenty of speed tests by third parties and other apps, plus Android is not a monopoly married to a name/hardware. Android is on dozens of different phones companies all over the world with zero licensing fees. </p>

<p>Only problem: Android doesnt do forced or nagging users to upgrade to the newest OS while slowing your phone down because OS&#39;s from 6+ years ago are still working fine no problem.</p>

<p>Phone companies are fucking everyone in countries where a person pays more than $35 a month. Deregulation in various countries like Israel for example, allows there to be sooooo much competition, the standard regular use phone place is around $11 unlimited</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also a sysadmin. While we still need to use Windows for certain tasks (and our servers) two of our sites have about 800 iOS devices between them ranging from Apple TVs, iPhones and a lot of iPads. We use DEP for deployment and JAMF Pro to manage our fleet and it&#39;s so much simpler than even the Windows devices (which as you&#39;d know are I.T. bread and butter). Software licencing is a cinch as well as pushing apps to certain departments that need them. We can completely administrate the devices remotely and know they&#39;re secure because of the enclave.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no worries about differing versions of Android (when is the manufacturer going to release the latest version?! Are we secure?!) and servicing is easy because when the devices fall out of warranty every phone repairer will have cheap parts on hand to get devices going again, as opposed to some Android devices where it&#39;s cheaper to get a new device than try to repair them.</p>

<p>1:1 Android is more open but Apple is simpler, most of the staff have used iOS devices in the past so for them it&#39;s pick it up and off you go, if you&#39;ve never used Android there can be a learning curve. Also everything Apple will work together, whenever someone needs to present something the built-in Airplay mirroring to an AppleTV is a godsend, no more fussing with 3rd party add-on software (chromecast etc.)</p>

It makes phone calls, texts, emails, browses the web and I have a watch that has all of the notifications for them on a simple and easy to use interface that I can also use to pay for my lunch in two clicks. I really don&#39;t know what else I need to be doing on this phone that would make me feel like I&#39;m getting more out of it. I&#39;ve had two android work phones and I hated them both. Scrolling was chunky. The screens were impossible to see in daylight. Why the fuck do I need 3 messaging apps? I did like customizing launchers and stuff but I seriously don&#39;t understand what I was so much more capable of doing on those phones than I am on my personal and company iPhone. I guess I&#39;m not a &quot;power user&quot; or whatever the android fanboys call me. </p>

My family all uses iphones &amp; even though I am using Apple laptops &amp; Ipad Pros... My older Samsung Galaxy 6 is much more snappy than our iphone 7.</p>

<p>I like music apps on Iphone but for taking photos, text, notes with a pen &amp; 4k video.....i&#39;ll take Samsung Galaxy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I repair electronics for a living, I just want to clear up the first paragraph...</p>

<p>Apple didn&#39;t &quot;make your batteries worse.&quot;  </p>

<p>As they roll out new versions of iOS they understandably focus them on the newest, greatest phones and design them to use those phones to their fullest potential.  Because the new versions of iOS run on older hardware though, they can strain them a bit.  </p>

<p>Now, the issue is, the batteries inside your phone are Lithium based and degrade over time from charging and discharging over and over.  When a battery degrades to a certain point, the phone can actually require more power while stressed than the battery can safely put out, so the phone shuts down.  This is a pretty common thing on Android phones that have old batteries in them because of the fact that they didn&#39;t pull the shit that Apple did.  </p>

<p>What Apple did is limit your processing power based on the health of your battery, so that your phone wouldn&#39;t demand more power than it could get from an old battery and shut down with no warning.  They (wrongfully) decided that random shut-downs were a worse user experience than a slower processor.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I have a problem with their solution from a utilitarian perspective, but the way they went about it was definitely wrong.  If they had been up front about what was going on from the get-go and/or just made their batteries easily replaceable or swappable this would be a really elegant solution.  But instead, they charged $75 dollars for a battery replacement and continued to try and make it more difficult for third-parties to replace with every iteration of the phone.  </p>

<p>In essence, don&#39;t necessarily get mad at the solution, the slowing down of the hardware, it was actually a pretty smart move, but feel free to hold against them the fact that they knew it was an issue an refused to make it easily or cheaply solvable and instead capitalized on it even more.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this just terrible/defective power management? I&#39;ve never had an android phone randomly power down when I did something too cpu intensive. Sure maybe if you have a dead battery with a 5m fully charged run time, but that&#39;s an edge case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The short answer is &quot;nobody is sure.&quot; The fact that apple is offering it as a solution leads most people to believe that it will fix the issue, but as far as I know no one has run the benchmarks before and after a battery replacement yet.  It makes sense in theory that it would, and it is the most likely case that it would, but until people start testing it and running more benchmarks it&#39;s hard to say for certain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be careful with Samsung phones, they&#39;re great phones but Samsung inflates the cost of parts by quite a bit, so repairs can be really pricey. if your buying soon i couldn&#39;t recommend anything more than the LG V20.

Your software is corrupt and can be fixed however it will reformat in the process, erasing the file tree and de-indexing your content(the phone wont find your files after reformatting but they are simply marked by the system as all clear to overwrite). The files can be pulled off with a computer and the right software, ideally before a reformat is attempted to resurrect the device.

    <div class="md"><p>My experiences:</p>

<p>iPhone 4 and 4S:
Both of them became laggy from the update that came out when the new phones came out.
iPhone 5: gf had battery issues as soon as the 6 came out.
Apple laptop pro from about 2016:
It would randomly start running slow, tried everything, then I&#39;d download the update and it would fix it for awhile.
Then the battery expanded (lol) and now the curser button doesn&#39;t work. It became so slow I couldn&#39;t even watch a YouTube video on it, I gave up and remembered the update trick, tried it....it worked for a few weeks and it&#39;s back to being unusable. </p>

<p>Switched to a sub $100 Motorola Moto E (gen 2) phone in early 2015</p>

<p>I still have it today, I use it all day for casting, surfing, selfies, apps, etc. It&#39;s great and it fits my hand good...but get this...it&#39;s now 2018 and there&#39;s literally no degradation in the battery. I keep figuring it will do what apple phones all do with their batteries but it never has. 
Only update I got recently was a security update that came out in December 2016...I put it off for awhile figuring it would finally kill my phone as I learned from Apple. D/l it a few months ago and everything still works exactly the same. </p>

<p>I&#39;m posting on it right now. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine my experiences with Apple were all coincidences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your synopsis be of what happened with apple is off by a significant margin. When you say:</p>

<p>&quot;Apple issued a software update that seemed to make the battery life of older iPhones worse and were caught doing so. They tried to explain it by saying they were doing something to help iPhone users...&quot;</p>

<p>That is factually incorrect afaik.  What happens is battery performance in phones diminishes with age and is to be expected, apple did nothing to degrade battery performance.  Apple was caught throttling processor speeds with new updates to older phones.  They tried to explain it away by saying that because battery performance diminishes over time, they were throttling processor speed to alleviate some of the load on ok&#39;d batteries in an effort to combat increased battery drain.  They fucked up because it&#39;s bullshit. How does apple know, whether or not someone has just replaced a battery? What metric did they use to assess how &quot;worn-out&quot; each person&#39;s individual battery was and did they have an auto-adjusting processor speed function in the updates to compensate? Why didn&#39;t they simply offer an choice between os modes which allow users to choose between processor friendly or battery friendly? Why weren&#39;t they transparent in notifying users before downloading the update? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a blatant case of planned obsolescence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for adding some corrections, AngryD09. I&#39;ll add a couple more things, also &quot;as far as I know&quot;.</p>

<p>Owners of some older iPhones were experiencing &quot;sudden, unexpected shutoff&quot;. The apparent reason was aging batteries. Most of these devices have a battery monitoring circuit which can, among other things, be used to safeguard the device against low battery voltage. This is apparently what was shutting down those older phones. It looks like Apple decided that reducing processor load, by either reducing processor speed or not using some cores, would help prevent the sudden shutdown scenario, so that&#39;s what they rolled out.</p>

<p>To answer some of your questions:
Apple doesn&#39;t know when you have replaced your battery, but the battery monitor circuit no longer detects a weak/bad battery condition.
The metric used to detect and assess how &quot;worn-out&quot; a battery is the drop in battery output voltage under load.
All modern smart-phone processors have had the ability to run their processing cores at varying speeds, and to not use some cores for quite a while now. These features are used to enhance battery life by giving you processing power when you need it and saving power at other times.
User friendly battery changing was sacrificed at the alter of sexy thinness. A user removable battery needs to be more robust, which usually means thicker, for safety, but super-thin is in, so we now have super thin batteries soldered into our phones.
Last answer: once the battery has been replaced, the phone should operate at full speed again, until that battery wears out.</p>

<p>Finally, I totally agree with you that Apple should have been transparent about the update, and they should definitely given the user the choice of faster processor or unexpected shut-down (= slower processor) protection modes.</p>

<p>I always wondered why they never exploded since they had a very good idea (create a phone with many different pieces that were customizable).</p>

<p>And the answer is.. they don&#39;t want any phones that are capable of opening up the hardware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this so funny. They slowed down iPhones to maintain battery life, as an iPhone running at full space with a degraded battery will drain it further. To be honest, if this was a feature I could toggle on my phone, I would absolutely turn it on. They way Apple did it without telling people is annoying, but this is in no way a conspiracy. Apple is notorious for doing things that are better for the consumer without telling them (not always great, but I get it). </p>

<p>Apple isn&#39;t destroying the battery in the phone like OPs Tesla example. Its more like Tesla sending out an update slowing down acceleration to maintain the range that you need in your car. Again, Apple is using the battery. The battery naturally degrades over time.</p>
