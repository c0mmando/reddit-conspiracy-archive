       I think the top 3 picks are: David Crosby, James Taylor, Neil Diamond.

       In light of this... Neil Diamond's "Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon" is a bit creepy.  Not to mention Sweet Caroline when viewed from a certain context... and jeeze... google tells me that he flat out said it was an ode to JFK's young daughter caroline who was like 12 in 1969!?

       Nicolette Larson is the dead singer/songwriter. The album is her last, "Sleep, Baby Sleep."
      </p>
      <p>
       Allmusic guide shows David Crosby and Graham Nash all over that album, with Neil Young contributing a song. It's produced by Andrew Gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing indicating that James Taylor worked on "Sleep, Baby, Sleep", but given what went down during the production, Larson might have omitted JT's material from the final product.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time Larson was recording "Sleep Baby Sleep," Young was recording "Harvest Moon," where James Taylor and Nicolette Larson are credited as backing vocalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taylor got divorced from Kathryn Walker in 1995. Are there details about the divorce? If not, that's telling. Carefully constructed facade fits. Rose to fame in 1970.
      </p>
      <p>
       B could be Astrid Young, a good friend to Larson, according to wikipedia. She's the sister of Neil Young, who would be  C.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus:
      </p>
      <p>
       A+ = James Taylor
      </p>
      <p>
       Singer/Songwriter = Nicolette Larson
      </p>
      <p>
       B = Astrid Young
      </p>
      <p>
       C = Neil Young
      </p>
      <p>
       ex-wife of A+ lister: Kathryn Walker
      </p>
      <p>
       Neil Diamond has his own issues but that's not part of this train wreck.

       Oh, it's in the comments on CDAN that Jewel put out a kid's album, and she did a lot of recording with Neil on his ranch. Timelines seem to fit, and she's not exactly an A-lister any more, although I would argue Neil is a permanent A+ and has had the requisite divorces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eh, food for thought. I doubt it'll ever be revealed by Enty unless the person dies.

       I really don't like Neil for this. The line about being a rock star to sleep with underage girls is not his vibe at all. That sounds like Rod Stewart or David Lee Roth (no money though.). If you follow the blinds, all the music ones are mainstream artists. No outsiders, punks, iconoclasts, etc. Its the Mamas and Papas, The Carpenters, Marvin Gaye, etc. usually.

       I don’t know what to make of it. There is no true accusation in it. It seemed more slippery than others. Like today’s blind says point blank that this stuff happened. I did think of one alt star who has some whispers but I’m not sure there is a blind about him: Kurt Cobain.

       Honestly I wouldn't put Neil Young as a A+ singer. He's a folk artist, him as a singer isn't what he's known as but more his unique style. Like Bob Dylan or something. Also, watching interviews of him, he's like a silly delusional grandpa writing songs about Monsanto and shit. He didn't have the same sort of hedonistic tendencies as the other rock n rollers. I think this is totally off the mark.

       This part is critical

       "The wife told the mom/singer who had simply just been making a record for kids. That mom/singer was crushed. She had looked up to the A+ list singer. She turned to a friend of hers who was also a singer (B) and told her what had happened. Apparently B knew about the A+ list singer and B said that a very close relative of hers was the same way back in the day. That relative, C, is also a permanent A+ lister and for a decade never had sex with anyone over 18, except for his wife. His philosophy was that he became a rock star to have sex with groupies. Very young groupies."
      </p>
      <p>
       So - singer girl tells another singer girl, who says her A+ list relative was the same way...
      </p>
      <p>
       So there are TWO A+ list pedo rock stars. One is a close relative with a singer girl.

       Oh, it's in the comments on CDAN that Jewel put out a kid's album, and she did a lot of recording with Neil on his ranch. Timelines seem to fit, and she's not exactly an A-lister any more, although I would argue Neil is a permanent A+ and has had the requisite divorces.

       Eh, food for thought. I doubt it'll ever be revealed by Enty unless the person dies.
