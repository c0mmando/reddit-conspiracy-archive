        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Walmart cashiers are slow as shit. I was annoyed enough by this to begin asking, as politely as possible, if they are not encouraged to work faster. So far, no cashier in my region has made any mention that management encourages them to work quickly or efficiently. Minimum wage employees will naturally put in minimum effort, making their work slow. Add understaffing and you can herd customers to self checkout.</p>

<p>Does anyone have corroborating evidence of this? A shared experience or similar questions&amp;answers? First, is there a top-down lack of pressure to work quickly? Second, is this to hasten the obsolescence of human cashiers? </p>

<p>The thing about self checkout that bothers me is that I&#39;m doing their job for them, so why don&#39;t I get a discount on my purchases? That&#39;s the real conspiracy here...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find people under 30 speed through most self-checkouts. I work faster than most, I&#39;d rather it be done this way. I don&#39;t need interaction and I really hate having to watch someone drag ass about as much as I hate hearing people chew.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t a fucking clue why my closest grocery store got rid of all <em>eight</em> of their machines. At least save one for the more competent.</p>

<p>As for the sake of the economy, there&#39;s more important work to be done than servicing people anyway. Retail is a waste of manpower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I managed Walmart, not a &#39;conspiracy&#39;.</p>

<p>All the &#39;disabled&#39; type people become cashiers. The fast people stock shelves and do heavy lifting.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Show up to a Walmart at 4am, and you&#39;ll see a lot of young and hard working older people lifting and putting up shit for 8 hours straight.</p>

<p>Go to the Cashiers and you&#39;ll see some happy people, but also a lot of lazy people who don&#39;t want to actually have to do work (or hard work).</p>

<p>Cashiers are smart though. If they move too fast, they become stockers / get put into more work (like government). They prefer the slowness, fake a disability, AND cashiering pays $3 more than working hard as a stocker, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do. Associates have a scanned items per minute score and the top ones usually receive incentives by managers. Customer Service Managers and our front end managers push and try to motivate the slower ones, but often they can&#39;t because a lot of workers are just tired, naturally slow, or other reasons that cause them to be slow. Plus, when you&#39;re being yelled at by 200 different customers a day because you put something in a bag that they don&#39;t want in a bag, or if they insist the price is wrong, and just get shit on by customers daily, it really makes it hard for you to be as fast as you can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>have to admit i love self checkout, though i do realize and am saddened that it will phase people out eventually. i just hate fucking talking to people and want to spare check out folks my sullen discomfort that always comes across as dickish impatience. plus there&#39;s never any lines.</p>

<p>however it&#39;s not all bad. i had to run out to home depot christmas eve afternoon and they only had 3 employees working. one overseeing the self check out and two other stand abouts. everyone else got christmas eve off. when&#39;s the last time home depot gave everyone but 3 people christmas eve off? bob cratchet did a jig in is fictional grave.</p>

<p>and the other night i ran into CVS for something pretty late (all i know is i ended up buying a stuffed kevin the minion that was by the checkout counter). the girl on duty just has to monitor the self checkout machines since she&#39;s there alone at night and its safer than having the cash in the register and she can walk around the store to check things out periodically, with leaving the register unguarded.</p>

<p>if the work week was in line with productivity, it would only be 11hrs long at max. so instead of paying one person to work 40 hours, 4 people could be paid to work 11 hours each, each getting the salary of a full time worker. this would be synergy with the self check out machines, like the CVS girl at night. the increase in payroll is more than offset by the gains from increased productivity.</p>

<p>the 40 hour work week was itself fought for by unions to give 2 people a job that used to be done by 1 in 80-100 work weeks. it was a tool to try to achieve full employment,  which is the only true way for strikes to succeed and wages and work environments to rise. no scabs can cross the picket and break the strike if everyone&#39;s got a job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. It depends on location. The Walmart just down the street from me pays $9.25/hr. A friend of mine got hired 3 months ago, and is now making $12.25 (transferred to stocking), so there IS room for advancement, ya just gotta work for it. But, most of the cashiers here are indeed slow, so I can imagine the ones who don&#39;t show incentive won&#39;t be advancing anytime soon. On a side note, making $12.25/hr where I live is amazing since 99% of the other businesses only pay minimum wage, so unless you&#39;re a server at a restaurant, the best bet around these parts is Wally World.</p>

<p>Probably not many, considering the volume that goes through Walmart every day in North America alone.</p>

<p>In the now, they&#39;re giving people that might not have the chance for gainful employment elsewhere. They offer a lot of jobs to the disabled, seniors, etc.</p>

<p>However they are gouging their low level, non-full time (mostly seniors, or the disabled) employees in many ways, <a href="https://www.disabled-world.com/editorials/guilty.php">this article goes in depth on the subject, but it&#39;s not quite on the subject of OP&#39;s submission.</a> 
This article is interesting if you consider the volume of McDonalds that exist within Wal-Marts.. but i digress.. Maybe this is best left for a different post.</p>

<p>So, back to the point of OP&#39;s post. In the future.. we should see the demand for these Cashiers to go to nil sooner than later. I absolutely agree with the fact that installing these particular people, and giving them next to no incentives, is pushing the move. I have no doubt about it.</p>

<p>TLDR: There is a reason every member of the Walton family is a billionare, self checkouts are more than likely already paid for, so yeah, what rich asshole wouldn&#39;t want to cash in on a free employee robit.</p>

<p>I do believe in an unrelated but similar kind of conspiracy regarding Microsoft Exchange server.  Removing the Windows management application in favor of a reduced functionality web interface and required CLI configuration is an intentional change designed to make Exchange more difficult to manage, encouraging customers to buy into Office 365 subscriptions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently if the store loses enough money because of the self checkout scanners they decide to go back to having more cashiers. Honestly I&#39;m not sure why one of my local grocery stores that is a chain decided to get rid of their self checkout machines. But I assume it is because enough people pretending to pay. The grocery store I visit has had a very high increase in traffic over the last year. Or two.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  Retail sales are affected by local and governmental policy and costs such as min wage and the fluctuating price of other inputs such as energy, real estate, lease and loan costs, as well as insurance, liability, loss, and taxes.  When these costs go up, without corresponding profits, you have inflation. And since Walmart is a public company, it receives more than 25 times its retail revenue from investment, so conceivably it can only care 1/25th about retail operations. So when the cost of living goes up, typically by poor governmental policy and increased taxes, retail operations are forced to squeeze budgets in order to justify to shareholders why 1/25th of the company is being disrupted.  The reason Walmart employees are slow is because the cost of living is so high the Walmart employee probably has multiple jobs and can&#39;t be dedicated to all of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I work at Walmart and it&#39;s simply because they&#39;re tired of doing the same thing over and over. Plus, they go slow on purpose sometimes if they&#39;re in a shit mood. No manager or Walmart is making them less productive on purpose. </p>

<p>Walmart is promoting self checkouts because soon most Walmarts will only have self checkouts. Mine that I work at is doing this next week. This is because you have have a lot more self checkouts than actual registers so there will be less lines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for your point about low numbers of open registers, they&#39;re maximizing their profits. If they can get the same number of customers through three fewer cashiers, not only are they not having to pay those extras, they&#39;re also avoiding as much cashier down time as possible. Walmart is a middle man by design. The best way to make money as a middle man is by making sure you yourself have as few middle men as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who was a minimum wage cashier, this is a fantastic and funny post for a lot of raisins. </p>

<p>It’s less about encouraging self checkout and more to do with low morale and scheduling policies encouraging managers to only schedule the bare minimum as far cashiers go; there is a point where the amount of people who drop their merchandise and leave because they don’t want to wait in line starts to hurt sales more than the amount of money that chronically understaffing the front end/checkout lines saves in labor costs. As long as you don’t cross that threshold, it is worth it to only have 2 or 3 cashiers out of 12-20 possible lanes. Everyone who is buying someone is going to eventually check out anyways and so it doesn’t matter to management how quick pr slow they get through, as long as they pay.</p>

<p>As far as speed, those kinds of jobs are mind numbing, the pay is low, and the prospects are bleak— no one wants to be there and no one wants to ‘work quicker’ because they aren’t getting paid enough and even if they were it is still mentally exhausting, not something you can keep up all day. </p>

<p>Also OP it needs to be said, when you say passive aggressive things like “hasn’t your manager asked you to work quicker?” you are not going to get much faster service, you’re just going to make the cashier upset with you 9 times out of 10, lol</p>

<p>tl;dr the problem isn’t a conspiracy to usher in an age of automation, it’s Wal-mart’s policy of wasting your valuable time because it saves on labor costs</p>

<p>the down side to self check-out is loss of jobs in any local community.</p>

<p>if you want wives and teens to have part time jobs then boycott self-checkout for normal cart sized purchases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find people under 30 speed through most self-checkouts. I work faster than most, I&#39;d rather it be done this way. I don&#39;t need interaction and I really hate having to watch someone drag ass about as much as I hate hearing people chew.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t a fucking clue why my closest grocery store got rid of all <em>eight</em> of their machines. At least save one for the more competent.</p>

<p>As for the sake of the economy, there&#39;s more important work to be done than servicing people anyway. Retail is a waste of manpower.</p>
