<p>Going beyond Christianity, if spirituality and religion didn’t have a biologically positive benefit, we would have evolved away from it tens of thousands (maybe even hundreds of thousands) of years ago. </p>

<p>I find the belief that the biblical stories are a distilled set of stories (or myths) meant to inspire people to a higher purpose.  Biologically I believe the drive towards a higher purpose has merit in perpetuating the best the species has to offer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no, many atheists subscribe to Peterson’s psychological telling of the Bible as series of higher purpose, but man made stories.  I think the evolutionary biologist popular on podcasts, Weinstein, believes this also. </p>

<p>Even Peterson has said when asked if he believes in a metaphysical god that  [paraphrasing] “whether I do or not believe in god is none of your business, I behave as if he does”</p>

<p>I would say a deist or agnostic is different than  atheists in that they acknowledge the possibility of a god, or gods, but have no way to prove it one way or another.  I fall into this category but subscribe to the evolutionary theory of religion also. </p>

<p>(((Weinstein))). You can read my comment history for more on this can of worms. The notion that you can disprove the existence of god means that the idea is not correctly formed in the mind. It is a consequence of seating the self there instead. </p>

<p>I remember Weinstein saying &quot;not everything happens for a reason&quot;. I think this sentence sums up the distinction I am trying to make. While this is true, believing in God is the attempt at telling the difference, and so the recursive &quot;everything happens for a reason&quot; is superior and inclusive.  </p>

<p>You can&#39;t build on the mind, it is only a stepping stone. You have to build on Nature, i.e. Brocca and early German neuroscience. </p>

<p>Weinstein is relatively new to me and I admit I may have a blind spot with his views because I have not spent as much time listening to his views as I have with Peterson (far north of 100 hours).

<p>Brocca was a die hard liberal, until he learned about the brain. While discovering Brocca&#39;s area, he realized that people are computers, and limited by the ability to compute --&gt; from genetics. The German neuroscience of the 1850s was devoted to understanding how humans worked, ignoring the metaphysical aspects as you say. </p>

<p>(((Freud))) came along and trapped everyone in the metaphysics. The problem with his psychology is that it created more problems than it solved. There is no way to distinguish between real and fake in his world, because it is not grounded in physics or physiology. Knowledge of Freud&#39;s methods, change the results. It is only applicable for brainwashing, not brain growing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m well aware. </p>

<p>Most authorities, however, agree on the following account. The whole of Egypt was once plagued by a wasting disease which caused bodily disfigurement. So pharaoh Bocchorisnote went to the oracle of Hammonnote to ask for a cure, and was told to purify his kingdom by expelling the victims to other lands, as they lay under a divine curse. Thus a multitude of sufferers was rounded up, herded together, and abandoned in the wilderness. Here the exiles tearfully resigned themselves to their fate. But one of them, who was called Moses, urged his companions not to wait passively for help from god or man, for both had deserted them: they should trust to their own initiative and to whatever guidance first helped them to extricate themselves from their present plight. They agreed, and started off at random into the unknown. But exhaustion set in, chiefly through lack of water, and the level plain was already strewn with the bodies of those who had collapsed and were at their last gasp when a herd of wild asses left their pasture and made for the spade of a wooded crag. Moses followed them and was able to bring to light a number of abundant channels of water whose presence he had deduced from a grassy patch of ground. This relieved their thirst. They traveled on for six days without a break, and on the seventh they expelled the previous inhabitants of Canaan, took over their lands and in them built a holy city and temple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion is the opiate of the masses, but it&#39;s also 50 other things, as Jordan Peterson might say.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a massive rift between the words of Christ (fictional or not) and the dogma of the Catholic Church. The former are teachings of liberation, the latter of oppression.</p>

<p>The church, in my view, is a limited hangout for true spirituality ( which is not exclusive to Christ&#39;s teachings).</p>

<p>Please read below the state of Jerusalem in 70 AD. Now where do you think most of the important religious documents were kept?</p>

<p>Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 AD by the Romans, along with who knows how many important historical documents.</p>

<p>Read below of the eyewitness account of what was left of Jerusalem. Josephus had acted as a mediator for the Romans and, when negotiations failed, witnessed the siege and aftermath. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now as soon as the army had no more people to slay or to plunder, because there remained none to be the objects of their fury (for they would not have spared any, had there remained any other work to be done), [Titus] Caesar gave orders that they should now demolish the entire city and Temple, but should leave as many of the towers standing as they were of the greatest eminence; that is, Phasaelus, and Hippicus, and Mariamne; and so much of the wall enclosed the city on the west side. This wall was spared, in order to afford a camp for such as were to lie in garrison [in the Upper City], as were the towers [the three forts] also spared, in order to demonstrate to posterity what kind of city it was, and how well fortified, which the Roman valor had subdued; but for all the rest of the wall [surrounding Jerusalem], it was so thoroughly laid even with the ground by those that dug it up to the foundation, that there was left nothing to make those that came thither believe it [Jerusalem] had ever been inhabited. This was the end which Jerusalem came to by the madness of those that were for innovations; a city otherwise of great magnificence, and of mighty fame among all mankind.[2] And truly, the very view itself was a melancholy thing; for those places which were adorned with trees and pleasant gardens, were now become desolate country every way, and its trees were all cut down. Nor could any foreigner that had formerly seen Judaea and the most beautiful suburbs of the city, and now saw it as a desert, but lament and mourn sadly at so great a change. For the war had laid all signs of beauty quite waste. Nor had anyone who had known the place before, had come on a sudden to it now, would he have known it again. But though he [a foreigner] were at the city itself, yet would he have inquired for it.[3] source:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegeof_Jerusalem%28AD_70%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegeof_Jerusalem%28AD_70%29</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are two Romans that wrote about Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Cornelius Tacitus was a Roman Historian</strong> who lived from 55-120AD. In 115 AD, P. Cornelius Tacitus wrote the following passage that refers to Jesus (called “Christus,” which means “The Messiah”) in book 15, chapter 44 of The Annals after a six-day fire burned much of Rome:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the fact the clearly despised Christianity as a “mischievous superstition”, Tacitus no less confirms once again the existence of Jesus and His crucifixion on the cross, it also states Pontius Pilate as the procurator who oversaw the crucifixion again giving non-Biblical proof of Jesus’ existence as recorded in the Bible.</p>

<p><strong>Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus, (61 AD – ca. 112 AD) : “better known as Pliny the Younger, was a lawyer, author, and magistrate of Ancient Rome</strong>. According to Wikipedia: “Pliny is known for his hundreds of surviving letters, which are an invaluable historical source for the time period. Many are addressed to reigning emperors or to notables such as the historian, Tacitus. Pliny himself was a notable figure, serving as an imperial magistrate under Trajan (reigned AD 98–117). Pliny was considered an honest and moderate man, consistent in his pursuit of suspected Christian members according to Roman law, and rose through a series of Imperial civil and military offices, the cursus honorum.” In his correspondence with the emperor Trajan (Epistulae X.96) he reported on his actions against the followers of Christ. He asks the Emperor for instructions dealing with Christians and explained that he forced Christians to curse Christ under painful torturous inquisition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“They were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god, and bound themselves to a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft, adultery, never to falsify their word, not to deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up. When this was over, it was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partake of a meal–but ordinary and innocent food.” So not only was Pliny aware of Jesus Christ, he also provides description of the activities of the early church. In a later writing he details persecution against Christians:</p>

<p>“Even this practice, however, they had abandoned after the publication of my edict, by which, according to your orders, I had forbidden political associations. I therefore judged it so much more the necessary to extract the real truth, with the assistance of torture, from two female slaves, who were styled deaconesses: but I could discover nothing more than depraved and excessive superstition. In the meanwhile, the method I have observed towards those who have denounced to me as Christians is this: I interrogated them whether they were Christians; if they confessed it I repeated the question twice again, adding the threat of capital punishment; if they still persevered, I ordered them to be executed. For whatever the nature of their creed might be, I could at least feel not doubt that contumacy and inflexible obstinacy deserved chastisement. There were others possessed of the same folly; but because they were Roman citizens, I signed an order for them to be transferred to Rome.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So here we see that not only did Pliny not follow the Christian faith, he was torturing Christians and threatening death against them. And he even records that under threat of execution (just for believing in Jesus Christ as God) the early church members refused to deny their faith in Jesus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly have not read the Dead Sea Scrolls, they disprove your claim. Also, I have you examples of different interpretations of Christianity, do you respect them all equally as you originally claimed? Clearly not.</p>

<p>&quot;Pagan&quot; means &quot;not-christian&quot; btw, a pretty ignorant term, like everything not Christian is the same thing. Obviously Christianity grew out of and was heavily influenced by them. Where do you imagine Christianity came from? Moses was an Egyptian prince, the Egyptian royal family were religous leaders, priests, like modern Iran. Moses knew all about &quot;pagan&quot; Egyptian esoteric mystery religion, and incorporated that into Judaism and for example the Kabbalah. Jesus was a Jew, and lived in a time where many &quot;pagan&quot; religions flourished in the area he lived, obviously he would know about their ideas and be influenced. And much of what we term &quot;Christianity&quot; was invented long after Christ, by people who also had close contact and knowledge of other religions. There is no mention of Santa Claus or 25. December in the Bible, they are &quot;pagan&quot; holidays and customs.</p>
