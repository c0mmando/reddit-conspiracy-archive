        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Endless articles by all the usual experts about Trump&#39;s &quot;mental instability&quot; and &quot;erratic nature&quot;...my response has always been, &quot;that&#39;s just Trump. The man is a troll for better or worse.&quot;</p>

<p>But when delusions of grandeur and the need to announce one&#39;s &quot;genius&quot; nature are presented in tandem, I start to worry. This jives not only with my experience of having a grandparent slip into dementia (&quot;of course nothing&#39;s wrong with me&quot; as things are clearly wrong and getting worse) but also my experience with a mentally ill, schizophrenia-breaching close friend, who would alternate between deep soul-level self doubt and towering shows of desperate belief in his own capabilities. </p>

<p>Now, it is possible and even likely that Trump says shit like this solely to pushback against accusations of his deteriorating mental state and alleged idiocy, to reassure the base that it&#39;s all liberal propaganda meant to inevitably take him down. And this very well may be the case really. </p>

<p>But ask yourself this: if any other US president took the time to pronounce how intelligent and with-it they are, would you be concerned that maybe he&#39;s really losing it in some essential way? We saw what happened to Reagan during his second turn-- that was the world&#39;s most prominent person gradually sundowning for all to see. Is that what&#39;s happening here? Are we all fooling ourselves by not taking the mental health concerns seriously? </p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>He has the family history. He’s in his seventies. He does not eat well. He does not exercise. He is under the tremendous stress of the presidency, and tremendous additional stress from knowing he is likely going to jail, penniless.</p>

<p>The family history <em>alone</em> would virtually guarantee the degeneration would occur at some point prior to his death, whether six months or six years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, what just struck me. When did Trump have the official last press conference, where he was asked questions by the press, which were <strong>not</strong> previously selected by his administration?</p>

<p>I only remember that infamous one just after his Inauguration in February and some with the foreign politicians, e.g. Merkel, Trudeau. during the summer. </p>

<p>There seems to be almost no live footage of Trump reacting to a genuine questions, challenging him to think on his own, for a while now.</p>

<p>TRUMP: Which one?</p>

<p>SCHMIDT: You said about the oil, that China. …</p>

<p>[Cross talk.]</p>

<p>SCHMIDT: What’s going on there. Tell me about that.</p>

<p>TRUMP: Yeah, China. … China’s been. … I like very much President Xi. He treated me better than anybody’s ever been treated in the history of China. You know that. The presentations. … One of the great two days of anybody’s life and memory having to do with China. He’s a friend of mine, he likes me, I like him, we have a great chemistry together. He’s [inaudible] of the United States. …[Inaudible.] China’s hurting us very badly on trade, but I have been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war. O.K.?</p>
