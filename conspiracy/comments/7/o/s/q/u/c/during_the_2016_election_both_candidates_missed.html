If you want to reach the most voters, why go to another country while campaigning? Its the craziest thing that candidates can go to a foreign country during the campaign and no one blinks, but Russia spending 500 dollars on facebook ads is a bigger deal? If foriegn bodies are not allowed in, why does Israel get special treatment. Blaiming Russia keeps people from seeing Israel&#39;s influence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be nice if it was actually like that. In reality it’s 44.5% all libs are bad, 44.5% all conservatives are bad, and 1% people who actually consider all available evidence and at least try to come to an informed decision. Users you’d think are completely reasonable often turn out to be just another firm believer in whatever propaganda they’ve managed to absorb. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another question: Why are state governors going to Israel to meet with Benji?</p>

<p><a href="https://governorblog.utah.gov/2017/10/governor-returns-from-trade-mission-to-israel-and-jordan/">https://governorblog.utah.gov/2017/10/governor-returns-from-trade-mission-to-israel-and-jordan/</a></p>

<p>I know it says business ties, but why are governors doing this? Seems like the role of state departments, national leaders, not State leaders. Also, so many states are signing onto the anti-BDS train, which seems unconstitutional. I could be wrong. I&#39;m just tired of Israeli influence. (Also British banking influence, but that&#39;s another topic)</p>

<p>I think Israel is the real deep state that runs the us government though and Russia is a convenient distraction while Trump pushes the Zionist agenda even more aggressively than Clinton would have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Semi related. I&#39;m curious why Trump would spend 1 second In California campaigning? If you were him would you exert 10 calories and / or spend $3 in California? Israel is one thing, skipping states just proves an IQ above room temperature. Fighting a battle one can&#39;t win seems... wasteful.</p>
