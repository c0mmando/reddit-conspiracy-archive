        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The most fundamental and pervasive conspiracy being propagated in Western societies is that individual inutive truths are inferior to the truths being churned out by academia, the scientific community, and other instituions.</p>

<p>When I say individual intuitive truths I am referring to things that people with a lot of experience and time doing something feel to be true about that thing based on their own subjective experience. Intuitive truths manifest as &#39;feelings&#39; about something.</p>

<p>Examples would be the business leader who uses his gut to make key strategic decisions, the philosopher that feels one logical framework more true than another, the meditation guru that feels certain thoughts and ideas to be more true than others, the mother that feels when her children are in danger, or even just when you interact with people and know things to be true about that person when you dont know how or why.</p>

<p>These intuitions, at the very minimum, reflect countless hours of accumulated experience and knowledge. We know that we all have a very powerful subconscious mind that is largely hidden from us that stores what it considers the relevant stuff, sometimes showing us pieces and parts. Maybe sometimes we see images, words, or remember sounds, but often we just feel things that are hard to put into words. Then we take these feelings to make life decisions.</p>

<p>These intuitions are completely individualized based on each person&#39;s unique genetics and life experiences, and are incredibly powerful.</p>

<p>Given that we know this to be universally true across all cultures, WHY IS IT THAT SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS, MSM CONTENT, AND ACADEMIC STUDIES ARE SO OFTEN VIEWED AS MORE TRUE THAN INDIVIDUAL INSIGHTS?</p>

<p>here are some arguments that may sound familiar:</p>

<p>-those people are professionals, they know what they are talking about</p>

<ul>
<li><p>wont believe that until the scientific community backs it</p></li>
<li><p>Thats different then what we learned in school , and the school is ivy league</p></li>
</ul>

<p>-Most people disagree...</p>

<p>-this does not fit with XYZ accepted theory</p>

<p>It is evident that:</p>

<ul>
<li>MSM content is pure bullshit</li>
</ul>

<p>-history was told by the victors</p>

<p>-virtually every theory in the scientific community has huge holes in it in light of recent data</p>

<p>-academia will always be behind the times and continue churning out regurgitators</p>

<p>It is also evident that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it is hard to separate real intuitive insights from all the other feelings. example: some one feels some one else is a bad person but the actual reason they feel that person is bad because the person is jealous of the other person or because they disagree with something that person said</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to figure out which feelings are intutive insights and which are just feelings takes time and practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Whereas logic can be reproduced and shared, feelings are subjective. Science loves the empirical and feelings are def not considered empirical in most fields.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The point I am trying to make is, individual intuitions are actively discredited in western societies. We are all being constantly told to believe fake bullshit, and that our own subjective knowledge is not only inferior, but that it is an invalid source of legit information.</p>

<p>This is at fundamental odds with the one thing we know to be true, which is that our minds generate very profound insights that are completely true to each individuals situation.</p>

<p>THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE ARE FED SO MUCH CRAP AND CONDITIONED TO AVOID INTUITIVE INSIGHTS. The result is that most ppl dont even know how to access their intuitive insights,  let alone begin to figure out how to separate the real insights from the regular feelings.</p>

<p>Its a tragedy that they are actively trying to keep this hidden from us.</p>

<p>All the issues you mentioned above and the people that propagate these attacks against your free will are people that hated their own free will or were given no real choice (indoctrinated at a young age inside their families..) and have refused to fight for their own free will and instead sold it out or given it to a hivemind and then hate theirselves for this choice and project their self hatred onto you buly declaring war on anything snd everything good in existence.</p>

<p>Thats the story, like it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Philosopher Alan Watts was fascinated by this and explains that though science has helped us cure disease and live more comfortably, we try to describe an ultimately indescribable existence down to the finest detail using words, science, etc. This has in turn left us feeling that we need to control everything, and removes us from the vulnerability of spontaneity.</p>

<p>He uses an analogy of calculus trying to define the wiggly, natural world by using infinitely small &quot;blocks&quot; (think integrations). It works for practical purposes, but ultimately it is impossible to describe &quot;wiggly&quot; objects (literally and metaphorically) with hard, rigid math and science.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this an argument supporting the increased policing of minorities?  Cops (who have a lot of experience and time) enforcing the law feel to be true that black people are up to no good.</p>

<p>Is their intuition valid or does this example not fit for some reason?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cops are a complicated example bc they are forced to make intuitive judgements on command on a daily basis. From my experience this is not how these intuitions work. </p>

<p>Furthermore cops bring their socially programmed beliefs with them to work. at the same time given the demographics of crime, being more skeptical of  most minorities makes sense analytically.</p>

<p>If anything, the post is would say that cops should work to cultivate and hone their intuitive abilities through self understanding by doing things like meditation and reflection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the night of November 20, 1619, Rene Descartes, then an aspiring philosopher still in his early twenties, had a series of three dreams which changed the course of his life and of modern thought. He reports that in his sleep, the Angel of Truth appeared to him and, in a blinding revelation like a flash of lightning, revealed a secret which would “lay the foundations of a new method of understanding and a new and marvelous science.” In the light of what the angel had told him, Descartes fervently set to work on an ambitious treatise called “Rules for the Direction of the Mind.” The objective of his “new and marvelous science” was nothing less than to describe how the mind works. For Descartes, who was to invent analytical geometry, there was no question but that the model for this task was to be found in mathematics. There would be axioms (“clear and distinct ideas” that none could doubt) and, connecting the axioms in logical progressions, a finite number of simple, utterly sensible rules that were equally self-evident. The result would be an expanding body of knowledge.</p>

<p>In February 1858 Alfred Russel Wallace was suffering from an attack of fever (probably malaria) in the village of Dodinga on the remote Indonesian island of Halmahera when suddenly the idea of natural selection as the mechanism of evolutionary change occurred to him. As soon as he had sufficient strength he wrote an detailed essay explaining his theory and sent it together with a covering letter to Charles Darwin, who he knew from correspondence was interested in the subject of evolution. He was later disgraced for becoming a spiritualist based on his experience in the jungle. We now refer to it as Darwins theory lol. </p>

<p>Just 2 of the more memorable recent additions to the wealth of human knowledge incubated via intuitive insights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intuition is completely spontaneous and encourages choices and courses of action that we wouldn&#39;t ordinarily out of habit, or have been conditioned to make. </p>

<p>Those, of course, really can&#39;t be predicted or second guessed and we can&#39;t really describe what the feeling is that prompts us to act on them beyond the fact that it seems to be necessary or a more right thing to do for reasons unknown to us. </p>

<p>Many times when we don&#39;t act on them we often wished we had because we could have avoided some equally unexpected difficulty or trouble of some kind simply doing our usual thing and often when we do simply follow it we find or run into something completely unexpected that actually turns out to be very worthwhile or a useful or important discovery of some kind.</p>

<p>Obviously the more we rely on and remain open to what our intuition tells us we&#39;re not going to be as predictable or as controllable or obedient as we have been groomed from childhood to be. </p>

<p>Not for our own benefit, of course, but to make us more manageable and compliant to the decisions of others and following their instructions. That&#39;s why it&#39;s actively discouraged. For want of a better term you could say it fosters a &quot;spirit of independence&quot; and a sense of self-confidence and enough bravery to go our own way.</p>

<p>And in today&#39;s world where just about everything that can be done is being done to gather up every little bit of information about us to predict and pigeonhole what kind of individuals we are and what we&#39;re liable to be thinking or doing that presents a very real problem to nailing us down with any degree of certainty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes! I would even take it a step further to say that as surprising as it may seem, we have access to a stream of universal knowledge has been shown to yield insights about places we have never been and people we have never met.</p>

<p>Recent declassified docs show that the US govt had a team doing remote viewing for decades and they were able to produce remarkable results. The Russians did it too.</p>

<p>The predictions they have gotten correct about things that were later confirmed true is really amazing.</p>

<p>Always enjoyed Ingo Swann and his calm laid back demeanor even though he was a remote viewing badass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you perform an experiment on axiomatic presuppositions?  With respect, you are confirming the value of empirical/inductive methods.  Cartesian rationalism is deductive.  Modern science follows from presuppositions that are not testable by experiment (as all thought necessarily does). </p>
