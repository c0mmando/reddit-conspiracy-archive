<blockquote>
<p>Archaeologists, ethnologists, and anthropologists have studied the ancient Nazca culture to try to determine the purpose of the lines and figures. One hypothesis is that the Nazca people created them to be seen by their gods in the sky. Kosok and Reiche advanced a purpose related to astronomy and cosmology: the lines were intended to act as a kind of observatory, to point to the places on the distant horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set in the solstices. Many prehistoric indigenous cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the later Mississippian culture at Cahokia in present-day United States. Another example is Stonehenge in England.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Gerald Hawkins and Anthony Aveni, experts in archaeoastronomy, concluded in 1990 that the evidence was insufficient to support such an astronomical explanation.</strong></p>

<p>Here is the conspiracy. We have been suppressed knowledge of our rightful place in this universe and where we really come from for so long. Why would these people create these massive drawings in the desert dirt for any reason other than for some <em>above</em> to look down upon them. These people knew something that we don&#39;t today (or have lost/not been told) about our origin and what is really out there in the universe. </p>

<p>(Full disclaimer, it is Ancient Aliens. This show is usually hot garbage with crazy attempts at drawing parallels, however, the Nazca Lines in my opinion are something that they present much better than anything else I have seen about it. Take it with a grain of salt, and be open-minded, and enjoy.)</p>

If I remember correctly the sand there has also been turned to glass which would support the theory that craft landed there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. I also found that quite hard to explain myself. The one that is most interesting to me is the spider. The way that thing is designed so perfectly makes me think I couldn’t do that if I traced that image. The skills and team-work it would take is hard to imagine.

    <div class="md"><p>I read about them a long time back, they are fascinating but part about the And turned to glass was shown by foot on the ground observation to be fabricated or exaggerated from maybe finding a lightning strike in one spot.  (Fuck, I know, doubt me, I can’t remember the source for that exactly, it was on a mid 90’s documentary where they investigated this stuff, it was just dirt and the original source for the claim was apparently just some random book or article with no basis).</p>

<p>But aside from that part, let me propose a few things worth also considering...</p>

<p>Is it possible that this culture had practices akin to labyrinths or Buddhist style rock gardens?  Like maybe creating lines across the ground was in itself a form of meditation or religious practice?  I mean you would clearly be able to see it from the ground, just not in its entirety...  maybe that could be a religious or philosophical purpose?  Why not allow that these peoples were capable of that kind of metaphorical thinking?</p>

<p>Next, a bit more far fetched, what if in the past some weather or geological phenomenon allowed for the images to be reflected on a cloud or dust cloud?  Is it conceivable that there was some way that these were made to take advantage of a rare thing such as that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah well that&#39;d be a shame since I always thought that was fascinating.
Of course those are possibilities and I&#39;m not sure why you think I don&#39;t believe they were capable of that since I never said they weren&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, sorry I didn’t mean you as in the definitive sense, just speaking in general that the concepts I mentioned are often never proposed for these kinds of things.  I suppose the idea of aliens and such is more intriguing than the idea that not being able to see them was a spiritual point.  Like the presumption is always if they drew these, there had to be intent for someone to see them, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah just confused since I didn&#39;t mention aliens at all and I&#39;ve always considered tthey were done from a spiritual point. Ya I mean that does seem logical but it&#39;s impossible to know obviously. Do you mean that they could see it under those conditions?

<p>Some tests performed by scientists from the University of Dresden have shown that electric conductivity was 8000 higher on the Nazca lines than next to them.</p>

<p>And this quote makes me strongly doubt the first article.  8000 what?  Sounds especially dubious when you consider the lines were made by <em>removing</em> ferrous material from the surface.  But if they mean electrical penetration, I suppose it could be <em>obvious</em> that removing such would increase this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alfred Watkins:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Broom&#39; occurs with great persistence on leys, with its variations brom and bram. Bromley and Bramley, Bromton and Bramton, Bromfield (where is the Old Field with a number of tumuli), Broomsgreen, Broomsberrow, and the many Broomy Hills are examples. It is not confined to one form of sighting point, and I surmise (from a faint line of evidence) that a component part of our modern broom was an essential working implement of the skilled ley man, and was continued as the staff of the medieval pilgrim. Whether the plant broom was the original root word or a derivative I cannot say.&quot;</p>

<p>The word &quot;broom&quot; is a cognate of &quot;bramble,&quot; a thorn bush. Or, as the Chilam Balam has, that weeds were being removed. As a household implement, the broom probably dates from the Upper Paleolithic.</p>

<p>Now you know the meaning of Leyman&#39;s Terms, or why Cleanliness is Godliness. What our ancestors were confounded to artistically imitate I&#39;ll leave in your capable hands to discern ... I&#39;ll give you a hint: The Opossum was so bright they had to carve its image on Rocks facing away - generally at high altitudes or close to the seashore for best viewing. Good luck :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re interested in this topic I recommend you to look for the &quot;Palpa lines&quot;. They&#39;re close to Nazca but there&#39;s not much information about them. Really interesting figures.</p>

<p>About the conspiracy, I believe the theory of Graham Hancock. There has been a prior advanced civilization before a global cataclysm. Some survived and carried the knowledge throughout history.</p>

<p>Now, I see a two part conspiracy.
First, the professional one. Right now there are studies, accepted theories and scientific conclusions about the history of humanity. And there are &quot;para-archaeological theories&quot; which are in collusion with the accepted ones. Problem is, there&#39;s evidence coming out to light supporting new hypotheses but mainstream archaeology won&#39;t even consider to analyze them because it would change the course of history. This means they&#39;d have to admit professional errors and accept the new theorists are right.</p>

<p>The second part is the religious/political cover-up.
I think you already know this one -maybe more than me-. There&#39;s ancient knowledge that teach us to live in harmony with each other, with nature and with ourselves. It&#39;s about exploring and finding our own consciousness. 
Why religious/political? Because when there&#39;s harmony everything is balanced, there&#39;s no a powerful 0.1% controlling the other 99.9% through politics, economy and religion. The tip of the pyramid prefers an ignorant mass because is easier to control.</p>

<p>PS: Sorry if my english is not good enough.</p>
