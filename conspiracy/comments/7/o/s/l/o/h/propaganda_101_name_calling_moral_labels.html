      <p>
       Name Calling or Substitutions of Names or Moral Labels:
      </p>
      <p>
       This technique attempts to arouse prejudices in an audience by labeling the object of the propaganda campaign as something the target audience fears, hates, loathes, or finds undesirable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Types of name calling:
      </p>
      <p>
       Direct name calling is used when the audience is sympathetic or neutral. It is a simple, straightforward attack on an opponent or opposing idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indirect name calling is used when direct name calling would antagonize the audience. It is a label for the degree of attack between direct name calling and insinuation. Sarcasm and ridicule are employed with this technique.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cartoons, illustrations, and photographs are used in name calling, often with deadly effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dangers inherent in name calling:
      </p>
      <p>
       In its extreme form, name calling may indicate that the propagandist has lost his sense of proportion or is unable to conduct a positive campaign. Before using this technique, the propagandist must weigh the benefits against the possible harmful results. It is best to avoid use of this device. The obstacles are formidable, based primarily on the human tendency to close ranks against a stranger
      </p>
      <p>
       Pinpointing the Enemy:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a form of simplification in which a complex situation is reduced to the point where the "enemy" is unequivocally identified. For example, the president of country X is forced to declare a state of emergency in order to protect the peaceful people of his country from the brutal, unprovoked aggression by the leaders of country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social Disapproval
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a technique by which the propagandist marshals group acceptance and suggests that attitudes or actions contrary to the one outlined will result in social rejection, disapproval, or outright ostracism. The latter, ostracism, is a control practice widely used within peer groups and traditional societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Virtue Words
      </p>
      <p>
       These are words in the value system of the target audience which tend to produce a positive image when attached to a person or issue. Peace, happiness, security, wise leadership, freedom, etc., are virtue words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slogans
      </p>
      <p>
       A slogan is a brief striking phrase that may include labeling and stereotyping. If ideas can be sloganized, they should be, as good slogans are self-perpetuating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimonials
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimonials are quotations, in or out of context, especially cited to support or reject a given policy, action, program, or personality. The reputation or the role (expert, respected public figure, etc.) of the individual giving the statement is exploited. The testimonial places the official sanction of a respected person or authority on a propaganda message. This is done in an effort to cause the target audience to identify itself with the authority or to accept the authority's opinions and beliefs as its own. Several types of testimonials are: Official Sanction. The testimonial authority must have given the endorsement or be clearly on record as having approved the attributed idea, concept, action, or belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four factors are involved:
      </p>
      <p>
       Accomplishment
      </p>
      <p>
       People have confidence in an authority who has demonstrated outstanding ability and proficiency in his field. This accomplishment should be related to the subject of the testimonial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Identification with the target
      </p>
      <p>
       People have greater confidence in an authority with whom they have a common bond. For example, the soldier more readily trusts an officer with whom he has undergone similar arduous experiences than a civilian authority on military subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Position of authority
      </p>
      <p>
       The official position of authority may instill confidence in the testimony; i.e., head of state, division commander, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inanimate objects
      </p>
      <p>
       Inanimate objects may be used in the testimonial device. In such cases, the propagandist seeks to transfer physical attributes of an inanimate object to the message. The Rock of Gibraltar, for example, is a type of inanimate object associated with steadfast strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal Sources of Testimonial Authority:
      </p>
      <p>
       Enemy leaders
      </p>
      <p>
       The enemy target audience will generally place great value on its high level military leaders as a source of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fellow soldiers
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of their common experiences, soldiers form a bond of comradeship. As a result, those in the armed forces are inclined to pay close attention to what other soldiers have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opposing leaders
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimonials of leaders of the opposing nation are of particular value in messages that outline war aims and objectives for administering the enemy nation after it capitulates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Famous scholars, writers, and other personalities
      </p>
      <p>
       Frequently, statements of civilians known to the target as authoritative or famous scholars, writers, scientists, commentators, etc., can be effectively used in propaganda messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonpersonal Sources of Testimonial Authority
      </p>
      <p>
       Institutions, ideologies, national flags, religious, and other nonpersonal sources are often used. The creeds, beliefs, principles, or dogmas of respected authorities or other public figures may make effective propaganda testimonials.

       Submission Statement:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the most recent post in a series I'm doing on propaganda. This information comes from Army Field Manual on "Psychological Operations" written in 1979. There are more recent copies of this manual but I have chosen to use this particular one because it significantly pre-dates our current political environment which makes the ideas within unbiased. And yet they describe the actions and behavior of our governmental leadership, news media, and intelligence agencies with alarming accuracy. Hope you check it out.

        Motives for spying
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are many suggested motives for spying that an individual may have. In general, espionage carries heavy penalties, with spies often being regarded as traitors, and so motivating factors must usually be quite large.
       </p>
       <p>
        There have been various attempts to explain why people become spies. One common theory is summed up by the acronym MICE, which stands for Money, Ideology, Compromise or Coercion (depending on source), and Ego or Extortion (depending on source). Another is the RASCLS framework: [1] Reciprocation, Authority, Scarcity, Commitment and Consistency, Liking, and Social Proof. Others have stressed the role of disaffection and grudges, or of personal links.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Beware of appeals to these ideals. They can make you push the stuff yourself, aligned to the belief you're pushing truth or fighting for a just cause.

       There's a lot of points of intersection between this and your latest topics of interest. Doesn't all directly pertain, but there's some great stuff in there. Lots of, "If they thought of this, what else might they have tried..." moments.

       Yes, most recently declassified and republished by Bob Wallace, former head of the Office of Technical Service for the CIA ( think Q from James Bond). The manual was written in part by a man named John Mulholland, a stage magician hired to teach sleight of hand, disguise, surreptitious entry, and all other manner of actions helpful for a spy-to-be.

       Good post. I’ve been directly attacked recently for simply not accepting someone’s word and suggesting that, while their position is a possibility, because they have no concrete evidence, there are other possibilities as well. This has happened on a few posts throughout the weekend. I’m not sure if these are just dense, close minded individuals or just people trolling for fun. I have a hard time making them fit in either box, which means the “gray area” position I was attacked for prevails even in making judgement of these folks. I just really hope they’re doing it for fun, because it would be a pretty angry and empty life, stomping on people simply for not aligning with their beliefs.

       Sounds like those people are using the "Assertion" technique:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Assertions are positive statements presented as fact. They imply that what is stated is self-evident and needs no further proof. Assertions may or may not be true."

       Oh man, it’s much worse than that. It’s direct attacks. This is the latest one where I’m simply stating that breaking laws perceived as unfair by some people is not the way to fight to get them changed. I don’t understand how people resort to personal attacks when I’m simply stating my opinion on a subject, not on them or their opinions on it.

       If it were simply “I don’t agree with that” type responses, I’d be 100% fine with it. They HAVE to be doing this in order to trigger folks to stop thinking rationally, as this is the only word I can use to describe their behavior: irrational.

       Welcome to the age of SJWs. I was just in another post talking about how and when this behavior started. And looking back to 2012(or14?) when propaganda was legalized we started seeing this “personality type” crop up. It seems to me this is largely used by the left side of the aisle voters. So, it’s possible this was used as a tool to simultaneously silence opposition and be the loudest voice in the room.

       Cult of personality is a much earlier concept. Thanks for your reply. Would our mind linking me the post and specific comment where you think this discussion started? Thanks.

       Let me see if I can find the post. It wasn’t necessarily about this topic of propaganda, it was the SJW behaviors. I questioned the origin of this new way of treating people in such a hostile manner, it hasn’t always been this way. I happened upon this post right after that post, so they seemed to fit the subject, ya know? Maybe I’m seeing something that’s not necessarily there, but this SJW has baffled me for some time. Is it just lack of social appropriateness, a degrading social norm or something that has been pushed from the creators of propaganda?
