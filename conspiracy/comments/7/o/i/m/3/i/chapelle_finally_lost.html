It was literally like watching cnn. </p>

<p>And for the shills: I am, regardless of what will happen to the world with Trump by the button, sooooo fucking glad he won. Not because he won, but because Clinton lost. </p>

He also only talks about trump the last twenty or so minutes of the first special if memory serves. It&#39;s a recurring theme in the media, he has to address it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dunno man, if you really are on team trump I think you&#39;ve got entirely the wrong end of the stick on this one. Yea chapelle doesn&#39;t like trump - he&#39;s a conscious black muslim, of course he doesn&#39;t like trump. That&#39;s what makes it so strange when he says things like &#39;trump might be the mistake that saves us all&#39; and &#39;trump is exciting the way the first black president should&#39;ve been exciting&#39;. If you&#39;re looking to redpill the normies or whatever, surely that&#39;s what you should be running with?</p>

<p>If you really are on team trump, that is. Other explanations - 1) it&#39;s team nevertrump trying to get ahead of the story, hype up the animosity in the hope that nobody notices it&#39;s a bit more complex than that; 2) netflix native advertising, for shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re way off on this. He&#39;s stating a very fair opinion. He&#39;s allowed to hate how Trump is governing.

He is criticizing hyperbole, the &quot;Trump is Hitler&quot; attitude of the left, and the policies and decisions of Trump. It&#39;s intelligent and fair. And I&#39;m a regular TD poster. </p>

I still think he does himself a karmic disfavor saying Bombama did a good job and that hrc was the lesser evil. But on the other hand I guess he wants his family to live.</p>
