        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>... tell them to get their heads out of their butts.</p>

<p>I am noticing a RECENT trend in the posts and comments here where they try very very hard to discredit anything to do with devil worshipping, satanism, pedogate, pizzagate, pedophilia, Tony and John Podesta, Church of Satan, Chelsea Clinton directly tweeting back to the Church of Satan, Chelsea wearing upside down crosses, James Alefantis and Comet Pizza, James Alefantis being a Rothchild, DC pedo ring, the Pope and the Vatican sex ring, human trafficking and children trafficking for sex etc ....</p>

<p>They are trying hard, you can see it yourselves, and the reason for this RECENT trend is because Trump became in charge, they have lost power, the military arm of their organisation, and it is only a matter of time before all of this comes out publicly. </p>

<p>So is this all conjecture? Ok, let&#39;s look at my argument. <strong>My argument is that the world is run by satanic worshipping elites (which is why all the shilling and trolling), be them world leaders or business leaders, and they are into the pagan worshipping, and they have completely taken over the governments and large corporations.</strong> </p>

<p>There is so much evidence that my argument is true, with Macron, <a href="http://thetruthrevolution.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/top-10-UFO-SIGHTINGS-43-752x440.png">giving his victory speech against the backdrop of a pyramid when he won the French presidency</a>, to <a href="https://mysteryoftheinquity.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/illuminati-666-a-ok-sign-all-seeing-eye-symbol-satanic-number-of-the-antichrist-beast.jpg">many leaders and stars giving hand symbols and all eyeing symbols</a>, how about <a href="https://jewishpaedophilia.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/adolfhitlerangelamerkelallseeingeye.jpg">Merkel ALWAYS doing the pyramid hand gesture?</a> I mean they just don&#39;t do these gestures for no reason. But let&#39;s simplify. Why not use critical thinking and let&#39;s go and look at the opening ceremony of the Gotthard Tunnel, the longest tunnel in the world, which opened on the 1st of June 2016.</p>

<p>This tunnel is the longest in the world so it is very important, and at a cost of 10 billion USD ... YET, and pay attention here, <strong>the opening ceremony was Satanic in nature, AND attended by a lot of power leaders.</strong> At the Gotthard Train Tunnel’s northern portal in Erstfeld, Switzerland, hundreds of dignitaries including Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Switzerland’s President Johann Schneider-Ammann, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and France’s President Francois Hollande attended the Illuminati-esq ceremony.</p>

<p>Satanistic I hear you scoff? Don&#39;t take my word for it. Here is a BBC article, for normies:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-36428799">http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-36428799</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And much more other people have spoken about the ceremony being paganistic in nature: </p>

<p>Charisma magazine opined: <em>“The opening ceremony of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland featured a ‘goat-man’ that dies, is resurrected, is worshipped and is crowned as ‘the king of the world.’ “The goat-man that played such a key role in this performance bore a striking resemblance to Baphomet, which in recent decades has become one of the key symbols used to represent Satan in the occult community. So could it be possible that this entire ceremony was actually an Illuminati ritual that was intended to honor Satan? Don’t pass judgment until you see the videos.”</em></p>

<p>Here is the full video by RT:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW5gklIKcDg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW5gklIKcDg</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Ed&#39;s The Outer Dark excellent explanation</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxg2qlONb-A&amp;amp;t=5s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxg2qlONb-A&amp;amp;t=5s</a></li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4xhOMv6dLk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4xhOMv6dLk</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So with all that said, the chances of the Eiltes being satanists are very high because why would anyone attend something blatantly and obviously satantic ... <strong>AND NOT PUBLICLY DENOUNCE THE SATANISM THEY SAW. Yes, that is right, it is so OBVIOUS yet none of the powerful world leaders SAID ANYTHING. Thee most influential thinkers of our day, SAID NOTHING!</strong> I&#39;ve already showed you the videos and articles. There is no doubt satanists exist. So is there a link to the elites?</p>

<p>Next question you need to ask, if the rich and powerful are satanists, into paganism, is it really stretch that they are into children sexually, in human sacrifice? <strong>Since Satanism is a religion</strong>, and it mostly spiritual and ritualistic, is it really a stretch that Royalty and The Vatican and the Pope are into this pedophilia and sacrificing babies? </p>

<p>Here are some more food for thought: </p>

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: Now, the question is is Satanism into human sacrifice of today? General knowledge of old paganism suggests it did exist <a href="https://youtu.be/RzYzvvIqPPc">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdwZOioHDz0">2</a></p>

<p>But <strong>does human sacrifice exist today?</strong> It seems so. <a href="http://theisticsatanism.com/asp/hs.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/human-sacrifices-still-taking-place-5999139">2</a> although it is not openly done because of laws, obviously.</p>

<p>I would say in many cultures across the world do sacrifice <a href="https://www.boldsky.com/yoga-spirituality/faith-mysticism/2013/religions-that-practice-animal-sacrifice-033784.html">animals</a>.</p>

<p>Again though, does it really stretch the truth if I said elites substitute animals for human beings to be sacrificed? Why wouldn&#39;t they? They are morally and ethically upright human beings and because they are rich and educated, they can&#39;t be corrupted, right? I have heard on many occasions they think it gives them more &quot;spiritual&quot; power by sacrificing a human instead of an animal. With all that in context, let&#39;s check out The Bohemian Grove:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Bohemian Grove is a 2,700-acre (1,100 ha) campground located at 20601 Bohemian Avenue, in Monte Rio, California, belonging to a private San Francisco-based gentlemen&#39;s club known as the Bohemian Club. In mid-July each year, Bohemian Grove hosts a more than two-week encampment of some of the most prominent men in the world.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>look === <em>...encampment of some of the most prominent men in the world...</em></p>

<p>All innocent, right? Well look here, a  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZTs0kTWp_A">sneakily taped video</a> shows them burning a <strong>LIFE SIZED HUMAN EFFIGY</strong> to the statue said to be Moloch</p>

<p>The question you have to ask is why? Why a HUMAN effigy, not animal or something else?</p>

<p>I think I am going to end it with this cracker. <a href="http://prntscr.com/hwto2f">Hillary Clinton email mentions Moloch!</a> </p>

<p>What?!  He can&#39;t even coherently link things together.  One moment he&#39;s accusing people of being Satanists (who don&#39;t actually worhsip a deity...), then Pagans, then onto Pyramids.

    <div class="md"><p>only if you&#39;re assuming that satanists are somehow embarrassed about being satanists, which doesn&#39;t go to together with the claim that they&#39;re openly shoving it in our faces  </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t the best way to detract attention from yourself to keep a <em>low</em> profile and not arrange shows that got the whole worlds attention?  </p>

<p>The world elite are not &quot;satanist&quot;, they&#39;re globalists - which means appropriating and making a profit on anything can get their greedy  hands on - even satanism, but it isn&#39;t your grandprants good ol&#39; satanism of olden times, just like anything else touched up by the globalist agenda, it got cheapened, synthesized and degraded so it can be spread to a larger market.</p>

<p>And i still don&#39;t get what the difference is between &quot;rubbing it in our faces&quot; and &quot;hiding in plain sight&quot; - if they are rubbing it in our faces they aren&#39;t exactly hiding and if hiding in plain sight <em>is</em> rubbing it in our faces, what is hidden about it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of their belief system is that they have to get your consent for them to do their evil. They believe they <em>have</em> to do evil, like they are the evil side of human duality. That reality is all a big &quot;game&quot; and their job is to be the bad guy, but they&#39;re not really <em>bad</em>. So the hidden imagery, and other hints they put out is us accepting our fate as cattle and willingly subjecting ourselves to their satanic new world order.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about a &quot;harvest&quot; where if the human consciousness as a whole is negative, we stay in our current reality.Which they want to do because of the power they have amassed here. Allegedly if we are more positive than negative emotions we ascend to a higher existence or frequency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry you aren&#39;t going to convince anyone with scripture. It&#39;s all very Spawn-like and is a compelling narrative but statistically there hasn&#39;t been one human religion that hasn&#39;t turned to mythology with enough time. Not to say the archetypes don&#39;t outlive their religion and traditions don&#39;t carry through to future generations. They all prove to be non-accurate, Christianity with it&#39;s God/Satan duality was a great tool for explaining things 2000 years ago. Doesn&#39;t work so well today, but Christianity is a relatively new religion as compared to the Norse or Roman. We don&#39;t pray to Odin or Zeus anymore. Both are equally alive in our lexicon, Christian duality has understandably a bigger presence. </p>

<p>As for Gang Stalking, well, it&#39;s simple. It&#39;s a human behavior so devious you can&#39;t relate to it. So it must be &quot;Satanic&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;. </p>

<p>The second part is true, it is evil in a very real sense, just not supernatural. </p>

<p>In my experiance non-religious persons aren&#39;t more bad than religious persons. I certainly try to be a good person and not to hurt other people just because of my personal moral code, not because of some kind of fear of consequence. </p>

<p>Maybe if I grew up with worse people surrounding me it would be different, but I think it&#39;s extremely dismissive of many people, both religious and non religious, to claim &quot;saying there is no god absolves from wrong doing&quot; and &quot;people that don&#39;t believe in a god just want to be bad&quot;. </p>

<p>Actually, believing in the christian god absolves you from certain wrong doing. So you could claim that people are just being Christian so they can be bad.</p>

<p>You sure? I&#39;ve often wondered what percentage of our moral behaviors is related to the pleasure of knowing that we are helping; love for others; the rebellion against &quot;badness&quot;; and the fear of social consequence. I know that they all play a big role, and I know that each person would have each in different measure, but I wonder sometimes: what is the key motivating factor in human morality, overall? What part plays the biggest role? </p>

<p>Maybe when I said</p>

<p>I was talking too broadly, but I didn&#39;t want to be reductive of Christian people&#39;s faith in general. I was just annoyed at the writer&#39;s reductiveness of non-religious people&#39;s morals as I heard similar arguments before.</p>

<p>&quot;If a god potentially punishing you for being bad is the only thing holding you back&quot; was basically what the guy said, didn&#39;t he? But it&#39;s obviously not all or most Christians that think that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im saying that the either something came from nothing, or God was &quot;always there&quot;, is simplistic.  The Big Bang theory was formed by inference as to what we see around us.  Why couldnt God have created the Big Bang to make this particular part of existence?  People who question the Big Bang with the opposing theory that God made us dont realize these do not have to be opposing theories at all.  Just more deviseness.  For instance I assumed you were Christian by your attacks on speculative thinking, just as you assume I am atheist for whatever your reasons are.  The answer is you dont know and I dont know, but asking who created God is just as valid a question as the question, who created the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with it. Pyramids are sacred. Those silly people use pyramid imagery because they believe it is a symbol for the occult and power. In reality, it is a symbol of energy. The ancients used pyramids to create energy or tap into energy. These &#39;satanists&#39; are just using Sumerian rituals and thinking this will give them power. But it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s just a waste of flesh. Then they also use Jesuit traditions to ensure as much wealth accumulation as possible. They kill (not naming anyone in particular now) to satisfy their own inability to deal with the restrictions created by society and then try to explain it away as saying, &quot;it&#39;s part of tradition&quot;.</p>

<p>You have to admire the dedication though.

<p>We love to use satanic or occult imagery, but not to praise it. It&#39;s about creating fear of those. They represent the evil and we are just not afraid of using that imagery to direct people away from the evil. </p>

<p>For example once a year the Krampus comes to town in order to chase kids around with wooden sticks. He will beat you if he catches you and will also grab you and put you in a cart in order to kidnap you.</p>

<p>Bad kids in order parts of the Christian world get coal. We get bruises and PTSD. Like seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the problem with Christian thought.  If someone were to read the Bible cover to cover, with no preconceived bias, they would read God ordering people to kill, in order to make a plan for the Salvation of mankind.  This makes no sense because the people who were slaughtered apparently are not a part in that Salvation.  To a Christian everything can be justified, because their is an us versus them mentality.  Saved and damned, goat and sheep, etc.  It&#39;s divisive and not compassionate.  This is why Christians don&#39;t seem to understand why non-Christians are so skeptical.  They can&#39;t see their own faults because it&#39;s already figured out in their minds.  No room for debate or questions..  Demonizing other people for traditions is the epitome of evil.</p>

Nobility involves acting in a way that is altruistic and compassionate. These people are not noble. Poor Diana, if it&#39;s true, I truly am saddened she was killed.

    <div class="md"><p>There are multiple forms of Satanism. I will describe them in simple points, if there are questions just ask.</p>

<p>Theistic Satanism:  </p>

<p>A spiritual religion who believes ain Lucifer as an entity the same way God and Jesus are entities in Christianity. Lucifer is considered the bringer of light but every individual is allowed to have their own gnosis.</p>

<p>LaVeyan Stanism better known as The Church of Satan:  </p>

<p>An atheistic philosophy that focuses on egocentism and high individualism. There is esotericism and ritualism in this &quot;religion&quot; and its also 
very materialistic (things as body and soul and afterlife do not exist for example).</p>

<p>Political Satanism also know as The Satanic Temple : </p>

<p>More political activists than religious or esotheric. Often show hypocrisy in religion and law. The baphomet statue next to the statue of the 10 commandmends is a well known political action they did.</p>

<p>Then there are a few Western Esotheric &quot;religions&quot; that are often thrown in with Satanism:</p>

<p>Thelema :  &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law&quot;.  Comparable with LaVeyan but more into ritualism and magik. Its a weird mic of Egyptian demonology and Numberology/Kabalah</p>

<p>American Neopaganism. Worship gosd from Gaia (Mother Earth) to Fay and Fairies. Main rule is to not be an interference in someone leses live (a different look on egoism)  A lot of influentual Neo-Pagans come from or still are LaVeyan or Thelemites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not from Switzerland, but I&#39;m still from the Alps and it&#39;s only like a 3 hour drive for me to get to that tunnel.</p>

<p>One thing you&#39;ve got to understand is that a lot of the traditions in the alps are pagan traditions or highly influenced by them.</p>

<p>For example once a year the <a href="https://youtu.be/tA35OeJslWg">Krampus</a> comes to town in order to chase and beat kids with wooden rods and to kidnap them and put them in a cart. It&#39;s like Fight Club mixed with the Purge mixed with satanic imagery for a night. Some of them are tamer and are just for <a href="https://youtu.be/8lZBJHiML3c">show</a> though.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the <a href="https://youtu.be/K1xiN-61y6s">Fasnacht</a> which is yet another weird festival that happens every fourth year.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of other traditions (like the <a href="https://youtu.be/snAK24ulVQY">Palmlatten</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/vkmj9LGL7bM">Witch Burnings</a> or the <a href="https://youtu.be/S8pcdY_zNCU">Singeslerlauf</a>) and each town has it&#39;s own variants.</p>

<p>These might all look very weird for outsiders because there&#39;s a lot of satanic, occult and witchcraft imagery, but it&#39;s not like we are praising those. The people here tend to be as devote Christian as the most Bible thumping Southerners in the US (I&#39;ve never been to the US, just basing this on stereotypes).</p>

<p>The message isn&#39;t &quot;Satan and witches are cool&quot; it&#39;s &quot;behave or the Krampus and the witches will get you&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Kingdom of the Lamb</strong></p>

<p>The teacher had in his hand a small parchment from which he began to read.  “I looked and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb’…In the midst of the throne stood a Lamb.  This is the vision given to Yochanan, John, in the book of Revelation.  Do you see anything strange about it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Everything,” I said.  The four living creatures, the elders, the lamb…”</p>

<p>“How about a Lamb on a throne?”</p>

<p>“Why is that stranger than the rest?”</p>

<p>“Think about it, a lamb, the most defenseless of creatures, so weak it must be protected not only by its mother but by a shepherd…That&#39;s what&#39;s so strange about the vision.  The Lamb is on the throne.  The Lamb is king.  The Lamb reigns over all.  A lion would make sense, but not a lamb…the most powerless of creatures reigning on the throne with all power and over all.</p>

<p>“It&#39;s a symbol of Him?  Correct?  Messiah, the Lamb of God.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the teacher.  “And he will reign over God&#39;s kingdom.  So the kingdom of God will be the kingdom of the Lamb.  How radical is that… a Lamb upon a throne?  It goes against the way of the animal kingdom and that of man&#39;s kingdoms.  But the kingdom of God doesn&#39;t work according to the laws of this world, but by its own.  And to prosper in God you must learn the secrets of that kingdom.  In the world, it is the strong and fierce who rule.  But in the kingdom of God, it is the Lamb that rules.  So in the kingdom of the Lamb, the weak are strong, and the strong are weak.  In this kingdom, if you would have, you must let go.  If you would receive, you must give.  If you lower yourself, you will be lifted up.  If you become little, you will become great.  If you lose yourself, you will find yourself.  If you surrender, you will prevail.  And if you die to yourself, you will find life”</p>

<p>“As He died and found life,” I said “and as He surrendered all and has prevailed over all and overcome the world.”</p>

<p>“And if you walk in the footsteps of the Lamb, you too will prevail and overcome the world.  For we are of the most radical of kingdoms…the kingdom of the Lamb.</p>

<p><em>The Mission:</em> Live this day in the way of the Lamb.  Let go that you might have.  Die that you might live.  And surrender that you might overcome.</p>

<p>Matthew 5:30-45; 20:25-28; 2 Corinthians 6:3-10; 12:9-10; Revelation 5:6-14</p>

<p>The Book of Mysteries</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.  <strong>And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.  I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”</strong>  Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do I think human sacrifice still occurs? The more I read about it, the more I think that yes it does... and I&#39;m sure the rich elite are into plenty of weird, kinky shit, tho not convinced its quite as much of Hollywood/gov&#39;t as people claim, tho some are def suspect.... like that lady tied to Hillary who was caught trying to smuggle kids out of Haiti, could be a pedo thing but also something even more sinister. </p>

<p>To give a bit of perspective here tho, animal sacrifice isn&#39;t all that odd. Plenty of religions do it, like the orthodox jews, muslims, and prob Christians all sacrifice a goat/lamb during certain holidays of the year. Also, if we had to butcher our own animals to eat them then most families would be sacrificing something each month for food. </p>

<p>And regarding the burning of a human effigy, I grew up hindu and we have a festival each year in the Fall called Dushera where they burn a giant human effigy who represents Ravana the demon king, dude has like 10 heads and arms. They usually put on a play that explains why during the festival. Its based on a famous story Ramayana, where Ram (Vishnu reincarnation) has to track down Ravana who stole Ram&#39;s wife Sita. Ram gets help from this monkey warrior named Hanuman (kinda like Chinese SonGoku). After 10 days he finally saves her and kills ravana, as well as burning his palace to ashes, which is why they burn his body. </p>

<p>Its supposed to be a good vs evil depiction. Its done here in the states as well. I&#39;m sure if a non-hindu saw it they would find it weird as hell but fairly normal if you grew up with it. I have seen the video of the CERN performance, and they certainly make it convincing that its occult/satanic stuff.... but it could just be a reenactment play. </p>

<p>On a side note, I have seen the term &quot;occult&quot; thrown out a lot esp regarding the esoteric symbolism and stuff and I disagree with a lot of it. Much of the symbols and philosophy is &quot;collective unconscious&quot; stuff that everyone uses.... try designing your own symbol for a made up company, then try to pick it apart and I guarantee you can twist it to find some occult reference. Pyramids, triangles, crosses.... that stuff isn&#39;t evil, the symbols may have some power to them but the intent and use is what makes em &quot;good or evil&quot;. </p>

<p>I do think the various parallels with religions are interesting, there was a video about how there may be some greater purpose to it all that we just don&#39;t understand. Like that Ramayana story I just mentioned has a bit about 10 days of darkness followed by light (when sita finally gets saved) with oil used to last thru it, and the jews have something about oil to last thru dark times. Hindus dont&#39; sacrifice animals, but the abramic religions do and usually around the same fall/winter times... even non religious people indirectly by consuming lots of meat during holiday season or thanksgiving. I have even heard theories that the wars in the middle east are deliberate cause all those deaths transfer life energy to the earth, keeping it moving or something lol... bit out there but interesting. </p>

<p>Anyways, not downplaying the stuff bout Satanism or pedos, just be careful bout assuming everything has evil/occult ties. As more stuff is leaked it seems like some of it is true and people are having a hard time accepting it or thinking its even possible. And I do believe there is illuminati influence, with strange stuff like how all the most southern most countries closest to Antarctica all have freemason ties (argentina, south Africa, Australia).... even most of the northernmost countries too, like US Canada japan and the Nordic countries (not sure about Russia) seem tied up in it too. Seems like they protecting the edges.... I still wanna know wtf is goin on in Antarctica. </p>

<p>But the thing is, satanism/catholicism are just regular mythologies. Incredibly, people still believe in things like that, which is a powerful way of blackmailing someone. If the majority of people fear some invisible demon, they&#39;d be shocked and hunt down the ones who they believe ar worshiping them. Imagine if they discover their <em>politicians</em> are worshiping shit like this? Fucking riots would happen.</p>

<p>So, just like this pedophilia is used as blackmail. The parties in Comet Ping Pong are exactly for that, to generate the bribery (footage probably).</p>

<p>2+2=4 anywhere in the universe. I wouldn&#39;t be surprise if you didn&#39;t know that.</p>

<p>No, they&#39;re only breaking <em>our</em> understanding of the laws and theories (which are the same thing, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you think the big bang &quot;is just a theory&quot;). </p>

<p>Light does it.. (?). I don&#39;t see where you&#39;re trying to get with this pseudo questions.</p>

<p>Really? Do you think math is &quot;formulas&quot;? If I were you I&#39;d definitely read The God Delusion, by Dawkins, tho I doubt your little ego would be able to actually read it and not feel offended by a stupid belief in Zeus, Brahma, Yahweh or whatever god you believe in.</p>

they have infiltrated every aspect of our lives...they run everything now! the government, ceos of most corporations, hwood, msm, military, big pharma, food industry...etc etc etc

    <div class="md"><p>This will be downvoted.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t normal.  Don&#39;t let the responses in this thread make you feel like you&#39;re crazy for thinking so.  If this were some fringe group of people, or some &quot;avant garde&quot; performance (as someone describes it below) it would be &quot;Weird&quot;, and perhaps stop at that.</p>

<p>This is an hour long, and I imagine very expensive &quot;performance piece&quot;.  Lots of time, money and coordination/organizational resources were put into this.  This event is commemorating a one-of-a-kind engineering project.  This is a huge deal politically, economically, and historically.  Multiple heads of state are pictured and I imagine many other foreign dignitaries are present.</p>

<p>That this ceremony with these symbols, images and tone would be permitted, let alone paid so much attention to speaks volumes.  What does a wedding ceremony look like?  How about a funeral ceremony?  What does Carnaval / Mardi Gras look like?  Notice how the images and symbols associated with those events are relevant to the events themselves?  What sort of event(s) would be associated with these symbols, and more specifically the way in which they are being (very expensively) demonstrated to us?</p>

<p>Do Alpine folk parades involve slapping chains on sheet metal in a dark atmosphere with malevolent laughter in the background?  What about half nude women flying as cherubs, with disturbing, distorted “child  faces”?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the holder of some grand secret.  I don&#39;t have the answer.  I don’t know what this is exactly.  What I can tell you however is that I get extremely negative vibes from this and yet the people trying to rationalize/explain this are not involved necessarily in shilling or some conspiracy.  That said, this is <em>not</em> normal, and you are <em>Not</em> crazy for seeing this for what it is.  Great pains were taken to make this event what it was - the sights, the sounds, the colors, the atmosphere, the constant goat head imagery.  The movements people are making, the overall feelings/emotions that it’s meant to impart.  All of this is intentional.</p>
