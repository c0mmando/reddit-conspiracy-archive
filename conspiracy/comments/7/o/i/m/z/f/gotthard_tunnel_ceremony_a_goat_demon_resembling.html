       ... tell them to get their heads out of their butts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am noticing a RECENT trend in the posts and comments here where they try very very hard to discredit anything to do with devil worshipping, satanism, pedogate, pizzagate, pedophilia, Tony and John Podesta, Church of Satan, Chelsea Clinton directly tweeting back to the Church of Satan, Chelsea wearing upside down crosses, James Alefantis and Comet Pizza, James Alefantis being a Rothchild, DC pedo ring, the Pope and the Vatican sex ring, human trafficking and children trafficking for sex etc ....
      </p>
      <p>
       They are trying hard, you can see it yourselves, and the reason for this RECENT trend is because Trump became in charge, they have lost power, the military arm of their organisation, and it is only a matter of time before all of this comes out publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is this all conjecture? Ok, let's look at my argument.
       <strong>
        My argument is that the world is run by satanic worshipping elites (which is why all the shilling and trolling), be them world leaders or business leaders, and they are into the pagan worshipping, and they have completely taken over the governments and large corporations.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much evidence that my argument is true, with Macron,
       <a href="http://thetruthrevolution.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/top-10-UFO-SIGHTINGS-43-752x440.png">

       </a>
       , to
       <a href="https://mysteryoftheinquity.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/illuminati-666-a-ok-sign-all-seeing-eye-symbol-satanic-number-of-the-antichrist-beast.jpg">
        many leaders and stars giving hand symbols and all eyeing symbols
       </a>
       , how about
       <a href="https://jewishpaedophilia.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/adolfhitlerangelamerkelallseeingeye.jpg">
        Merkel ALWAYS doing the pyramid hand gesture?
       </a>
       I mean they just don't do these gestures for no reason. But let's simplify. Why not use critical thinking and let's go and look at the opening ceremony of the Gotthard Tunnel, the longest tunnel in the world, which opened on the 1st of June 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       This tunnel is the longest in the world so it is very important, and at a cost of 10 billion USD ... YET, and pay attention here,
       <strong>
        the opening ceremony was Satanic in nature, AND attended by a lot of power leaders.
       </strong>
       At the Gotthard Train Tunnel’s northern portal in Erstfeld, Switzerland, hundreds of dignitaries including Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Switzerland’s President Johann Schneider-Ammann, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and France’s President Francois Hollande attended the Illuminati-esq ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satanistic I hear you scoff? Don't take my word for it. Here is a BBC article, for normies:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-36428799">
         http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-36428799
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And much more other people have spoken about the ceremony being paganistic in nature:
      </p>
      <p>
       Charisma magazine opined:
       <em>
        “The opening ceremony of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland featured a ‘goat-man’ that dies, is resurrected, is worshipped and is crowned as ‘the king of the world.’ “The goat-man that played such a key role in this performance bore a striking resemblance to Baphomet, which in recent decades has become one of the key symbols used to represent Satan in the occult community. So could it be possible that this entire ceremony was actually an Illuminati ritual that was intended to honor Satan? Don’t pass judgment until you see the videos.”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the full video by RT:
      </p>
      <ul>

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Another critical analysis

         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4xhOMv6dLk
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So with all that said, the chances of the Eiltes being satanists are very high because why would anyone attend something blatantly and obviously satantic ...
       <strong>
        AND NOT PUBLICLY DENOUNCE THE SATANISM THEY SAW. Yes, that is right, it is so OBVIOUS yet none of the powerful world leaders SAID ANYTHING. Thee most influential thinkers of our day, SAID NOTHING!
       </strong>
       I've already showed you the videos and articles. There is no doubt satanists exist. So is there a link to the elites?
      </p>
      <p>
       Next question you need to ask, if the rich and powerful are satanists, into paganism, is it really stretch that they are into children sexually, in human sacrifice?
       <strong>
        Since Satanism is a religion
       </strong>
       , and it mostly spiritual and ritualistic, is it really a stretch that Royalty and The Vatican and the Pope are into this pedophilia and sacrificing babies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some more food for thought:

        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       EDIT: Now, the question is is Satanism into human sacrifice of today? General knowledge of old paganism suggests it did exist
       <a href="https://youtu.be/RzYzvvIqPPc">
        1
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdwZOioHDz0">
        2
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But
       <strong>
        does human sacrifice exist today?
       </strong>
       It seems so.
       <a href="http://theisticsatanism.com/asp/hs.html">
        1
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/human-sacrifices-still-taking-place-5999139">
        2
       </a>
       although it is not openly done because of laws, obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say in many cultures across the world do sacrifice
       <a href="https://www.boldsky.com/yoga-spirituality/faith-mysticism/2013/religions-that-practice-animal-sacrifice-033784.html">
        animals
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Again though, does it really stretch the truth if I said elites substitute animals for human beings to be sacrificed? Why wouldn't they? They are morally and ethically upright human beings and because they are rich and educated, they can't be corrupted, right? I have heard on many occasions they think it gives them more "spiritual" power by sacrificing a human instead of an animal. With all that in context, let's check out The Bohemian Grove:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         Bohemian Grove is a 2,700-acre (1,100 ha) campground located at 20601 Bohemian Avenue, in Monte Rio, California, belonging to a private San Francisco-based gentlemen's club known as the Bohemian Club. In mid-July each year, Bohemian Grove hosts a more than two-week encampment of some of the most prominent men in the world.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       look ===
       <em>
        ...encampment of some of the most prominent men in the world...
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       All innocent, right? Well look here, a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZTs0kTWp_A">
        sneakily taped video
       </a>
       shows them burning a
       <strong>
        LIFE SIZED HUMAN EFFIGY

       to the statue said to be Moloch
      </p>
      <p>
       The question you have to ask is why? Why a HUMAN effigy, not animal or something else?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I am going to end it with this cracker.

       What?!  He can't even coherently link things together.  One moment he's accusing people of being Satanists (who don't actually worhsip a deity...), then Pagans, then onto Pyramids.  These concepts are worlds apart.  Don't even get me started on the use of the 'okay' sign.

       Biggest problem is that most people see no difference between satanism and occult practices. Modern satanism is basically just a spoof on abrahamic religions, whereas occultism is where actual dark and harmful shit happens. Doesn't exactly help the matter that some people who claim to be satanists perpetuate the issue.

       The world elite are not "satanist", they're globalists - which means appropriating and making a profit on anything can get their greedy  hands on - even satanism, but it isn't your grandprants good ol' satanism of olden times, just like anything else touched up by the globalist agenda, it got cheapened, synthesized and degraded so it can be spread to a larger market.

       ? Why are they misinforming the public? If they are really satanists why not just come out and say it, its 2018 nobodys gonna fire up the stake and torch the evildoers anymore, the church of satan is on social media etc. so why is all the secrecy and misinfo necesary?

       because GWB and BLiar and Cameron and May and Merckle and Hollande all are hypocrites, all good churching going Christians when the public and MSM are watching, they do this shite when the MSM is told to not watch.

       But why wouldn't they just fess up, if they weren't really christian? They could just aswell not be church going christians - it doesn't matter anymore in this day and age, satanism isn't really shocking too many people outside the vatican or the bible belt

       Part of their belief system is that they have to get your consent for them to do their evil. They believe they
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to do evil, like they are the evil side of human duality. That reality is all a big "game" and their job is to be the bad guy, but they're not really
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       . So the hidden imagery, and other hints they put out is us accepting our fate as cattle and willingly subjecting ourselves to their satanic new world order.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all about a "harvest" where if the human consciousness as a whole is negative, we stay in our current reality.Which they want to do because of the power they have amassed here. Allegedly if we are more positive than negative emotions we ascend to a higher existence or frequency.

       I mean, isn't that the point? They were the ones that made it "sound" like a cartoon. You were brought up thinking that by watching the cartoons and TV they published. They could have made you think
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       sounded like a "cartoon" if they wanted, since they are in control of what you can watch and read in the mainstream. They made it sound ridiculous to current humans so they could operate in peace.

       I think most people in power and master manipulators are narcissistic. Therefore most I bet are not religious at all. They are greedy and selfish and want money and power for selfish reasons. Not for some cult or religion.

       Real Satanists, as is Satanism, is based on lies though. I'm not a Christian but I've met plenty. They always try to slyly push it on me and tell me how it's just about self determinism and no "hokus pokus bullshit" - and then when you're like "okay let me give it a try" - suddenly it's incantations and all this hokus pokus bullshit.

       Surface level? A bunch of contrarian dweebs who put edginess on a pedestal and then still manage to do it wrong.

      <p>
       Devotary level? A bunch of sick ass sociopath/psychopath types who don't feel empathy and need a cosmology that makes their predations seem necessary. There also exist a faction of those who simply hate society, and looking for a vehicle for that hatred, choose Christianity, and after deciding that they are anti-social, will turn to Satanism as a way to affront others and state their animosity with one swoop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clergy level? A few exceptionally sick fellows who honestly hate the world so passionately that they actively seek out ways to do it harm and, knowing full-well that what they do is called "evil", do so pridefully, donning the mantle of the servant as do their counterparts, but serving all the things that said counterparts attempt to combat; a reactionary thing, in essence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thought leader level? Jews. lol you think I'm kidding, but there are so many quotes out there of prominent Jews saying in one form or another that Lucifer is their God.

       Sorry you aren't going to convince anyone with scripture. It's all very Spawn-like and is a compelling narrative but statistically there hasn't been one human religion that hasn't turned to mythology with enough time. Not to say the archetypes don't outlive their religion and traditions don't carry through to future generations. They all prove to be non-accurate, Christianity with it's God/Satan duality was a great tool for explaining things 2000 years ago. Doesn't work so well today, but Christianity is a relatively new religion as compared to the Norse or Roman. We don't pray to Odin or Zeus anymore. Both are equally alive in our lexicon, Christian duality has understandably a bigger presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Gang Stalking, well, it's simple. It's a human behavior so devious you can't relate to it. So it must be "Satanic" or "evil".
      </p>
      <p>
       The second part is true, it is evil in a very real sense, just not supernatural.

       Im telling you it is supernatural. Some of those people are dead or fully enslaved in mind body and spirit. Men can do that?

      <p>
       Ever heard of the djinn or daemons. They aren't just figments of the imagination. I just used the lds instead of explaining myself. There are light and darkbentities at work in this world. What is dark witch and what is a white witch? Where do familiars come from? What is blocula/blacula? Who do they communicate with? The unseen world.
      </p>

       If I could ever find "Wonders of the Invisible World" by Cotton Mather Is quote some of that too... But its in possible to find in an original version. Why do you think that is?

       And i guess prescience humans made the thing that made the so called big bang too thus creating the whole universe on their own?  How can you be so ignorant to think the universe just is and was and nothing created it?  I would imagine only a god could creat something from nothing.

       I mean in the popular mythology, since that seems to be what you're talking about, then there would be consequences, metaphysical and physical, from places and of beings which we can't know, but the way you're presenting it is like saying that people only do what's right because there are police. I say that, and I'm not even a Christian. I just take stands against bad thinking when I see it.

       In my experiance non-religious persons aren't more bad than religious persons. I certainly try to be a good person and not to hurt other people just because of my personal moral code, not because of some kind of fear of consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if I grew up with worse people surrounding me it would be different, but I think it's extremely dismissive of many people, both religious and non religious, to claim "saying there is no god absolves from wrong doing" and "people that don't believe in a god just want to be bad".
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, believing in the christian god absolves you from certain wrong doing. So you could claim that people are just being Christian so they can be bad.

       You sure? I've often wondered what percentage of our moral behaviors is related to the pleasure of knowing that we are helping; love for others; the rebellion against "badness"; and the fear of social consequence. I know that they all play a big role, and I know that each person would have each in different measure, but I wonder sometimes: what is the key motivating factor in human morality, overall? What part plays the biggest role?

       Nah we disagreed. You were like "If a god potentially punishing you for being bad is the only thing holding you back", etc, and I thought that that was a super excessive reduction of what all goes into a Christian person's faith, so then we started arguing, and you mistook me for that other bro, you lost track, and now we're here lol

       I was talking too broadly, but I didn't want to be reductive of Christian people's faith in general. I was just annoyed at the writer's reductiveness of non-religious people's morals as I heard similar arguments before.

       "If a god potentially punishing you for being bad is the only thing holding you back" was basically what the guy said, didn't he? But it's obviously not all or most Christians that think that way.

       What is your definition of "a god"?  If so what was there before this God?  Questions of existence, because we are self-aware, aren't as simple as, something higher made us, because then you have to ask what made this something higher.  At the end of the day it is just as simplistic to say something was always there, than to say, a big bang made our particular universe.

       Im saying that the either something came from nothing, or God was "always there", is simplistic.  The Big Bang theory was formed by inference as to what we see around us.  Why couldnt God have created the Big Bang to make this particular part of existence?  People who question the Big Bang with the opposing theory that God made us dont realize these do not have to be opposing theories at all.  Just more deviseness.  For instance I assumed you were Christian by your attacks on speculative thinking, just as you assume I am atheist for whatever your reasons are.  The answer is you dont know and I dont know, but asking who created God is just as valid a question as the question, who created the universe.

       This has always confused me about those that push the narrative of intelligent design.

       Isn't it more intelligent to create the system that creates and perpetuates itself. Instead of one that magically resembles the Bible.

       Wait... What? You're trying to critique my argument by inserting your concerns retroactively? I wasn't addressing your valuation statement at the beginning. So I couldn't have just started with that.

       My point is the idea of "Satan" or some other "Dark Lord" is compelling fiction, but hardly worth anyone's time. Especially spending billions to dig a tunnel.

       It has nothing to do with it. Pyramids are sacred. Those silly people use pyramid imagery because they believe it is a symbol for the occult and power. In reality, it is a symbol of energy. The ancients used pyramids to create energy or tap into energy. These 'satanists' are just using Sumerian rituals and thinking this will give them power. But it doesn't. It's just a waste of flesh. Then they also use Jesuit traditions to ensure as much wealth accumulation as possible. They kill (not naming anyone in particular now) to satisfy their own inability to deal with the restrictions created by society and then try to explain it away as saying, "it's part of tradition".
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you noticed, repressed societies come up with the sickest 'traditions'? I wonder why.

        8 months before they started filming it

       You have to admire the dedication though. They started planning this cover up a naked man climbing out of a window

       I'm from the Alps and made a comment in this thread that explains some of it from the perspective of a local person and with plenty of videos of other alpine festivals and traditions.

       We love to use satanic or occult imagery, but not to praise it. It's about creating fear of those. They represent the evil and we are just not afraid of using that imagery to direct people away from the evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example once a year the Krampus comes to town in order to chase kids around with wooden sticks. He will beat you if he catches you and will also grab you and put you in a cart in order to kidnap you.
      </p>

       Bad kids in order parts of the Christian world get coal. We get bruises and PTSD. Like seriously.

       This is the problem with Christian thought.  If someone were to read the Bible cover to cover, with no preconceived bias, they would read God ordering people to kill, in order to make a plan for the Salvation of mankind.  This makes no sense because the people who were slaughtered apparently are not a part in that Salvation.  To a Christian everything can be justified, because their is an us versus them mentality.  Saved and damned, goat and sheep, etc.  It's divisive and not compassionate.  This is why Christians don't seem to understand why non-Christians are so skeptical.  They can't see their own faults because it's already figured out in their minds.  No room for debate or questions..  Demonizing other people for traditions is the epitome of evil.

       I dont hate Christians or anyone.  You stated that using allegory to tell a story proved someone was quote, fucked in the head.  I apologize for assuming you were a Christian and therefore challenging christian thought.  By your statement i thought the shoe fit.  Evil people are rich, poor, middle class, super intelligent, unintelligent.  Its our decisions that prove our worth, not our belief systems.

       So sad and creepy what happens with the British 'elite'. Why even call these people elite? They are not there because of their skills and nobility. They are there because their parents exist in a system that rewards birthright rather than actual hard work and talent. Nobility is not birthright. Nobility involves acting in a way that is altruistic and compassionate. These people are not noble. Poor Diana, if it's true, I truly am saddened she was killed. Parents take care of your kids, these people are becoming desperate.

       The world leaders who were there were: Angela Merkel of Germany, Matteo Renzi of Italy, and Francios Hollande of France. Maybe it would comfort you to get the facts straight before leaping to such detached conclusions that lead you to tying in the death of princess Di, which is completely unrelated. Renzi, Hollande, and Merkel are elected leaders not monarchs, they do not rule by birthright. You seem to be projecting a bunch of fears not based in reality, and not even loosely based on the facts of what this post is talking about.

       Okay first of all, I was referring to one of the links the op posted not just the tunnel opening ceremony. Second, the post wasn't just about the tunnel opening, it was talking about Jimmy Saville, the Vatican pedophilia controversy and so forth. And third, maybe you should read the post in its entirely before saying anything and making assumptions.

       The opening paragraph of this post talks about Hollande and Merkel, as their presence relates to the Gottard Tunnel opening. Please tell me how that relates to Jimmy Saville (a British guy) who died in 2011, five years before this ceremony. Be specific, I'm not interested in all-encompassing conspiracy theories.

       Which is it? Get your facts straight before accusing someone. I don't agree with her policies, but I won't even enter a conversation about it if you won't take the time to figure out why you hate her. That's just lazy, baseless hatred.

       Goddamit. I know about the ceremony and you had me going for a sec until you started with the same old narrative that Clintons are bad and Trump is our savior. Why does everything have to be about fucking politics. Just keep that shit to yourself, no one cares you hate the Clintons or that you love Trump. Do you see how that taints your whole post?

       Yeah, I enjoyed the read but had to fact-check that one. I suppose you could claim the PR excuse came out later as a cover.

       Bad link aside, I still wouldn't be surprised if a certain set of elites were into ritual magic. The old-money types come from a very alien tradition compared to most of us. Their world does not look quite like our world, so who knows what really goes on? You won't find them chatting here.

       There are multiple forms of Satanism. I will describe them in simple points, if there are questions just ask.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theistic Satanism:
      </p>
      <p>
       A spiritual religion who believes ain Lucifer as an entity the same way God and Jesus are entities in Christianity. Lucifer is considered the bringer of light but every individual is allowed to have their own gnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       LaVeyan Stanism better known as The Church of Satan:
      </p>
      <p>
       An atheistic philosophy that focuses on egocentism and high individualism. There is esotericism and ritualism in this "religion" and its also 
very materialistic (things as body and soul and afterlife do not exist for example).
      </p>
      <p>
       Political Satanism also know as The Satanic Temple :
      </p>
      <p>
       More political activists than religious or esotheric. Often show hypocrisy in religion and law. The baphomet statue next to the statue of the 10 commandmends is a well known political action they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are a few Western Esotheric "religions" that are often thrown in with Satanism:
      </p>
      <p>
       Thelema :  "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law".  Comparable with LaVeyan but more into ritualism and magik. Its a weird mic of Egyptian demonology and Numberology/Kabalah
      </p>
      <p>
       American Neopaganism. Worship gosd from Gaia (Mother Earth) to Fay and Fairies. Main rule is to not be an interference in someone leses live (a different look on egoism)  A lot of influentual Neo-Pagans come from or still are LaVeyan or Thelemites.

       Its a problem around here right now that we can't get our definitions straight with this satanic shit. Look up Crowley, if you haven't, its pretty interesting, especially with who he's connected to.

       No, it's a web of crime and blackmail that allows the rich and powerful to trust one another because each knows the other is guilty of atrocities too.

       It is literally opposite of God, everything good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan is responsible literally for every thing evil and all the pain in this world...he is literally known as the deciever. His legion, came to Do what? Kill, steal and destroy..
      </p>
      <p>
       So a religion revolved around that is good how?

       You are absolutely correct. True satanism is the worship of an enlightened being - lucifer is the light bringer to humanity. Its just been bastardised by the church. And the vatican is the real evil here

       I'm not from Switzerland, but I'm still from the Alps and it's only like a 3 hour drive for me to get to that tunnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing you've got to understand is that a lot of the traditions in the alps are pagan traditions or highly influenced by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example once a year the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/tA35OeJslWg">
        Krampus
       </a>
       comes to town in order to chase and beat kids with wooden rods and to kidnap them and put them in a cart. It's like Fight Club mixed with the Purge mixed with satanic imagery for a night. Some of them are tamer and are just for
       <a href="https://youtu.be/8lZBJHiML3c">
        show
       </a>
       though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/K1xiN-61y6s">
        Fasnacht
       </a>
       which is yet another weird festival that happens every fourth year.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of other traditions (like the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/snAK24ulVQY">
        Palmlatten
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://youtu.be/vkmj9LGL7bM">
        Witch Burnings
       </a>
       or the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/S8pcdY_zNCU">
        Singeslerlauf
       </a>
       ) and each town has it's own variants.
      </p>
      <p>
       These might all look very weird for outsiders because there's a lot of satanic, occult and witchcraft imagery, but it's not like we are praising those. The people here tend to be as devote Christian as the most Bible thumping Southerners in the US (I've never been to the US, just basing this on stereotypes).
      </p>
      <p>
       The message isn't "Satan and witches are cool" it's "behave or the Krampus and the witches will get you"

       To the people that don't believe elites do things like worship Satan, because it "doesn't make sense", what makes sense about Hillary Clinton's spirit cooking parties emails?  " Oh, she was joking." So, that's how normal people joke? Do you joke like that?  What about her buddy's artwork depicting little boys in compromising situations? Do you feel that's a normal, healthy appreciation for art?

       <strong>
        Kingdom of the Lamb
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The teacher had in his hand a small parchment from which he began to read.  “I looked and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb’…In the midst of the throne stood a Lamb.  This is the vision given to Yochanan, John, in the book of Revelation.  Do you see anything strange about it?” he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Everything,” I said.  The four living creatures, the elders, the lamb…”
      </p>
      <p>
       “How about a Lamb on a throne?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Why is that stranger than the rest?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Think about it, a lamb, the most defenseless of creatures, so weak it must be protected not only by its mother but by a shepherd…That's what's so strange about the vision.  The Lamb is on the throne.  The Lamb is king.  The Lamb reigns over all.  A lion would make sense, but not a lamb…the most powerless of creatures reigning on the throne with all power and over all.
      </p>
      <p>
       “It's a symbol of Him?  Correct?  Messiah, the Lamb of God.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Yes,” said the teacher.  “And he will reign over God's kingdom.  So the kingdom of God will be the kingdom of the Lamb.  How radical is that… a Lamb upon a throne?  It goes against the way of the animal kingdom and that of man's kingdoms.  But the kingdom of God doesn't work according to the laws of this world, but by its own.  And to prosper in God you must learn the secrets of that kingdom.  In the world, it is the strong and fierce who rule.  But in the kingdom of God, it is the Lamb that rules.  So in the kingdom of the Lamb, the weak are strong, and the strong are weak.  In this kingdom, if you would have, you must let go.  If you would receive, you must give.  If you lower yourself, you will be lifted up.  If you become little, you will become great.  If you lose yourself, you will find yourself.  If you surrender, you will prevail.  And if you die to yourself, you will find life”
      </p>
      <p>
       “As He died and found life,” I said “and as He surrendered all and has prevailed over all and overcome the world.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “And if you walk in the footsteps of the Lamb, you too will prevail and overcome the world.  For we are of the most radical of kingdoms…the kingdom of the Lamb.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The Mission:
       </em>
       Live this day in the way of the Lamb.  Let go that you might have.  Die that you might live.  And surrender that you might overcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matthew 5:30-45; 20:25-28; 2 Corinthians 6:3-10; 12:9-10; Revelation 5:6-14
      </p>
      <p>
       The Book of Mysteries
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.
       <strong>
        And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.  I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”
       </strong>
       Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.

       If you're freaked out by avant-garde theatre enough to pen this level of freakout, you're the normie. Speaking as a pagan and an occultist, yes it's a huge stretch to assume that prominent pagans sacrifice children.

       He is attacking practices in which he deeply believes against.  It's about being proactive and taking a stand against the trash being pushed on our youth who are susceptible to this nonsense.  If you want to live like a hethan, worshiping wooden statues while telling others the devil is a great guy thats fine.  Just dont expect everyone to be your friend.

       The original poster is attacking something of which he has ZERO understanding. You're doing the same thing. Really, you're just demonstrating your own ignorance on the subject and then criticizing your own ignorant ideas. Pagans don't worship wooden statues. From a totally confused perspective, you judge and condemn other humans, yet you haven't taken the time or the effort to understand what you're talking about. When you google Heathen, make sure you spell it right. It's not
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       difficult to educate yourself. But you're...

       and Divisive.

      <p>
       Take a look at yourself in the mirror. There's that Devil you're so afraid of. I'm sure deep down you're really a great guy.

       I was making a mockery of your "paganism" because you are mocking others religions.  The only ignorant person is you.  I know exactly what is going on because my eyes are wide open.  I will always condemn evil and anything that eludes to evil.  Get the fuck out of here with that shit.  Go suck satans cock somewhere else.

       Your eyes may be open, but your mind isn't. You also seem to be more obsessed with evil than any Pagan I've ever met. Something dark is lurking inside your heart. Love is the Law.

       Believes define in-group, out-group behaviour. In essence what happens here is a certain self defined elite openly separates themselves from the plebs. Wolves and Sheep. Morlock and Eloy.

       Baphomet and the people who follow the LHP are all idiots chasing their purest inhibitions free of any guilt and empathy. They are trapped in the 3rd density, holding a metaphorical gun to humanity's head. The light is winning, and those 'kick-ass' demons are scared shitless.

       Nope, there are many Scientific theories pointing to multiple dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is loads of evidence pointing towards a huge occult influence in nearly every corner of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're the one calling demons 'kick-ass', not only succeeding on their existence but praising them when they are inherently evil. Would take a cult like environment to get someone to praise evil, wouldn't it?

       Do I think human sacrifice still occurs? The more I read about it, the more I think that yes it does... and I'm sure the rich elite are into plenty of weird, kinky shit, tho not convinced its quite as much of Hollywood/gov't as people claim, tho some are def suspect.... like that lady tied to Hillary who was caught trying to smuggle kids out of Haiti, could be a pedo thing but also something even more sinister.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give a bit of perspective here tho, animal sacrifice isn't all that odd. Plenty of religions do it, like the orthodox jews, muslims, and prob Christians all sacrifice a goat/lamb during certain holidays of the year. Also, if we had to butcher our own animals to eat them then most families would be sacrificing something each month for food.
      </p>
      <p>
       And regarding the burning of a human effigy, I grew up hindu and we have a festival each year in the Fall called Dushera where they burn a giant human effigy who represents Ravana the demon king, dude has like 10 heads and arms. They usually put on a play that explains why during the festival. Its based on a famous story Ramayana, where Ram (Vishnu reincarnation) has to track down Ravana who stole Ram's wife Sita. Ram gets help from this monkey warrior named Hanuman (kinda like Chinese SonGoku). After 10 days he finally saves her and kills ravana, as well as burning his palace to ashes, which is why they burn his body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its supposed to be a good vs evil depiction. Its done here in the states as well. I'm sure if a non-hindu saw it they would find it weird as hell but fairly normal if you grew up with it. I have seen the video of the CERN performance, and they certainly make it convincing that its occult/satanic stuff.... but it could just be a reenactment play.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, I have seen the term "occult" thrown out a lot esp regarding the esoteric symbolism and stuff and I disagree with a lot of it. Much of the symbols and philosophy is "collective unconscious" stuff that everyone uses.... try designing your own symbol for a made up company, then try to pick it apart and I guarantee you can twist it to find some occult reference. Pyramids, triangles, crosses.... that stuff isn't evil, the symbols may have some power to them but the intent and use is what makes em "good or evil".
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think the various parallels with religions are interesting, there was a video about how there may be some greater purpose to it all that we just don't understand. Like that Ramayana story I just mentioned has a bit about 10 days of darkness followed by light (when sita finally gets saved) with oil used to last thru it, and the jews have something about oil to last thru dark times. Hindus dont' sacrifice animals, but the abramic religions do and usually around the same fall/winter times... even non religious people indirectly by consuming lots of meat during holiday season or thanksgiving. I have even heard theories that the wars in the middle east are deliberate cause all those deaths transfer life energy to the earth, keeping it moving or something lol... bit out there but interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, not downplaying the stuff bout Satanism or pedos, just be careful bout assuming everything has evil/occult ties. As more stuff is leaked it seems like some of it is true and people are having a hard time accepting it or thinking its even possible. And I do believe there is illuminati influence, with strange stuff like how all the most southern most countries closest to Antarctica all have freemason ties (argentina, south Africa, Australia).... even most of the northernmost countries too, like US Canada japan and the Nordic countries (not sure about Russia) seem tied up in it too. Seems like they protecting the edges.... I still wanna know wtf is goin on in Antarctica.

       It's particularly sad when poor people want to tell themselves that all the rich people are evil, devil worshippers, and the only reason they are poor is because they're righteous and good. That may be the greatest form of self-delusion and self-masterbation  ever conceived.

       I agree with most of the post, the only problem is quoting yournewswire as source.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the thing is, satanism/catholicism are just regular mythologies. Incredibly, people still believe in things like that, which is a powerful way of blackmailing someone. If the majority of people fear some invisible demon, they'd be shocked and hunt down the ones who they believe ar worshiping them. Imagine if they discover their
       <em>
        politicians
       </em>
       are worshiping shit like this? Fucking riots would happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, just like this pedophilia is used as blackmail. The parties in Comet Ping Pong are exactly for that, to generate the bribery (footage probably).

       Said the guy desperate for a belief. Can't face your own ignorance, but eventually you'll move on. Just like people have moved on on believing the earth is flat and the center of the universe, and that a mythological god created everything in 7 days. Next step is simple: no god at all.

      <p>
       If it was a big golf ball where would it be 'baffed' to? Ever seen the dos equips commercial where the most 'interesting' man goes to space with a golf club in hand? Now they have a new one if you notice. People are leaving to space under the flag of baff o meta. Not MAphomet. Mommy is the real scary one.

       So is this all conjecture? Ok, let's look at my argument. My argument is that the world is run by satanic worshipping elites (which is why all the shilling and trolling), be them world leaders or business leaders, and they are into the pagan worshipping, and they have completely taken over the governments and large corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       now you are getting somewhere!!!!
they have infiltrated every aspect of our lives...they run everything now! the government, ceos of most corporations, hwood, msm, military, big pharma, food industry...etc etc etc
keep digging! the truth is out  there for anyone that looks hard enough

       This will be downvoted.

       This isn't normal.  Don't let the responses in this thread make you feel like you're crazy for thinking so.  If this were some fringe group of people, or some "avant garde" performance (as someone describes it below) it would be "Weird", and perhaps stop at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an hour long, and I imagine very expensive "performance piece".  Lots of time, money and coordination/organizational resources were put into this.  This event is commemorating a one-of-a-kind engineering project.  This is a huge deal politically, economically, and historically.  Multiple heads of state are pictured and I imagine many other foreign dignitaries are present.
      </p>
      <p>
       That this ceremony with these symbols, images and tone would be permitted, let alone paid so much attention to speaks volumes.  What does a wedding ceremony look like?  How about a funeral ceremony?  What does Carnaval / Mardi Gras look like?  Notice how the images and symbols associated with those events are relevant to the events themselves?  What sort of event(s) would be associated with these symbols, and more specifically the way in which they are being (very expensively) demonstrated to us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do Alpine folk parades involve slapping chains on sheet metal in a dark atmosphere with malevolent laughter in the background?  What about half nude women flying as cherubs, with disturbing, distorted “child  faces”?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not the holder of some grand secret.  I don't have the answer.  I don’t know what this is exactly.  What I can tell you however is that I get extremely negative vibes from this and yet the people trying to rationalize/explain this are not involved necessarily in shilling or some conspiracy.  That said, this is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       normal, and you are
       <em>
        Not
       </em>
       crazy for seeing this for what it is.  Great pains were taken to make this event what it was - the sights, the sounds, the colors, the atmosphere, the constant goat head imagery.  The movements people are making, the overall feelings/emotions that it’s meant to impart.  All of this is intentional.

       Well said. The performance was very esoteric, and some things cannot just be written off as local customs, like the eye, the upside down tree of life, and the Baphomet of all things.

       Can anyone explain who baphomet really is? He has a head/brain removal like Ganesh's elephant head. He has a caduceus for a penis (light and dark agency or blue and red for the moon/djinn), he might have breasts. His fingers pointing up represent Saturn uranus and Neptune (Sun) and down is Mercury Venus and Earth. Sun is light and up/scattered and Mve is down and the dark gathered. He has a pentacle on his forehead (light/brain/"third eye") and no sign of a pentagram anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read many things like he is Augustus  Caesar or a headless Jesus cut off by Paul of Tarsus (foot clan) and that ties in with red and blue (will of the wisp/will the Smith/jackolanterns) headless Horseman... All kinds of stuff.
      </p>

       Who or what is baphomet for real? Representation of technology?

       <p>
        I am noticing a RECENT trend in the posts and comments here where they try very very hard to discredit anything to do with devil worshipping, satanism, pedogate, pizzagate, pedophilia, Tony and John Podesta, Church of Satan, Chelsea Clinton directly tweeting back to the Church of Satan, Chelsea wearing upside down crosses, James Alefantis and Comet Pizza, James Alefantis being a Rothchild, DC pedo ring, the Pope and the Vatican sex ring, human trafficking and children trafficking for sex etc ....
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For example, "Chelsea Clinton tweeting to the Church of Satan" when you look at what actually happened means nothing. She was asked if freedom of religion included the Church of Satan and she answered, truthfully, that it does.

       I mean in the popular mythology, since that seems to be what you're talking about, then there would be consequences, metaphysical and physical, from places and of beings which we can't know, but the way you're presenting it is like saying that people only do what's right because there are police. I say that, and I'm not even a Christian. I just take stands against bad thinking when I see it.

       Well said. The performance was very esoteric, and some things cannot just be written off as local customs, like the eye, the upside down tree of life, and the Baphomet of all things.
