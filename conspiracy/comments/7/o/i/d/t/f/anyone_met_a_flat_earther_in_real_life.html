       Starting to think this whole movement is fake, setup with the aim of discrediting the overall conspiracy theory community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there are spokespeople with videos and such, but has anybody actually shared a meal with a flat earther or had a flat earther colleague?

       its like there there was a chunk of them that was straight wrong and was actually the main problem that people were talking about, then there was another chunk that was just really weird but didnt seem to try to push the agenda that what elsagate was about. another chunk was seriously just parents what it seemed almost like forcing them to do these abnormal vids that were boarder lined fucked up but pointless at the same time. also a chunk of videos that were for people who had a really dark sense of humor

       Yeah I thought most folks here believe something fishy went down on 9/11. I certainly do. Maybe not some of the more fringe worthy theories floating around, but there's def more to the official story than we've been told. Super sketch.

       My dad, who is a bootlicker to the core, had an interesting conversation with me a weekish ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, like I've been doing for years and years, sent him some type of documentary or something about 911 seeing an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been pointing out that there wasn't the proper engines for the plane that hit the pentagon and that the impact doesn't look like a plane more like a cruise missile and to top it off they won't release that frame that shows the impact
      </p>
      <p>
       He says bullshit
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he turned around and said oh but there is something weird going on in Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I almost flipped my shit but caught myself and realized this is the chink in his bootlicking armor I've needed for years.

       Well that’s because you just haven’t looked into it yet. Watch 911 The New Pearl Harbor. Its 5 hours long and all on youtube. It’ll change your life. Would love to chat after to see what you thought.

       Out of curiosity, do you care to lay out where you draw the lines of bullshit in the topics stated?
      </p>
      <p>
       Undoubtedly, there is much bullshit being thrown around relating to all theories (disinformation), but most of that is deliberately planted so people choose to draw a line they don't wanna cross, in my view. Have you ever considered that to be a possibility?

       I don't ever remember being told that "myth" in an educational setting; I was in elementary school in the 90's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its more of a Mandela Effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what I was taught was CC was trying to find a quicker route to the Far East and just proposed it could be quicker sailing West and not East.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the "myth" everyone was "taught" was just our young minds' seeing a flat map on the classroom wall and his linear path on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just like how we are taught CC "Found" NA, when it has been widely accepted that the Vikings found it first. They just had no ongoing historical impact or spark surrounding the event, so its just easier to say it was CC because that's when things started heating up rather than getting into little details that an 8 year old doesn't need to be concerned with yet.

       Its a painting, a poetic license on something that was known not to be true, they weren't used as an educational graphic portraying reality during that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the "fall off the edge" was just a carry over from the lack of understanding of Newtonian physics, which
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       new during that time, and the hyperbole the paintings depict.
      </p>
      <p>
       The common man knew the world was round. What perhaps they didn't understand was how you would stay glued to the "bottom" part of the globe.  So a commoner might think, "Hmmm were gonna sail over the curvy part... are we just gonna, 'fall off' at some point?
      </p>
      <p>
       The abrupt "edge" depicted in most of the paintings is a way for the artist to illustrate that notion in the confined space of his canvas.

       if that was the case, how did "flat earth" ever become a thing, in the years after CC?
      </p>
      <p>
       and why were Columbus and Magellan featured so prominently in our education?
      </p>
      <p>
       those two men, among others, were used to help craft a narrative about flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       in particular, how CC and FM were the visionary geniuses who knew the earth was round, in an era when the common man believed something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       same story with Galileo. GG was a visionary in an era of Artistotle's dogma.

       i think my education, in particular, and this lesson, in particular, were crafted as a way to deceive me, not as a way to educate me
      </p>
      <p>
       i think that those responsible for creating the curriculum for my education must have at some point, after they educated me, decided that teaching this particular lie was not worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       i suspect that they noticed that in spite of trying to introduce "flat earth" to young, impressionable minds, they were still introducing the idea to curious, inquisitive minds who might look into it further.

       He's right though. All my life growing up I was never taught that the Golf of Tonkin incident was a false flag, for instance. There are MANY MORE examples of this in the American education system. I wouldn't blame the teachers, though. They teach us what they themselves were taught and believe in their hearts that they are RIGHT. So in there eyes, it makes no sense to try and fact check an educational textbook. Especially if it appears that all of the info contained within is information they themselves have learned.

       Besides, history takes a MAJOR backseat to "the curriculum" which is whatever is going to be on state mandated tests. So math, science, reading comp, and writing.

       Never taught in either direction is different than being taught a lie. Especially with something of more recent history like the GoT.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked my high school history teacher why all the text books seemed to lack in-depth chapters after the 1950's, basically just listing earmarked events, but not giving much detail, despite the books being pretty new.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer he gave was pretty insightful.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said that for something to get into a non-biased history book and to be written at length, it needs to have happened AT LEAST 1 generation ago, i.e. all the people up to the ones born during the event have died. Preferable 2 generations later and 3 is better.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way when it is written about in detail, the authors or researchers have more perspective on on the event, and the outcomes it had and thus would be less likely to bias writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The essays and articles that are being published now, on say the GoT are what will eventually be their primary sources, with the added perspective of being a few generations away from the people alive during the event, and the people that start publishing the real truth about the event.

       That sir, is a fair fuckin' statement. You got a good head on your shoulders there; I still don't like being taught the lie, but at least I still have access to the truth as well.

       the real reason they want a few generations to pass is so that you can't ask your grandparents what really happened and have one of them accidentally debunk the textbook, which would likely start a rumor at school, and create a crisis of confidence

       They only discovered brass could kill the giants when they discovered a chained up giant in Jerusalem and all the chains were brass.

       I’ve glossed by that giants in Afghanistan story but never looked closely. Pretty sure there’s a subreddit dedicated to just the discovery of giants. Homoerectus? Anyway, doesn’t sound nearly as crazy to me as flat earth. Especially being that many ancient texts and art describe there being giants on earth.

       Yeah it’s one of those theories that’s pretty hard to prove. Is it possible the military found them and got rid of the evidence? Yes. Is it possible someone made it all up? Also yes. That guy that someone else linked that’s researching the mounds might be the best bet to reveal evidence to the mainstream.

       Damn well looks like a cyclops skeleton, doesn’t it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s just a fossilized dwarf elephant. But it is another example of a similar claim about giant cyclopses being real.

       That was it? Your bullet proof evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single one of those bones that were pictured in his video were recreations of bones who's measurements were taking 50+ years ago, with no trace of the real bones. They were most likely misidentified or was a tabloid article. Just because something was in the paper 50 years ago doesn't mean it was legit. Back then tabloids and legit papers were often one in the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, most of the more believable claims seemed to average around 7-9 feet tall, which doe occur within our species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discovering ancient bones from the last 10,000 years, statistically you are going to come across people who suffered from giantism, that doesn't mean there was an ancient race of giants.

       In his other videos he says that his father said a knife jab could not penetrate its skin, only a sawing motion with a knifes teeth could over time, and the veins couldn't even be cut with wire cutters, yet was taken down by a single shot?

       Hey man, whatever floats your boat. This is also super fake looking, and some of it is pulled from old Hollywood footage.

       Also, now the giants are "aliens" and fulfilling a biblical prophecy which has been taken out of context, let alone look nothing like the head from your first video.

       The sumo footage is from a 2007 mockumentary called "Big Man in Japan".

       The film takes the form of a mockumentary that follows Masaru Daisato. Daisato is an otherwise normal Japanese citizen except for an inherited ability to grow to a height of approximately 30 meters in response to the application of high voltage electricity.

       Lmaao I get that you've been conditioned to turn away from youtube. But you do realize it's a resource for photos and videos too right?

       I met one at a grocery store the other day. I was wearing my NASA shirt and he asked if I liked NASA. I said not really, to which he said, "oh well I am a flat Earther" and I said "Me too" and I used my NASA shirt for its intended purpose of pointing out the red snakes tongue and big fat hebrew word that means TO DECIEVE. We then had a chat about Pete Conrad dumping his enema bag on people before going to the moon.

       Yeah, it sure looks like a snake's tongue when you draw a fucking snake onto it. It's a v shape. That's literally the only thing it has in common with the snake's tongue.

       Its a nicely curved v shape that tapers just like a snakes tongue. Snakes and their tongues are a symbol for lies. Couple that with NASA being a hebrew word that means DECEIVE and you got a nice little truth in plain sight. NASA lies and Earth is not a globe.

       Incorrect on all accounts my good man. Firstly, NASA when spoken aloud acronym or not means to lift, lend with interest, and decieve or beguile. That's fact. Honestly its a joke. Its naming a government agency "Municipal Active Veracity Enforcement Team" and then realizing the acronym, when spoken aloud is, MAVET or hebrew for death.

       It would be stupid to call an agency "Municipal Active Veracity Enforcement Team" because that doesn't mean anything. On the other hand, it makes perfect sense to call a national administration that oversees aeronautical and space research the national aeronautics and space administration. It wasn't even originally called that either. It was the "National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics" (NACA) until 1958.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even after all this, it doesn't mean anything. The fact that is similar to the Hebrew word for deception means literally nothing. It's called a coincidence, and there are a lot of them. You can "prove" anything if you go off stupid coincidences and wordplay. If you want to actually debunk something that they have done, feel free. Unfortunately, you won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it would be very strange for some shadowy Jewish organization to use a former Nazi who used Jewish slave labor to design their rockets.

       Another picture,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmkbAql5_jU">
        but it starts to become apparent at around 40,000ft.

       I was on a flight a while ago that briefly went that high and I can definitely confirm that there is an apparent curve.

        It's apparent at sea level if you have a really good zoom on your camera.

       Bullocks. The Concorse airlines flew at 60,000 ft and never saw any curvature. You have your proof, sir. The fact that this question ALWAYS is answered differently by every person shows how fake and false the globe really is.

       there is a very apparent curve. It was definitely harder to see it because the Concorde's windows were about the size of your palm, but it was there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is answered different by everyone because different people are answering it. If you just google the question, 35,000 - 40,000 ft is the typical answer and it is the correct one based off my observation. Obviously different people with better or worse eyesight are going to see it at slightly different altitudes, but it quite clearly becomes apparent at around that altitude.

       4. No. The answer is no. You don't need to continuously provide thrust to a baseball to make it fly after you hit it. The baseball starts with X amount of vertical kinetic energy, and as it moves towards the peak of its trajectory that kinetic energy converts into potential energy. I think you learn this in high school.
       <br/>
       5.  No. There is (basically) no air resistance. There isn't anything slowing you down. You don't need to continuously burn fuel to stay in orbit. Once again, high school.
       <br/>
       7. It's effecting it in the exact same way. Gravity does not magically disappear when you reach orbit. There is still plenty of gravity. The only difference is that the orbiting object has enough

       </a>
       . Objects in orbit are continuously falling.
       <br/>
       9. No. Once you get enough speed, you will just keep going. There would have to be some magical external force that's slowing you down for you to continuously need to burn fuel.
       <br/>
       11. No, because the spacecraft it is carrying is significantly smaller at that point, and because kinetic energy is proportional to mass you would need FAR less than 1/6th the fuel.
       <br/>
       12. Yes, it sure does. Wtf kind of a question is that?

       21. Another loaded question. The vehicle simply obtains enough velocity that it will simply continuing going away from the earth forever. Once gain, I'm pretty sure you learn the escape velocity equation in high school.

       if you were able to follow directions, you would have noticed that the flag is not merely photographed from different sides, but that the folds of the flag, and the shadows the folds, make it obvious that it is merely an "image flip" photo manipulation technique that probably seemed high-tech in the 1960's but is child's play in 2018

       yes. what you learn in high school is that the baseball comes back to earth. when you finally get into calculus 1, you can actually regurgitate the mathematics of the curve of a thrown baseball for a grade

      <p>
       so, according to your high school level of understanding, none of the other processes going on during the trip would require energy? things like communications, life-support, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       the reason 5 is included is to mock the idea of the so-called "sling shot effect", where a rocket would magically acquire energy
      </p>
      <p>
       this so-called "sling shot effect" would be akin to creating a pendulum that would swing higher than its initial starting point. this is not possible according to our understandings, yet features prominently in science fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       so if we really analyze 5, we see that orbiting the Earth a few times would cost the rocket far more energy than it would ever gain back.

      <p>
       the rocket is not merely "in orbit", or maintaining its elevation.
      </p>
      <p>
       the rocket is heading toward the moon, increasing its elevation, and thereby increasing its gravitational potential energy, relative to earth, for the entire time.
      </p>
      <p>
       which as you know, would require energy from some other source (fuel) to be converted into this increased gravitational potential energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       you should've learned about the conservation of energy in high school

       "magical external force"; the Earth's gravity will slow you down anywhere between the Earth and the moon, regardless of how fast you are going.

       "escape velocity" and "sling shot effect" and "rocket equation" are all concepts borrowed from the realm of science fiction.

       you should have learned how gravity obeys the inverse square law in high school

      <p>
       basically, the lay people tend to believe that gravity goes to 0 very quickly between earth and moon
      </p>
      <p>
       but the inverse square law informs us that gravity is plenty strong all the way to the moon and beyond, and that it never really goes to 0.
      </p>
      <p>
       so that means your "uphill" journey to the moon will be "uphill" all the way. you will never travel in a plane where the slope of the effect of gravity is 0, anywhere between earth and moon

      <p>
       it can be argued that the mass of the moon is only 1/100th that of Earth
      </p>
      <p>
       however on the other hand, you would still have to account for the fuel consumption required to control the decent. otherwise the lander would crash into the moon at max speed
      </p>
      <p>
       also noteworthy is the fact that you can't actually find any credible video of the lunar lander launch and/or docking with an orbiter.
      </p>
      <p>
       then, the lunar orbiter would have to have enough fuel to go back "uphill" toward the LaGrange Point
      </p>
      <p>
       if this was basketball, they would have us believe that they made 100% of their free throws, without ever taking a practice shot.

       do you think it would be a remarkable feat of STEM to launch a lander off the moon, and have it intercept an orbiter?
      </p>
      <p>
       you claim that the relative speeds would be zero, but that is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       the lunar lander is on the surface of the moon, not moving at all, relative to the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       and the lunar orbiter is in orbit, moving relative to the surface of the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       supposedly the lander would have to launch from speed 0 and dock at speed 3600 MPH
      </p>
      <p>
       its not a loaded question. its a real story problem that you would have to solve if you had actually gone to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       "idiotic" would be to send men to the moon and not have thought very hard about how to get them back

       "escape velocity" is the myth that if a rocket attains a speed of 25,000 MPH, then magically Earth's gravity will quit affecting the rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       since lay people tend to have trouble grasping large numbers
      </p>
      <p>
       (example: the L curve
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woIkIph5xcU">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woIkIph5xcU
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       ill break it down into smaller numbers, much like those presented in the original.
      </p>
      <p>
       lets say a car is planned to travel at 25 MHP uphill for 200 miles
      </p>
      <p>
       if you killed the engine once the car reached 25 MPH, would you expect the car to travel an additional 200 miles? or even an additional 20 miles? or even an additional 2 miles?
      </p>
      <p>
       of course not. you would expect the car to coast to a stop very quickly. if you have ever run out of gas, you will learn that you won't get far on "sail boat fuel"
      </p>
      <p>
       you will of course argue about the rolling friction of the tires, the air drag etc
      </p>
      <p>
       but the biggest force at play will be gravity. and in our example, the car would actually be going "uphill" at 90 degrees, which is what you see a rocket do during launch (90 degrees to gravity)
      </p>
      <p>
       "escape velocity" is science fiction. you have never experienced it. nobody you will ever meet has ever experienced it. nobody ever will experience it.

       this question reiterates the absurdity of the science fiction of "escaping gravity"
      </p>
      <p>
       you cannot "escape gravity" anywhere between the earth and the moon, since the gravity of the earth and the moon are both present in the space between the earth and moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       going faster than 25,000 MPH does not change this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       would traveling 25,000 MPH on Earth somehow make the gravity of the moon less strong?

       No, it was clearly not an image flip. You can clearly see that the folds going outward on one image are going inward on the other. It's just a picture of the flag taken from the other side. Even if it was an image flip and I'm wrong, how does that show anything? It could have been flipped for any number of reasons.

      <p>
       Do you want to read about the gravitational slingshot effect? It's not magically gaining energy from nothing. I'll just copy and paste something from your own link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The spacecraft's speed increases as it approaches the planet and decreases while escaping its gravitational pull (which is approximately the same), but because the planet orbits the Sun the spacecraft is affected by this motion during the maneuver. To increase speed, the spacecraft flies with the movement of the planet (taking a small amount of the planet's orbital energy); to decrease speed, the spacecraft flies against the movement of the planet. The sum of the kinetic energies of both bodies remains constant (see elastic collision). A slingshot maneuver can therefore be used to change the spaceship's trajectory and speed relative to the Sun.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        so if we really analyze 5, we see that orbiting the Earth a few times would cost the rocket far more energy than it would ever gain back.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How could you have possibly come to that conclusion?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the rocket is not merely "in orbit", or maintaining its elevation.
the rocket is heading toward the moon, increasing its elevation, and thereby increasing its gravitational potential energy, relative to earth, for the entire time.
which as you know, would require energy from some other source (fuel) to be converted into this increased gravitational potential energy.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The energy came from the fuel. It's already there in the form of kinetic energy when the engine shuts off. I am well aware of this concept, and you are the person denying its existence. When the engine cuts off the rocket has kinetic energy, and that kinetic energy is converted to potential energy as it moves away from the earth. It's literally the exact same thing as throwing a baseball in the air.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "escape velocity" and "sling shot effect" and "rocket equation" are all concepts borrowed from the realm of science fiction.

      <p>
       They are concepts with hard math behind them. Did you even read what you linked? The one on gravity assist specifically states that it came from a scientific paper. The equation for escape velocity is derived from the equations for kinetic and potential energy. The wiki page for the rocket equation specifically says that it was derived by mathematicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it came from ideas from science fiction writers, how does that prove anything? The idea for the nuclear bomb came from a science fiction book and that ended up working pretty well.

        however on the other hand, you would still have to account for the fuel consumption required to control the decent. otherwise the lander would crash into the moon at max speed. Also noteworthy is the fact that you can't actually find any credible video of the lunar lander launch and/or docking with an orbiter.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course you do, but once again, the lunar descent and ascent vehicles weigh almost nothing in comparison to the entire rocket. Just to give you an idea on the ascent figure, the lunar ascent module weighed about 4700kg. Doing some math and throwing in a bonus for a lack of air resistance and slightly more efficient engines, and you are looking at needing around ~4000x less fuel for the ascent. If you want to go do the math for it, feel free.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you mean no credible video? According to who? There is plenty of video.

       And I can conclude that it can fly back up and dock. What about the design indicates that it can't? If you asked a genius scientist from 200 years ago if they thought a 737 could fly, they would probably say that notion was ridiculous. Doesn't mean it can't fly.

       Yes, but it's not too hard. You just time the launch at the right time and go after it.

      <p>
       Did you read that wikipedia page? It gives a very thorough explanation of it.
       <br/>
       Of course gravity will always be influencing it, but you can get enough energy to continuously travel away forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       You clearly do not understand how it is possible to escape, so I will try to explain with numbers. You argue that because gravity will always be acting on it, then it will always be slowing down and eventually fall back to earth. That is not true.
       <br/>
       Let's take an infinite series for example. The classic is the series 1 + .5 + .25 + .125 + .0625 etc.....
       <br/>
       Despite the fact that that series goes on forever, it still has an end. It still has a very definite value that the series adds up to. And that value is.... 2.
       <br/>
       By your logic, the sum of that series is infinite.

       I don't care to click on your links because they are simply parroting the normal arguments that have all been debunked and I have already spent time looking at and debunking myself. So many of these videos are filled with blatant lies and moronic ideas that they are not worth watching. You seem to be smarter than the normal hoaxer and I am very disappointed that you fail to try and look at any of these videos critically. I admit that I have in the past been intrigued by arguments that the moon landing was faked, but I was able to dispel those ideas. You, instead of actually looking into it at all, simply lap it up.

       the reason i was able to craft the 24 questions, is because i understand the arguments. why do i understand the arguments? because I've been debating the math and physics of the moon landings for over 20 years, with all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds
      </p>
      <p>
       i can tell you that your video is one of the most popular videos cited as evidence,
      </p>
      <p>
       and i always debunk it with the same wikipedia link
      </p>
      <p>
       i can tell you that your next argument will be that if it was faked, then surely some Russians would have told you...somehow...

      <p>
       there is at least one blogger who took my 24 questions to task on his blog. google is your friend, not really

       A childhood friend of mine became a flag earther after I lost touch with him for a year or two. We had 5 or 6 very long talks about it. He was all in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure how much I influenced him, but he came out of it about 6 months ago. He didn't want to talk about to, but said he was embarrassed to bring it up anymore, and that was that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found out recently he was smoking 3-5 joints a day during the flat earth time, and experimenting with mushrooms. He just kinda lost it for a year or two. Video games and YouTube for 10 - 15 hours a day probably didn't help either. He went to the bottom of that rabbit hole

       yeah, i was going to say this. i grew up in texas and knew a lot of fundamentalists who sincerely believe the earth is only 6000 years old and that the dinosuars drowned in the flood because they couldn't swim and were too big for the boat...ergo why turtles and alligators survived, swim? check, fit in stoage? check.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't really know why people care, except for when someone is forcing them to agree. in the scheme of things, on a day to day basis, drowned dinosaurs and a flat earth don't impair functioning.

       Yes my friend is big into conspiracy theories and was telling me about one flat earthier that he'd met recently who had made him think it could be true. I said but how would eclipses happen as I'd seen someone make that statement in a debunking video and he went "oh yeah, you're right" and was instantly off that wagon.

       It's not really open minded. When you can take a commercial flight and see the curviture of the earth yourself your flat Earth theory is quickly and easily and through debunked.

       I used to know a guy who said they put a chemical compound in the air they circulate that slightly distorts the lenses of your eyes.  He is also in prison for almost beating his ex-girlfriend though so he likely not the best source. I agree with you there is a pretty big difference between open mildness and gullibility/mental illness. I suggest when he can u/of_mendez go on an airplane, it will likely help him understand why so many even conspiracy minded people have trouble with this one.

       If you haven't heard the latest news, it is that rockets don't work in a vacuum. Why? "There is nothing to push against", unlike on Earth where we have atmosphere. Had a lengthy discussion about this and it got nowhere but the other party finally getting angry.

       HAHAHA. That's not how rockets work man. Rockets and jet engines don't "push" on anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard of newton's third law of motion? Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. If you expel 1 ton of fuel out of a nozzle at 5000mph, there is going to be one hell of a kick in the opposite direction. It's the conservation of momentum man. I'm pretty sure they teach you this and the math behind it in 11th grade.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, rocket engines actually work BETTER in a vacuum. If you look at the wikipedia page for pretty much any rocket engine, you will not two different efficiency and thrust figures, one for the atmosphere and one for a vacuum. You will also note that the one in a vacuum is larger. See the

       Wow, you should actually learn some physics sometime. Rockets achieve motion by ejecting mass backward at a high velocity, producing forward thrust due to conservation of momentum. There is no medium required. The derivation is incredibly straightforward provided you know some calculus, but the concepts are obvious without it.

       Interesting. I must say that, as far as America goes, most flat earth believers also happen to be Trump supporters too.

       However most Trump supporters are not flat earth people I should say, but the reverse seems to be true from my personal observation. Interesting correlation.

       I don't know what "satanic human traffickers" mean or what it's got to do with any of that. I just think it's interesting that most Americans who believe in the silly nonsense of fake moon landing, flat Earth, not to mention the anti-vaccination morons, and general scientific research and study deniers who opt to simply "believe" their biases instead, all happen to be disproportionately Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       No doubt general stupidity and lack of common sense plays a major factor into all this, but I think there are other more complicated factors at hand as well. Anyway it's all fun to watch for me, hope it's interesting for you too :)

       No it's not. The default was the flat earth. Then, through observation, we discovered that it was in fact, not flat. It's not that complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also the "default" that shooting yourself in the face with a shotgun is a bad idea. I guess we should all have an "open mind" about that issue too.

      <p>
       Having an "open mind" does not mean you get to blatantly disregard evidence and only listen to things that conform to your idea, which is exactly what all flat earthers do.

       You cant prove Einstein yourself but believe wholeheartedly, and havent tested, but you wont even consider the flat earth beliefs, if we are replying quickly, please tell me something if I may ask a question, have you heard about gobleki tepe and the new chamber on the pyramids?

       I can't prove that Einstein was correct myself, but there are plenty of people who have. In the same way, I cannot prove to myself that shooting myself in the head with a shotgun is bad for me.

       I have heard of those things, but new archaeological discoveries have nothing to do with the shape of the earth. Once again, feel free to provide some evidence that the earth is flat.

       Einsteins theories are famously abstract, so abstract only a handful of people understood them, this is a famous fact, only about 12 people reeeeaaaallly understand Einstein they'll tell you, they'll tell you he was using a higher percentage of the brain, the man of the century, but at the time he lived he was Identified as a pretender by Tesla himself and many others, he got pushed to stardom cause he happened to support the farce with his abstractions.
............About those archeological discoveries, the "expert Egyptologists and archeologist" wont discuss, because it would mean they have been wrong for a long time, science, real science is getting witheld by people attaching to wrong beliefs of the world out of ownership, round earth is one such belief, and it just happens to be that the authorities at the time are invested on that one, we cant know with the senses we are too small, this is why we have to believe those with the power to get to the upper atmosphere where only the military yets can go

       Einsteins theories are really not that hard to understand, at least at a basic level.

       The "12 people" thing is not a fact, it's a myth. It's completely untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure the experts were jumping all over those finds. "Expert Egyptologists and archaeologists" were the people who found and were looking for them in the first place.

       As I have already said, you have full access to the upper atmosphere. Just buy plane tickets that take you on a higher flight path. I'm pretty sure you can take a high altitude flight in a fighter jet if you pay the right person too.

       We have been able to observe that the earth was round for quite a bit longer than we've had planes. We've known for well over 2,000 years. Eratosthenes measured the circumference of the earth with extraordinary accuracy in 200 BC (he was off by 0.16%).

       Honestly, flat earth people can somewhat find all sorts of explanations or whatever to explain most of the phenomena that you observe on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where they fail however, is in finding a singular explanation that is consistent with itself and explains all that you observe on Earth, as if it's a flat thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, their many different explanations for the many different observations of natural phenomena, seem to be wildly incompatible with each other.

       Einstein theories are hard to understand, we are not talking cartoon basic level here, but international authorities lying abstract, that is how abstract.
12 people is maybe an exaggeration, the number of fakers may be in the hundreds if I need to be accurate, still fakers.
We dont have access to satellite levels of altitude, not without government approval and disclosure agreements.
Al those old round earth hypotheses can be explained by other frames of reference, for example, Eratosthenes could have been fooled by a closer smaller sun....  but most importantly, about the egyptologist and archeologists, NO they dont want to discuss anything about it Zahi Hawass vs Graham Hancock on significance of Gobekli Tepe ...

       Actually, you do. You can buy the equipment necessary to track and steal images from satellites for relatively cheap. It's hard as hell to do, but people do it for fun all the time.

       I also fail to see  why you need to be in space to see that the earth isn't flat. You keep moving the altitude that you need to be every time I counter you. Stop running away from it and face the facts. I also want to point out that you failed to counter any of those points in previous comments.

      <p>
       Ahh yes, the famous sun on a flat earth. Something that clearly makes no sense, but you lap it up anyway. A sun that magically only shines on one side of the earth at a time, and quite obviously goes over the horizon yet still magically maintains a high altitude, circling around the earth.

       One or two people not liking a new find does not mean the entire scientific community is against it. Try again.

       Forget all that. You say you're worried about conspiracy theorists being discredited. Tell me, what conspiracy theories are true? What is legitimate for a conspiracy theorist to believe? In other words what do you subscribe to? Do you think Adam Lanza killed 20 kids? Do you think the 9/11 conspiracy is limited to "foreknowledge" by the Bush administration? Do you think we went to the moon ten times starting in 1968?

       FWIW while I'm passing through, I've seen several folks speaking to the idea that moon landing footage was recreated in a studio because there were things in the original footage folks weren't supposed to see.  I found that as an interesting side to it, as I had only heard "lulz moon landing truthers all think we didn't go to moon here's proof wut idiots".  (Yes, that's how people who knee-jerk reject whole categories of ideas sound to me. With &lt;3.)

       No, there's no way the Soviets would not have gone to the moon after they had been working on it for so long and had beaten the US to every other space milestone.

       Excellent response. Question everything. Real science does not jump to any conclusion. We study, theorize, gather empirical data, and put pieces of the big puzzle together.

       that would be amazing, only problem is that most people on this sub jump to conclusions instantly, only the more "out of line" ones.

       im yet to see any decently sized conspiracy board that is truly skeptic and neutral, and in search for the answer, rather than simply being contrarian cunts that would accept any other truth but the one put forward by governments, scientists, normal people, etc. some smaller ones back when i used to spend my time on the onion router were pretty good, but theyre probably long dead by now

       Agree. The more outlandish the claim, the louder and less scientific it gets. Too many Fox Mulder's and not enough Dana Scully's, IMO.

       Yeah there was a guy that I worked with for a hot minute who was a flat earther. They legit exist. Can't really blame them though. When the veils lifted and you realize that people you once thought had your best interests at heart turn out to be nothing more than selfish elitist liars, who can you believe? No one. So you fall down a never ending rabbit hole and are left with the question, what IS real? So to me anyways its understandable. And while I believe that  the flat earth theory is a little out there, my hope is that more and more folk will get "woke" and become better at sifting through all of the info and disinfo out there.

I know you are being sarcastic, but this is exactly why this technology is not going anywhere. There is no money in FREE energy. If everyone could pump their own water, purify it, grow their own food, power their own house, the government would have NO foothold on how we the people run our lives and not the other way around.

       So you should be winning the Nobel prize then? Also I seen your thread and you were called out there too, with much better explanations than I could give to how it's impossible and you didn't respond to them LOL

       Honest question: What do you actually have to gain from this? You're not selling any product, we've established that it's obviously impossible (see your own thread). Unless you really believe it is possible? Tell me what are you using this crystal to power? And what's your input:output? How can it have more output than what's put into it, doesn't that break the laws of physics?

       It's been impossible for 100+ years, Tesla never made any progress with it and 100% of the "free energy" nutjobs we've seen have turned out to be conmen, including such laughable bullshit as turning water into gasoline.

       Sorry bud, but it is immensely clear that you are not even willing to entertain a single thought that goes against the standard. You apparently don't even realize that the phrase "free energy" is a misnomer, as proven by your thermodynamics question.

       It seems you don't have the slightest clue as to what Tesla was working toward or how he saw success in his inventions. I'm not going to waste my time compiling research trying to convince someone that has no desire to learn. This is my last message to you.

       So you believe that people are walking upside down on a round Earth right now? That makes no sense to me. So the Earth just somehow pulls people towards it like magic? It’s flat. If you stand on the beach with a telescope you’ll be able to see a lot farther than a curved Earth theory would suggest. I’ve done it.

       Gravity sir just google it and read about it it's not that hard to understand. If you want proof gravity does exist just go take a zero g flight then you will know what it's like if gravity doesn't exist. About the telescope thing use it too see other planetary existence look at them look at their shape then think about it.

       Hold on OP. You made a good post 2 weeks ago that I actually commented in, called "Neil Degrasse Tyson: super shill." Here is a direct quote from it:

       You realize that flat earthers are people who are actually questioning the "basic foundation" of the cosmology that we were brainwashed with from a young age and which is maintained by people even you seem to understand are charlatan actors?

       ok but they're literally supporting an idea that is beyond stupid. they are completely ignorant to the basic evidence that can be observed by every human. the moon is round, the sun is round, the planets are round, why the fuck would the earth be the exception? you don't need science to figure that out. why not attach a go pro to a bunch of balloons and confirm it for themselves? it's nonsense. they can literally take 3 round objects and a flashlight and simulate how the earth, moon, and sun interact to create an eclipse.

       And here it is! I just commented elsewhere that I see the Flat Earth theory as deliberately pumped up so that people can use it to try to deride everybody who questions Scientism.

      <p>
       (Scientism being blind dogmatic faith in their pet Scientist or theory, rather than continually questioning based on the knowledge that we don't yet know everything, just like all the scientists of past centuries).

       Because we did. Same thing as with the flat earth. Any arguments "proving" it didn't happen are an absolute joke to debunk.

       You would think that if it was all a conspiracy to bankrupt the Russians that the Russians would argue that it was fake. Instead, the tracked the craft all the way to the moon and back and congratulated us on the achievement.

       I just want to undertsand the flat earther ideology. I thought it was fake cuz 'who would be lieve the earth was flat' but now It seems it is very real and I have a much better idea of how the 'flat earther movement' came into existance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like ppl just saw too much evidence and facts that dont fit the narrative they were taught their whole lives. It just reached a critical mass and ppl started to question even the most basic assumptions taught us, which was that the earth is round.

       yes i met one at the beach. i cut the conversation short and i walked away. every time i said something that disproved what he said he tried to rationalize his point in very weird ways. moral of the story, if you meet a flat earther, run. anyone who is stupid enough to believe that shit is NOT worth talking to and most likely wont change their mind.

       Then you don't even understand Flat Earth theory. If there even is an edge, it's far past Antarctica, where attempting to travel is met with being turned away at gunpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for physicists, astronomers, and science itself, you are just naming people who are literally the most brainwashed into the modern consmology; whose lives and livelihoods depend on conforming to this model. "Science" is not appeal to authority. It's the process of observation and testing hypotheses. As you have never observed or experimented to prove you live on a ball spinning at 1,000 mph, your belief is not based on science.

       Ok I'm done laughing now. So before I walk away from you (another crazy), I'm just going to ask you to show me your evidence. I am a sailor and have traveled across the world and ended up in the same spot I started in. You are sitting in a basement, probably never leave your house, and have all these crazy ideas because you haven't EXPERIENCED anything. Science is science because it can be replicated and bears consistency. To you, anyone intelligent is "brainwashed" because you aren't smart enough to understand them. To think that there are people like you out there that actually believe this shit, and you can vote! Even have kids! Holy fuck. Blows my fucking mind.

       This whole thread is another perfect example of people getting crazy just because somebody might have a different point of view. I'd wager that every single person who has made a comment mocking the tiniest possibility the earth could be something other than round knows somebody who is open to the idea of the FE theory. Let me repeat, I said "open to the idea", as in having a civil back and forth discussion without it turning into a fist fight.
The responses here prove that bringing up the subject at all can turn on the fingers-in-your-ears switch. 
The question shouldn't be "anyone ever met a flat earther" but why does the slightest hint of FE talk make people so angry? Why is it that even bringing up the subject makes people mock and curse and accuse others of being out of their minds?

       I don’t understand why there even has to be an edge. If you imagine a 2d video game where the world “wraps around” when the player gets to the edge of the screen, is there really an edge from the player’s perspective?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not making fun, nor am I a flat earther, but there are many widely accepted theories out there that are accepted based on the same math that could also explain a 2d earth. Yet those theories are not ridiculed as the flat earth theory is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose Elon Musk is right and our reality is a simulation of some sort. That would essentially mean that the earth could be flat, in the sense that it’s shape would obey the rules of the simulation. Like how google earth is actually flat but gives the user the illusion of roundness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I’m not debating the merits of either theory so much as pointing out that both have equal merits yet only one is ridiculed for some reason.

       There doesn't have to be an edge. There could be more "pockets" of life where another "sun" has melted out the ice to form continents. This could be only thousands of miles away from our map and contain other life forms which would explain any actual ET disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the simulation thing is interesting but I also
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       Elon Musk is a fraud so it's very unclear.

       I don’t think Musk is the only Simulated Earther, just one of the most prominent.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s an interesting and cool point about multiple “pockets”. I would love to see that played out in either video game form or book form. Hell, I would love to see even a more “traditional” flat earth as a story.

       LOFL. The "theory" of gravitation can't be explained on spinny-ball earth. That's why it's a theory. I can derive the constant for acceleration due to gravity. I can tell you how long a ball you throw will stay in the air. Even Newton said he could describe what gravity does but not say what it was. It's just the measurable effect we experience that what goes up must come down. Flat earth or spinny-ball earth, either way we have a mystery on our hands.

       Except for with spinny-ball earth, you have to believe you're in an elliptical orbit going faster than the speed of sound while spinning at 1,000 miles an hour but water looks like

       "That's why it's a theory" is a laughable comment. At a minimum, go to Wikipedia and read just a little bit about "Scientific Theory." Obviously you haven't taken (or can't remember after the head injury) a single undergrad science class.

       Yes, and he’s a pain in my ass. Either he’s deleted everyone from his social media that disagrees with him, or they just won’t argue with stupid, because I’m the only one who falls for it from time to time when one of his posts is too much for me to ignore. He said the sun was too bright the other day. He’s actually not a dumb guy and we were friends once upon a time, that’s why it’s so frustrating.

       Well I can't go that far, but back in the 90's I had some written contact with them (keep in mind this was very early days of or even pre internet).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of my interest in The Church of the SubGenius I had read
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Weirdness_by_Mail">
        this book
       </a>
       . It mentioned The Flat Earth Society and had a photo of a flat earth map they produced. I really wanted a copy of the map as a wall decoration.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point there only real exposure to the public had been that book and a mention on a show like That's Incredible (or some similar show).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wrote them and they wrote back asking some pointed questions about where I had heard of them and why I was interested. They specifically said something along the lines of "If you saw us on That's Incredible and think this is funny please do not reply". I don't think they were even aware of the High Weirdness book, but were very sensitive to people laughing at them even in the age when everything was done by mail.
      </p>
      <p>
       From corresponding with them I got the impression the entire Flat Earth Society could hold a meeting in one, at most maybe two booths in a diner. I think it was essentially a man and wife and a very few scattered other members.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also everything they wrote was based first and foremost on their reading of scripture. They did attempt to make physical arguments that seem to be more popular with the current incantation, but everything flowed from their reading of The Bible. Very similar to young earth creationists. They will try to use their version of science to argue, but The Bible is the starting point of their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure if the current Flat Earth folks are direct descendants, but I suspect everything has been blended in with trolls and people ironically having fun, and it's probably very hard to tell who is real and who isn't.

       So you show me a video that had some ice cliffs in it... Yikes. You've never seen a cliff before? I asked you to show me an impassible wall of ice (that supposedly surrounds the entire flat planet). You gave me... That.

       Nobody ever said it was impassible.  Admiral Byrd went past it and lost a bunch of his aircraft then they founded NASA and hit the dome with a bunch of missiles in operations Dominic and  Fishbowl.  The firmament is a few hundred miles past that wall.

       Yeah, before I use to think " holy fucking shit that is idiotic, how do people travel,plus all the technology." Now I still think it is impossible but at least I can envision the cinematic version of their theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movie would Basically involve all high level mathematics and science  turns out to be freemasonry illuminati who control the latest communications media from it's invention. All our daily existential travel comes from the ability to locate the magnetic north. North pole directly in the center, Antartica is the huge circular edge, everybody going east to west or vice versa goes in a circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the movie (think Independence day, truman show, they live) the entire world grew up conditioned to believe in things they have never seen backed by equations no one has ever checked. (Most people you know don't understand the math behind black holes, supernovas, planets spinning, endless black space)
      </p>
      <p>
       In this movie the pinnacle of science basically figured out how to get unlimited funding while basically indoctrinating everybody in a religion that they created (cosmos and spinning planets).  For fans of"  they live" hypothetically if you had the sunglasses on and looked at a picture of the computer composite of earth it would reveal DO NOT QUESTION YOUR HISTORY OR ENVIRONMENT
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to entertain this sub, It still is definitely impossible because it would involve a  gargantuan amount of people in on it.

       Isn’t there a theory that is at least plausible if not widely accepted that the entire universe is a flat holographic projection and reality only is perceived in 3d because our minds essentially trick us into thinking it’s not a flat holographic projection?
      </p>
      <p>
       So that theory causes people to raise their eyebrows and go “hmm”, but the other theory that say that the earth is flat and the only reason we think it’s round is because someone else tricks us into thinking it’s round causes people to ridicule and mock you.

       Seems legit.

       I’m no flat earthier or flat universer, by the way, before anybody ridicules and mocks me for my beliefs lol. Just pointing out something that seems a little inconsistent to me.

       The effect described by the holographic principle is independent of consciousness, so it isn't your mind "tricking" you. Rather, it's just that the full 3D spatial information  in the universe might be encoded in a 2D surface. It's more of a proposed unusual property of space on a quantum level rather than something explicitly linked to human perception. And there isn't exactly overwhelming evidence for it, it's just an idea that's attracted a lot of attention because quantum gravity may be easier to describe within such a framework. General relativity still works well on macroscopic scales.

       I don’t think it’s possible to know whether reality is truly independent of consciousness, because it’s philosophically impossible for an individual to know whether anything is independent of himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, I have no way of really objectively knowing that you are not just a vivid hallucination of mine, or that I’m not just a vivid hallucination of yours. Or that we are both just NPC’s in a really good video game.
      </p>
      <p>
       But.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m of the opinion that I’m better off taking your word for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s really the compelling argument in favor of round earth, or anything else we consider to be objective fact— We’re better off just believing it’s round. In other words— Even if it’s not round, it’s better for us individually to act as though it is, so therefore it might as well be. And if it might as well be round, then it’s effectively round.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s not really any immediate benefit in believing the Earth is flat, other than it would make an entertaining Sci-fi short story.

       I know a few.  Some are nice people.  They are nice because I don't go out of my way to debate them.  I don't have to probe anything to them,  i let them be them.

       Here's the thing: even if it was faked to begin, it will invariably now possess real people. They saw it online, they thought "huh... Wow" and now regurgitate the talking points. Its now a living beast
      </p>
      <p>
       This ties into the success of fake news websites and trolling. Whether or not its true, a small % of people are going to believe it and spread it.

       There's one in my town.  He has his house and vehicles decorated with flat Earth propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he sucks at driving because both vehicles have body damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's an entertaining part of our city, unless you're driving, I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was listening to him have a polite debate with someone the other day and I felt sorry for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       His whole identity is wrapped up in FE theory.
       <br/>
       It reminded me of KISS.
When they got famous there had to be a dejected moment when they realized that they would always and forever have to wear that makeup.

       Yes.  The same guy also once told me something about how all the forefathers did or believed a certain thing I can't recall.  I questioned him.  He said "yea, all 4 of them dudes, Thomas Jefferson, Jon hancock, (in can't remember the other 2 he listed).

       Yeah so one day I was playing poker at my fraternity house in college. All of the sudden Waka Flocka Flame comes in with a camera crew and asks us if we want to be on his upcoming tv show. The show was about conspiracy theories and was suppose to air on MTV. We were all shocked and giddy to be on the show so we signed the forms and he sat at the table. He asked us what we thought of stuff like the moon landing and 9/11. Then he blatantly said that he was a flat earther and we just like burst out laughing and tried to get him to elaborate.
      </p>
      <p>
       No idea what’s become of the so called tv show or whatever. I do have a video and maybe it has the quote on it. I’ll have to go check

       A kid I've know since high school is a flat earther. He was actually one of my best friend's roommates for a while. I haven't talked to him in a while but almost every time I see him it gets brought up and he won't stop trying to convert everyone around him. Last time I was at my friend's and he was there for a party, my friend told him to get the fuck out of his house, because he refused to drop it.

       Interesting choice of words. Seems that flat earth theory would not need to be proven wrong if it could be demonstrated that we live on a
       <del>
        ball
       </del>
       <del>
        oblate spheroid

       pear-shaped thing spinning at 1,000 mph and traveling faster than a bullet around the sun. But this cannot be shown or measured in any intuitive or tangible way. Thus you must try to "debunk" another explanatory hypothesis.

       There are all sorts of conspiracy theories against all sorts of known facts and just mainstream stories in our world. However, the flat earth conspiracy theory runs against one of the most known facts on the planet: That our planet is in fact a globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       No other conspiracy theory out there runs against such a massively well known fact. That's why there's a lot of backlash to it. That, coupled with the fact that "the earth is flat" was in fact the mainstream accepted idea (when people back then used only simple local observation, and did not know of proper scientific reasoning and experimentation) that baffles the average person of today even more, on how someone in this day and age can latch on this archaic false notion.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the top reasons why there are so many is speak out about the flatters and how dumb their ideas are, given what we know in this day and age.

       Sadly yes. Two of the 10 ish guys I work with are flat earthers.
      </p>
      <p>
       May explain why they're working decent, but dead end jobs in their mid 30s and bitter/spitfil towards everyone they work with.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a way to make themselves feel smarter or above those who don't "know the truth". Had a few intense arguments when I first started working with them but quickly realized there's no helping them. Gravity is bullshit, the earth is flat, NASA is a sham, it goes on and it's fucking embarrassing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality they are both just simple minded dolts with no ambition, and this is what you get from that.

       Oh trust me, I’ve tried. And I don’t feel bad in the slightest for ridiculing him. He treats everyone like they’re idiots, talks down to them, tries to make everyone else feel guilty for not spending all their time on the Internet research conspiracies. Any debate anyone tries to have with him is no debate or discussion - it’s him already “knowing” he’s right and gaslighting the fuck out of whoever is trying to have a discussion with him. He’s become a huge prick.

       I'm a believer that the earth isn't a globe. Maybe flat, maybe not. However, I'm not taking the word of people stealing $52 million a day in taxes from us, that "destroyed" the telemetry data to go back to the moon, that only have a little over 500 people claim to go into "space"; 23 of those have actually been to "outer space". I'm sorry for rambling, but the inability in me to trust those in a place of authority, is part of the reason I'm in this sub to begin with. I hate being lied to, and whether the flat Earth theory is nonsense or not, the heleiocentric model reaks of lies.

       No, flat earth isn’t something that is believed by really anybody BUT a famous rapper.

       I’ve said it before here: flat earth is a disinformation campaign. Notice how flat earth is pushed here then on showerthoughts they post anti conspiracy posts? That’s a character assassination at work.

       They exist, in fact every person who honestly looks into this becomes a flat earther. You will see more and more of them forever.  They are all in on the brainwashing and super lazy with the actual fraud.  The space-pear lie will be a very shortlived blip

       He's a good friend but he's confirmed diagnosed insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       He basically did MDMA/LSD/Coke/Mushrooms as a hobby for 4-5 years. Insisted its impossible for anything pure like the drugs he takes to do him harm etc
      </p>
      <p>
       He won't drink normal water, he'll drink like Pepsi, Beer, any kind of drink except tap water.
      </p>
      <p>
       He won't use any product that has any sort of dye in it and basically tries not to touch anything colored because he thinks that dyes are a big part of what happened to his brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       He believes witches follow him around and that they cackle outside his window.
      </p>
      <p>
       He believes in giants and talks about them every day as if there's some importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drinks his own piss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calls Christians Jesus Freaks and claims that basically every religion is "Luciferian" or "Satanic" except his flat earth Yahowa online cult thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       100% believes the Earth is flat, he talks to a guy on Facebook who used to "draw fake planets" for NASA 1 on 1 and possibly sends the guy money I don't really know.
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't believe that gravity is "possible" or that buildings could stay on a round earth especially if it moves, it would all just fly out into space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't believe anything can to space, Moon is a hologram, Sun is directly overhead during day and just on the "other coast" of the earth at night.

       Yup. They exist and aren't even crazy. Ask them why they believe not what you believe. You'll get very interesting YouTube's to watch with lots of historically conspiratorial subject matter. My whole thing with FE is look at the "proof" flat earth believers use and some of it is really weird. Doesn't have to do with "the earth is legit flat" its usually a video demonstrating nasa using cgi or other nasa fakery. Why would nasa need to lie. Flat earth also kinda jives with another conspiracy "we never left low earth orbit/never went to the moon" which is one I believe wholeheartedly, seeing as the Van Allen radiation belts would have cooked old the armstrong gang.
      </p>
      <p>
       Always look at "why". I swear for being a place where we often talk about magic and government supression, flat earth isn't even that crazy. Holds more water than Katy Benet Ramsey.

       Awesome thread guys. Very interesting and stimulating reading. TIL at least 1 flat earther has reverted back to sanity snd reason. If there's 1...then there's more. Gives me hope. I really looked into the whole FE thing, first out of horror then amusement. As someone who has been interested in astronomy my entire life, as i would look at the sky, i would try visualizing the movements of the sun moon planets and stars to try to understand it. Mind boggling but possible if you do it a lot. I am also fascinated following the changing angles of the sun and changing seasonal hours of daylight. Knowing what i know, FE makes absolutely no sense, but if you are completely ignorant of astronomy, and can't visualize what you are seeing in the sky in real time to understand it, i could see how someone could be taken in. There are a lot of really good videos debunking FE. You guys are all really awesome...i love reddit!

       How is it possible that you can by a flight from Johannesburg South Africa to Sydney Australia on a flat earth? On a globe that is a few thousand mile flight over the ocean. On a flat earth that is a flight that takes you over Africa and most of Asia and is far beyond the physical capabilities that a commercial airline can achieve.

       flat just seems like such an impractical shape for a celestial body. Is the earth a celestial body according to FE? If so, what are the forces that have shaped it into being flat?

       Gravity makes things spherical over time, what would have made it flat?

       Thanks for your question. Gravity is only a theory. In our model the earth is not spinning, but stationary. Buoyancy and density of objects are what makes things fall.In the Round Earth model, terminal velocity happens when the acceleration due to gravity is equal to the acceleration due to drag. In the Flat Earth model, however, there are no balanced forces: terminal velocity happens when the upward acceleration of the person is equal to the upward acceleration of the Earth.

       ok, so then what about observations of other objects in the solar system like the sun and other planets? Would that be part of a simulation?
      </p>
      <p>
       re 'gravity is only a theory', if I throw a ball up in the air it becomes less dense and more buoyant so it goes up, then it gets more dense and less buoyant on the way back down. correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       What force causes the ball to become more dense and less buoyant at the apex of the ball's throw so that it descends?

       or is it that because I personally believe in gravity and we as a society collectively believe in gravity that allows gravity to exist as a physical construct? This would be a logical extension of the two slit experiment from physics in which the observers expectation of a light particle being a wave or particle actually influences whether or not it becomes a wave or particle.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in ancient times people didnt believe in gravity, yet historical accounts before gravity was discovered do not show there being any difference than today re gravity. At the same time we have geologic and other features on earth that show they have been effected by gravity in roughly the same way for millions if not billions of years.

       not necessarily gravity as you say it is just a theory, but wouldnt there need to be a force of some sorts to cause the ball to change direction?

       I value your perspective. It sounds like gravity is a key contention in this discussion. You say gravity is a theory, i say if not gravity, then what, and you say buoyancy and density, also resistance.

       Thanks for sharing. Cognitive dissonance is super powerful. I guess I could kind of explore it if it were part of some simulated matrix, but that would mean that there is no earth as we know it, not that the earth we know is flat.

       What about the other planets, are they flat too or is it just earth?

       Well if you trust the stuff that Nasa puts out it seems like they would be spherical. But to the extent that the normal person can verify Nasas material, the planets and stars are barely recognizeable as odd looking speckles of light, unlike anything seemingly physical or material.

       I always assumed that moon landing edits hiding evidence of moon inhabitation or other intelligent life were the real reason for so much doctored images. This goes for a lot of other NASA footage from manned flights and probes sent out.

       i think you are missing the point
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, we know they took liberties with reality in crafting our education.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reason i am aware of the stories, and the paintings, is because thats what we were taught in school
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The common man knew the world was round.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       if that was the case, how did "flat earth" ever become a thing, in the years after CC?
      </p>
      <p>
       and why were Columbus and Magellan featured so prominently in our education?
      </p>
      <p>
       those two men, among others, were used to help craft a narrative about flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       in particular, how CC and FM were the visionary geniuses who knew the earth was round, in an era when the common man believed something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       same story with Galileo. GG was a visionary in an era of Artistotle's dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       and Newton...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What perhaps they didn't understand was how you would stay glued to the "bottom" part of the globe. So a commoner might think, "Hmmm were gonna sail over the curvy part... are we just gonna, 'fall off' at some point?
       </p>
       <p>
        The abrupt "edge" depicted in most of the paintings is a way for the artist to illustrate that notion in the confined space of his canvas.
       </p>

       i think my education, in particular, and this lesson, in particular, were crafted as a way to deceive me, not as a way to educate me
      </p>
      <p>
       i think that those responsible for creating the curriculum for my education must have at some point, after they educated me, decided that teaching this particular lie was not worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       i suspect that they noticed that in spite of trying to introduce "flat earth" to young, impressionable minds, they were still introducing the idea to curious, inquisitive minds who might look into it further.

       ...Conditioned? Just because I dont watch TV and Im not a fan of watching my information means im conditioned? How does that even make sense?
