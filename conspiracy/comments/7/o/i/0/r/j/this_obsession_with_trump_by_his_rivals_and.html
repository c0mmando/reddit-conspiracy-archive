        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump is infamous for his ego and pride in his name/brand. Even his supporters would admit to this. The funny thing is that this daily plot to ruin him is only throwing fuel onto this fire. We are approaching historic levels of fame or infamy depending on your  views. The daily soap opera, entertaining rivalries with the media, rivalries with other politicans, and battles with the &#39;Deep State&#39; puts him already on the level of a Henry VIII. His existing fame, colorful personality, and ascendency at this period of American history could lift his fame even further. I&#39;d argue he already is a folk hero. His first year of his first term is compelling stuff, for his supporters and detractors. Wild conspiracies from both sides. </p>

<p>Anything he does more on the world stage is just icing on the cake. And that&#39;s probably all he wanted before the MAGA movement came into being. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No mental gymnastics here. (Though that seems to be a new catch phrase for Trump detractors) I&#39;m completely neutral in all of this. </p>

<p>However, I KNOW we got a better deal with Trump than we would be had with Hillary. How incompetent must one be to lose an election with the weight of billions of dollars in support and propaganda behind themselves?? Or was a sure thing!! The Clinton machine was the biggest and grandest in US HISTORY; and it was reduced to rubble on Nov. 4Th, 2016. What followed was a book called &quot;What happened&quot; in which the prime offender blamed everyone except herself and as of 2018 most of it has been proven to be falsified claims anyway. </p>

<p>Talk about a petulant child!!! And I haven&#39;t even had to bring up her crimes once! The facts are all you need to see what kind of &quot;leadership&quot; was in store had Clinton won...</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m happy, the world isn&#39;t over and like Chapelle said: &quot;I&#39;m going to give him a chance.&quot; The first year wasn&#39;t so bad! ISIS IS DEAD. Corrupt Saudi Princes are jailed, and so far 8000 child abusers have been arrested with more than 3000 children saved. Which is an increase of over 250% compared to previous admins... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha these corrupt globalists who you pretend to be against just got billions and billions and billions in tax cuts paid for by America&#39;s great great great great grandkids.  A pleasant gift indeed. </p>

<p>It is telling that you spend most of your post talking about Clinton.  My God, the election is over.  It was well over a year ago now and while Trump&#39;s victory was a shocker, it in no way says anything about the quality of his presidency.</p>

<p>You mention ISIS.  Russia is the main reason they are not as influential (not dead as you suggest).  To believe that Saudi corruption is anywhere near gone is outright laughable and to give Trump credit for what a powerful Saudi prince has done within Saudi borders is ridiculous.  It is wonderful indeed that child abusers are being caught, but don&#39;t forget for a second that Trump bragged about being able to step into the change rooms of underage models because of who he is.  </p>

<p>What about his fucking non-stop tweets?  His constant lies?  His 91 days of fucking golf in one year alone?  The stock market growth is only happening because of a massive deregulation bubble (showing no willingness to learn from history) and when it bursts - and it will burst - the damage will make 2008 look like a cakewalk.  The guy is a self-absorbed fool, and his supporters aren&#39;t much better.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether he is Hillary&#39;s friend who didn&#39;t want to be President, which is what it seemed you claimed, or whether he has some personal affiliation with Putin, either way I don&#39;t see the  swamp being drained.<br/>
He ran a very effective campaign. I think it was very clear that Hillary thought she owned the position and sort of saw actually convincing people to vote for her as a formality. She&#39;s a very unlikable person, in my opinion, and she did not reach out to voters who could have made a difference. She had contempt for those who supported Sanders and she made it obvious.<br/>
Trump, on the other hand campaigned very hard and inspired people to vote, many for the first time. I don&#39;t think anyone has said he stole the election. The charge is more that he benefited from the Russians leaking information about Hillary, which unfortunately for her, seems to have been true.<br/>
She&#39;s corrupt. That&#39;s no secret. But my point is that, if he didn&#39;t want to be President and was only running to further his own interests, if he was lying and hoping to set up his old friend Hillary to get the job she wanted, then he is also corrupt and the whole idea of &quot;draining the swamp&quot; is nonsense.<br/>
I think he&#39;s a less competent President than Hillary would have been but I am not waving flags and asking you to support her. I&#39;m just saying that anyone who believes he didn&#39;t want to be President shouldn&#39;t be able to support him. Wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m running on the current narrative from that book that claimed he didn’t want to be the President. I don’t believe it at all considering he number of rallies he had leading into the election. He outworked Hillary and ran with far more energy. You don’t risk your entire name and reputation if you don’t want to win. They tried to destroy the Trump brand during the election. </p>

<p>There may have been a time where he never believed he would be President or even win the GOP nomination. But then he starting winning and you can blame the media/Hillary for that they even admitted they wanted Trump&#39;s antics versus more dangerous candidates like Marco Rubio. They gave him insane amounts of coverage which only fueled his brand. </p>

<p>But then I think something changed with Trump. After he was finished humiliating the GOP, his former friends and NY/LA colleagues started increasingly turning on him. Trump went from being an amusing showman/egomaniac to being called a Nazi, a white supremacist, a sexual harasser, a rapist, a mass murderer, and everything in the book. I think it then dawned on him that he actually crossed the Rubicon and this all starting becoming more real. Then he wins the Presidency and immediately the Democrats/Washington Establishment (Deep State) started launching an obvious soft coup against him. Recounts, protests, media hysteria, and trying to influence the electoral college. I don’t think we’ve seen anything like the continued reaction to Trump since Lincoln won in 1860. And then of course the rest is history with the FBI and Obama Administration actively trying to undermine a sitting President that continues all the way to today—where we are taking about his state of mind. </p>

<p>I think he is draining the swamp. The FBI and DC Establishment has had a light shone on it that never would have happened with any other President. Hollywood, entertainment, and sports...likewise. There is real change happening in this country. If there wasn’t, people would just let Trump hang himself on his own petard. They won’t though. They keep obsessing over him and it is backfiring. It is making him more infamous by the day to such a degree that I truly believe this period of history will be remembered for a very long time. I mentioned Henry VIII as a comparison. I think that is his existing bar for fame but it can only go higher the further he/his enemies go. </p>

<p>I support anyone who is the President of the US. I think Hillary is more competent than Obama was but she is also more corrupt. I think Trump on the surface seems incompetent but in reality he is a master class politician who will be studied and written about forever. His unorthodox style makes him historically interesting and a great leader in my eyes. Would Hillary or any other establishment politician cut off (rightfully) an extremely important ally like Pakistan at the drop of a hat? Or get into a public war of words with North Korea and force China’s hand? I doubt it. Trump is doing things differently than the neoliberals, neocons, and globalists. The old ways of doing things were expensive and weren’t working. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the reasons he won the nomination is because in the debates the other Republican candidates could not respond to him. I don&#39;t hate him. I used to watch The Apprentice and as far as that goes I thought he was very entertaining.<br/>
I would disagree with you on some of your points but I appreciate your reply. It&#39;s very interesting. You&#39;re right that the media helped him get the nomination and then panicked when he won. He was clearly supposed to lose.<br/>
I wish he were better able to deal with the criticism, and I wish his policies on many social issues were different. But I can understand your points better now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I’d agree with the debates thing too. I remember that first Republican debate where Trump came out swinging and clowned everyone including Megyn Kelly’s career. </p>

<p>I also appreciate the response and discussion. It’s refreshing to talk about things politically that doesn’t boil down to ‘orange Russian cheeto’. I wish people would be able to discuss Trump rationally more. The man has many flaws (and strengths) but he’s not some comic book villain either. I think most should agree that we are living in historically interesting times and at least have a sense of humor about some things. </p>

<p>So is Benedict Arnold, Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson.</p>

<p>Trump being known as the first illiterate, pathologically liar placed into the Presidency by direct hostile foreign influence is not a fame or glory.</p>

<p>Trump has merely assured that in the future his name will be tied to incompetence and corruption.</p>

<p>Hopefully, he and his family will die in prison to complete the historical narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enough public realm evidence of conspiracy, treason and money laundering exists to indict the entire Trump family. The former National Security advisor and a campaign advisor have pleaded guilty to crimes and turned states witness. The Trump campaign chairman has been indicted for crimes exactly like those committed by Trump.</p>

<p>On top of all this, the former campaign CEO and close Trump friend and advisor has openly accused the Trump family of treason.</p>

<p>You can personally ignore all this evidence, but that won&#39;t make it go away.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is a traitorous illegitimate pretender and his criminal empire is collapsing around him.</p>

<p>In a year or two, no one in the country will even admit voting for Trump and the Republican Party will have been scrubbed of all Trump sycophants.</p>

<p>So that they could testify against Trump and not be charged with more serious crimes.</p>

<p>An unhinged dotard ranting at the television and eating McDonalds in bed because he fears assassins is the definition of &quot;stronger&quot;. </p>

<p>Even Trump himself doesn&#39;t believe this bullshit.</p>

<p>Obviously the Republicans were going to mortgage the country to payoff a few wealthy families. Even then the numerous lawsuits over this giveaway haven&#39;t been resolved. So this is not even a done deal.</p>

<p>Trump is an criminal old fool and even his own party now recognizes that fact. Wait for November 2018 when the GOP burn Trump to the ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No mental gymnastics here. (Though that seems to be a new catch phrase for Trump detractors) I&#39;m completely neutral in all of this. </p>

<p>However, I KNOW we got a better deal with Trump than we would be had with Hillary. How incompetent must one be to lose an election with the weight of billions of dollars in support and propaganda behind themselves?? Or was a sure thing!! The Clinton machine was the biggest and grandest in US HISTORY; and it was reduced to rubble on Nov. 4Th, 2016. What followed was a book called &quot;What happened&quot; in which the prime offender blamed everyone except herself and as of 2018 most of it has been proven to be falsified claims anyway. </p>

<p>Talk about a petulant child!!! And I haven&#39;t even had to bring up her crimes once! The facts are all you need to see what kind of &quot;leadership&quot; was in store had Clinton won...</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m happy, the world isn&#39;t over and like Chapelle said: &quot;I&#39;m going to give him a chance.&quot; The first year wasn&#39;t so bad! ISIS IS DEAD. Corrupt Saudi Princes are jailed, and so far 8000 child abusers have been arrested with more than 3000 children saved. Which is an increase of over 250% compared to previous admins... </p>
