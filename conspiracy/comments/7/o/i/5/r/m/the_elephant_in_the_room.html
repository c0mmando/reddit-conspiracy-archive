        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The thing no one wants to talk about: Gender roles. The Native Americans had 4 genders. There were men, women, men who stayed with the women and took care of children, and women who hunted with the men. </p>

<p>They understood that sometimes the aggressive masculine spirit was present in a female and sometimes the passive feminine spirit could be present in men. </p>

<p>They had it right. Identify this spirit at an early age and allow the individual to choose their own path. </p>

<p>Unfortunately in our modern society these <em>anomalies</em> have become far too widespread. Men are behaving as if they are weak and women are behaving as if they are strong. It has led to the high divorce rate, the astronomical rate of infidelity, and the paramount gender confusion. </p>

<p>I feel for people who feel as if they are the wrong gender. I feel pity for them, as I don’t think that feeling is evil or detrimental. There’s nothing wrong with it. However, in the world where everyone gets a trophy, everyone is allowed to vindicate their bizzare sexual dispositions without consequence. The minority has become more powerful than the majority. Political correctness has neutered us. </p>

<p>Again, I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with this, if it were a few isolated cases, but when a huge percentage of the population becomes confused as to what gender they are, we have problems.  </p>

<p>A guy in Britain had ovaries surgically implanted so that he could give birth. This is unnatural. </p>

<p>It is very clear to me that using the LGBT community as human shields is a major part of the NWO’s plan. How many actors and entertainers are homosexual, openly, much less secretly? </p>

<p>Again.. I have nothing against them. I’m simply pointing out that homosexuality and transsexuality are being used as weapons. </p>

<p>Many of you will just shut down this argument “because I’m a bigot” “how dare you question us?” </p>

<p>Only people with their minds blown wide open will see what I’m trying to say. The rest, crucify me. This needs to be said.</p>

<p><em>Its all part of the plan</em></p>

<p>A big plan; water down our ideas of what is normal, what is “family”</p>

<p>Eventually, the government will take your children.  </p>

<p>We just need to let people be. If a femme guy and a butch guy want to adopt a kid or whatever, go for it. Or two femme guys. Or two butch women. Whatever.</p>

<p>Everybody wants to feel like they belong. Even genderqueer zebrakin want to have a family. And if they are good parents who cares about their gender politics?</p>
