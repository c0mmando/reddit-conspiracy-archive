       The thing no one wants to talk about: Gender roles. The Native Americans had 4 genders. There were men, women, men who stayed with the women and took care of children, and women who hunted with the men.
      </p>
      <p>
       They understood that sometimes the aggressive masculine spirit was present in a female and sometimes the passive feminine spirit could be present in men.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had it right. Identify this spirit at an early age and allow the individual to choose their own path.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately in our modern society these
       <em>
        anomalies
       </em>
       have become far too widespread. Men are behaving as if they are weak and women are behaving as if they are strong. It has led to the high divorce rate, the astronomical rate of infidelity, and the paramount gender confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel for people who feel as if they are the wrong gender. I feel pity for them, as I don’t think that feeling is evil or detrimental. There’s nothing wrong with it. However, in the world where everyone gets a trophy, everyone is allowed to vindicate their bizzare sexual dispositions without consequence. The minority has become more powerful than the majority. Political correctness has neutered us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with this, if it were a few isolated cases, but when a huge percentage of the population becomes confused as to what gender they are, we have problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       A guy in Britain had ovaries surgically implanted so that he could give birth. This is unnatural.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very clear to me that using the LGBT community as human shields is a major part of the NWO’s plan. How many actors and entertainers are homosexual, openly, much less secretly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again.. I have nothing against them. I’m simply pointing out that homosexuality and transsexuality are being used as weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of you will just shut down this argument “because I’m a bigot” “how dare you question us?”
      </p>
      <p>
       Only people with their minds blown wide open will see what I’m trying to say. The rest, crucify me. This needs to be said.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Its all part of the plan
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       A big plan; water down our ideas of what is normal, what is “family”

       This is why you should be careful about saying something is unnatural. Sticking a bit of metal or plastic in the body is unnatural.

       If you don't like ovaries being put is someone because they are the wrong sex or whatever, just say it is because you don't think it is right, don't dance around it.

       Most people have no problem wth this. People do not like when we start to say that some men get pregnant and some women produce semen.   It’s a totally different thing to completely ignore the biological presentations of the overwhelming and statistically significant majority of people.

       We have a mind and a body, simple as that. But our bodies determine our sex and whether we are "man" or "woman". Our minds/personality is called feminine/masculine. A feminine man is not a woman, a masculine woman is not a man.

       The family unit is the BASIS of any society!!! How is that NOT ultimately important. That's what all these PC agenda's are doing! It is basically an assault on the core building blocks of society and the family unit is sacrosanct.

       Actually, fulfilling classical gender roles is important. This might sound crazy, but it's actually important for children to be raised in an environment with both a masculine and feminine influence. I don't care if sometimes male and females reverse their roles or whatever,  but for everyone to act like shitting out a kid into day care so the parents can float around exploring various careers and sexual lifestyles while confusing everyone with double speak is not how to raise our future generations.

       Honestly there's more harm being done by people's reaction to someone's choice of gender than someone choosing their gender. On both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       We just need to let people be. If a femme guy and a butch guy want to adopt a kid or whatever, go for it. Or two femme guys. Or two butch women. Whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody wants to feel like they belong. Even genderqueer zebrakin want to have a family. And if they are good parents who cares about their gender politics?
      </p>
      <p>
       This reaction of "OMG SOMEONE WANTS TO BE SOMETHING WEIRD THIS IS REALLY BAD GUYS" is more harmful than those people peacefully being what they want.

       I honestly believe most people who say such things are just incapable of comprehending their situation in their current "insert color pill" state.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I've noticed is that it's not that individuals totally care about identity politics, but rather the way were told we have to accept these people for what they are before we can even understand the situation at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was in the wrong body, or believed I was a zebrakin, for my sake, I would also try to be conscious of how the rest of the world would be with understanding my situation. Oh you're not accepting of me? Maybe I'll try to calm explain who I feel I am, instead of just shouting you down and calling you bigoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno. Shitty people are shitty. And sometimes those shitty people are conservative, sometimes they're liberal, sometimes they're gay, and sometimes they're homophobic. I'm tired as fuck and am really confused as to what my original point was.
