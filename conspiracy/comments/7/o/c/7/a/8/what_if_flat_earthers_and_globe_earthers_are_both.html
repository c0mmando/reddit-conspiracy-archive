<p>If all you say is true then why do we only have a handful of images of Earth from space in all that time and nearly all of them are a joke? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean by &quot;a joke&quot;? We have millions of images of Earth. Earth as a whole we have very few because you have to get <em>really</em> fucking far away to get it all in one shot, and satellites do their most valuable worth in LEO. The photos taken in LEO can be composited to get full-scale images so there&#39;s not much reason to send them out far enough for a whole-planet single image.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What has manned space travel died and no one really cares? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume you mean &quot;why&quot; and it&#39;s this: manned missions worked when:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There was prestige propaganda to be had in the Cold War from accomplishing various &quot;firsts&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Humans were the best mobile scientific instruments we had</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Nowadays:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Cold War is over, there only remaining &quot;firsts&quot; available are really huge projects like a manned Mars mission</p></li>
<li><p>Miniaturization and robotics have made humans less essential to scientific work in space</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>It can&#39;t be financial because we know the world wide economy is a joke. It&#39;s all monopoly money..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s also financial because, mostly due to the Cold War ending and the &quot;firsts&quot; being achieved, NASA&#39;s raison d&#39;être is not longer urgent or prestigious, so their budget is low-priority.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not silly at all. You&#39;ve been conditioned by youtube charlatans into believing bullshit, and they prop up your ego by suggesting everyone except you has been duped.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hell.. they should have had some mishap as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not if they did it right, which they did. It might help to understand the US&#39;s space program in contrast to the USSR&#39;s, which had <em>way</em> more mishaps, including more dead cosmonauts. The USSR did way more tests the US did, often rushing a rocket to the pad just to watch it explode then take notes on the explosion for the next one. They basically did rapid prototyping at the extreme. When they needed a bigger rocket, they&#39;d weld a bunch of existing ones together.</p>

<p>The US, by contrast, would redesign rockets from the ground up whenever they needed to be bigger. Then, they&#39;d do multiple years of simulation and refinement, and only after all that attempt tests. </p>

<p>The US, generally speaking, didn&#39;t do a mission in public until they were 99.99% sure they&#39;d covered all their bases.  This was partly because they worked mainly toward manned missions, so they had to be 100x as careful. Russia was much more cavalier and tended to focus on robotic missions. </p>

<p>So why did the US not suffer (more) mishaps? Because their engineering style was paranoid and cautious to the extreme. If you want to see more mishaps, look at the USSR&#39;s space program history.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Actually, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s naive here. You don&#39;t understand space, engineering, or the history of the space program. You just have an idea in your head that &quot;it&#39;s really hard&quot; and so you can generate endless scepticism coming purely from your own ignorance.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a controlled, hermetically sealed environment with life support systems. What on Earth are you expecting?</p>

<p>Be honest: have you put any effort at all into researching how the US space program actually worked? It sounds like you&#39;re just sitting in an armchair saying, &quot;Nah, sounds too hard to me.&quot; </p>

<p>Watch them closely.. it&#39;s a joke to me now.. the way they have ever video interview the same and you can&#39;t see space behind them.. what director in their right mind wouldn&#39;t include space in the backdrop..? Especially for the price of that backdrop. It makes zero sense..</p>

<p>And they only do certain things on the space station at certain times.. which also makes no sense.. they are either all lined up in front of the camera and  do nothing showing they are in space and then only do zero G things at certain times... it&#39;s far far too convenient...  and things like their hair floating looks absurd... If you watch it considering it is all fake you see how fake it truly is...</p>

<p>Its parallax motion with regard to the stars. This builds on our knowledge about Earth&#39;s orbit, which in term is built on knowledge about its size. All of these things fit together into a single, coherent, mutually-reinforcing theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment history is really sad, yet revealing. If you asked me 2 years ago what I thought about Flat Earth I would have called it b.s., laughed it off, possibly even mentioned that it could be a psy-op. What I would never have done is go thread to thread trying to &quot;debunk,&quot; as if it were my life&#39;s mission to convince internet strangers something that I could never be certain of anyway, like the shape of the earth or distance to the sun. </p>

<p>It&#39;s bizarre. Such effort, to attempt to disprove an idea that, were it as ridiculous as you seem to think it, could be dismissed and forgotten. This is one of the reasons I began to doubt modern cosmology in the first place and why so many others are every day. So, thank you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re referring to the simulation hypothesis. Care to elaborate?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll grant you that there is an intriguing hypothesis that describes our Universe as holographic/holofractal in nature. Within that paradigm reality (rather than Earth itself) can be described as a 3-dimensional projection from a 2-dimensional plane. The world, in that sense, is &quot;flat&quot; indeed, though I doubt that&#39;s what FE proponents mean at all. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also conceivable, that our consciousness can sort-of tap into the hologram in such a way that we may perceive anything from any place at any time. The CIA&#39;s Stargate project indicates that much if it is to be believed. Astral Projection, Channeling, The Akashic Records, etc. would be applications of our ability to tap into the holographic plane.</p>

<p>The Simulation Hypothesis is a strange variant of this idea, and I&#39;m not entirely sure what to make of it. It rests on the assumption that we will become so advanced technologically, that we will construct a simulation of our world that is practically indistinguishable in complexity and size from our own. I&#39;m not so convinced that&#39;s a valid assumption, but it may be. If it is, then the chances of our reality being base reality are exceedingly slim. </p>

<p>It seems the flat eathers are right that we can&#39;t leave Earth IMO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps, but that&#39;s like calling a broken clock right when it&#39;s only right twice a day.</p>

<p>The Van Allen radiation belt is still an obstacle we don&#39;t know how to overcome, or rather, we don&#39;t know how to build a ship with thick enough shielding to cross it and keep any passengers alive. I believe the Apollo Program was a farce because of precisely that factor. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve sent Neil and the others into parking orbit, and maybe we had sent probes to the moon and other places, but I think the ISS is the farthest any human has travelled so far (neglecting the possibility of a secret space program which may have solved those technicalities long ago by employing superior shielding materials or generating Star-Trek like shields for protection).</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that NASA is at least half-full of shit, as much as it pains me to admit that. The rovers on Mars are really on Devon Island, either because they&#39;re studying Mars in secret (investigating potential archeological sites or residual microbial life), or for some other reason.</p>

<p>The dome/FE idea strikes me as stupefying misinformation that preys on the inherent want of the people to be somewhat remarkable. It makes little sense otherwise.</p>

<p>Perhaps our world really is just a procedurally generated simulation of a natural world based on physical laws derived from some base-reality, but I&#39;m as of yet unconvinced that&#39;s the case. The psychedelic experience, for instance, would seem like a rather strange bug in the code, were it so.</p>

<p>I&#39;m much more inclined to think that the physicality of our world is such that every mind, every cell, every atom, every proton, every planck length of space contains every other instance of itself within itself, just as every part of a hologram contains the whole image. That doesn&#39;t mean that space ain&#39;t real (or that Mirrors And Our Eyes Aren&#39;t Real, Jayden!), but that everything is fundamentally connected to everything else. I&#39;m not sure if flat is the right term to use for such a reality, but it might be perceived that way in certain psychological/psychedelic states, which in turn might explain where the idea first came from. But that&#39;s obviously just wild speculation on my part.</p>

<p>Almost certainly, yes, though the alien &quot;disclosure&quot; serves many purposes at once. It introduces a new global threat (as carbon failed to catch on), it removes conventional notions of God significantly, allowing for the creation of an artificially constructed religion, it allows the military tech field to use previously undisclosed technology and AI, etc. It&#39;s a pretty complicated topic, but almost certainly a ruse.</p>

<p>The belts aren&#39;t as harmful as conspiracy theorists suggest. They mischaracterize the nature of radiation exposure, ignore shielding, and ignore that limited duration within the belt, and ignore that the vast majority of missions don&#39;t cross it at all.</p>

<p>The reason we don&#39;t go back is there is no good reason to. At the time it was motivated by the propaganda usefulness of passing the milestone, the science was secondary. Once they got there, the useful science started to run out after only a few missions. Turns out the moon is made mostly of useless dust and helium, which will one day be useful when we have the technology to economically harvest it and use it. With such a limited budget, its better spent on satellites monitoring the Earth, which in contrast to the Moon has <em>waaay</em> more going on to study.</p>

<p>to which there is no reasonable answer.</p>

<p>I googled for 5 seconds and go this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The van Allen &quot;belts&quot; are zones of radiation where high speed particles
(such as protons and electrons) that have been trapped from the Solar
wind by the Earth&#39;s magnetic fields.  The inner van Allen belt extends
from about 1,000 to 5,000 kilometers above Earth&#39;s surface, the outer
van Allen belt extends from about 15,000 to 25,000 kilometers above
Earth&#39;s surface.  The radiation in the van Allen belts was a serious
concern for the Apollo program.  The Apollo spacecraft were designed to
provide some protection from the van Allen radiation, but more than that
the mission was designed so that astronauts spent the least possible
amount of time in the van Allen belts.  The actual amount of radiation
received by the Apollo astronauts during their passage through the van
Allen belts is difficult to determine but it is estimated to be about
2 rems (or 20 milli-Sieverts).</p>

<p>In comparison, a modern chest X-ray will deliver about 10-20 millirems
to the subject, radiation doses from background radiation (cosmic rays,
radon, uranium deposits, etc.) for the average human living on Earth is
on the order of 100 millirems per year, and annual doses for people
working around radiation (for example, X-ray technicians, nuclear power
plant workers, etc.) can range up to 0.4 rems per year.  The &quot;maximum
permissible dose&quot; for radiation workers on Earth is 5 rems per year or
25 rems in a single emergency exposure.  A 25-100 rem dose will increase
a person&#39;s chance of developing cancer.  Around 100-200 rems, a person
will experience nausea several hours after exposure.  Above 300 rems,
severe vomiting, and hemorrhaging will result nearly immediately, loss
of hair, and other health effects will result fairly rapidly, greater
than half of the people exposed to this much radiation will die within 2
months.  Above 800 rems, diarrhea, dehydration, and problems with
digestive organs will result rapidly, over 90% of people exposed to this
much radiation will die within two weeks.  Above several thousand rems,
death results in a few days and convulsions and nervous system failure
occurs almost immediately.  So, 2 rems is certainly a lot, but by no
means would it cause instant death or illness.  And in fact is most
likely to cause no noticeable immediate or long term effects.</p>

<p>There are several space programs that are at least somewhat independent from NASA. ESA for one, along with independent astronomical studies, of course. I&#39;m not aware of any independent assessments of the Van Allen Belts at this point, but it&#39;ll certainly be worth looking for.</p>

<p>For one thing, I&#39;d like to know if there are diverging estimates about the radiation received by the Apollo crews, as that&#39;s the core assumption on which the reasonableness of a transition rests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I largely agree with that view of simulation theory. </p>

<p>It is an interesting argument to assume that we&#39;ll be able to perfectly simulate an entire Universe as complex as our own in due time (be it in 10 years or 10.000) and that this simulated Universe would consequently be capable of evolving another species who could do the same, ad infinitum, making the statistical likelihood of our Universe being the original base-reality very, very slim. I&#39;m just not convinced the initial assumption is actually correct.</p>

<p>I think Asimov had it right when he suggested that there could never be &quot;sufficient data for a meaningful answer.&quot;, though he certainly blurred the line again with the remarkable conclusion to his story.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting thought experiment, to say the least, but I do agree that it&#39;s likely a misdirection or false interpretation of our holofractal Universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an academic &amp; scientific view of it being both flat and spheroid. In plane surveying and geodesics, each geodesic frame is flat, making up a larger geoid.</p>

<p>In Einsteins relativistic interpretation, there is no <em>true</em> ball-shaped Earth, but rather gravity is an expression of potential and the bending of space-time - using the geodesic interpretation, variable gravity creates the geoid (which is the &#39;sphere&#39; everyone is used to). Note, geologists measure changing gravity very consistently with observable tests.</p>

<p>In that definition, the Earth isn&#39;t so much spheroid as its a measure of bending of space-time and gravity potential. Since gravity potential changes it produces the geoid.</p>

<p>There are some other wonky interpretations in relativistic physics however, such as throwing a ball into the air does not make the ball return in its path, but continue on in one direction and space-time is bending to make it appear having a return trajectory.</p>

<p>Comparatively, a flat earth is about as nonsensical as the infinite path physics in relativity to most people.

<p>There is an academic &amp; scientific view of it being both flat and spheroid. In plane surveying and geodesics, each geodesic frame is flat, making up a larger geoid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not it being &quot;both flat &amp; spheroid&quot;, that&#39;s just two ways of mapping its surface, comparable to a paper map vs a globe. One thing in reality can be <em>represented</em> two different ways, that doesn&#39;t mean the thing itself is simultaneously flat and round.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once you take the geodesic interpretation and apply the relativistic interpretation, it forms something new entirely. </p>

<p>Gravity is defined in relativity of a curvature of spacetime rather than a force. The Earth&#39;s shape is measured in gravity potential. It allows for an interpretation where the Earth isn&#39;t entirely &quot;solid&quot; and given Love numbers and gravity anomalies, it&#39;s just an apt expression or model as any other.</p>

<p>One could also argue that no models are accurate. But then no models are accurate. So defining any as what <em>is</em> would be arbitrary. Case in point, look at how many projection maps exist.</p>

<p>Basically whatever widespread belief that is maintained is what <em>is</em>, and arguing against it is a hazard to sanity or social standing.  Even if we strive for objective interpretations, unfortunately, if everyone agrees to a subjective one, the subjective agreement is then objectively distinguished.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like smart-sounding bullshit, honestly. The &quot;geodesic interpretation&quot; is a mapping approach for surveying, not a theory of the actual shape. </p>

<p>I also think you&#39;re talking out your ass about relativity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Einsteins relativistic interpretation, there is no true ball-shaped Earth, but rather gravity is an expression of potential and the bending of space-time </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A &quot;true ball shaped Earth&quot; and &quot;gravity as an expression of the bending spacetime&quot; are not mutually exclusive things. Please point me to a source that Einstein disputed the ball-shaped Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Geoids_sm.jpg/220px-Geoids_sm.jpg">Geoid Map</a> is made from measuring gravity anomalies.</p>

<p>Various theories may not be mutually exclusive but if one argues that something <em>is</em> or represents a whole, they must be logically consistent in the whole. (Arguably something could be said about the consistent inconsistencies).</p>

<p>Einstein also said that when you get on a train, the station moves and the train stays in the same place [albeit in jest, it works in theory]. Relative math is fundamentally based in that premise, anything can be made a focal point of relative motion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In GR you can use any frame that&#39;s convenient to solve the Einstein equation and calculate the curvature and/or metric. That&#39;s because these tensors are co-ordinate independant. If you choose polar co-ordinates centred on the Sun you get a mildly perturbed Schwarzschild metric, which is indeed nice and simple. Once you have the curvature you can transform it to any co-ordinate frame you want e.g. geocentric co-ordinates, then use it to calculate the evolution of the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found this post earlier, and started to chime in to debate with the NASA fanboys, then one of them proposed the question to show him a working flat earth map. </p>

<p>This got me looking to see if anybody has improved on that, b/c the &quot;AE map&quot; that is the most popular among flat earthers has flaws- and he probably knows it, which is why they ask for a working model.</p>

<p>This of course doesn&#39;t prove the oblate spheroid earth, b/c the problems with it is what got a lot of us into seriously considering this theory to begin with. </p>

<p>The fact is both models have major flaws. As much as I don&#39;t like Flat Earth Asshole, (b/c he is an annoying AF asshole) he has that broken record point of the AE model not working. He doesn&#39;t provide anything more to counter point, or bring anything productive to the table in place though.</p>

<p>All this/these anomalies are what keep me running back to your simulation theory point of this post. Either the entire world/our paradigm is a simulation, or the sun, moon, and sky are simulations. Or there are multiple suns.</p>

<p>I recently saw as of today that there are people like Darren Nesbit proposing that there is possibly a fourth dimension spacetime loop of the sky, which from what I gather basically means it is its own simulation, so to speak, so we don&#39;t have to be &quot;NPC&#39;s,&quot; in someone else&#39;s video game.</p>

<p>That theory could explain how the day times work in every time zone, how the sky is a repeatable cycle, how the sun moves on every continent, and all of the anomalies that can&#39;t be explained 100% on either sphere earth, or AE flat earth model.</p>
