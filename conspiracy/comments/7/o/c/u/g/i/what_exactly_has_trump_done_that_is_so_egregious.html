       I dislike the idea of Donald Trump as my president. I grew up hearing of him, disgusted by his disconnect from spirit and worship of material things. He is ugly, rude, loud, innapropriate, and not professional. I didn't vote for him ( or anyone last election..we all know Hillary is worse) and would not vote for him again unless it turns out he is really orchestrating the Q drops and has been trolling the whole world via Twitter and has an actual plan to take down the deep state and their Satanist agenda. I still hold out a little hope for said scenario. But in all honesty without the unintelligent hate, the usual Russia garbage ( these people want Trump gone if there was real treasonous collusion he'd be gone already no doubt in my mind) what has he dine that is so terrible? Like hate worthy? I have to deal with family and friends and fake laugh when they bring up msm bullshit and constantly hate on this man they see as ruining their lives.  But how I ask? Fucking crickets. What has been so bad or so different this year than the last 16? I'm honestly asking. I don't see it. And I truly don't have a political agenda anymore, it left with the continual destruction of my ego. Can someone enlighten me?

       I don't doubt that Trump is another puppetdent in a long line of shitty puppetdents, but it is amusing that the "not my president" crowd who acted like his election was the end of the world don't seem so panicked and despondent anymore. They've probably gone back to watching their television shows and sports.

       I am a full blown libtard and while I have never been a panicked type because I've been completely cognoscente of the horse and pony show for almost 30 years, try spending some time in Liberal circles. They are in a living hell and they are still panicking. I try to get my thumb on the overall pulse of people which means I intentionally expose myself to both liberal and conservative thought. If you insulate yourself from liberal thought you might think they aren't panicking. Try watching MSNBC or visiting
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       and tell me they aren't.

       Overall I've never really thought the roll of the president really mattered that much more than being an ambassador to the world as a reflection of the average American. While I strongly disagree that the current POTUS does not reflect us as people I know the rest of the world knows that the way this guy acts is not who we are. I still believe most of us are compassionate and the popular vote is a reflection of that.

       It's funny to think of Trump as an ambassador of the common man of America. His life couldn't be more non-representative of mine or 90 percent of the people i know. I hope the world knows we the people are quite w9nderful

       I agree with you. And I am glad that this presidency has brought SO much into the public conscious that we were distracted from by Obama's pretty smile. It's one of the greatest things to happen in my lifetime I believe, and hopefully in the years to come will be a catalyst for real system overhaul

       Yes. Open corruption has the potential to be recognized, anger and outrage to be created, and ultimately revolution. Quiet sleeping corruption continues on while my fellow Americans are unaware. Can you imagine 8 more years of Obama??? And I voted for him !

       We already saw this show in 2001 after George W. Bush and his Supreme Court partisans, five of them, stole the election. Do you remember how crazy it was until September 11, 2001?

       What's changed is the MSM, who stayed mostly silent about corruption and scandals for the last 8 years, decided to go on full attack mode 24/7 about every little thing Trump does. Down to koi food and how he drinks from a bottle of water.

       It's rather disorienting I'm sure for anyone who wasn't already aware and was doing their own research about government corruption. I don't blame them for feeling like it's the end of the world.

       How about the vast upward shift in wealth we just witnessed last month? I don't get how half the country still thinks the POTUS is "their guy" in the WH. He displays obvious disdain for anyone who hasn't made millions--even though he was handed something like $100M from his father.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be rich too if my dad gave me $100M, or whatever it was. Trump like to brag about how he made his fortune off of a $1M loan from his father, but that's simply a lie. He dad gave him a loan AND he inherited his father's money when he died. So don't be fooled.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know politicians lie, but again, not all lies are equal. If you think attempting to impeach Bill Clinton was justified on the grounds that he said "I did not have sexual relations with ML," then it should be a slam-dunk impeachment if the POTUS (and the AG of the US) lie under oath about their dealings with a hostile nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put that to the side for now. Take a look at the increased debt load that the recent tax bill has put on the backs of the working people in this country: for the low, low price of
       <strong>
        $1.5 TRILLION
       </strong>
       we get to enrich the already wealthiest group of about 700 families in America. And that's just the amount that wasn't covered by cutting all the other former benefits of the tax code--like mortgage interest payments, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we just decided to give every capable man and woman in America FREE COLLEGE at state universities, it would cost about $67-70 BILLION. That's $0.067 TRILLION. Instead, we fill the pockets of the wealthiest and get nothing for it. Not only nothing, we actually pay out of our pockets to fill theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that we are not in a full-scale class revolution is a feat of the Public Relations industry. Edward Bernays would be blushing at the idea. That's my biggest criticism. All the other clownish (possibly treasonous) bullshit aside.

       You're missing the point. What could we fix as a nation if we all decided to spend $10TRILLION? Name a problem. We could probably log a significant change of course with a fraction of that cash. Green economy, global warming, solar for every home in the country, medicare for everyone, free college, (whatever pet program you can think of)....

       yeah, I get that. I agree that there could be much better things to fund and that oligarchs are currently the main beneficiaries of current govt taxation and spending.

      <p>
       It's just that sometimes I get the feeling that politicians float ideas like "free college" exactly because they want to keep them going as indoctrination centers rather than reforming them.

       That's fair, but I think the trade off of training a higher percentage of people to become critical thinkers is well worth some people who would be someone's ideological tool anyway becoming indoctrinated into academic dogmas. In other words, idiots will be idiots, but there are lots of unused brain cells in America that could be put to good use if they had access to higher ed.

       Depends on what you mean by "irresponsible." I thought invading Iraq and spending 16 years in Afghanistan was irresponsible, as well as subsidies for oil and gas companies, lack of regulations allowing $21Trillion in offshore accounts, FDA approvals of bullshit and/or harmful drugs, lack of consumer protections that allowed companies like MCI Worldcom and Enron to raid their pension funds, just as a few off-the-cuff examples. In other words, overtaxation to the middle class and undertaxation to the ruling class.

       If you want to fix wealth inequality it can't be done with an income tax. I wealth tax would be the way to go that's why they have so many wealthy people in support of higher income taxes. It don't really effect them.

       You might be rich if your father gave you $100M. There are plenty of examples of kids losing their families wealth. Not to mention lottery winners losing everything in a short period of time. I'm not saying that he worked hard in the pull yourself up by your bootstraps sense. Only that he did something to hold on to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tax thing appears to suck for sure. There are reports here and there that show it might not be as much of a break as first thought. I think the jury is still out on that. To many people quick to jump to conclusions to sensationalize the headlines, on both sides.

       You understand that free college for everyone would be a disaster. Look at high schools today, its good to weed out some people. Poor people can still go but they have to show a substantial amount of effort proving that they will make an effort once there. Not to mention if everyone went to college then it would be worth as much as a high school diploma. Although I would support free college as a replacement to what we have now. The current system has created a capital bubble causing the value per dollar to be less than in years past.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with this but disagree in that this is not new but has been a long time coming. Trump has only added fuel to the fire.

       No. The only thing that the jury is still out on is how x% of Americans still think the GOP is "lookin out for the little guy". They're not. Neither is Trump. If the GOP is telling you that cutting Medicare (for instance) is "good for American citizens," they mean .01% of the citizens--the ones who fund their campaigns. Not you. Not me. Not our grandmas. You can guarantee that the effects of this tax bill will be to make life unimaginably harder for the poorest people in the country and a lot more profitable for about 700 or so families that make up 90% of the wealth of this country.

       Right. Just like it's been a disaster in Western Europe? If everyone got smarter, yes, that would make it harder to be dumb. True. But that's a good goal anyway. You shouldn't want people to remain dumb because it would be hard on the dumb people to adjust. That's a pretty dumb approach.

       A tax cut at the expense of infrastructure spending is pretty short-sighted.  Raising the budget for the military industrial complex is pretty absurd.  Allowing net neutrality to end and allowing prison lobbies to run the DOJ is pretty egregious.   I’m not a big supporter of corporate stooges, Trump is exactly that.

       The minute Russia contacts your campaign about helping you win, you are supposed to contact the FBI...not set up a secret back channel so US intelligence can't figure out that you're sabotaging the country for personal gain.

       It seems simple enough. They run budget deficits year after year therefore they have debt. As far as I'm concerned the federal government has zero money. They are stewards of the money they force their citizens to relinquish control of. Not very good ones at that.

       This.  it's a new, common tactic used - put misleading or vaguely true statements in large lists as 'proof', collect upvotes for your effort and by the time its corrected, you will be already have been top comment and everyone will downvote or ignore correcting statements.   If the corrections do make headway, simply get into chain quote wars 'correcting' each other until its a mess and derailed all discussion anyways.

        Wasting money planning to build a wall that won't stop illegal immigration 
This is where people dont seem to understand Trumpian strategy... Just by TALKING about building the wall, he reduced illegal immigration substantially. The numbers show this - by being Hardline on the issue he essentially accomplished the goal without spending a dime...

      <p>
       I hate to use the term 4D chess, but while his opponents are fixated on "pffttt he wants to waste money on a wall to stop illegal immigration", Trump has already accomplished his goal and moved on. He does, however, need to keep up a little wall talk just to appease stupid people who think it's actually necessary...

       I think appointing individuals into his close cabinet who each have little to no experience in those fields (ex: Jeff Sessions, Rick Perry and Betsy DeVos). They’re lack of knowledge suggests that they will be making choices based on what benefits their own business ventures, not the citizens. One example is that college students under DACA may lose scholarships, while other students attending university under Pell grants may soon lose those under new tax cuts — both these actions affect large minority groups.
