    <div class="md"><p>If you want to be in compliance with federal regulations you shouldn&#39;t be anywhere near marijuana. As for possession of a firearm you would probably have to turn yourself in and I&#39;m not even sure what would happen with local authorities (if anything) were you in a legal state. Purchasing of a firearm may be more difficult depending on the state you are in and how in depth they are with background checks but I think that the disjunction that you describe between the state and federal level is exactly what is being highlighted by Sessions&#39; recent decision. Anyway, when states go recreational people won&#39;t be forced to carry registration cards (probably? I guess I could picture some dystopian state requiring a &quot;marijuana registry&quot; but lets hope not).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, personally, do not want more prisons. I am saying that privately run prisons get money from the government for every prisoner they jail. These government payments are supposed to pay for the food and housing, medical care, etc for the prisoner. However, the for profit prison model has driven down cost of providing for prisoners to the point where the company that runs the prisons makes money on every prisoner. </p>

<p>For example, say the government gives you $100 a day per prisoner for meals alone. You spend $50 a day on low quality food per prisoner.  You now make $50 a day per prisoner. </p>

<p>The prison industry is very very real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people,&quot; former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman told Harper&#39;s writer Dan Baum for the April cover story published Tuesday.
&quot;You understand what I&#39;m saying? We knew we couldn&#39;t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,&quot; Ehrlichman said. &quot;We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Nixon Era war on drugs (the first real crackdown on a federal level) was inherently racist. They specifically targeted poor urban communities that were primarily black, while also funneling drugs into the areas and limiting job and housing options for men. White people used drugs too, but only specific groups of them were targeted by the government. Namely, the hippies. Nixon was trying to heavily suppress the hippies because they were vocal opposition to the Vietnam War. Naturally the easiest way to squash opposition was to make (relatively) harmless drugs like cannabis illegal, and turn anyone caught with it into felons- thus making it impossible for them to vote.</p>

The fact is that illegal aliens provide a cheap source of labor and a way for companies to cut corners, which encourages them to keep compensation/working conditions low even for citizen employees because, &quot;hey joe if you don&#39;t like it jose will take your job tomorrow&quot;. They don&#39;t pay taxes, they commit way more crime proportionally than citizens do, and they send a ton of money out of this country and encourage their friends to come join them.

    <div class="md"><p>I read the article and one thing that stuck out was this. &quot;The worker demand is usually outpacing the supply&quot; which is a valid point I&#39;d think. It wasn&#39;t the resounding point of the piece but it definitely makes you think. Globalization/Capitalism has sped it up so much you gotta try to think of what the end game is. So is the issue the supply or the demand? Will we hit impossible standards eventually? Or the conditions surrounding both. Its not an easy question to answer and I don&#39;t expect an easy answer. </p>

<p>Former teacher:  money isn&#39;t the problem.  LA schools get much more money than the average school.  They not only get regular funding for a ton of students, but they get additional funding for lots of low-performing reading students, most of which are legal and illegal immigrants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>19-year-old here</p>

<p>In my state (IL) we took a few standardized tests in 5th grade, a couple in middle school (one was for placement IIRC), and then of course ACT and a couple others in high school. The SAT was optional, although recommended, but I never took it because I got kicked out of my home school and didn&#39;t want to bother with going back. I didn&#39;t plan on going to college.</p>

<p>Standardized tests left me with the impression that teaching practices were ineffective and the bar was set very low. As far as accomodation goes, not all students have the free time or appropriate home environment in which to do homework (or simply couldn&#39;t care less). In my case, I just didn&#39;t give a fuck because I thought homework was a joke, and drugs and reddit were a lot more fun.</p>

<p>Some people CAN do well without paying attention or doing homework, but their GPA suffers. I consistently scored very well on standardized tests, which isn&#39;t fair to students who try to comprehend material that isn&#39;t properly conveyed to them. On the flipside, my grades were shit-tier. I had trouble with regular math class because I had a shit teacher who was speaking another language I didn&#39;t understand. I wasn&#39;t the only one having problems with that class, and I have no doubts that I&#39;d fail every quiz from that class if you gave them to me today. Comprehension for topics for which you&#39;re forced to study is low. That&#39;s why some students score well on quizzes but fail end-of-chapter tests.</p>

<p>I think some subjects (advanced math, science, english) should be elective instead of being required. When the FUCK will I need to use trignometry, statistics, or calculus if I&#39;m going to end up as a QA inspector at an iron foundry?</p>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;m ranting. I just wanted to vent some of my frustrations with school.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completed high school early through an alternative school on account of me taking more classes than required throughout high school. I started working at near-minimum wage early last year a couple months after I graduated for almost half a year before I decided the mediocre cashflow wouldn&#39;t cut it. I desperately wanted out of my mom&#39;s house.</p>

<p>I lined up a job at an iron foundry and I&#39;m working there as a QA inspector. I was officially hired on a couple months ago, after spending three months as a contingent worker. I moved out of my mom&#39;s house in...October I think? Everything is going well. I have no problems paying the bills and making rent every month. </p>

<p>As far as my job is concerned, the labor is intense, it&#39;s usually hotter than hell, sometimes cold, dirty, the nights are long, and your respiratory health will definitely decline over time if you&#39;re not wearing a respirator. I didn&#39;t report my broken finger because we have a profit sharing program that awards bonuses based on plant yield and safety, and especially safety. The pressure to not speak up is enforced by the workers, not so much the company.</p>

<p>I know you didn&#39;t ask about specific details on my job, but I like to tell people about it. I take pride in the work ethic I&#39;ve been told I would never have, haha.</p>

CA spent $92.5 billion on K-12 education.  The expectex 1 billion in increased revenue from Pot , even if it were only spent on education (which it won&#39;t) would be 1% of budget.  These numbers don&#39;t i clude additional revenue for juco, state programs for college, waivers, etc.  Teachers average class size of 30 and average 60k per year = 2k per student.

<p>I work for a Jr. College and we just passed a 600 million bond election to expand the school and hire more administrators and build buildings. So we had our annual state of the union type deal where they laid out plans for the next year and beyond, passed out awards to faculty and staff, said goodbye to retirees and those who died, and finally announce the amount of raises we get. The last 8 or 9 years have been a steady 4% increase. They gave us 3.5% and their were audible groans, murmurs and chairs being pushed back as people got up and left. We gave them 600 million and we loose .5%. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>California spends about $11 billion on illegals and children of illegals, about 200 times as much money as is cited in the article.  A good chunk of is LAUSD.  They have also declared themselves a sanctuary school district so it won&#39;t change anytime soon.  That is how they have decided to spend your money.</p>

<p>Here is one source that has good information.  It&#39;s from 2008 so I suspect that the $11 billion number is actually less than today&#39;s spending.  You can also piece it together from other sources to confirm this.  It may take some work since this is a fact that California goes the extra mile to obscure.</p>

<p>In general, you have to find separate sources for education spending,and the number (or percent) of illegals.  Alternatively you can multiply spending per pupil x number of illegals.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s more than just looking the other way though. They are accommodating a new industry, collecting tax dollars and protecting it from other states. Under the 10th Amendment, states are supposed to be laboratories of innovation and the citizens vote with their feet. So the federal government has very specific delegates powers, like regulating commerce between more than one state and providing for the national defense, and the states have every power not specifically named, essentially.  So this situation is a natural incarnation of that. </p>

<p>But this is a theoretical model, Supreme Court decisions over the past two hundred years make it more complex. But I hope this makes sense </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. Stop defending the shill. When extremely negative and unnecessary rhetoric is spoken about the President, it&#39;s open to any kind of criticism. People want to bitch about not getting legal weed well, that&#39;s fine, but the alternative to possibly getting it wasn&#39;t worth it. I see more anger aginst the President than the fact that their ticket was stolen and that&#39;s half the problem. Instead of evaluating the failures of their party, they want to whine and complain about the President over every little thing. It won&#39;t get us anywhere closer to pot legalization and overall contributes nothing to the discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For three comments now you&#39;ve been providing nothing to the conversation, I&#39;m not sure labeling me a shill is appropriate here. You came to a legitimate comment that outlined the steps Trump could take to help the cause for legal weed, and remember he said the issue should be left to the states not the feds. Yet here we are with the Feds taking strict action on the legalization of MJ and you&#39;re talking about Clinton like it&#39;s some profound comment. Again the OP statement has nothing to do with Clinton, so why even bring them up?</p>

<p>It’s sad what happened to Bernie and his organic following. I’m not really a believer of the socialist dream but that man had something going and you can’t deny that regardless of how you feel about his policies.

<p>On Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked if President Trump agrees with Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ decision to rescind Obama-era federal guidance discouraging prosecutors from prosecuting certain marijuana cases in states where it is legal.</p>

<p>“The president believes in enforcing federal law. That would be his top priority, regardless of what the topic is, whether it’s marijuana or whether it’s immigration.” Sanders said. “The president’s position hasn’t changed, but he does strongly believe that we have to enforce federal law.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honest question: Why would alcohol lobbyists be against legalized weed? Plenty of people drink and smoke, and I have a feeling that if an alcoholic can smoke legally they most likely won&#39;t stop drinking alcohol because of it. Is it a worry that people will never start drinking because they have a healthier alternative?</p>

<p>Honestly don&#39;t know. There&#39;s some talk that there&#39;s huge issues with the public employees pension system eating huge parts of the budget but if that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s because of decades of mismanagement. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah Oregon has done similar in the past where a new revenue source, the lottery in the instance I&#39;m thinking of, would be dedicated to education and then ends up getting used for something else. </p>

<p>The reality is, since education is something people care about, it&#39;s the first thing they threaten to cut because they know people will accept a tax increase if it&#39;s &quot;for the kids&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not just &quot;the deal&quot; in CO, that&#39;s thanks to the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR). Every tax raised in Colorado has to be pre-earmarked for specific spending purposes, and all costs are published in public record. </p>

<p>Democrats hate it because it was passed by an (arguably very corrupt) Republican specifically to spite them; but it has been a godsend for the taxpayers of Colorado and efficiency of the state government overall. </p>

<p>There are some roadbumps; literally, like a hospital that couldn&#39;t use hospital funds to repair a road it relied on, but voters resolved this via referendum, it was paid for quickly with a 0.25% gas tax, and the tax went away after it was fixed. That would never happen in any other state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the <em>state&#39;s</em> door though. Does the state have a right to grant a license for something which is otherwise illegal?  I would be surprised if there&#39;s not some mundane example where a state is allowed to license something that federal law prohibits by default, and I expect something like that to be the basis of an argument that allows the states to at least have medical marijuana.</p>

It is important to note however that as far as the federal government sees things, in large part, historically how it has seen things-is that these state laws ending prohibition are in conflict with the federal laws which take precedent.

    <div class="md"><p>According to the vid, Sessions recinding the MJ policy basically puts the Congress in position to be forced to discuss the matter. Being as how this is just another regulation, if it does go to congress chances are they will vote to legalize it because both parties are in agreement at the moment that less regulation is a good thing. Estimated 60-70% chance this happens.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it, is this is a clever way for Sessions to not go against his &quot;integrity&quot; by still saying no to weed, but allowing confess to ultimately make the decision.</p>

<p>No Democrat in DC has made any serious legalization attempt in the last 10 years since Obama was elected, Democrat majority in House and Senate, and a bunch of states got medical/recreational use. </p>

<p>And Democrats don&#39;t ever want to support states rights trumping federal because states rights could work around any federal firearm bans then.  </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make sense. Legalizing pot at the federal level would remove it entirely from being a &quot;state&#39;s rights&quot; issue.</p>

Hurr durr. Colorado already spends a ton of money per pupil, let’s throw more money at the problem.
Hurr durr, lets have socialist projects to gentrify low income areas bulldozing small business and fucking over the same people who are paying a shit ton more for pot now.
Hurr durr, never mind the fucking fact that now that pot has been legalized, the criminal drug industry can no longer make money off it and has therefor flooded the streets with cocaine, fetanyl and meth!</p>

<p>I do not understand why anyone would be excited about the state spending their money. Everything the government touches is bloated with waste, mismanagement, and bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Given the freedom to do so people would renovate schools, run treatment programs, or do whatever else they want. </p>

<p>Most of you disapprove with the government massively. You don&#39;t like the wars, collusion with big pharma, FDA, actions of the police, etc. So why now do you approve of the government&#39;s actions? Would you not prefer the freedom to spend your own money, to improve society in the way you see fit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding marijuana, absolutely I disagree with him. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want the government choosing what I can or cannot put inside my body. Similarly, I don&#39;t want the government spending my money. </p>

<p>It&#39;s why this thread baffles me. You&#39;re celebrating one type of freedom (marijuana legalization), but at the same time advocating for less freedom (loss of ownership to the fruits of one&#39;s labor). </p>

<p>Taxes in California are insane. Why is anyone happy to see the government spending their money? Marijuana shouldn&#39;t be taxed. There shouldn&#39;t be any legislation. There shouldn&#39;t any be money going to schools. Unless there&#39;s something that absolutely requires government intervention for the common good the government can fuck right off.</p>

<p>What would those millions of people have done with that tax money were it left in their pockets? What businesses will never exist? What experiences will never exist? What has been lost only so the government can have their cut?</p>

<p>Our right use the plants of this earth is not something that can be given or taken away. It&#39;s always been our right. The only difference now is that in California when you use weed men with guns will no longer come to put you in jail. </p>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;m not impressed. Just because someone who was beating you over the head with a stick decided to stop for a moment doesn&#39;t mean you should thank them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you guys hoping for exactly?  You put it all on Trump but what did Obama do when this movement was growing quickly?  He cracked down on medical marijuana centers and wouldn&#39;t let banks accept legal marijuana business&#39;s money.  </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a partisan issue.  Obama had the chance to reclassify weed and he didn&#39;t.  Then he leaves office saying he should have like it was out of his control.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m usually on the &quot;you guys are being unreasonable with Trump.&quot;  But I fucking can&#39;t stand him for putting Session into power as Session is by far the worst thing about Trump&#39;s presidency.  Civil asset forfeiture and the war on drugs, two moron issues that this dude is in love with.  </p>

<p>But you guys need to stop this &quot;the otherside is way worse than we are!!1!1!!&quot; crap.  Sessions is at least doing what you&#39;d expect out of an old GOPer, Obama was suppose to be the man for change and he&#39;s was no better than a christian Neo-Con on many of these important social issues.  </p>

<p>If you want this to change, vote on a local level based on ISSUES not what color is next to their name.  At that national level they all start seeming very similar with minor differences and can&#39;t get much done.  At the local level weed has been legalized and needs backing to fight the federal gov into at least respecting their decisions.  There&#39;s too much money at the top for them to fight against all the lobbyist that desperately do not want weed to be legal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DEA is a branch of the executive, not congress.  If Obama had them reclassify marijuana then he could have effectively made it legal nation wide the same day.  </p>

<p>The reason I say go at the local level is because if the culture changes so dramatically the fed has two choices, stand firm and deal with the people rising up against it which results in shit like we had with gay marriage.  Which had less support than weed legalization as there isn&#39;t a big religious movement against weed, many people prefer not to use it and want their children not to, but they see the conflict of alcohol and tobacco being legal but weed not when the former two are much more dangerous.  </p>

<p>The other choice is the fed adjusts either directly by reclassification through DEA, law in congress.  Or if they want to be blameless to avoid voter backlash they let the supreme court deal with it, again like gay marriage.  This way they don&#39;t worry about being voted out of office by people who disagree.  BUT, if this changed at the local level, every state has legal marijuana usage, or at least decriminalization the perceived political backlash will be minimal, even favorable for passing laws at the fed that reflect what the states have done.   </p>

<p>Gay marriage took over once states started legalization, to say it wouldn&#39;t work for marijuana is just ignorant of recent history.  Politics is downstream from culture and politicians just want to keep their jobs.  If you change at the local level the fed is either going to adapt or die and they know it.  If every state has it legalized or decriminalized but the fed is still locking people up, eventually people will be getting voted out of office purely because they didn&#39;t do anything to change the law.  That&#39;s the change we should be looking for.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s much easier to change a local law than it is to vote out an incumbent congressperson.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>WRONG.  Its much much more complicated for an administration to remove or declassify a drug than for congress.</p>

<p><strong>Controlled Substances Act</strong>. Under this law, marijuana is listed as a Schedule I substance, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no current accepted medical use. Congress has the power to reschedule marijuana, either through new legislation specific to marijuana or through tailored amendments to the Controlled Substances Act.</p>

<p>Here is a link that shows why it&#39;s so difficult for the President and would NEVER EVER happen &quot;in a day&quot; : [How to Reschedule Marijuana]&quot;(<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2015/02/13/how-to-reschedule-marijuana-and-why-its-unlikely-anytime-soon/">https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2015/02/13/how-to-reschedule-marijuana-and-why-its-unlikely-anytime-soon/</a>)</p>

<p>Because I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll read it, In a nutshell, administrative rescheduling begins when an actor—the Secretary of Health and Human Services or an outside interested party—files a petition with the Attorney General or he initiates the process himself. The Attorney General forwards the request to the HHS Secretary asking for a scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation, as specified by 23 USC 811(b-c). HHS, via the Food and Drug Administration conducts an assessment and returns a recommendation to the Attorney General “in a timely manner.” The Attorney General, often through the Drug Enforcement Administration, conducts its own concurrent and independent review of the evidence in order to determine whether a drug should be scheduled, rescheduled, or removed from control entirely—depending on the initial request in the petition. That won&#39;t be done &quot;in a day&quot;.</p>

<ol>
<li>60% already approve of marijuana. But stones seem to be too unmotivated to march on Washington.  So politicians don&#39;t make it a policy front and with the Trump admins stance on it, it&#39;s not going to happen anytime soon. </li>
</ol>

<p>3.The Supreme court won&#39;t even hear a case, even on a &quot;states rights&quot; issue because the law has been clear for decades. The burden falls on congress, which could reclassify the quickest and the easiest. </p>

<ol>
<li>While I agree that marijuana acceptance has grown and has started locally, and that all politicians want is to keep their job, it&#39;s still going to take an act of congress to change things. This will ONLY occur if millennials and GenXers get out and vote out Boomers in 2018 and 2020. Period.  Changing local laws does nothing if the DEA can still override them.<br/></li>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re fighting really hard to shame this one off Obama. </p>

<p>That chart you put in is nice, but it all ends at the AG, which the president appoints.  The AG&#39;s decision is based on advice but it&#39;s his decision.  If Obama cared about this issue, if the AG had a different opinion Obama could just replace them with someone who wanted to legalize marijuana.  </p>

<p>In 2016, the process was followed and the DEA decided to keep marijuana&#39;s schedule I status.  Guess what, Obama is in charge of the DEA, it&#39;s a branch of the Department of Justice and under the executive branch.  The president can fire the head of the DEA and hire someone who supports his ideology, you know like how Trump fired Comey.  FBI is also a part of the Department of Justice and is under the executive.  So following the system that is in place, Obama just didn&#39;t have the right people in place to make the change. </p>

<p>Oh, you mentioned congress passing law.  Well, Obama had a Democrat congress for 2 years, it&#39;s how he got Obamacare through.  Marijuana, not important enough for him.  </p>

<p>I feel we&#39;re on the same team but your hang up is me calling out Obama and the Democrats when really it&#39;s 100% their fault.  This movement was starting up during Bush but caught full fire when Colorado made it legal at the same time Obama was voted into office.  Obama had multiple opportunities, in many different ways but never took them.  </p>

<p>Never mind Obama is known for expanding the power of the executive.  The dude was basically declaring wars on countries like Syria, Libya, Yemen and I think a couple others through drone bombing and supporting rebel uprising, but somehow he couldn&#39;t just strong arm departments that report to him?   I guess it&#39;s more important that the NDAA was in place than it was to give the people the legal right to consume a plant.  </p>

<p>More towards the local level, a little known thing that everyone forgets about is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification">jury nullification</a>.  So again, if you change the culture at the local level, so even more people find it acceptable, if a federal case goes in front of a jury of people who are against these laws and they come up not guilty, they can effectively change the law.  </p>

<p>So sure, keep talking to me like I&#39;m an idiot and fight hard to defend your team.  Before you start attacking the GOP thinking that you&#39;ll get me, I&#39;m not on either of your sides.  I hate the GOP for being so stupid with this issue and I hate the Dems for having the chance to change it and just acting like the GOP.  Shrugging off the blame like it was out of their control to get anything done.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It&#39;s simple. Which president has done more for Pots legalization and acceptance than Obama? NONE.  You&#39;re just butthurt that he didn&#39;t pass out joints at his inauguration party. You&#39;re making a case that Pot legalization should have been Obama&#39;s NUMBER 1 issue and that any political appointee should have been immediately removed if he didn&#39;t make weed like distilled water. </p>

<p>Again, Obamacare, affected 30 million Americans, but less than 10% smoke weed. But they&#39;re the same issue in your eyes. </p>

<p>I am all for legalization. I&#39;ve been to Colorado on April 20th. I&#39;ve been to Oregon and Washington State in 2017.  So we seem to be on the same team. But I am clear eyed that Obama advanced the movement further and NORML has been fighting for decades. Trump and Sessions is a major setback. </p>

<p>Do you invest in Marijuana stocks? I do. And now it&#39;s dead money until Sessions and Trump are out. It&#39;s just reality. </p>

<p>What you seem upset is that you perceive Obama to have had an opportunity to make weed like tobacco, and since it isn&#39;t he is a failure. I don&#39;t see it like that.

<p>This isn&#39;t saying much, most previous presidents were actively fighting it.  He wasn&#39;t actively fighting it as much, still went after medical dispensaries, made these legal businesses have to act like criminal enterprises dealing in all cash, traveling with former military security to protect them.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it should have been his #1 issue, stop strawmanning.  He had congress in his pocket for 2 years, never came up.  He had the AG which could have changed it at any time, especially in light of all the medical research coming from places like California, didn&#39;t.  The DEA had it in their lap to change it just before Obama left office, didn&#39;t.  How many chances does someone get until it&#39;s clear they didn&#39;t want to do anything?  </p>

<p>I also am very confused that you seem to be such a marijuana advocate, clearly a democrat or at least some version of lefty and throw this non-sense out at me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re just butthurt that he didn&#39;t pass out joints at his inauguration party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...I don&#39;t smoke.  I actually dislike weed and if it was legal I might buy it once to say I did (which I guess I could I live very close to MA) then never touch it again.  This isn&#39;t an issue of me getting mine.  This is an issue of me not wanting people locked up for smoking a fucking plant.  I never expected such a stupid GOP talking point thrown in my face from someone who is fighting so hard to make Obama blameless.  </p>

<p>Accept it, your golden boy had every opportunity in the world and he wanted nothing to do with it. Beside his interview of him saying he wished he did more as he was leaving office, is there anything to indicate he actually wanted it legal?  I mean the dude ran against gay marriage and it took Biden saying they were cool with it for Obama to get on board with it.  Obama seems like a fairly conservative guy and acted like one too.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly not trolling.  You picked your team and refuse to see your blind spot.  You bring up this complicated chart and try to dismiss that Obama could have done anything.  You praise his inaction as progress.  The only reason we got into this back and forth is because you couldn&#39;t accept my attacks on Obama as we both agree weed should be legal.  </p>

<p>Again, I hold zero love for what&#39;s going on now and Sessions is by far my biggest problem with Trump.  Most of the Trump hatred comes from his appearance, how he&#39;s twitting like a moron or the stupid things he&#39;s saying about other people and countries.  Sessions on the other hand is actively driving things backwards and making it worse.  </p>

<p>But I give no love to Obama for making it possible in the first place.  Obama was wrapped up nicely for me when he signed NDAA into law and said that he would never use it.  Obama had no problem extending the power of the executive to do evil things but when it came to him forcing issues that people actually cared about he was indifferent.  To him it was more important to extend wars into new areas when he got a Noble prize for his campaign promises of peace than it was to actually make policy that created more peace.  Like not locking people up for smoking a fucking plant.  </p>

<p>So, no, I&#39;m not trolling you.  I&#39;m just sick of this awful president who had amazing public speaking ability being able to give the illusion that he&#39;s an amazing man when when at best he&#39;s just a more liberal neo-con.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about Obama&#39;s Cole memo?</p>

<p>The Obama administration began issuing prosecution guidelines in 2009 and in 2013 settled on ones crafted by Deputy Attorney General James Cole. Cole’s memo basically left it to state and local agencies to enforce their own laws, while the feds would focus on marijuana when it was tied to gangs or drug cartels, violence (especially involving firearms), or was part of schemes to sell pot in states where it remained illegal.</p>

<p>Cole&#39;s memo urged federal prosecutors to use their own discretion. Giving a green light to Marijuana&#39;s current growth. </p>

<p>Executive orders have very little Teeth. But compared to what Trump has done in the 1st year, Obama is the real GENIUS. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t strike me as someone who would EVER be happy with a President.  You simply want your way with NO compromise, and that&#39;s now how politics works. at all. Ask Ted Cruz or Bernie Sanders. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sick of Trump too, but if this new book is any indication, the heat is definitely turning up, and Mueller seems to have a clear strategy that leads to money laundering for the Russians through Deutche Bank and implicates Jared and Ivanka.  It sounds like Trump has a 50/50 shot at making a full term. And I don&#39;t say that lightly or as a conspiracy left wing nut job. I truly think he is our generations Nixon and we are living in Historical times. I think that Trump will have dozens of books written about him, his campaign, his presidency and his Psyche. For decades.  Most of them NOT GOOD. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>...this is what I&#39;m talking about.  You say I&#39;ll never be happy by any president, which honestly is pretty true.  I mean right now Trump is the least evil president of my life time just because he has only had a year to go on compared to the rest having 8.  I digress, you&#39;re holding Obama up simply because he leaned on inaction for an issue that had a large movement behind it but he clearly disagreed with.  </p>

<p>Not it wasn&#39;t a priority to him, because if it wasn&#39;t he wouldn&#39;t have bothered with the memo, he didn&#39;t want weed to be legal.  Swallow that and let it sink it.  How many times does an issue have to come up before something is done?  He had 2 direct times he could have did something, when doing this memo and when it was in front of the DEA, no real change.  If it was at all important to congress they could have pushed it through a democrat congress and easily had it passed, nothing.  Obama didn&#39;t want to change the law, he wanted to hold his position without losing votes for his party.  Dance around that all you want but you&#39;re showing nothing that changes this. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I know very little to nothing about Cruz, but Sanders isn&#39;t someone who doesn&#39;t compromise the dude endorsed Clinton after campaigning saying she is basically what&#39;s wrong with politics today.  The dude basically threw his moral stance out the window to support his party and hopefully leverage it for something later on.   </p>

<p>I can also see that you really want me to be a normal GOPer for you to fight with because the Trump rant at the end makes zero sense.  You do come off as a conspiracy left wing nut job because I don&#39;t like Trump, I didn&#39;t remotely praise him nor am I saying he&#39;s better than Obama.  You&#39;re trying to make this a binary argument because it&#39;s easier for you to &quot;win.&quot;  I&#39;m not a republican and on social issues they are almost always 20-40 years behind so I&#39;ll never hitch my wagon to them on something like weed because they&#39;re still thinking about the &quot;this is your brain on drugs&quot; commercials from the 90s.  </p>

<p>Stop trying to wiggle out of it.  Obama is a social conservative.  That&#39;s why there were no changes to drug laws.  That&#39;s why there was no wide sweeping police or prison reform.  That&#39;s why his acceptance of gay marriage was basically forced on him.  Was there any social issue that he came out ahead of his voting block&#39;s outcries?  Every social issue I can recall off the top of my head of him being involved in were a reaction to something.  The only issue I remember him being the driving force behind, socially again, is like the Sandy Hook shooting where he went hard against guns.   </p>

<p>How old are you?  I&#39;ve lived through 8 presidents and it&#39;s not even close to how evil Trump is. His environmental orders alone put him at the top. Not to mention his human rights orders. If you aren&#39;t a white male, you don&#39;t exist.  I&#39;d love to hear you defend Trump on almost any of his policy decisions in year one. He is the worst in History. His entire policy is simply undoing anything Obama did , and the reasoning behind it is not policy based, but only to maintain is voter base. It&#39;s so wrong on so many levels it&#39;s insane. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t pretend, like you are, to understand or know what &quot;Obama wanted&quot;. All I know is what his actions were. Which was to actively promote the NON ENFORCEMENT of laws that you disagreed with. Significantly fewer people went to prison for Weed than under any other president. And he pardoned a ton of drug offenders too. So again, you&#39;ve got an impossible standard to meet for any president. </p>

<p>Cruz is hated in Congress for causing the shutdown over his lack of compromise. Sanders folded for the reasons you stated. But he read the writing on the wall. So maybe he is a pragmatist. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t care who you support or what party you affiliate with. I just want to uncover your thinking process. If it&#39;s flawed, then I&#39;ll expose it.  Right now you seem to not be very informed on politics. You don&#39;t even know who Ted Cruz is? Cmon. Did you even vote? You strike me as maybe a 30s millennial or an out of touch GenXer. </p>

<p>Haha. If Obama was a social conservative then Trump is what? Trump is a lifelong teetotaler!  But wait, he had 3 wives so he&#39;s just a conservative hypocrite.  Obama presided over gay rights, women&#39;s rights, drug rights expansion, immigrant rights. And Trump is actively fighting against ALL of those things.  So I&#39;m not sure which president that exists in reality you like? Again, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any person in history that can live up to what you expect a president to be able to accomplish.  He isn&#39;t a KING, he is but one among 1000s in government that affect policy decisions and passage. Maybe you don&#39;t understand that a president doesn&#39;t pass laws, or change them. AT ALL. Only congress can do that. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>...History?  Like all of it?  Wilson forcing us into WWI isn&#39;t worse?  Jackson&#39;s trail of tears?  LBJ for starting the drug war?  Nixon...enough said.  You don&#39;t want to come across as a crazy left wing nut but how in the world is Trump worse than these that are off the top of the head of a non-historian?  I&#39;m sure someone with much larger knowledge of the issue could ramble off hundreds of examples.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t pretend, like you are, to understand or know what &quot;Obama wanted&quot;.</p>

<p>Cop out.  Look at his actions and stop shrugging it off because you want him to be your savior.  You keep dodging all the opportunities he had and hanging all your hope on his decision of inaction on an issue he was aware was becoming a big one.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>So if I don&#39;t know everything you do I&#39;m completely uninformed?  This is stupid logic and makes the standard for what informed is impossible to meet because the line moves randomly.  Did you know about jury nullification?  Can I dismiss everything you say because you don&#39;t know about a basic right?  Of course not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Obama was a social conservative then Trump is what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...not a social conservative.  Trump is flamboyant, over the top, egoistical, throws his wealth in our faces, doesn&#39;t follow the norms of marriage and things related.  Thaddeus Russell even goes as far to say Trump is black.  He embodies black culture and is mentioned a ton of times in rap before his presidential run because of it.  That rappers would look up to him and want to be him.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama presided over gay rights, women&#39;s rights, drug rights expansion, immigrant rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He had nothing to do with gay marriage.  Again, he was against it.  He never advocated for congress to move on it, it was done by the states then the supreme court.  Would be the same thing as saying Nixon was the person to make abortion legal because Roe V Wade happened during his term.  No lefty is praising Nixon for his pro-choice outlook on life, nor should anyone be praising Obama for being at his post when other people did things.  With this logic of saying you&#39;re for something but doing nothing, Trump is our most gay-friendly president as he&#39;s the first to get elected believing gay marriage is acceptable.  How does that one feel?</p>

<p>What women&#39;s right issues did he fight for?  </p>

<p>You&#39;re putting a ton of credit into a memo saying don&#39;t arrest weed smokers, like a shocking amount to add it to this list next to gay marriage being legal.  </p>

<p>Immigrant rights huh?  Is that why he was labeled <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/national-council-of-la-raza-janet-murguia-barack-obama-deporter-in-chief-immigration-104217">the Deporter and Chief</a>?  <a href="https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report/2017/iceEndOfYearFY2017.pdf">Is that why deportations are down under Trump</a>? </p>

<p>You have to be trolling me.  I&#39;ve listed the ways Obama could have been directly and indirectly involved in changing the law in 3 ways, I think 3 or 4 times now.  This is what you come away with?  Are you just not reading what I said or is the cognitive dissonance too much for you that you literally cannot see the words because they disagree too strongly with your view of things?  </p>

<p>When World War I erupted in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson pledged neutrality for the United States, a position that the vast majority of Americans favored. Britain, however, was one of America’s closest trading partners, and tension soon arose between the United States and Germany over the latter’s attempted quarantine of the British Isles.</p>

<p>Did Obama propose building a physical WALL? Deportations Are Down Under Trump, But Arrests of Non-Criminal Immigrants Surge. </p>

<p>Your words, that I read, claimed that Obama could have changed everything &quot;in a day&quot;. That was a lie, a falsehood, not true. You really don&#39;t understand what the process was, or is, for doing it from the Administration side vs the Congressional side. So you keep repeating your beliefs, but I don&#39;t recognize them because you won&#39;t accept your own cognitive dissonance on this. Obama NEVER campaigned on legal weed. It wasn&#39;t even on his platform. Yet you wanted it to be legal for recreation on day 1 or else he didn&#39;t do enough for weed. I just don&#39;t think you even know your own position.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On May 7, the British-owned Lusitania ocean liner was torpedoed without warning just off the coast of Ireland. Of the 1,959 passengers, 1,198 were killed, including 128 Americans. The German government maintained that the Lusitania was carrying munitions, but the U.S. demanded reparations and an end to German attacks on unarmed passenger and merchant ships. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s believed that Wilson did this on purpose to spark favor to join the war effort.  Like it&#39;s a common belief at this point.  I mean he wanted into the war so badly that he did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_of_1918">things like locking up people for speaking out against the war.</a></p>

<p>Listen to Dan Carlin&#39;s Hardcore History episodes on WWI, as you needed to reference the history channel, I assume you don&#39;t know anything about it.  Carlin tries to paint Wilson in neutral light and the guy still comes out badly.  He&#39;s by far the worst president in US history.  It&#39;s the US&#39;s involvement in WWI that eventually lead to WWII.  </p>

<p>If you read the link, you&#39;ll see why LBJ did those things.  He was trying to buy the black vote.  He was a raging racist but knew that the black vote was up for grabs and social programs are a progressives best friend for buying favors and shaping cultures to their will. </p>

<p>Got you digging hard on history channel last night huh?  Weird that&#39;s your go to source.  Also weird that you think you need to mention these things and almost hope I don&#39;t have a good retort.  I have a special hatred for Wilson, FDR and LBJ.  I didn&#39;t feel like breaking down FDR as if you&#39;re a progressive I don&#39;t feel like fighting that battle as well as the Obama one.  You&#39;re holding on to Obama for dear life, I didn&#39;t want to find out if FDR is also a hero of yours.  </p>

<p>Then why are you not letting a single blemish stick to Obama?  The only people I see other&#39;s defending as strongly as you&#39;re defending him is religious figures.  You talk about him the same way someone would Jesus.  That he did no wrong and the things we perceive as wrong were for a reason or out of his control.  It&#39;s creepy and frankly the hero worship is scary to me.  </p>

<p>Uh...nothing?  He tried to ban transsexuals which was overruled by the courts.  So by your measures Trump is allowing transsexuals into the military.  That&#39;s how this works right?  Courts do something and the president gets all the credit?  Or is that not what you&#39;re trying to imply when you talk about Obama and gay rights? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now you&#39;ve got me confused. Are you saying you WANT weed smokers prosecuted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s nothing confusing.  My point has been consistent for like 4-5 posts now.  I&#39;ve spelled it out in multiple ways.  Let me do it again, maybe in your old age you&#39;re struggling to keep up.  If he wanted to change the law, he had 2 years with a democrat congress.  He didn&#39;t.  If he wanted to not make it as harsh federally he could have put in an AG that could have rescheduled it from schedule 1 to 2, putting it next to cocaine.  So at least medical dispensaries didn&#39;t have to worry about being raided, which happened often under Obama.  Towards the end of his term the DEA had the specific case of rescheduling on their agenda.  If he wanted it done he could have strong armed the director into doing so or fired him and replace him with someone who would.  He didn&#39;t.  1 direct chance to make the change as he&#39;s leaving office and 2 longer chances, one being 2 years with congress the other being 8 years with his AG.  Never was important enough for him to make actual change.  At some point you have to look at someone&#39;s half measure as a way to appease people without making lasting change.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did Obama propose building a physical WALL? Deportations Are Down Under Trump, But Arrests of Non-Criminal Immigrants Surge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Obama was great for immigration because Trump is arresting more and wants to build a wall?  This logic doesn&#39;t make sense.  Also like how you didn&#39;t mention any of Obama&#39;s fight for women&#39;s rights.  It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re just saying things that are opposite of Trump and saying Obama was known for them without any knowledge of what Obama actually was doing.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>claimed that Obama could have changed everything &quot;in a day&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even close.  2 years with congress.  8 years with his cabinet.  Then whenever he found out about the DEA having the rescheduling on the table until they made their decision.  Even if he didn&#39;t want full legalization he didn&#39;t have to go so hard after medical dispensaries.  A reclassification keeps it illegal federally but doesn&#39;t make doctors and cancer patients potential federal criminals.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet you wanted it to be legal for recreation on day 1 or else he didn&#39;t do enough for weed. I just don&#39;t think you even know your own position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know my position well, you&#39;re trying to strawman me to make it sound like I&#39;m saying it&#39;s his biggest issue or that he should have done it Day 1 or in 1 day.  None of these things I&#39;ve said and I&#39;ve clarified his timeline multiple times at this point.  </p>

<p>Again, if you can&#39;t have a discussion without misrepresenting my points then just stop responding.  If you don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m saying, rather than making wild assumptions, ask.  You know, how I asked for specific examples of what you meant by certain things.  I haven&#39;t been vague and I&#39;ve repeated myself many times by this point.  </p>

<p>If Obama wanted to changed federal policy on Weed all he had to do was use the Cole memo. Which he did, which changed policy. Just not permanently. Obama&#39;s weed policy effectively allowed the weed industry to bloom. And opened the door for the states that have recreational usage now. This is fact, it&#39;s not debatable. But what it seems from your stated opinion is that Obama didn&#39;t make those changes <em>permanent</em>. But nothing in Washington is permanent.  So at this point it seems that we have concluded our debate on Trump/FDR/LBJ and who are terrible people etc. I&#39;ll concede that we need to have a separate debate on the metrics of concluding what makes a &quot;bad&quot; president. But I&#39;m not interested.  The point I simply can&#39;t get my head around is how you feel that Obama was anti-weed.  So again, if Obama was anti-weed, which president has been pro-weed?</p>

<p>None.  It seems you need this to be binary and it&#39;s not.  Not a single president, to my knowledge, was ok with the population using drugs.  The main reason drugs are illegal is because they saw that the rebellious types were doing them so they saw it as an easy way to lock them up.  </p>

<p>I mean think about it.  LBJ hates black people but sees the writing on the wall that he can&#39;t leave Jim Crow laws or other obviously anti-black policy in place.  Black people generally aren&#39;t following the same rules of be a good christian man and work hard, instead they want to do drugs and not work.  So you make it a crime to do drugs and you can punish them according to what other people in that community want you to do.  The blacks that are trying to assimilate love that you&#39;re trying to &quot;clean up the community.&quot;</p>

<p>You hang your argument on Obama being the best but it really doesn&#39;t say much.  LBJ was racist and has the civil rights act in his name.  Obama was in place for a large revolution against the war on drugs and did nothing.  Even if he didn&#39;t want to out right legalize it he could have made medical marijuana allowable.  Again, weed is right next to heroin and cocaine is a better drug according to the government.  That&#39;s not a major change and doesn&#39;t really measure up to what the states have been doing but it&#39;s something. </p>

<p>Marijuana is moving forward despite the federal government and it&#39;s one of the largest political conflicts we&#39;ve seen since slavery.  But it&#39;s not about keeping people as slaves and isn&#39;t dividing our country between ourselves.  It&#39;s dividing our country between the people and the fed.  It&#39;s a conflict Obama had control over stopping and especially as Trump is rising up when the DEA had the chance for rescheduling, him not changing it was accepting that Trump might get in and make things worse.  </p>

<p>Our political leaders should be doing the will of the people and I get sometimes that can be conflicted.  Which it probably is for Trump as he&#39;ll be hearing from more social conservatives even though he isn&#39;t one, as that&#39;s who he&#39;s surrounded himself with and therefore who is in his ear.  Obama wasn&#39;t that way, he had a pulse on the social liberal movements in the country and he often spoke to them.  He ignored there outcry here and it might be another decade before real change comes in and could lead to even larger conflicts between the states and the fed.  I mean what if Trump starts threatening federal funding if a state legalizes weed?  </p>

<p>Nonsense.  Go read about the war on drugs.  Read about LBJ.  It&#39;s not a safety issue.  If it was there&#39;s no reason crack would have harsh sentences than cocaine, that&#39;s on purpose.  Guess who uses each type?  Blacks use crack, so put them in prison longer and cocaine is a drug of businessmen so that&#39;s a much lesser sentence.  </p>

<p>It has nothing to do with danger as many medicines are dangerous but a doctor doesn&#39;t face prison time for using it.  It&#39;s social control.  If you want to lock people up make the behaviors of those people illegal.  </p>

<p>How?  How is it even close?  A great deal of the reason there&#39;s a conflict over immigration is the war on drugs.  The two big reasons conservatives are for closed boarders is keeping their jobs (the stupid reason) and criminals coming across to sell drugs.  We&#39;ve spent trillions fighting the war on drugs domestically and aboard.  Have you seen Nacros on netflix?  Imagine if drugs were legal, how does any of that exist?  Where does the US and South American conflicts play out differently?  Immigration isn&#39;t on the same planet of an issue.  From every angle, immigration doesn&#39;t have the death toll or cost.  I can&#39;t think of a single metric it even comes close, no idea how you can say it&#39;s bigger.  Notice I gave examples and explained my point.

<p>We&#39;ve wasted trillions on the war on drugs. Yes. But that doesn&#39;t make drugs a good thing for society.  Nor is all that money a &quot;waste&quot;. It paid for police budgets, familys, communities etc. It&#39;s like the defense industry. Sure, we spend a ton on it, but what would all those people do if we got rid of it? </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to hear your argument for why Fentanyl should be offered on the shelves in WalMart though. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also curious why the Drug war is never mentioned in Presidential debates? Nor is it asked by reporters, nor is it discussed in press conferences. But Taxes, the Economy, Jobs, Immigration repeatedly top polls when people are asked about their top concerns. Drug legalization is NEVER in the top 5. WHy not?</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying that Drugs <em>should</em> be the biggest concern of all Americans because of the points you&#39;re making. But I&#39;m saying the reality is people care more about ISIS and terrorism, or Police brutality than drugs coming over the border . </p>

<p>I agree, but that isn&#39;t the movement behind Trump.  The movement he&#39;s hitching onto is the exact opposite, it&#39;s the working class that fear losing their jobs to that cheap labor.

<p>Never even tried to imply that.  I don&#39;t use any drugs.  The hardest I&#39;ve tried is weed.  I don&#39;t even drink.  People like to get intoxicated, we cannot stop it.  They cannot stop it from happening in prisons, places designed to prevent things from entering and leaving without permission.  Making it illegal is making something a person is voluntarily doing to themselves a crime and if someone wants to get high I don&#39;t see how anyone else&#39;s opinion factors in.  Even if it results in death.  It&#39;s for them and their family to deal with, not for society to ruin their life to help prevent them from ruining their life.  </p>

I take great issue with the media playing high and mighty but ignoring major issues like the domestic war and foreign wars.  Prohibition didn&#39;t work in the 30s, these morons didn&#39;t learn their lesson and are trying to convince us that it&#39;s not a complete failure this time around.  It&#39;s all playing out the same, except the gangs are much larger, much more violent and oh, the government found a way to get a cut now too.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_involvement_in_Contra_cocaine_trafficking">Like how the CIA was funneling cocaine into LA for the Contras.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_production_in_Afghanistan"> Also the odd coincidence that Afganstan became the largest manufacturer of heroin after we invaded.</a></p>

<p>There you go again, saying that a problem can be solved &quot;overnight&quot;. This is a much larger issue in our society. The Rich asset owners now gain more share of the profits than 30 years ago. Wages are kept artificially lower, hurting the middle class and leaving them open to inflation creep.

<p>As for the rest of your history of people being awful to other people. I used to think like you. I used to get so upset over all the injustice in the world. I still do, if I let myself. But the history of civilization has been injustice, abuse, horror, pain, selfishness and greed. People have been trying to &quot;fix&quot; things since 5000 years ago.  Now we want women to be &quot;equal&quot; and THAT will fix society. We want poor people to have a higher wage, and THAT will fix everything. Drugs being legal will fix everything. Guns being more legal, less legal will fix everything. And the truth is, it won&#39;t. People, humans, are the problem. We evolved and survived by living in tribes of 75-150 people. So most of our cultural and societal instincts came from that. But now we live in a global world and the internet allows me to talk to YOU in some other tribe in some other place. The tribes in the middle east have been killing each other for CENTURIES. The American Indians used to fight each other before the white man wiped them out. Nothing has changed except the tools for our greed, fear and selfishness.  So I don&#39;t think anything you or I propose or argue is going to solve that. </p>

<p>...which is why I&#39;m not arguing to fix society but to give everyone freedom.  That if people want to ruin their lives over time, so be it.  There&#39;s many drug users who live normal lives.

<p>How very conservative of you, but the reason they are wrong about this logic is if this is true it means the market is artificially high, not low.  For prices to be at their current levels it requires cheaper labor than what we currently have.  If you want higher wages you&#39;ll have to accept higher prices which then it comes out to a wash.  This is the exact reason I say if we got rid of minimum wage much of this problem could go away because people who wanted to work for that lower wage could and we could do without illegals.  There&#39;s a million other factors that go into the price and wage issue, but in regards to illegal immigrant labor, the minimum wage is one of, if not the single biggest issue.  Of course taxes, health insurance and other benefits factor as well.  Relieving that burden would allow employees to take home more money but go without things like vacation days, some people don&#39;t want that type of trade off and rather see it as built it and invisible.  Nothing is free though. </p>

Have you not been around alcoholics?  How sheltered is your life?  Do you think every drug users is automatically homeless and steals for their next fix?  Have you seen Wolf of Wallstreet?  Drug use is heavy in high stress jobs.  This isn&#39;t to say they are the best in their field, that they are great people or even should keep those jobs, but your statement is a wild assumption with zero backing.  If you can even find a source for it it&#39;s going to have a million qualifiers to make it extremely specific when you&#39;re using it incredibly generally. Also where&#39;s the source on normalizing drugs is part of the problem?  Again, go look at Portugal.  You haven&#39;t so you are making assumptions based on zero information and just going on propaganda that has been feed to you over the years.   Are you going to link Reefer Madness as a source to how normal pot heads act next?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You either don&#39;t know what libertarianism is or have been around progressives calling themselves libertarians.  Libertarianism centers around the idea that we cannot shape society to our will.  That giving people freedom to do what&#39;s in their own best interest will always result in a better society.  The main pillar of our beliefs is that we cannot solve societies problems, that society will evolve to solve the problems that it has no choice to or will die as a result of it.  That if drugs are a major issue that society will look for way to help their people get clean and avoid them.  That some politicians a thousand miles away cannot possibly know all the answers to why drugs are a problem and how that society can solve it.  And their attempts to solve it just end up creating new issues elsewhere and most of the time don&#39;t even solve the problem they set out to fix.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you think you know about libertarianism but your first quote sounds an awfully close to the same way I&#39;d talk about socialism and the second quote sounds like progressivism.  Libertarianism is pretty much the polar opposite of both.   We believe in individualism, socialism is centered around collectivism.  We believe in people&#39;s right to choose bad choices, progressives want to shape society to what they think is correct.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eliminating the minwage is another Libertarian fallacy. To start, it’s actually a bit of a leap to assume that just because existing businesses could hire cheap workers to do new jobs, they necessarily would. although the value of the minimum wage fell 32 percent during the 1980s thanks to inflation, teen employment actually dropped slightly.Because we have minimum wages today, businesses are required to work at a certain level of efficiency. Unless a business is understaffed, adding a new worker, even a cheaper one, might not be particularly profitable. the median front line fast-food worker today is 28 years old. Lowering their wage would have consequence on society. But a libertarian isn&#39;t concerned with that. </p>

<p>My point is that if only 1 out of 6 people are smoking pot, then it&#39;s not a <em>normal</em> activity for MOST people. You can&#39;t deny this. The only way you could is to redefine the term &quot;normal&quot; to include drug use. Which is not the case in most people&#39;s daily routine.  The rest of your rant is based on a fictional movie? Cmon. Even if based on true events they weren&#39;t even CLOSE to normal. Wild assumption with zero backing? How about your inference that most people in high stress jobs do cocaine and/or other drugs? Where is your research for that? Where are your citations?? Where is your back up? Since you want to turn this into a citation and notation contest, why aren&#39;t you holding yourself to the standards you hold me to? Fail. </p>

<p>I told you I have no desire to argue with Libertarians. I&#39;ve done it for years, and most of them, like you already, can&#39;t or won&#39;t see reality. This allows the idea of libertarianism to continue to live in your head.  Give me real world examples of libertarian societies! Central governments going away produce chaos! not order. Libertarians fail to realize that there has never been--and never will be--a government that functions according to their principles because it runs entirely contrary to human nature. I&#39;ll say this one last time on this topic. Read it and think about this:</p>

<p>The exercise of power by those in a position to wield it does not end with the elimination of federal authority: rather, it simply shifts to those of a more localized, more tyrannical, and less democratically accountable bent. Feudalism is the inevitable consequence of the decline of a centralized state.</p>

<p>Knew you&#39;d say this.  It&#39;s not based on a movie, it&#39;s to show that people are using drugs in high stress jobs.  It was made fun of in the movie but it doesn&#39;t take away from the truth of the actions.  Look how many athletes get pinched for drug use today.

We aren&#39;t saying they&#39;ll always figure it out and society will just become the best place ever without a government.  There will always be problems and if they can&#39;t figure them out they will die as a result.  We aren&#39;t seeking a Utopia, we&#39;re seeking freedom for people to find their own subjective utopias.

<p>The reason I&#39;m getting hung up on it is because you&#39;re using heavily refined stats.  It&#39;s not just &quot;here&#39;s something that happened in history&quot; it&#39;s &quot;here&#39;s exactly how many people are using drugs.&quot;  I&#39;ve interacted with both types of claims many times.  Someone saying something about history I know it&#39;s their interpretation and they are learning some someone who is explaining the source data a certain way.  They are just repeating someone else&#39;s information and it doesn&#39;t bother me as much to just listen and I&#39;d ask for a source more to learn more rather than fact check.  When going directly to the data though, it&#39;s another thing because you&#39;re interpreting data, you&#39;re drawing conclusions.   Meaning I either take you at face value or I see the data myself as your claims seem off.  When looking at the data it&#39;s important to factor who was studied, how many people, for how long, with what methods, what were the results and what were the researchers conclusions.  Each one of these stages can be wrong.  Just listened to a podcast by Malcolm Gladwell on Revisionist History called The Basement Tapes where he explains how difficult research can be and how people don&#39;t want like to accept research that is directly counter to their beliefs.  He explains how difficult each step of getting the results can be.  So you just pulling up random stats off the internet and not giving me any context means you&#39;re either trying to lie your way into a win, knowing something is fishy about the stats or you don&#39;t know how to interpret them, just see that it&#39;s a win for you and go with it.  </p>

<p>Like I said, hard stats and studies need sources because interpretation is important.  Do we really need to source that athletes are using drugs?  When hasn&#39;t that been a problem.  </p>

<p>This one is fair, mostly depends on the definition of common which really I don&#39;t know because that&#39;s an agreed upon type term and we&#39;re working all over the place so 10% of the population to me is common, but you&#39;re saying that 1/6th is rare.  </p>

<p>Huh?  Libertarianism is about how societies interact, not about the absence of them.  You get that there are rules and order in a libertarian society right?

Which could include everything from DUI&#39;s to cirrhosis of the liver. But in the context of our debate, we were talking about Fentanyl overdoses vs Alcohol overdoses.

And every individual in society is 100% informed about 100% of the products offered. </p></li>
<li><p>Everyone knows that <em>some</em> athletes do drugs. And everyone knows that that the Russians were banned for using illegal PEDs. But again, that&#39;s not the context of our argument. You said it&#39;s NORMAL for people to do drugs and live NORMAL lives. Olympic athletes aren&#39;t normal people. By definition. PEDs aren&#39;t even relatively NORMAL drugs! They aren&#39;t even recreational. So again, you&#39;ve accomplished your goal. Of taking the discussion so far out of context that you can book a &quot;win&quot; without ever addressing my point.  Which is that if drug use isn&#39;t done by almost everyone, how can it be &quot;normal&quot;?  I&#39;m conceding that <em>some</em> people are functioning alcoholics, and <em>some</em> people do narcotics and go to a job. But this is not MOST people, so it&#39;s not normal, AT ALL. </p></li>

<p>You missed my point here. It&#39;s concerning Libertarianism vs American capitalism/Democracy now.    In order to win over the hearts and minds of the majority of Americans with your Libertarian alternative,  you&#39;re going to have to show how it&#39;s going to provide a better life for them IN EVERY WAY. And if you can&#39;t, then it&#39;s just mental masturbation.  If people still feel FREE in todays society, then why would they change? Will Libertarianism provide them with more choices of toothpaste or streaming services? How about this, give me a couple examples of how your version of LIbertarianism will make America better for MOST people? Go for it. I&#39;m excited to hear them. </p>

<p>If there are rules in Libertarian society, who enforces them?</p>

<p>Even with a &quot;police state&quot; of America in place, people STILL murder each other, so why should I believe it will be LESS violent under your libertarian rules? There are MANY people who would murder and steal much much more if they could get away with it. </p>

<p>Or this:</p>

<p>What you original say is however you present the information means your correct.  Which by nature has to apply to me as well or you&#39;re trying to give yourself an unfair advantage, that you can set the parameters and I can&#39;t.  That you can go specific and general when you feel, but I have to stay within your guidelines which I have to constantly have you define.  </p>

<p>You understand the contextual nature of these things when we&#39;re talking specifics but you feel the need to start your reply by saying things are absolute.  Just stop and look at your arguments before you attack what I&#39;m saying when you a sentence later go on to agree with.  </p>

<p>Now to the content. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your 80,000 number is from somewhere (no source) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, again I&#39;ll hold myself to the standard I&#39;m setting.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics">https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics</a></p>

<p>Your Fentanyl argument, on your terms, tobacco still beats it.  Now if we set fentanyl to the standard you later try to get me to follow on the drugs in sports, as the drugs Russia are in trouble for are illegal in most countries without a doctor script, some even with.  Most versions of steroids aren&#39;t prescribed by doctors.   So this means you need to show numbers of people who have died from Fentanyl from purely unprescribed, recreational use.  </p>

<p>Do you now understand how impossible your restrictions are making this conversation?  It&#39;s easy to just change the parameters then claim I don&#39;t have a good response, but where is that getting us exactly?  What&#39;s the end point you&#39;re trying to make?   You&#39;re arguing below the line rather than above.  In otherwords, you&#39;re arguing the irrelevant details and putting greater importance on those than the larger argument of drugs, as a global term, usage in most situations.  Who is using them and how dangerous they are.  </p>

<p>A death from a drunk driver isn&#39;t less deserving of attention than a death from an OD.  Both were optional events that the user took part in where they didn&#39;t understand the potential harm of their actions.  If people are dying because they are being told to take too much fentanyl rather than deciding to take it when they shouldn&#39;t, then there&#39;s a different argument.  It&#39;s not the drug or user that&#39;s the problem, but the person prescribing them the drug.  </p>

<p>So if we really need to play this game, I&#39;ll humor you because seems I&#39;m still right. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm</a></p>

<p>&quot;Number of alcoholic liver disease deaths: 19,388&quot;
&quot;Number of alcohol-induced deaths, <strong>excluding accidents and homicides</strong>: 30,722&quot;</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re referring to this article (I&#39;m starting to feel like an idiot for doing your work for you, but guess I&#39;ll help the lazy)</p>

<p>Just need to point out that Fentanyl is a schedule II drug. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml">https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml</a></p>

<p>You know, below marijuana (not on that death toll list at all) and heroin, which is in 2nd place by 5k deaths.

Almost seems like the government has no fucking idea what they are doing with this scheduling and need to take a serious look at it huh?  </p>

<p>You&#39;re setting me up for failure by making it too board.  On top of that I&#39;m still not convinced you really understand what libertarianism is.  And let&#39;s just be honest here, what&#39;s the point?  You have as much bias against libertarianism as I do socialism.  I&#39;ll argue all day with someone about socialism but they&#39;ll never convince me that it&#39;s good, at best they could convince me there&#39;s good parts but never that the entity as a whole is good.  I won&#39;t be the college freshmen who were enlightened suddenly who want to share how great socialism is by yelling at people until they agree or give up.  I&#39;ll cut my losses.  I mean we&#39;ve been going back and forth for a week now and all major themes you&#39;ve just abandoned to focus on irrelevant details, why on earth would I start trying to convince you libertarianism is a good system.   You&#39;ve primed the conversation so I cannot possible win.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there are rules in Libertarian society, who enforces them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well to the vast majority of libertarians...the government.  You know, because they aren&#39;t anarchist.  Anarchist don&#39;t form political parties and run for office.  They separate from society and start their own communities.  Do you see any ancomms running for congress?  </p>

<p>If you mean ancaps, you&#39;re asking me to unpack an incredible complicated problem that much smarter people than me have attempted.  If you&#39;re genuinely curious I can point you to some podcasts I&#39;ve heard on the issue but I&#39;m not totally sold on anarchism so I won&#39;t make their argument for them.   Just like I wouldn&#39;t argue in favor of progressivism or neo-cons or socialism.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so why should I believe it will be LESS violent under your libertarian rules?</p>

<p>Well simply by ending the war on drugs violence would drop dramatically.  I know you hate my magic bullet arguments but it&#39;s fact, not theoretical.  </p>

<p>As you don&#39;t seem interested in looking up Portugal yourself, there ya go. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Somalia didn&#39;t have a central government but had civilization that devolved into a Warlord /Pirate economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, wanted to make sure that&#39;s all you listed.  You ignored some key points, like how they were a socialist country that was being raped by the rest of the world for it&#39;s resources and that it went into full blow anarchy.  Not that libertarians settled there, tried that form of government and it went to shit.  </p>

<p>Got another example or are they all based on failed socialist countries that fell into anarchy, which again there&#39;s a vocal branch of anarchist in the libertarian wing, but the left has the same thing and the right does kinda.  The right&#39;s &quot;anarchy&quot; is a little different as somehow the party of small government&#39;s radical wing becomes fascism and nationalism, which is strange.  But I&#39;m all over the place.  Somalia is a better example of the evils of imperialism or the failures of socialism.  To call it libertarianism is to just associate all forms of anarchy with us which means you don&#39;t actually understand anything we stand for.  We&#39;re more socially liberal than the left and we&#39;re more fiscally conservative than the right, not all of us are anarchist.  </p>

<p>If you want my exact beliefs, I think the federal government should be the smallest and weakest form of government.  It&#39;s job should be to be the glue holding states together, acting like a toothless EU basically.  That cities and counties should have the most power as they are directly connected to the people they are serving and can shape the society to the will of the people actually living there.  I don&#39;t think a congressperson from California should be telling a district in Maine how they should live.  Vastly different cultures and require vastly different needs.  My biggest hiccup with being a full ancap (anarcho capitalist, or what you think we all are...I think? you still talk like we&#39;re socialist) is I don&#39;t know how a criminal justice system works on a scale of 350 million people without it being somewhat centralized I also don&#39;t know how we pay for it without theft from someone.  I&#39;m open to a good idea but all the ones I&#39;ve heard seem lacking as criminal justice was my major in college and I know how incredibly complicated it is and I think non-criminal justice types over simplify it too often.  </p>

<li><p>I&#39;m not really interested in arguing about arguing. </p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t see the distinction in the link you provided for alcohol related deaths.  I want Alcohol poisoning. compared to Fentanyl ODs. It&#39;s that simple. We don&#39;t need to debate if a person was prescribed by a doctor or if they are life long drinkers.  Also, has anyone overdosed on Tobacco?  So again, I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d include it in the debate. Fentanyl having only ONE overdoes &quot;beats&quot; tobacco overdoses. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>While I agree that drunk driving deaths are important, this actually makes a case against your argument that drugs should be unregulated in Society.  I think that my point can be summed up more succinctly: Drugs lead to the early death of MANY people, therefore they should be tightly controlled. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If your point is that the drug scheduling in America is &quot;messed&quot; up. Then yes. I agree. But only in that. Not that the solution is to make all drugs available over the counter. </p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t bring up Obama because it&#39;s a dead point at this end. You&#39;re never going to see it my way, so why should I beat a dead horse? You&#39;ve admitted that NO PRESIDENT EVER can live up to your expectations so why try? I&#39;ve already clearly, shown you, with the Cole memo, why Obama is the most lenient president on marijuana over the last 50+ years and it&#39;s still not enough for you. So why keep going? The Cole memo exists, Sessions threw it out. But somehow Obama should have could have done more, which makes him anti-pot. I don&#39;t know how to reason with someone so unreasonable on this point. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>As far as libertarianism goes, great. I don&#39;t need to argue it anymore either. If you want to throw up your hands great. I win. I simply wanted examples of your thought process and the reasoning behind how or why America should switch from it&#39;s current democratic system to your ideas. But you dont&#39; feel like offering any for debate and scrutiny. fine. great. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Responsible anarchism sounds great, on paper. But in reality humans simply don&#39;t behave in the needed ways. Capitalism plays better to human behavior.  That&#39;s my problem with Libertarianism. It requires the average citizen to be 100% informed of 100% of all things, all the time. </p></li>
<li><p>In Portugal, drugs aren&#39;t legal.  Those caught with drugs are hauled before a ‘commission for the dissuasion of drug addiction’. They may not get a criminal record but they can be fined, placed on a compulsory treatment program, or even have their passport confiscated. </p></li>
<li><p>17 years after Portugal changed it&#39;s laws, have they cured drug abuse? No. Not one bit. Some studies point to increased abused. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/01/20/133086356/Mixed-Results-For-Portugals-Great-Drug-Experiment">link</a></p></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re more socially liberal than the left and we&#39;re more fiscally conservative than the right, not all of us are anarchist. </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>So , like, you love Rand Paul?</p>

<ol>
<li>Finally, on your views. Good luck. But you&#39;re not realistic. 2 senators from Nebraska, can affect EVERYONE in the country right now. And limiting government is a joke as both parties support bigger and bigger government. They only disagree on who gets the perks.  Rand Paul is your hero then? But even his policies have real world implication problems.  Personally, I feel that we are at a generational war point.  Baby boomers have stolen the future from GenX and Millennials and I don&#39;t really care WHO you vote for as long as they are under 60. There are going to be some tough choices coming for future reps and leaders, and I want them to represent MY interests and not the boomer generation. WHich has only shown interest in protecting and benefiting itself at all others expense. </li>
</ol>

<p>So you&#39;re still in your 20s or early 30s?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Then why are we continuing this?  At this point it&#39;s devolved into an argument about specifics and semantics.  If we aren&#39;t going to get on the same page then we&#39;re going to keep throwing out things that are true in their own context but the other person is going to disagree with the context.  That&#39;s what most of your reply ends up being in fact. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want Alcohol poisoning. compared to Fentanyl ODs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I want deaths from Fentanyl ODs from purely recreational use.  If you can put arbitrary qualifiers, so can I. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drugs lead to the early death of MANY people, therefore they should be tightly controlled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And my point is the current methods of control are doing absolutely zero to stop this and creates more problems as people fear getting help, use dirty needles, fear being locked up for long periods of times, it&#39;s the main reason for most gang violence.  It didn&#39;t solve the problem, it created a black market. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But only in that. Not that the solution is to make all drugs available over the counter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you talk about being reasonable and compromise but why wouldn&#39;t you clarify which drugs should be schedules as what, which should be legal or any thing like that?  I&#39;m cool agreeing to give more than we have, I&#39;m not all or nothing as you&#39;re coming across in this comment.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t bring up Obama because it&#39;s a dead point at this end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve explained my point from multiple angles, I&#39;ve given solid reasoning and examination.  You&#39;ve retorted by just bringing up the memo as if it has any lasting effect.  You also act like someone taking a half measure means they are in total support when I gave good examples of how Obama is a social conservative.  You&#39;re response to that was to laugh and ask about Trump, deflecting to something easily winnable because you don&#39;t have a good rebuttal to the issue at hand.  I bring it back up because that felt like a dominating win and shows how you&#39;re the one unrelenting as you just choose to ignore issues you can&#39;t argue well enough. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve admitted that NO PRESIDENT EVER can live up to your expectations so why try?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have no empathy.  Think about it this way.  You&#39;re a democrat.  Imagine every president ever was a republican or another party that is counter to your beliefs.  All they do is enact policies that are directly counter to all your most important values, whatever they might be.  Would you compromise and say one of them is good by your standard?  If you do what do any of your values mean if someone can act in direct opposition to them and you still be in favor of that person.  It&#39;s why I have so much contempt for Sanders.  Hillary was the exact type of person he was preaching against and he folded in hopes of staying in good favor with the party for future success.  He is an ideology who will push his ideas to the side if they will interfere with his career advancement.  If he was to win, all of his policies would be watered down and toothless.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you dont&#39; feel like offering any for debate and scrutiny. fine. great.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have, I&#39;m just not going to go so general when I&#39;m not an academic, nor a policy wonk.  It&#39;s not my job to set up the transition and imagine what the end game is, in fact my beliefs are directly opposed to that type of thinking.  I think there are steps we&#39;d need to take but the philosophy centers around freedom and letting people figure things out in their own ways.  I have given you some of my beliefs so don&#39;t pretend like I&#39;m just straight up ignoring the issue entirely.  I mean the last paragraph if my previous reply is how I&#39;d prefer society to be governed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Responsible anarchism sounds great, on paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are you talking about?  Are you trying to force me into the anarchist box against my will?  I&#39;ve said multiple times that I&#39;m not an anarchist, nor are all libertarians.  Should I just start calling you a communist because communist are a wing of the left?  Stop type casting me to make dumb arguments.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism plays better to human behavior. That&#39;s my problem with Libertarianism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Number 1 sign someone doesn&#39;t have a clue what they are talking about.  Capitalism is an economic system, libertarians have opinions on how they want that run, specifically a unrestricted free market, but libertarianism isn&#39;t an alternative to capitalism, it&#39;s a political system.  The reason for this confusion is because of socialism as that is an economic AND political system.  Under libertarianism the economics that most people deal with wouldn&#39;t change, under socialism they change radically.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Portugal, drugs aren&#39;t legal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say they were.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those caught with drugs are hauled before a ‘commission for the dissuasion of drug addiction’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So at this point you&#39;re just trolling right?  It comes off as you trying to get away with a lie.  If you just kept reading, a common feature you come with, laser focus on what proves you right and ignoring the part that makes your ground shaky. </p>

<p>&quot;The committee has the explicit power to suspend sanctions conditional upon voluntary entry into treatment. If the offender is not addicted to drugs, or unwilling to submit to treatment or community service, he or she may be given a fine.&quot;</p>

<p>Because getting treatment or a fine is totally on par with 5-10 years in prison.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>17 years after Portugal changed it&#39;s laws, have they cured drug abuse? No. Not one bit. Some studies point to increased abused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...who in their right mind thinks we&#39;re &quot;cure&quot; drug abuse?  Cigarettes are legal and one of the most harmful things you can put in your body.  We&#39;ve spent 20-30 years and millions, maybe even billions of dollars at this point educating people to their harm.  Cigarettes are taxed almost $10 a pack in some places.  People still smoke.  You don&#39;t &quot;cure&quot; drug use, you remove the optional and additional harms that take a potential life ruining problem and make it a guaranteed life ruining thing by throwing them in prison just for consumption.  </p>

<p>Also if you&#39;re going to use studies, don&#39;t use ones that are closing in on 10 years old.  It takes multiple years for them to gather the data and process it.  Then it takes 2-4 years to get the research published and reviewed.  If you&#39;re lucky that data is coming from 2005-2008 range.  I can&#39;t seem to find it, but there was a chart I saw that showed murder rates went up after the decriminalization and just started to fall back to what they were before the new laws in recent years, like 2015-16 type recently.  An article from 2011 is years away from seeing that end result.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So , like, you love Rand Paul?</p>

<p>Rand Paul is a conservative with some libertarian leanings.  I like him sometimes and other times I don&#39;t, like most politicians, but he does end up on my &quot;like&quot; list more often than not.  I wouldn&#39;t say I love any politician.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Duh, it&#39;s why I&#39;m torn which party is absolutely worse as republicans are saying one thing and doing another while democrats are trying to warp society to their will, even if the people don&#39;t want it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rand Paul is your hero then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol I just figured it out.  I have you over a barrel over your Obama worship and you&#39;re desperately trying to find someone comparable that I&#39;ll defend religiously.  You won&#39;t find it and if you do you won&#39;t know enough about them to out argue me as you&#39;ll be going off strawmans built with the intention of discrediting them.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Baby boomers have stolen the future from GenX and Millennials and I don&#39;t really care WHO you vote for as long as they are under 60.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, totally makes sense in an election where it was Bernie Sanders, Clinton and Trump as the front runners, all young politicians.  -.-</p>

<p>As for the future being stolen, ya it was stolen in the form of debt and the generations after them&#39;s answer has been to spend even more and put future generations into an even worse spot.  A significant portion of our annual budget is going to paying off the interest on the debt.  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stancollender/2017/10/22/the-trump-budget-legacy-a-permanent-1-trillion-federal-deficit/#43968aa87a65">There&#39;s talk of a $1 trillion deficit annually moving forward.</a>  That has to be paid off and your generation (assuming your gen X or you&#39;re talking shit about your own generation) and mine have decided to put the problem off on our children and grandchildren to figure out. </p>

<p>So don&#39;t act all high and mighty as it&#39;s not like any generation has done anything but make the problem worse.  </p>

<p>I never said it was. But don&#39;t imply that Portugal is just fine with drugs being over the counter. They&#39;re not.

<p>Isn&#39;t Obama the best president for women&#39;s rights (gave no answer to how), gay rights (done against his will), drug rights expansion (minimumal effort that I still argue was for political capital which is why it was a half measure, again he attack dispensaries viciously in his first term) and immigrant rights (which another one you didn&#39;t have a good rebuttal too, just said Trump is arresting more so therefore Obama is good I guess?).  Follow the consistency of your own argument.  This conversation started because I attacked how Obama handled this issue and you defended him on every single thing I brought up.  You didn&#39;t concede a single point.  If you don&#39;t want to appear to worship Obama then don&#39;t start talking about how he was great on every issue and how he&#39;s the best we&#39;ve ever had.  </p>

<p>Means that it&#39;s artificially over priced which is a big problem with the prescription drug market and why people want stuff like being able to buy drugs from out of the country to drive costs down.  I guess you just don&#39;t know why black markets come into existence.  In places where cigarette prices are reasonable there&#39;s limited to no black market, in a place like NYC where they are taxed $10 a pack people sell loosies and get choked to death for selling them.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s stuff like this that makes me want to end this.  This is normal political horseshit where you&#39;re playing to an audience to make it seem like I&#39;m saying something I&#39;m not when you know full well I&#39;m not even remotely saying this.  You&#39;re purposely being a troll.  If you want to continue a civilized discussion I&#39;m down but if you just want to be a cunt I&#39;m out. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Monopolies exist until someone else finds a way to compete.  We haven&#39;t had any monopolies without government restricting competition.  <a href="https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Standard_Oil#Other_important_points_of_note">Standard Oil was never a true monopoly even though it&#39;s the poster child for it, only getting to 88% market share and was already down to a 64% market share when they went to court for Anti-Trust violations.</a> </p>

<p>Workers and consumers made out much better than they did prior to these companies coming into existence.  We look at shit like children working in factors compared to now forgetting that people would have large families to have their kids all work on the farm.  That the kids are working so they don&#39;t starve to death, not because the parents wanted to sit at home and be lazy.  </p>

<p>I won&#39;t act like any company is perfect but to act like some of the largest advancers of society were objectively evil is idiocy and I&#39;m sick of seeing it accepted as common knowledge.  If the environment is a as big a concern as you made it out to you, then you should praise people like Rockefeller for how much he lowered the need for killing whales as that was what people used for lamp oil before.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Instead of a bunch of people who don&#39;t know your culture or life voting on what you can and can&#39;t do, it&#39;s more localized and people can live whatever life they choose too.  Come together and form whatever society under whatever rules they decide as long as it&#39;s voluntary.  Also we aren&#39;t a democratic society, we&#39;re a republic. </p>

<p>Sigh, you just are not understanding anything I&#39;m saying if this is what you come away with.  I&#39;m compromising when I say take that money saved from locking them up and spend it on rehab.  My actual belief is let them die in the streets as it&#39;s their choice to do so.  That if people feel in their hearts to help them through charity, I&#39;m all for it but it shouldn&#39;t be done by tax dollars.  People should have the right to ruin their lives and kill themselves in horrible ways.  That the government isn&#39;t our parents who are here to punish us into doing the right thing.  Especially when that punishment can end up having a harsher effect on your life than the act it&#39;s punishing, a felony is much worse on a resume than saying you&#39;re a recovering addict.

<p>What&#39;s inherently different between the types of things each generation wants passed?  I think you&#39;re hanging this entire argument on that but really don&#39;t see that it doesn&#39;t matter.  The issues that really matter are the ones that are destroying our future, which are locking up people unfairly, all the generations belief that to different degrees.  The wars aboard which are spending our money to shape countries in our image even though it&#39;s just causing more hatred for us leading to more problems for the future.  And spending future money for improvements today and of course they don&#39;t actually solve the problems.  Obamacare is an example of something designed to fail, has insane costs and doesn&#39;t give the same coverage that people would want out of a government insurance program.  The only thing that really divides the generations is some social issues, but as for most policy they&#39;re on the same page.  Government is good, spend more today/fuck tomorrow, kill brown people locally and globally.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boomers don&#39;t care, they&#39;re on their way out. And they&#39;d take it all to the grave with them if they could</p>

<p>...what is different about your generation or mine?  The ones that want Obamacare even if it makes life more expensive and adds to the deficit.  The ones who take a tax break that is going to add a ton to the deficit.  The ones who want free tuition, health care or whatever other entitlement program people can come up forgetting nothing is free.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get you people who put everything on a single generation but can&#39;t point to anything that&#39;s actually different about the generations.  The only differences I see are cultural which those are changing.  Your generation couldn&#39;t imagine gay marriage being legal, or buying pot legally.  Stop pointing the finger at others and realize that you&#39;re just as much part of the problem.  </p>

<li><p>What divides the generations? A) Taxes. The older Boomers, who control the most wealth, want to KEEP it, and not be forced to spend it on roads, bridges, education and high speed fiber internet. Why? Because they&#39;ll never see the benefit. Instead, they want to focus on Old People Welfare, aka Social Security. Which is insolvent by 2034. The year that the last boomers die off. The boomers simply do not want to spend ANY of their money on anything that doesn&#39;t give them immediately benefit. Not the environment, not the infrastructure, and not education. They want THEIR taxes lower at the expense of future generations loss of purchasing power.  The social issues you mention are all BULLSHIT. They&#39;re a distraction from the upfront THEFT that is taking place right now by boomer legislators and boomer CEOs, which run most companies. and control 80% of elected offices.  wake up. If you actually read and knew what was in the latest tax bill , you&#39;d be aware of this. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Obamacare is an attempt to mitigate the growing healthcare crisis. Nobody else has offered ANY alternative solution. NONE. The rising healthcare costs could not only bankrupt the US but crash the global economy. Obamacare was an attempt at a single payer system where the government could negotiate lower costs. It was kneecapped by the healthcare lobbyists and drugmakers. It&#39;s been sabotaged ever since. Who is your healthcare through?</p>

<ol>
<li>Deficits in self-control were not limited to the sexual and marital. Perhaps the purest example of self-control and foresight is <strong>saving</strong>, the denial of pleasure now in favor of security later. This proved almost impossible for the Boomers, whose inability to save represented yet another radical break from earlier generations’ practices and ultimately required them to plunder the accounts of other generations. Here is a link to a book that spells it all out for you quite clearly why the BOOMERs alone are responsible for the current state of crisis we are in. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Generation-Sociopaths-Boomers-Betrayed-America/dp/0316395781">A generation of Sociopaths: How the Boomers Betrayed America</a> . It&#39;s free from Audiobooks.  Impressively weighted with hard numbers and specifics, the volume serves as both an indictment of and rebuttal to a Woodstock Generation that has gleefully celebrated themselves for decades while gradually running the country into the ground. </li>
</ol>

<p>The reason you &quot;don&#39;t get&quot; why people place blame on the boomer generation is because you simply don&#39;t know the facts, or you&#39;re too arrogant to think you can be misguided. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I have no interest to trade insults.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then stop.  You&#39;re purposely twisting my words.  Should I just roll over and answer seriously?  You keep replying, I&#39;ve shown how I respond if you&#39;re going to be a cunt I&#39;m going to call you on it.  I&#39;m long winded. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>SO save your arrogant attempts to show how much you learned in college.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I learned exactly zero of this in college.  I wasn&#39;t a history or economics major, I already said I was a criminal justice major.  I went to a small college and both my professors (we only had 2 full time ones) were against marijuana legalization.  Portugal was having it&#39;s first analysis of it&#39;s stats from it&#39;s recent change when I was at school and my profs couldn&#39;t be less interested.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m going to try and keep these short. Because you go on too much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you have very little to say in response and your entire angle at this point is to attack semantics and ignore the overall point.  Like your weed/president question.  It&#39;s irrelevant to the discussion of whether or not Obama specifically had any interest in legalizing weed but he technically wins being the &quot;most&quot; in favor because he had a popular uprising coming against him.  If there&#39;s anything a good politician knows how to do it&#39;s get behind a popular movement.  Isn&#39;t it weird that Hillary was against gay marriage for her entire 30 year political career until this last election?  Of course she is the most pro-gay marriage candidate now right?  That&#39;s how that works? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he term &quot;artificially high&quot; is a vague value term that places your opinion on the current market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s vague about it?  The price is much higher than people are willing to pay so rather than doing it the legal way they burden themselves with the risk of fines or prison time to get a cheaper price.  In the case of Eric Garner the dude was killed for trying to supply cigarettes to people at reasonable prices.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on the failure of libertarians to win elections, most people seem quite content with taxation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because the libertarian party is fighting to be seen as the cool guy in the middle of the two parties bickering.  Ron Paul ran as a republican remember?  Gary Johnson wasn&#39;t say taxation is theft, which is a common phrase thrown around <a href="/r/Libertarian">/r/Libertarian</a>, he was pushing for a flat tax.  No one votes for us because we come across as weak democrats and weak republicans, the party is doing an awful job of showing the country our values which is why there are so many of us divorcing ourselves from the party.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Natural Monopolies exist. Read them.</p>

<p><a href="https://mises.org/library/myth-natural-monopoly-0">https://mises.org/library/myth-natural-monopoly-0</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>So again you start by saying one thing then do the complete opposite.  &quot;Don&#39;t insult me...you moronic child!&quot;  This isn&#39;t a rebuttal, it&#39;s your opinion of a topic you aren&#39;t even bothering to consider.  You even conceded the point to me somewhat.  Are you saying it&#39;s better than a congressperson 3000 miles away decides the rules of your county or should you and the people who live there do?  The question becomes why aren&#39;t all?  If this is too difficult of a question for you just ignore it like everything else I&#39;ve stomped out of not answering.  It&#39;s your favorite &quot;I got nothing&quot; answer.  Or I can just start throwing insults back at you, I warn you I&#39;m much better at it than you&#39;ve been so far, just like arguing and understanding all these topics.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re arrogant to think this type of thinking would EVER produce a better society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the problem.  You keep thinking I&#39;m trying to do something.  The people will have the society they desire, it would be better or worse based on how much time, effort and desire they have for it.  I&#39;m NOT a central planner.  Libertarianism is about individualism.  Socialist countries centralize the control and decide who gets what and how much with the guise of improving society, to eliminate waste.  Progressives want to &quot;nudge&quot; society in &quot;better&quot; directions to improve things and create more problems than their solutions were intended to correct.  Central planning always fails, at best it drives a society backwards, look at the black community which by all metrics was better off during the 50s, you know during Jim Crow, than it was now.  Pick up Black Redneck, White Liberal by Thomas Sowell if you&#39;d like to see how.  At worse, it kills MILLIONS of people because important things like food don&#39;t get where they need to be.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The older Boomers, who control the most wealth, want to KEEP it,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ya...they&#39;re mostly retired at this point so what taxes are you wanting them to pay?  Also everyone should want to keep their money.  Are you paying more taxes than you&#39;re asked to?  If not you&#39;re a hypocrite.  You should be giving every penny you don&#39;t need to the government to help fund the projects you want to see completed.  Why are you so apt to spend other people&#39;s money? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because they&#39;ll never see the benefit. Instead, they want to focus on Old People Welfare, aka Social Security.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we agree we should get rid of social security?  Boomers are the last generation to get it so everyone under 60 doesn&#39;t get social security.  I&#39;m down for it, are you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They want THEIR taxes lower at the expense of future generations loss of purchasing power. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see nothing to suggest this is limited to only Boomers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re a distraction from the upfront THEFT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, taxation is theft, we should abolish the income tax first. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you actually read and knew what was in the latest tax bill , you&#39;d be aware of this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another insult in the &quot;don&#39;t insult me&quot; reply.  What exactly about the tax bill am I suppose to see baby boy?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obamacare is an attempt to mitigate the growing healthcare crisis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in (to my knowledge) every metric it&#39;s making it much worse.  Not only is it driving prices up but insurance companies are leaving the program because they can&#39;t afford to stay in.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody else has offered ANY alternative solution. NONE. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This that hero worship again?  I thought you were old?  Obamacare is a version of Mitt Romney&#39;s bill.  Hillary&#39;s bill is said to be the reason that democrats lost so badly to the GOP which brought in Bush.  I mean, you lived this shit, it&#39;s just slipping your mind?  I was only 2 years old when it happened for god sake and it feels like yesterday!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was kneecapped by the healthcare lobbyists and drugmakers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was written by lobbyist and drugmakers.  Still can&#39;t get insurance over state lines, that drives prices down.  Can&#39;t get drugs from different countries, that drives prices down.  Insurance agencies were suppose to get huge reimbursements from the government, they&#39;re dropping out because the government is refusing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This proved almost impossible for the Boomers, whose inability to save represented yet another radical break from earlier generations’ practices </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re doing nothing to show the difference between your generation and the boomers.  I&#39;m not saying boomers are a good generation, stupid people can only think binary, I know it&#39;s hard for you but stay with me here.  The boomers AND the generations that follow can be bad.  </p>

<p>So what is your generation doing different to improve the situation?  40-60 year olds are in politics, you can&#39;t just act like all policy is being done by Boomers now, many GenXers voted for the tax bill.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason you &quot;don&#39;t get&quot; why people place blame on the boomer generation is because you simply don&#39;t know the facts, or you&#39;re too arrogant to think you can be misguided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I &quot;don&#39;t get it&quot; because you&#39;re awful at arguing a point, spew off some rehearsed shit that you read somewhere that doesn&#39;t entirely apply to the questions I&#39;m asking and then demand I unpack and explain your stupid rebuttals back to you.  You keep trying to call me a child but this child has a much better understanding of economics, history and even politics it seems.  Anything that&#39;s not on whatever news channel you watch just doesn&#39;t exist in your reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and yet you&#39;re name calling persists. It&#39;s because you&#39;re out of arguments. so you name call and insult. It&#39;s fine. it&#39;s indicative of your intelligence level. </p>

<p>You had 2 professors? Total? It was a REAL college right? It wasn&#39;t Clown College? Or Mime school? LMFAO. Did you guys have nap time?</p>

<p>So you&#39;re from Portugal? I&#39;m unclear on that point. Or did you just study it&#39;s drug laws in one of your &quot;classes&quot;? </p>

<p>I have plenty to say. I just don&#39;t think you warranty the energy or the knowledge. You&#39;re an arrogant child.</p>

<p>A) So we AGREE! Obama is the most Pro-weed president ever. ! damn you&#39;re a stubborn one. B) Hillary isn&#39;t a candidate anymore, so you&#39;re wrong again.</p>

<p>Eric Garner was killed because he was obese and resisted arrest. He was also BREAKING THE LAW. But you keep defending criminals. It&#39;s a week point.  People would love to pay NOTHING for marijuana,  but that doesn&#39;t mean any price above NOTHING is &quot;too&quot; high. You don&#39;t understand economics. The black market exists because they are subverting the law and the true cost of production. Which includes TAX.  What is your current job? </p>

<p>The underlying concepts are dumb. Not just the candidates, which are horrible. Flat tax is regressive, and punishes the poor. It&#39;s dumb. Ron Paul came off as a nut. Whenever a libertarian candidate tries to offer an economic model, all the economists laugh them off the stage. It&#39;s pathetic. </p>

<p>You&#39;re article sucked. It was based on turn of the 20th century examples. Outdated analogies, and just bad economics. But I would love to agree that Comcast needs more competition, &quot;in theory&quot;, it would be great for consumers. in theory. The mating call of the libertarian. &quot;but but but in theory.....&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re not &quot;much better at it&quot;, you&#39;re just giving it your full attention, I&#39;ve got 10 other conversations going concurrently, and they are all infinitely more interesting than this cafeteria style conversation we are having. You haven&#39;t earned my full attention . And most likely won&#39;t, until you clean up the bullshit. I&#39;m much better at this than you. I&#39;m stomping you. I&#39;m awesome and Frolf. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love for to expound on some meaningful insight into your claim that blacks were better off under Jim Crow, that is something interesting. Go on.... </p>

<p>The boomers have CHANGED the tax laws to benefit themselves at the EXPENSE of future generations. It&#39;s THEFT. The only reason that have been able to do this is because of NUMBERS, their cohort numbers are too large for anyone else to matter. So they kept &quot;their money&quot; at the expense of infrastructure, education, defense. You may not believe it, but things in this system need maintanance, and that costs money. It has to come from somewhere. The many wars that boomers have started cost TRILLIONS, where is that money talleyed? Off the books of course. Not counted in our National Debt. The financial crisis? Caused by boomers, who methodically changed the regulations to allow it to happen. So private risk was offloaded to the public. And the public PAID for the consequences. In bailouts. BILLIONS in bailouts, voted for by boomers, to bailout boomer run companies. You didn&#39;t have a say in ANY of that. You were still in highschool. You were to busy learning how to wipe your nose to pay attention to what happened. You didn&#39;t even study it in college. </p>

<p>Boomers should NOT get Social Security. It wasn&#39;t designed for people who didn&#39;t need it. They should be confiscated and put back into the system to make it solvent and function as it was intended. For people who become to sick or injured to work, for the elder poor, who can&#39;t work and/or maintain a standard of living in old age. Why should anyone worth $100,000+ get social security?  The boomers think they&#39;re entitled to it. Newsflash. They&#39;re NOT. we should take it away and lower it to minimal levels. But YOu are suggesting exactly what I said, Boomers, on average paid into SS about $750,000. But on average will take out of SS about $1.5 million. So who pays for the excess? We do. why should we? </p>

<p>A simple google will provide source reading. </p>

<p>&quot;I see nothing to suggest this is limited to only Boomers. &quot;</p>

<p>Keep looking.</p>

<p>&quot; we should abolish the income tax first. &quot;</p>

<p>Then who will pay for the boomers benefits?</p>

<p>The tax bill, my son, is a giant GIFT to the Corporations and the boomers who control them. Paid for over 10+ years by you and me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And in (to my knowledge) every metric it&#39;s making it much worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is due to Republican sabotage. Not flaws in Obamacare. Do your homework. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obamacare is a version of Mitt Romney&#39;s bill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. I&#39;m not hero worshiping Obama, I&#39;m blaming those that deserve blame. YOU. You haven&#39;t offered a better alternative. You. You haven&#39;t given me your version of healthcare in the world that works best. I&#39;ll wait....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still can&#39;t get insurance over state lines, that drives prices down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Economists disagree. This is a red herring. Man health insurers already do business in multiple states under different entities, but you&#39;re just regurgitating sound bites now. This is why I don&#39;t want to waste time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&#39;t get drugs from different countries, that drives prices down</p>
</blockquote>

<p>W. Bush signed a bill that RESTRICTED the fed from negotiating drug prices. WHY?? Hmmmm. use your melon. </p>

<p>Adn TRUMP stopped payments. why? To sabotage Obamacare, as I said. </p>

<p>All people can be &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot; however you define those words. But my point is very clear. The boomers inherited a very strong and young country. And instead of passing it on, they milked it and abused it. It&#39;s still in their hands, so it&#39;s impossible for other generations to act the same, because no other generation has the control or power or money they have. Impossible. But if you look at the previous generation to the boomers you see very different behavior. Less divorce, less drug use, more savings. Gen X and Millennial actually have higher savings rates, less drug use, and better relationships than boomers. Boomers get divorced in later stages of life more than any previous generation. Read the book for source. They are unethical, narcissistic and emotion driven, not empirically driven. </p>

<p>Because you&#39;re young and stupid, I&#39;ll repeat myself again, Boomer still control 80% of elected posts. We have no say yet. This is why I said, vote R or D as long as they&#39;re under 60. </p>

<p>I have degrees and licenses in finance and economics. So again, you keep trying to convince yourself that you know enough. You&#39;re convinced that you&#39;re smart, but being smarter than your friends doesn&#39;t make you a genius.  What I could easily do is copy and past your last paragraph and claim the SAME exact sentiment.  You&#39;re awful and arguing a point. You spew off some rehearsed college lecture and it doesn&#39;t entirely apply. You keep trying to call me a cunt, but this cunt has more experience with econ, history and even politics. I actually WATCH the news on a daily basis on a screen bigger than my iPhone.   Mic Drop. bitch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Care to elaborate? To be clear, you’re saying that Wikileaks has confirmed that there’s good cause to believe qanon when he says to trust that sessions isn’t zealously gunning for potheads? Because this was your claim which I called bullshit on. Unless you’re somehow going to provide a link showing that sessions’ decision wasn’t intended to reafffirm the draconian federal stance on marijuana then your reply falls flat and I can assure you that my face has not been rubbed in anything but your own mental shortcomings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I did call you delusional, for believing an anonymous 4chan posters’ assertion that AG sessions was to be trusted on the marijuana issue. Trusted in such a way that one would have to disbelieve his self professed long standing prejudices on the subject. Have you encountered anything substantial that backs up this assertion? If not, then whether qanon is larp or not (if not, I would be wrong on that point), I stand by my claim that you’d have to be delusional to trust sessions on this issue despite his open convictions because someone on the internet named qanon said to.
Go back to your original post, you’ll see that the original point of contention between us is over sessions’ trustworthiness on marijuana, not qanon’s true identity. You should be able to grasp this as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People act based on the information available to them and how it incentivizes them to pursue their interests.  During an already chaotic time that is also producing the lowest approval rating in history at this point of an administration, why would an embattled AG push forward a policy that is highly disliked across the polical spectrum?  I mean we know he loves his private prison donors, but he is freely moving forward with draconian immigration policies and enforcement to keep their facilities full.  This move will clearly further harm his standing as AG.  Trump already said he would have picked someone else had he known Sessions would recuse.  So, what non-Russia, non-investigation related topic would cause more negative feedback about the AG than rescinding the Cole Memo?  I can’t think of any.  </p>

<p>So ask yourself... Why this topic, and why now?  Surely you see the desperate barage of polarizing policies? (MAGA people refer to this as the Trump Train, others see it for what it is).  Everyone acts logically when you understand their end goals and the information set that defines their perception of a situation.  What makes this a logical PR move right now?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a PR move. It&#39;s strategic. Sessions can&#39;t back down from his principles. Like or dislike him, he sticks to his principles. He can&#39;t just come right out and say let&#39;s legalize pot. More than this, even if he did, it&#39;s still on the books which will just cause headaches down the road. The only <em>true</em> way to solve this is by getting the legislature to step in and do their damn job. </p>

<p>So how does he go about this? Well a plurality if states are already legalizing it, the national conversation has like 80-90% of people saying to just legalize it already. The argument is over. America wants pot to be legal, safe, and rare (lulz). So now we are in a situation where states have legalized it and the federal government has it condemned. We are in a good old fashioned states vs fed battle now. So sessions doubles down, says he&#39;s going to ignore all the wrist slapping and go hard in the paint. This puts the ball completely in the legislatures court. They are going to need to get off their asses and act.</p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t believe me, here&#39;s your boy Barry O saying exactly this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-its-congress-change-how-feds-cla/">During an interview aired Jan. 31, 2014, CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Obama whether he would consider changing marijuana’s status as a Schedule I narcotic, a distinction that bans the substance from sale or use for medicinal or recreational purposes.
&quot;Well, first of all,&quot; Obama contended, &quot;what is and isn&#39;t a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress.&quot;
&quot;I think it&#39;s the (Drug Enforcement Administration) that decides,&quot; Tapper offered.
&quot;It&#39;s not something by ourselves that we start changing,&quot; Obama replied. &quot;No, there are laws undergirding those determinations.&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying that Sessions is doing this now surreptitious attempt to force Congress to legalize it?</p>

<p>If that were the case, why this week with everything else and the large discussion around his potential departure being mired in Russia/Obstrucion related tones?  Why is this the right timing for that?  Keep in mind, nothing in my original point argues against Sessions being honestly against legalization and I assume he actually does want to enforce the federal laws on the issue.  My point was that if those were his goals, this is a garbage time to accomplish it and is beyond idiotic from a PR/politics standpoint.  What explains the behavior is an attempt to attract controversy that would shield from obstruction discussions. </p>

No more &quot;I will vote yes on your bill to further militerize the police if you add some language that guarantees we get some more highway funding next year&quot;. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what this is really about.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>And how much crime is legal weed causing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>States that legalize actually have less crime in average after legalization. Even the police in colorado have admitted that crime rates drop after legalization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Denver saw a 2.2 percent drop in violent crime rates in the year after the first legal recreational cannabis sales in Colorado. Overall property crime dropped by 8.9 percent in the same period there, according to figures from the Drug Policy Alliance. In Washington, violent crime rates dropped by 10 percent from 2011 to 2014. Voters legalized recreational marijuana there in 2012.</p>

<p>Medical marijuana laws, which have a longer track record for academics than recreational pot legalization, are also associated with stable or falling violent crime rates. In one 2014 study of the 11 states that legalized medical pot from 1990 to 2006, there was no increase in the seven major categories of violent crime and “some evidence of decreasing rates of some types of violent crime, namely homicide and assault.”</p>

The vote based on hate/fear/jealousy and willing to sacrifice American institutions for the sake of a senile puppet of a foreign leader is something I&#39;ll never understand and just have to pity and cut out from my life. I don&#39;t vacation in red states anymore, don&#39;t visit that side of the family, and am happier for it. You guys have your klan meetings or accuser house burnings or whatever you can go to, don&#39;t need my presence or money, the welfare red states steal more than enough of my tax money as it is. </p>

<p>I will side with the right wing though if they want to cut Medicare and social security for all current seniors. They have plenty, protect the systems for the future generations that are being left fucked by the right. If we need to let the boomers go to get Medicare for all, the health of future generations is worth it. </p>

That&#39;s its idealized version; the reality of the situation is that the &quot;war on drugs&quot; is a source of near-endless arrest and jail revenue, great crowd control via propaganda and fear mongering, and an extremely effective tool for protecting those in power and their investments. &quot;&quot;In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.

    <div class="md"><p>Ive been thinking with the legalisation of cannabis, its a fantastic time for rehabs to start focusing on their future cannabis addiction programs. I&#39;ve had many many friends go in to treatment for cannabis addiction, and the amount of mental suffering they experience to get off cannabis it is very different and very intense, I was in for alcohol addiction, so I got mainly physical withdrawal, and a few days of mental anguish, but with cannabis the mental anguish seems to take months to heal. But im sure the rehab programs are currently frothing at the mouth with the number of new cannabis admissions they will be getting in the near future</p>

<p>So although im glad that schools are getting the attention they need, funding into treatment programs, drop out and bullying seem to show that hidden message of where cannabis addiction can lead many people. I would also suggest they put money into suicide and depression programs, and regaining cognitive skills</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the 8 million is for extra after school programs and actually paying the teachers what their time is worth?</p>

<p>After school clubs really help bring kids out of their shells sometimes and paying the teachers for extra time might help kids who have a really crappy situation back home.</p>

<p>The problem with letting kids be kids, is sometimes kids can be absolute asses, really go over the top with bullying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, personally, do not want more prisons. I am saying that privately run prisons get money from the government for every prisoner they jail. These government payments are supposed to pay for the food and housing, medical care, etc for the prisoner. However, the for profit prison model has driven down cost of providing for prisoners to the point where the company that runs the prisons makes money on every prisoner. </p>

<p>For example, say the government gives you $100 a day per prisoner for meals alone. You spend $50 a day on low quality food per prisoner.  You now make $50 a day per prisoner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re fighting really hard to shame this one off Obama. </p>

<p>That chart you put in is nice, but it all ends at the AG, which the president appoints.  The AG&#39;s decision is based on advice but it&#39;s his decision.  If Obama cared about this issue, if the AG had a different opinion Obama could just replace them with someone who wanted to legalize marijuana.  </p>

<p>In 2016, the process was followed and the DEA decided to keep marijuana&#39;s schedule I status.  Guess what, Obama is in charge of the DEA, it&#39;s a branch of the Department of Justice and under the executive branch.  The president can fire the head of the DEA and hire someone who supports his ideology, you know like how Trump fired Comey.  FBI is also a part of the Department of Justice and is under the executive.  So following the system that is in place, Obama just didn&#39;t have the right people in place to make the change. </p>

<p>Oh, you mentioned congress passing law.  Well, Obama had a Democrat congress for 2 years, it&#39;s how he got Obamacare through.  Marijuana, not important enough for him.  </p>

<p>I feel we&#39;re on the same team but your hang up is me calling out Obama and the Democrats when really it&#39;s 100% their fault.  This movement was starting up during Bush but caught full fire when Colorado made it legal at the same time Obama was voted into office.  Obama had multiple opportunities, in many different ways but never took them.  </p>

<p>Never mind Obama is known for expanding the power of the executive.  The dude was basically declaring wars on countries like Syria, Libya, Yemen and I think a couple others through drone bombing and supporting rebel uprising, but somehow he couldn&#39;t just strong arm departments that report to him?   I guess it&#39;s more important that the NDAA was in place than it was to give the people the legal right to consume a plant.  </p>

<p>More towards the local level, a little known thing that everyone forgets about is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification">jury nullification</a>.  So again, if you change the culture at the local level, so even more people find it acceptable, if a federal case goes in front of a jury of people who are against these laws and they come up not guilty, they can effectively change the law.  </p>

<p>So sure, keep talking to me like I&#39;m an idiot and fight hard to defend your team.  Before you start attacking the GOP thinking that you&#39;ll get me, I&#39;m not on either of your sides.  I hate the GOP for being so stupid with this issue and I hate the Dems for having the chance to change it and just acting like the GOP.  Shrugging off the blame like it was out of their control to get anything done.  </p>

<li><p>I&#39;m not really interested in arguing about arguing. </p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t see the distinction in the link you provided for alcohol related deaths.  I want Alcohol poisoning. compared to Fentanyl ODs. It&#39;s that simple. We don&#39;t need to debate if a person was prescribed by a doctor or if they are life long drinkers.  Also, has anyone overdosed on Tobacco?  So again, I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d include it in the debate. Fentanyl having only ONE overdoes &quot;beats&quot; tobacco overdoses. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>While I agree that drunk driving deaths are important, this actually makes a case against your argument that drugs should be unregulated in Society.  I think that my point can be summed up more succinctly: Drugs lead to the early death of MANY people, therefore they should be tightly controlled. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If your point is that the drug scheduling in America is &quot;messed&quot; up. Then yes. I agree. But only in that. Not that the solution is to make all drugs available over the counter. </p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t bring up Obama because it&#39;s a dead point at this end. You&#39;re never going to see it my way, so why should I beat a dead horse? You&#39;ve admitted that NO PRESIDENT EVER can live up to your expectations so why try? I&#39;ve already clearly, shown you, with the Cole memo, why Obama is the most lenient president on marijuana over the last 50+ years and it&#39;s still not enough for you. So why keep going? The Cole memo exists, Sessions threw it out. But somehow Obama should have could have done more, which makes him anti-pot. I don&#39;t know how to reason with someone so unreasonable on this point. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>As far as libertarianism goes, great. I don&#39;t need to argue it anymore either. If you want to throw up your hands great. I win. I simply wanted examples of your thought process and the reasoning behind how or why America should switch from it&#39;s current democratic system to your ideas. But you dont&#39; feel like offering any for debate and scrutiny. fine. great. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Responsible anarchism sounds great, on paper. But in reality humans simply don&#39;t behave in the needed ways. Capitalism plays better to human behavior.  That&#39;s my problem with Libertarianism. It requires the average citizen to be 100% informed of 100% of all things, all the time. </p></li>
<li><p>In Portugal, drugs aren&#39;t legal.  Those caught with drugs are hauled before a ‘commission for the dissuasion of drug addiction’. They may not get a criminal record but they can be fined, placed on a compulsory treatment program, or even have their passport confiscated. </p></li>
<li><p>17 years after Portugal changed it&#39;s laws, have they cured drug abuse? No. Not one bit. Some studies point to increased abused. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/01/20/133086356/Mixed-Results-For-Portugals-Great-Drug-Experiment">link</a></p></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re more socially liberal than the left and we&#39;re more fiscally conservative than the right, not all of us are anarchist. </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>So , like, you love Rand Paul?</p>

<ol>
<li>Finally, on your views. Good luck. But you&#39;re not realistic. 2 senators from Nebraska, can affect EVERYONE in the country right now. And limiting government is a joke as both parties support bigger and bigger government. They only disagree on who gets the perks.  Rand Paul is your hero then? But even his policies have real world implication problems.  Personally, I feel that we are at a generational war point.  Baby boomers have stolen the future from GenX and Millennials and I don&#39;t really care WHO you vote for as long as they are under 60. There are going to be some tough choices coming for future reps and leaders, and I want them to represent MY interests and not the boomer generation. WHich has only shown interest in protecting and benefiting itself at all others expense. </li>
</ol>

<p>So you&#39;re still in your 20s or early 30s?</p>
