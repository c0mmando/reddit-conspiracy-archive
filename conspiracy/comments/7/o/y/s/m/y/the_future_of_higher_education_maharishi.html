       I'm in community college right now and I plan on going into the environmental science field (yes I know most of you don't think college is worth it but this is a stem/sciency field)...but most universities with Env Sci degrees focus on chemistry or physics, which is not what I'm interested in at all... Not to mention taking five classes at a time is rediculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       This college however, you have the option to create your own major, and instead of juggling four or five classes you take one per month. Transcendental meditation is part of the curriculum...all of their food is organic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm seriously considering this place, what do you guys think? Would you go here?

       Weird, we're both right! HLC is subsequently recognized by DOE. Cool!
      </p>
      <p>
       Still wary of the school because it breaks with educational norms, though that alone shouldn't serve as a deterrent in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if it wasn't accredited, imagine going into a job interview after working your ass off for four years just for the interviewer to tell you your degree doesn't mean anything in their state, or even though the state recognizes it, it's not recognized on a national level, so it's meaningless. It would hurt to potentially have all that work invalidated, which is precisely why I was so quick to scrutinize the school.

       Maybe talk to an admissions officer and triple check for good measure?

       This reads like someone who has a kinship with state, and already established universities.

       Considering the sub, considering how a fair amount of us view the official histories, IF we want to change the system, why cater to their standards? Their exceptionally corrupt, questionably accurate, standards?

       Most jobs want a degree to prove reliability. Unless you are in a highly specialized field, a bachelor's in finance, or a bachelor's in economics reads much the same.

       I think I get what they're saying, but I also think they think I was pushing you towards going the route most take, and throwing yourself into debt to go to school. I wasn't advocating for that either. If I could do it all over, I'd go to a state school for undergrad and save a pricier school in better standing for a Master's once my career goals were more concrete.

       No kinship with the state; as I said, my concern was for OP being told his/her degree is meaningless because it didn't come from an accredited university. That would be an even bigger waste of money than taking out loans, because at least then you have a degree that others view as valid. I understand the system is horrible, but a new-age school with questionable accreditation isn't the best panacea. That's not to say it isn't the answer either, but rather that any decision made should ideally be well-informed.

       MUM has been accredited since 1980.
      </p>
      <p>
       At one point, they had a PhD program in theoretical physics.

       The curent President of the University became head of the Physics department a few years after it was accredited, and was internationally recognised as a cutting edge theoretical physicist. He stopped publishing physics papers in the mid 1990s when he decided to run for President of the US 3 times in a row, but even 20 years after his last paper was published, he was still getting name recognition as was one of his PhD students:

        <strong>
         Hagelin
        </strong>
        , Nanopoulos, Olive, and Srednicki, we realized that the lightest supersymmetric particle would be a very natural candidate for cold dark matter and calculated its density in some detail (this paper now has over 1,000 citations in the SPIRES database; Ellis J, et al., "Supersymmetric relics from the Big Bang," Nuclear Physics B 238[2]: 453-76, 1984).

        During his time at CERN, SLAC and MUM, Hagelin worked on supersymmetric extensions of the standard model and grand unification theories. His work on the flipped SU(5) heterotic superstring theory is considered one of the more successful unified field theories, or "theories of everything", and was highlighted in 1991 in a cover story in Discover magazine.

       <em>
        In the years 1979â€“1996, Hagelin published over 70 papers about particle physics, electroweak unification, grand unification, supersymmetry and cosmology, most of them in academic scientific journals. He co-authored a 1983 paper in Physics Letters B, "Weak symmetry breaking by radiative corrections in broken supergravity", that became one of the 103 most-cited articles in the physical sciences in 1983 and 1984. In a 2012 interview in Science Watch, co-author Keith Olive said that his work for the 1984 study was one of the areas that had given him the greatest sense of accomplishment. A 1984 paper by Hagelin and John Ellis in Nuclear Physics B, "Supersymmetric relics from the big bang", had been cited over 500 times by 2007.

       A lot of times, with these spiritual discussion things, people with hidden (or not-so-hidden, in my case) agendas pop up and tend to be super positive or super negative about things.

       No worries. I'm a true believer and I've worried at times about things wrt MUM myself. The new President, John Hagelin, is certainly a hardcore believer, but unlike the last President, he had a day job (researcher at CERN) before he joined the organisation. HIs predecessor went to India at age 18 (several years before the beatles did, I think) to be with his guru, and so once he graduated from Cambridge, his guru (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi) used him as a troubleshooter as he was obviously very dedicated. He ended up being the President of MUM for 35+ years, starting the year it was accredited (the longest-running president of an accredited university  in the history of the USA, I believe), but since he had never worked outside the organisation, you might argue that his 'tude was a bit skewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       John's a bit more pragmatic and so the University has started going in a slightly more mainstream direction since he took over.

       Eh, about the only thing I disallow is "how do I do it?" discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       TM comes from a tradition that claimed that only an enlightened teacher had the intuition to impart the intuition we call TM (
       <em>
        dhyana
       </em>
       â€” "motion of the mind [in the direction of
       <em>
        samadhi
       </em>
       ]"):
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Taught by an inferior man this Self cannot be easily known,
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        even though reflected upon. Unless taught by one
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        who knows him as none other than his own Self,
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        there is no way to him, for he is subtler than subtle,
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        beyond the range of reasoning.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Not by logic can this realization be won. Only when taught
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        by another, [an enlightened teacher], is it easily known,
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        dearest friend.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       -Katha Upanishad
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Maharishi Mahesh Yogi tried to prove that tradition limited by creating a teaching play â€” where the TM teacher spends 5 months, in residence, learning the words, gestures, body-language and tone-of-voice Maharishi used when teaching (not to mention how to evaluate and tailor their teaching to the level of experience of the student) â€” so that they could literally "play the part" of Maharishi when teaching meditation. He called it "duplicating myself" and spent 50 years of his life refining that play.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So, believer that I am, I try to keep people from ruining the experience of learning/practicing TM  by outlawing "how to" discussions. TM teachers promise to provide a free lifetime followup to any student of any other TM teacher, as long as they learned through official channels, so people can go to any TM center anywhere in the world and get help for free.
      </p>
      <p>
       TM teachers STILL travel to out-of-the-way places and teach TM (there's now a center in Mongolia, however), so its not like a student can't invite a TM teacher to their rural community and get the teacher to come to THEM to teach, if they're actually interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the only place where this can't happen are a few middle eastern countries where TM teachers are outlawed [on pain of death if they teach?] I just found out, and there are sliding scales and grants to help lower the cost if someone
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wants to learn, so its just laziness and cynicism on people's parts (except in the Middle East and the like) if they won't find a TM teacher to teach them the "real deal."
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on about True Believer stuff (e.g. the Roman Catholic Church allows the teaching of TM and even the TM 'levitation' technique to kids as therapy for PTSD in Church-run schools and orphanages, for example), but I tend to be long-winded.

       I've been doing TM since 1973, so I tend to know all the current big-wigs in the TM organisation just because I've been around for 44 years. As I said in my disclaimer, I'm co-moderator of
       <a href="/r/transcendental">
        /r/transcendental
       </a>
       for discussion of TM (the President is on my email list and Facebook friend's page, and about 1/50 of the emails I send to him, he actually replies to).

       .

       I took an advanced meditation class at MUM back around 1984 and I've been back once or twice, the last time in 1985, I think, so any first-hand experience is almost 35 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just know all the links to all the pages where TM stuff is found and I am good at googling.

       OCD doesn't hurt here, either.

       Seriously just transfer somewhere with a real reputation, hopefully you have a decent enough GPA to allow that.

       They're accredited by the U.S. Department of Education and the Council on Higher Education Accreditation...are those different in some way?

       No kinship with the state; as I said, my concern was for OP being told his/her degree is meaningless because it didn't come from an accredited university. That would be an even bigger waste of money than taking out loans, because at least then you have a degree that others view as valid. I understand the system is horrible, but a new-age school with questionable accreditation isn't the best panacea. That's not to say it isn't the answer either, but rather that any decision made should ideally be well-informed.
