<p>Tyson foods pork acquisition  </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tyson Foods acquires hogs through direct negotiated purchases with producers using a variety of methods. The four primary methods are: formula (a reported price plus some amount), the spot market, a fixed price tied to feed or a fixed price tied to a futures market. Hogs are purchased on a daily basis, generally a few days before the animals are required for processing. Payment for the hogs may be made on a live-weight basis or on a grade and yield basis. Grade and yield payments are paid on carcass weights generally paying a premium for preferred carcass grades and discounting undesirable grades. Grade premiums or discounts are applied using a predetermined formula<br/>
grid method. </p>

<p>The Pork Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of  Tyson Foods, Inc., produces finished hogs, feeder pigs  and weaned pigs for sale to pork processors and finishers throughout the country. Tyson Foods’ equity ownership of live hog operations represents less than 3% of the Company’s total pork production. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Often Sysco and US Foods have the manufacturer package in proprietary labels- say chicken nuggets. It is the identical product as the Tyson product (although the quality specs can vary slightly.) In the small print on the label of the Sysco box, you will find &quot;manufactured by Tyson for Sysco&quot; or something along those lines. Sometimes they even get trickier and only supply a plant or factory number and you have to look it up.</p>

<p>It is the same concept as &quot;store brands&quot; at the grocery store. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s the case, the school thing in general isn&#39;t a big deal though, as we face the same issue on the consumer level? The only difference being we have choice in what we eat and where it comes from. We have that same choice in school by sending our kids with a packed lunch. In this situation, and most situations in life, when you choose convenience, you lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how it works. Most school districts contract with a food management company like Aramark or Sodexo to run their food operations. Those companies work out a contract with a food distribution company like Sysco or US Foods. The distribution company purchases the food from all the crap companies you would expect: Cargill, Advance, Tyson, Kelloggs, etc. The school food is literally made by the same companies that make the food you buy in the grocery store, but sometimes have different specifications.</p>

<p>For those of you that don&#39;t remember, Jamie Oliver did an expose on pink slime on an episode of his show, Jamie&#39;s American Food Revolution. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Oliver%27s_Food_Revolution#Season_1_(2010">main body of this Wikipedia article</a>) summarizes it as such:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/pink-slime-school-lunches-96502_Page2.html">https://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/pink-slime-school-lunches-96502_Page2.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the episode from April 12, 2011, <strong>Oliver decried the use of pink slime in US ground meat and in US school lunches</strong>. In the episode, Oliver explained what the product is and why he was repelled by it. <strong>He utilized artistic license in demonstrating the concept by immersing beef trimmings in liquid ammonia, rather than gaseous ammonia, as in the meat industry.</strong> Oliver has stated, &quot;Everyone who is told about &#39;pink slime&#39; doesn&#39;t like it in their food—school kids, soldiers, senior citizens all hate it.&quot; The American Meat Institute and Beef Products Inc. responded with a three-minute YouTube infomercial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, pink slime is the meat particles you can get from spinning meat trimmings and bones in a centrifuge. Small pieces of meat are flung towards the outside of the centrifuge, and are collected and treated with chemicals like ammonia before being processed into food. This product is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_slime">lean finely textured beef or LFTB</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/pink-slime-school-lunches-96502_Page2.html">The following link goes back to 2013</a>, but I doubt huge strides have been made to fully eliminate pink slime from school lunches, despite the hit the industry initially took when this story first came to light:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the aftermath, <strong>most of the major fast food chains have dropped their use of lean finely textured beef. And, at last count, the number of pounds of lean finely textured beef in the USDA’s National School Lunch Program was down 95 percent. Before the pink slime issue exploded last spring, schools were serving up about 7 million pounds of the product per year.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And it’s not likely that the product will ever get back to its previous glory</strong>, based on what school officials say.</p>

<p>Mark Bishop, the vice president of policy for the Healthy Schools Campaign, said he is confident <strong>lean finely textured beef will stay out of Illinois’ largest school district: Chicago Public Schools.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“They’ve taken the position that they’re not going to buy meat treated with ammonia and they’ve followed through on that,”</strong> Bishop said. “This issue is really about labeling more than it is about nutrition. Whether in our homes or in our schools, we want to make informed choices. We want to know what’s in our food.”</p>

<p><strong>But Bryan Black, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Agriculture, told POLITICO his state has not changed its policy on lean finely textured beef in school lunches. “It has always remained the same, it’s a local decision. Schools have the option to request the type of beef they want to serve and USDA fulfills those orders,”</strong> Black said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/pink-slime-returns-school-lunches-article-1.1451244">Also from 2013:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of Sept. 3, those <strong>seven states have ordered approximately 2 million pounds of ground beef that may contain LFTB, a fraction of the amount that schools nationwide once ordered.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In 2012, BPI sold 7 million pounds of LFTB</strong> to the National School Lunch Program and so-called 
<strong>pink slime was found in roughly 70% of all supermarket ground beef.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was in food distribution, I worked with military, and I have to say- they were adamantly against pinkslime. Part of my job was to send out samples to the lab to make certain that it was wholesome, and it was so spotty that we found a local company to produce our ground meat. </p>

<p>Also, with processed chicken, military would refuse anything that was &quot;mechanically separated&quot;- same concept as pink slime. We had to work with Tyson to have &quot;CN&quot; or &quot;child nutrition&quot; added to the labels to differentiate the grades of product. If you see a case of Tyson with CN on it, know that it contains either copious amounts of soy and/or slime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, the processed food supply chain is pretty complicated and a simple search won&#39;t help much. It gets even more complicated then I&#39;ve explained elsewhere when it comes to the actual bidding process. Often the vendor is required to have a certain percentage of suppliers that are small or minority-owned businesses. In that case, a small company will buy the Tyson chicken nuggets from Tyson, slap a &quot;small business&quot; label on it and deliver it to the distributor with an additional markup- a practice known as&quot;paperhanging&quot;. This makes it even more difficult for the layman or even the school foodservice manager to know who the actual manufacturer is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worked in my high school cafeteria for two years after I graduated, everything came from Sysco...not much of a conspiracy here. The only people that don&#39;t know where it comes from are the people that don&#39;t ask or don&#39;t see the trucks pull in twice a week.</p>

<p>The phrase &quot;where does schools get their food&quot; probably pulls up bad results because its so poorly written and in quotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Often Sysco and US Foods have the manufacturer package in proprietary labels- say chicken nuggets. It is the identical product as the Tyson product (although the quality specs can vary slightly.) In the small print on the label of the Sysco box, you will find &quot;manufactured by Tyson for Sysco&quot; or something along those lines. Sometimes they even get trickier and only supply a plant or factory number and you have to look it up.</p>

<p>It is the same concept as &quot;store brands&quot; at the grocery store. </p>
