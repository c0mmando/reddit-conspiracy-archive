    <div class="md"><p>Most of the world is ruled by corrupt morons and sociopaths. Seems likely to me that super advanced sentient AI will take them out first. I think youre ascribing malice to incompetence.</p>

<p>You should study chaos theory and you will see that a lot of the behavior of the elite is the amplification of non-adaptive behavior over many iterations. </p>

<p>Said another way: youre giving the Jeff Bezos and Mark Cuckerberg type of rich assholes of the world too much credit for being evil geniuses. The general population&#39;s stupidity is more responsible for those kind of peoples&#39; wealth and power than their own &quot;evil genius&quot;.</p>

<p>And i think youre taking an unnecessarily defeatist view. Theres no reason to believe that if they have the technology to make sentient AI that theyd need to make you suffer for them to continue being rich powerful assholes.</p>

<p>Theres also no reason to think TPTB can control what theyre trying to create.</p>

They&#39;ll limit their activities to clandestine control of the world financial system (and vicarious control of global politics), as they are doing now.  It&#39;s all the power with none of the blame or accountability.  As soon as you step out and openly dominate the world, you risk mass uprisings and overthrow.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about a singularity is that it doesn&#39;t matter if it sparks uprisings or not. No matter how angry a bird gets about a trove of bulldozers showing up to bulldoze its forest, there&#39;s nothing much it can do about it. A technological singularity is so beyond humanity in every imaginable way that resistance is quite literally impossible. Even residents of the mainstream like Elon Musk have recognised this danger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suicide is on the rise for every class and gender, so I&#39;d like to unequivocally say to anyone who wrestles with it : Don&#39;t do it. It cripples the people you leave behind. I&#39;m not going to give you platitudes about <em>it gets better</em>, because, honestly, no one on this planet has been promised fulfillment and happiness. You have to find your own peace and motivation. You&#39;re also unique, magnificent stardust, so go fuckin glitter! </p>

<p>All that being said, yes, I went through this phase, too. I think many here do, after losing our religion. I wish we had a few more motivated posts, like the book and movie club ideas, I know there&#39;s some discussions about organizing content. I&#39;d love to see more theme days, like a throwback Thursday, where an old theory is featured and we all contribute to a mega-thread, so folks can easily read up on a complex issue. </p>

<p>As far as AI goes, I think humans are intrinsically brilliant and resourceful and will develop ways to defeat or isolate AI. Either that, or we&#39;re left to die on this planet as they lounge in space. Yeehaw, I still have to walk the dog and get to the grocery store, yeah? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All conspiracies are there to push you away from believing the King James Bible and to push you away from God.  The truth is we are all cursed sinners and need redemption.  God came to Earth as Jesus Christ and gave himself up as the final blood sacrifice for sin.  All that needs to be done is repent of one&#39;s sinful nature and believe  the gospel of Jesus Christ in one&#39;s heart and they will be saved and taken out of this fallen realm that is run by the Lucifer and his deceived minions.  The gospel you must believe is so simple.  It&#39;s that Jesus Christ paid for your sins and that&#39;s it.  There is nothing you can do to save yourself.  You can only trust in what God did for you already.  </p>

<p>Repent and believe this and you will be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>
