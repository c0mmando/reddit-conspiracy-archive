       It was him or Clinton. I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would vote for Hillary Clinton.  A crooked, nasty woman who had accomplished nothing except getting people killed and lining her own pockets.

       It's also easier to love him when you shield yourself from any and all criticism about him, getting all information abo it him from his Twitter and the_donald, and claim any news outlet that say anything bad about him is fake news.

       It's sad that reading this statement feels like a massive victory and restored a slight amount of my faith in humanity. Man, this place has always been heading downward for the past five years but this last 12 months has been brutal. This community no longer exists, it's been infiltrated by confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, and low level partisan politics.

       Pretty hard to shield yourself from criticism if Trump if you use reddit.  Any positive mention of him on any of the popular subreddits gets you downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       95% of articles about Trump on Worldnews and News are negative.  People who like Trump like his results.  Instead of pretending they don't exist i read about them.  I for example listen to right and left wing media and then develop an opinion for myself (I'm not American but your politics is entertaining as hell).  He's easy tò criticize, he doesn't watch his mouth and is used to being able to say whatever he wants to whoever he wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, since Russia failed liberal media is now trying to get him impeached with amendment 25.  If that doesn't scream fishy nothing will.  Please tell me how your "Alzheimer's afflicted" president is conspiring with Russia?

       I listen to conservative talk radio all the time. Russia failed? They wrapped up that criminal investigation after the 4 criminal indictments? When did that happen? We've been talking about his mental health because a new book came out and apparently everyone who works at the white house thinks he's a retard.

       Lol, so the FBI charges someone for a lie about a non-criminal offense is considered a success? And that's just one of the pitiful examples.

       The new book is horseshit, even Bannon has apologized and said he wishes he could take back his statements he only stated because he wanted vengeance for being fired.

       Yeah I'd say 4 criminal indictments in the first year of a criminal investigation is pretty successful. Anybody with common sense would say so. Hell of a lot more than republicans have ever gotten investigating Clinton over the past 20 years.

       Cruz, jeb, Rubio, McCain, Paul Ryan, all make my skin itch.  That's all.  Give me a hard working citizen running for office over a career politician in either party!  I would much prefer a libertarian.  I voted for Trump OVER Hillary.  It wasn't a very high bar.  Lol.

       That statement is a little bit of a reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       When half the country is pushing for arrests, there is a good chance there will be an arrest.  It doesn't matter if it was a minor crime or it is barely related.  That's what happens in these massive government criminal investigations.  I'm actually more then pleased that nothing substancial was dug up on Trump and his family considering his involment in global affairs as one of the richest people in the USA.  More reason to offer my support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like i said, attack my opinion all I want, but I just do this as a hobby.  I'm an outsider, non-american.  I have no reason to support Trump or his narrative aside from his policy and his actions.

       The most effective propaganda is when the audience isn't aware that they are being manipulated. The globalist Establishment runs the media, and they are against Trump. What they put out is definitely propaganda. And I've never once read Breitbart so I wouldn't know about them.

       I just wonder... why do you think all this? Have you never considered that he's a bad president? Have you never looked objectivelu at his presidency and seen the ups and the downs?
      </p>
      <p>
       Heres my opinion that I've gleaned from statistics and news: he's good for the economy. However, there is definitely some shady shit going on behind the scenes that i dont like that ill delve into more if you want me to. He's also making an embarrassment of us globally with his attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I consider my most important political value to be the environment. Trump has done only bad things for the environment (selling public land, drilling oil, withdrawing from paris, etc.) so i don't like him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, do you still believe I'm being controlled by propaganda? Can't everything I say be backes up by objective fact?

       The choice was between Hillary and Trump. An informed voter choosing Hillary is a psychopathic one.

       This pretense of playing nice before the cameras as the standard for how a politician is to be perceived is why this procession of soulless weasels continue to line up for a chance to win the faux popularity contest of public acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
       A tough talking jocular personality rose to the occasion after a long drought of creepy nerds still hung up on being a dork in high school, with their repressed emotion propped up on neo Marxist, feminist creep thinking, trying to manipulate the ordinary thought processes of those normies they so hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       They undermined democracy by ousting Bernie. They undermine it by colluding with media. They undermine it still now manipulating the people against who won the public acceptance contest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The creepy dorks were rejected once more. And they didn't grow up playing sports to appreciate fair play and learn how to lick their wounds and walk away like adults. They're stuck in their adolescent perception of reality with their Marxist fantasies of government imposed equality, AKA slavery.

        Weren't there 4 supreme court rulings from the late 90's to like 2015 or something?
       </p>

      <p>
       Yea, but in a way we're both right.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2015, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, under Mr. Obama, issued a contrary ruling, deciding on a vote of three Democrats to two Republicans that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was illegal. That ruling, which was reviewed by the Obama administration’s Justice Department, did not formally bind the federal courts, although courts often defer to federal agencies when they interpret laws that come under their jurisdiction.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its brief, the Trump administration’s Justice Department said the E.E.O.C., which had also filed court papers supporting Mr. Zarda, was “not speaking for the United States.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So it wasnt official, but recommended. And considering gay marriage is legal now, it really should be a protected class.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How is the bakery different than the Seattle coffee shop owner (Ben Borgman) and why isn't he getting a court case?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From the article you link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Members of the group had been inside of his business distributing a disturbing flyer (see here if you must) depicting blood-covered rainbow hands letting go of an aborted fetus, which has no place in any public setting, let alone a coffee shop.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If straight people came in and ordered a coffee and he banned them, then sure. But they were disrupting his business and handing out disgusting fliers: he had every right to send them away.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CO Baker case could be a landmark for gay rights, and add lgbt to the civil rights act officially. This case is just a guy sending people out of his store, and a court case wouldn't really be a landmark decision.

       I appreciate your answer.   Thanks.

       "it [LGBT] really should be a protected class." - agreed
      </p>
      <p>
       I linked the article I did specifically because the source called him a hero more than anything else.  I do believe they had handed out some stuff in the shop previously and he told them that would not be allowed.  I do believe that on this day, the religious group was outside handing them out and they came in for a beverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see it as simply someone sending people out of their store.  His own words say as much
      </p>
      <p>
       The coffee shop owner kicked out a protected class.  So lets say we make LGBT a protected class tomorrow.  If you set the precedent that being a protected class by law doesn't actually afford you protections, then what would stop a business owner from discriminating against LGBT in our hypothetical tomorrow?
      </p>
      <p>
       "he had every right to send them away" - OK, so a private business has the right to refuse service unless the class is a protected class.  Or maybe not since the Christians got kicked out?  And maybe you don't need to be a protected class since the bakery saw their day in court?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you feel the pamphlet was inappropriate?  Was his language inappropriate?  Don't each have the right to express themselves freely as long as they are within the law?
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, so according to you, a protected group can be kicked out using language such as this because they handed stuff out in his business.  So let us use that logic.  If a non-protected group such as LGBT came into a coffee shop and handed out fliers for something, the owner is perfectly fine to unleash an expletive laced tirade and kick them out and "all their fucking friends"?  I don't think you would agree.   What exactly are you saying here?
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing really makes no sense.  If there was ever any clarity on this issue, it is now gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe instead of creating endless classes of people and putting them in many unique boxes each with their own flag, we should protect human rights under one flag.

       also, check your last three links as they don't describe what you say. 1st one says he might remove something from Obamacare, 2nd I think I need an ELI5, and the 3rd one says the council is extended through 2019.

       Surely a measurement for the charge of objective falsehood would be met with the supplementation of objective measurements for the charge. But not in Weasel World, I guess. Objectivity and subjectivity are interchangable in FANTASY LAND, at least if you're asking a Marxist transgender who will profess gender to be optional, though it is a concept of inherent and pure abstraction that has no substance for objective measurement, and therefore no basis on which it can be objectively proposed to be objective whatsoever.

       Driving is a privilege, not a right. Right? Why? Because we don't all magically function in accordance with a pre-ordained system. It's called FREE WILL. And with it, sometimes we CRASH. I'll take the risk of the crash over the risk of never getting over the horizon and drowning in the viper's den of egalitarianism.

       I’m going to assume you mean, man-made ‘Global Warming’ and not ‘climate change’. They are not the same. Is the earth’s temperature rising at a similar pace as it has since we started recording ocean temps? Yes. Is it rising at an alarming rate due to man? Debatable.  Catch up kid!

       dude im an environmental science major i know what climate change is, and it's what i'm talking about. did you know this year had the most expensive storms on record due to climate change? it's not just getting a bit warmer, it's crops dying because of unpredictable temperature swings. i specialize in ornithology and i can seriously talk for over an hour on how its affecting birds.

        On day one, Hillary Clinton will set bold, national goals that will be achieved within 10 years of taking office:
Generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America, with half a billion solar panels installed by the end of Hillary’s first term.
Cut energy waste in American homes, schools, hospitals and offices by a third and make American manufacturing the cleanest and most efficient in the world.
Reduce American oil consumption by a third through cleaner fuels and more efficient cars, boilers, ships, and trucks.

       The Paris Agreement was based on the exact same study debated in my first link. There is a political agenda attached to it just like everything else. The agreement would have cost an avg. of $7,000 per citizen annually because of the manufacturing restrictions. These restrictions wouldn’t hurt corporations in a negative way or reduce the emissions though. They would just outsource the production to countries such as India and China for half the cost with little to no restriction. China is exempt from the Paris Agreement until at least 2030 even though their emissions are the largest in the world outside of volcanoes. Did you know over 1500 private jets to shuttle people into last year’s summit? Clearly there is a lack of consideration such things are having on our planet by the major players involved. Until the people pushing this bullshit down our throats start living like it’s a threat, remain skeptical as fuck.

       You can't come up with even one reason why someone might like Trump or his policies?

       I'm not a US voter, and if I were I probably would have thrown my vote away to a third party. But I can certainly understand why some people support him and why some support Hillary.

       Not even the economy? Black unemployment is at the lowest in recorded history. Unemployment in general is the lowest its been in two decades. The stock market is up 1000 pts. We're decreasing government spending and 80% of the US is getting a tax break next year.
      </p>

       Surely you can't be against all those things.

       Obama couldn't hit 3% annual GDP during his entire presidency and you're trying to tell me that the economy is doing well because of him? He let tons of jobs go offshore and claimed that he couldn't do anything to bring them back, yet Trump managed to do just that in his first year.

       Just because you feel Trump supports are racist and bigots does not make it true. Not all southerners are racists, not all Canadians like hockey, not all Asians are good at math, not everyone with a tattoo is a biker...the list goes on and on.

       Because the economy is soaring? Because if you woke up from a coma today and no one would tell you who the president is, you would not be able to walk around the outside world and come to the conclusion that you're in a "Nazi dystopia" that the left imagines around them. You would come to the conclusion that the government is moderate, fiscally sound, and stable. Any other vision of reality is created by the news-fear industrial complex.

       That is the definition. You hate a large group of people because of your opinion. That makes you a bigot in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not Trump is a bigot is a personal opinion. It's one that I agree with, but it's an opinion. To then turn around and hate on everyone who voted for him or showed support for him makes you a bigot. You are placing a label on a large group of people who it may or may not relate to. I bet some people who voted for him or agree with his policies are nice people.

       These things are cyclical, so there will likely be a downturn, but it won't be a malaise like Obama's, and likely the GOP won't use it as a reason that they must create a regulation to control every private industry around.

       And under Obama it was.  The whole of the reporting effort was weaponized and made political.  Reports were always rosy then revised downward later.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for Trump to say that they were lies is completely true.  But he wasn't in office when those things were said was he.

       People are fucking idiots.  And they vote.  Trump appealed to ignorance and fear because it works.

       Notably, Sanders also appealed to ignorance, fear, and division just as much as Trump.  Just different ignorance, different fear, and different division. It's what politicians do to get elected.

       the venn diagram of Trump and Obama voters likely has a pretty small overlap, but what's your point?

      <p>
       Yes, lots of stupid people voted for Obama.

      <p>
       Because there are a lot of stupid people in the country who vote.

       Trumps approval rating is in the 30s and most of that 30% already decided they didn't like CNN. So why would CNN try to appeal to them? Their business is infotainment; they don't have any desire to show both sides.

       There have been a couple Fox reporters come out and say they tried to report about Russia or put Trump in a negative light and the network shot them down (wonder how Shep gets away with it).

       Fox is a GOP cheering section and I've never been sure that Trump really is part of the GOP.  (He seems to fight with them as much as he does with democrats.)

       Regardless, if the decision was Clinton versus Trump, I feel like the right decision was made.  I don't hold it against Fox.  At least they weren't Clinton champions the way that ABC, NBC, CBS and the rest of them were.

       Fox News is absolutely not 100% Trump. Leading up to the election, they were barely 50% Trump and I'd put them at around 75% now. There are still a LOT of old guard establishment Republicans that are featured on the network on a daily basis who are staunch never Trumpers.

       Reality is 100% anti-Trump; therefore, experience and intelligence will always lead the educated to this conclusion. You can't blame CNN for being a professional news organization staffed with experienced and educated professionals from reaching a similar point.

      <p>
       Repeating a lie doesn't make a lie true. All current economic trends have a long post 2009 trajectory. Jumping into line at the end of a trend doesn't give an illegitimate President like Trump instant credit.

       Obama could have legitimately insisted that the Hague bring charges against the Bush Administration for war crimes and allowed Interpol to arrest Bush And Cheney on US soil. But he didn't. So Bush should spend the rest of his life kissing Obama's ass.

       Agreeing with me doesn't have anything to do with anything in this conversation. Supporting open fascism and a racial police state under well known racists such as Jeff Sessions is a concern.

       Trump has the highest negatives and the lowest support of any US President in 70 years. So I am sure it isn't a personal quirk of mine.

       You may not have encountered this before, but many citizens in the United States are opposed to racism and fascism so we will fight against wannabe fascist fools like Trump with passion.

       No, the electoral college was created so that states with small population density (farm states) would feel like they had a chance at having a voice in government that might counter the dense states that controlled the ports of entry to the country.

       The electoral college dovetails into the 3/5's Compromise. Guess which states had a "small population density" of eligible voters and need a mechanism to exert political control? Slave states.

       There were two houses of congress.  One was the house.  Democratically elected.

       The second was the senate - which was made of up people chosen by a governor that was democratically elected.

       So, yeah, voting was relevant.  (And interestingly enough - the President was voted in too - using a set of rules and methodology that made sense if you wanted to keep a group of states together.)

       I'll give you this. You are persistent.  But I'm not a young kid fresh out of high school off to learn leftism at the local university.  Repeating the same thing over and over an over to me isn't going to convince me it's the truth.

       This is what so many Trump supporters have never understood. It's not about you or trying to get your vote or even trying to engage with you in a meaningful way.

       You only exist as a foil to push the nation into a progressive world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your world is dying and the remaining reactionaries expose the degradation of the past generations. Your purpose was to vote for Trump, or some fool like him, and then try to defend that fool on a national stage. History works in cycles and this is a necessary period to finally destroy the old political dichotomy.

       If anything I feel sorry for the Trump supporters and their disjointed world view. Being a sycophant for oligarchs doesn't seem like a tenable position to take. But here we are.

      <p>
       Just to note: I view the Clinton family the same way I view the Trump family or the Bush family. They should be fed to the dogs on general principles alone. So the right-versus-left false dichotomy is just silly.

       But you can't support an unhinged wannabe fascist and not be stupid or evil. See how that works? Many people in the US, roughly 70% of the country don't support this petite fascist, so I am secure in the validity of my position and the democratic support behind that position.

       So you should probably throw around alot of politically charged words that are still just your opinions, then call me stupid and a racist again.  Maybe if you do that enough, you can convince one of us that your opinions are facts.

       And yeah, Hillary had a 99% chance of winning the election.  So those polls tell the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  You just keep repeating them to yourself and tomorrow you will wake up and Hillary will be President.

       Regardless, you've succeeded in boring me.  Keep insulting, repeating yourself and telling the world what a captain of industry you are.  That's why it's so vitally important that you win this argument with an old man you will never meet and don't know a thing about.

       But Trump isn't "literally Hitler". Trump isn't smart enough to even read a book about Hitler much less emulate him. And Hitler wasn't actually that smart of guy himself as most authoritarians suffer from major psychological and emotional disabilities throughout their lives.

       You seem very angry about this whole profit things and men who seek profits.  Fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       An odd thought pattern for a captain of industry such as yourself.   Here's a secret - most people who made a real difference in this world had profit and power in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I proudly say I worked my butt off for decades to make money for myself and my family.  I'm sure that must horrify you.  I also ate beef jerky, wore leather shoes, and used petroleum products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, with the insults disguised as fact, but here's the real fact. Trump is in the White House.  You are not.   So call him whatever you want and he won't care.  Frankly I don't either.
      </p>

       Plus ISIS has been beaten in Syria thanks to a lot less U.S. intervention. The tax breaks. The conservative judges being installed en masse.

       You realize all of that is because of the Obama Administration? And the stockmarket is booming because of layoffs and stock buybacks.

       That statement is a little bit of a reach.
      </p>

       When half the country is pushing for arrests, there is a good chance there will be an arrest.  It doesn't matter if it was a minor crime or it is barely related.  That's what happens in these massive government criminal investigations.  I'm actually more then pleased that nothing substancial was dug up on Trump and his family considering his involment in global affairs as one of the richest people in the USA.  More reason to offer my support.
      </p>

       Like i said, attack my opinion all I want, but I just do this as a hobby.  I'm an outsider, non-american.  I have no reason to support Trump or his narrative aside from his policy and his actions.

       It's just super cute that even when republicans have complete control over every section of our government, conservatives need to pretend it's the democrat's fault when things go wrong.

       The Paris Agreement was based on the exact same study debated in my first link. There is a political agenda attached to it just like everything else. The agreement would have cost an avg. of $7,000 per citizen annually because of the manufacturing restrictions. These restrictions wouldn’t hurt corporations in a negative way or reduce the emissions though. They would just outsource the production to countries such as India and China for half the cost with little to no restriction. China is exempt from the Paris Agreement until at least 2030 even though their emissions are the largest in the world outside of volcanoes. Did you know over 1500 private jets to shuttle people into last year’s summit? Clearly there is a lack of consideration such things are having on our planet by the major players involved. Until the people pushing this bullshit down our throats start living like it’s a threat, remain skeptical as fuck.
