        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Watching his last specials and his beautiful metaphor on what happened to him on. Netflix was enough. Nobody in hollywood came close to that. His interview on inside the actors studio hinted at it, and his last special did too.</p>

<p>Then I came across a video of him going of for 4 hours on YouTube. Admittedly I&#39;m being lazy and I also don&#39;t know reddit well so I can&#39;t link. But his special is on Netflix and if you Google Dave chappelle 4 hours it&#39;ll come up on YouTube. I recommend it. Even if it doesn&#39;t open your eyes it&#39;s still dave chappelle and you&#39;ll get a laugh. </p>

It was like watching political humour reddit do the material for Chappelle.  I wonder if it has anything to do with Netflix funding and who invested millions into Netflix and led the charge for Dear White People and Bill Nye and now cuckholding commercials.  Would explain a lot about how different these two new specials were compared to his last set of specials and older material.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched his latest special recently and thought it was really funny, however, the part where he starts comparing blacks coming together in 2008 to vote for Obama and then &#39;poor whites&#39; coming together in 2016 to vote for Trump I thought was pretty ignorant. One group, according to Dave, was really doing the country a service by all coming together to vote for their candidate, while the other group were just a bunch of dummies.    </p>

<p>For someone who I think can usually cut through the BS on most issues, that was one point where I could tell he really wasn&#39;t interested in having an honest discussion about the topic.</p>

<p>He voted for Hillary, for the same reason that many people did, because Trump was/is pretty terrible. He criticized her heavily, but he said he voted for her-with a caveat-that it didn&#39;t feel good to vote for her (as in voting for the lesser of two evils). That doesn&#39;t sound very pro-hillary, but rather anti-trump. What is the greatest difference between someone that voted for Trump because he/she saw him as the lesser of two evils, and someone that did the same in voting for Hillary? Being anti-trump doesn&#39;t lump you in with every single demographic conservatives don&#39;t like, unfortunately. What was that he said during his SNL monologue? Let&#39;s give Trump a fair chance? He got a lot of shit for saying that, and that&#39;s not fair, but he did say it, even if he regretted it later. White privilege? Dave Chapelle is black, a very rich black person. He didn&#39;t grow up in the streets, either. Of anyone, he&#39;d be pretty well qualified to speak about the topic of white privilege. There are some parts of life, in some parts of the country, to some degree, that white privilege does exist. Even right leaning moderates can admit that. It&#39;s not as though being white puts you a whole tier above all black people in terms of class, as it did in parts of the south before the civil rights movement, but white privilege isn&#39;t completely non-existent, either. I&#39;ve been in enough situations with black friends of mine, as a white person, to see some of this first hand, in particular with police in certain parts of the south. Dumb redneck whites <strong>did</strong> vote for Trump though, just like how dumb ghetto blacks voted for Obama, and dumb feminist women voted for Hillary. Dumb people vote every election cycle, they&#39;re the reason for why we&#39;re in this fucking democratic disaster. I wouldn&#39;t take &quot;fuck wypipo&quot; away from these last few standups from Chapelle. That&#39;s more in line with the ilk of Dear White People.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s okay to enjoy something even though you don&#39;t agree 100% with what is being said by the entertainer you&#39;re listening to/watching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aye, Chappelle. Yes Snoop Dogg publicly endorsed Clinton very early in the election, like January 2016 when Sanders still had a chance. All of these public figures and pop stars pushing status quo candidates keep the cabal alive.</p>

<p>Sure, I voted Sanders too in the primary but what did you do in the general? I couldn&#39;t even talk my mom out of the Clinton vote over her fear of Trump, so I get it, but that&#39;s how evil gets perpetuated. If the enemy of your enemy is still your enemy then why fucking do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t blame anyone for being fooled by that cabal; they (DNC/Clintons) are masters of manipulation.</p>

<p>I was registered as a Democrat; in Ohio, a partially open primary state; one must register to vote in the primaries. I voted for Sanders, who lost by only 7%. (Thanks for nothing, DNC!)</p>

<p>In the general election, I voted for Sanders again. Regardless that Ohio went Republican, and knowing that it was going to be either President Trump or Former Senator Clinton, I wrote in Sanders. Of Ohioans who voted, .3% wrote in a name. Only those names on some &quot;list&quot; that Ohio approves, count - so my vote for Sanders was only for my own satisfaction.</p>

<p>I am actually a Libertarian, but I could not vote for the candidate this time, because he couldn&#39;t find Aleppo with both hands.</p>

<p>Candidate Trump was merely an embarrassment, and knowing more about the Clintons than probably 95% of America, I cannot imagine myself voting for that fucking gun-running war whore.</p>

<p>Yes, the friend of my enemy is my enemy. My enemy is the lie, and the Clintons would not recognize the truth <em>if it bit them on the face.</em></p>

I’ve only watched the first of the last 2 and was disappointed with a lot of it. Once he started on about Trump and Hillary. Meh. Simple basic shit. It’s pandering. He’s bigger than that. The “kick in the pussy” thing wasn’t funny either. Just not. </p>

<p>I’m not offended. I’ve never been offended. I’d LOVE to hear a good joke about Trump - I haven’t really to be honest. I can laugh. I can laugh about things I love. But I didn’t think that special was any good overall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so many are finally speaking out now....jim carrey, rosanne barr, randy quaid is another good one to look up on youtube. he had to move to canada to escape and they emptied his accounts completely! then if you look up all the strange rants that have come out of hollywood, like kanye etc, it paints a very dark and evil picture.
add that to what is going on with ceos of major corporations and the government itself and you would be heading on the right path to the truth of what has been going on under our noses our entire lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he came back for a pay check, he is so out of touch with normal people now. His funniest joke was about kicking a mom in the pussy. I don&#39;t think he could fill auditoriums through out America unless it was promoted as a special event like a Netflix special. Honestly I haven&#39;t seen any comedy on NF besides Kevin Hart that is very funny.</p>
