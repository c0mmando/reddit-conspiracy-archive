        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We all know porn rots your brain, desensitizes us to sex, and ruins our relationships with women. It highlights our deepest fantasies..many we didn&#39;t know we had until we started using...and our darkest animalistic urges. It&#39;s also a great release when you haven&#39;t gotten laid in a while and you are considering ordering a flashlight vagina haha. I&#39;m a physically fit sexually charged 28 year old and have fallen into the brainsuck that is sex through screen and noticed the effects it has on my body mind and soul. I have recently moved from Cali to new England for a bit and don&#39;t know anyone and especially don&#39;t any women. After 2 months I broke down and fired up the old computer only to be met with very ...different...themed video. Everything had an incest theme. Daddy&#39;s daughter does this. Step brother this. Mom and daughter teach this.  Sisters doing that. Literally everything on the front page of pornhub was incest themed. So much so I backed out of that shit and was thoroughly turned off. Remembering why I quit in the first place. I believe porn has been used as a fracturing point between men and women and a catalyst for the destruction of the family further.  Breaking down all taboos introducing themes into the brain that are not biologically intelligent and skewing the headspace of people by associating negative themes with a positive sexual release. It&#39;s just another example of the creeping corruption that has shown up in every aspect of American culture. Has anyone noticed this??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s partly a result of so many millennials living at home with their family while simultaneously being sexually frustrated. Living with parents increases the frustration because they act as a barrier to sex, so as a repressive force all the libidinal energy piles up against them. </p>

<p>The step-relation is especially interesting from a psychoanalytical perspective. Sexual contact with relatives is taboo, but the step-relative sidesteps the underlying reason for the taboo. So it allows the satisfaction of the taboo desire without transgression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as I&#39;m playing armchair psychoanalyst, I think there&#39;s another dimension. Porn over the past 10-15 years has been increasingly violent and degrading towards women, very different from porn in the 90&#39;s and earlier. </p>

<p>I think a lot of young people resent their parents and siblings for getting in the way of sex (such as when Mom wont let you have girls over overnight or something), and so that translates into anger and violent tendencies. Porn has already convinced them that hostility and sexuality are near-interchangeable, so it may come naturally to them to transmute this angry resentment into a repressed sexual desire.</p>

<p>IMO this is big speculation, but on the whole I feel it&#39;s not a conspiracy, moreso a handful of economic and cultural trends converging in an especially dark place.  I think the ramp-up of the &quot;extremeness&quot; of porn since the 90&#39;s is largely a result of a <em>general</em> desensitization and overstimulation because of our hyper-connected, media-saturated lifestyle. It got harder to make people excited or impressed by stuff and so porn go increasingly extreme just for the sake of novelty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TBH, your first part was pretty damned intuitive, but I doubt the second claim...  Porn has not &quot;ramped up&quot; there has always been the weird shit.

<p>I don&#39;t think so. The most famous porn movie of all time is Deepthroat, which came out in 1972. The famous &quot;Golden Age of Porn&quot; lasted from about 1970 to 1985.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The attitude among the family about sex has changed.  Historically sex was about having babies with your spouse, and a husband and wife might well live with one of their parents.</p>

<p>Now, the culture is becoming extremely &quot;sexually liberated&quot; but many of these people live with their parents who likely have a different view of sex and seeing what is going on in the world likely have an increasingly negative opinion of sexual liberation and of casual sex...  add in being sexually frustrated as the person above describes as well as feeling inadequate for not being able to provide for themselves and a spouse, and it is a recipe for fucked up mental associations with sex.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pleased as hell about it. I&#39;ve been watching porn with the sound off for years just because the shit they say to and about the women makes me sick.

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite the addiction, just that <em>watching porn</em> itself is taboo, even though practically anyone does it. So even though we&#39;re all watching it, we&#39;re all afraid to admit it and talk about it in public, so these issues just get worse and worse. And <em>because</em> the porn is getting weirder and weirder, it becomes <em>even more</em> shameful to admit to watching it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a nasty cycle. For all the sexual liberation we enjoy today people still aren&#39;t honest about consuming porn. If we accepted that it&#39;s not an inherently bad a sinful thing, maybe we can start talking in public about the content of the porn and actually address these issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weed shrinks your brain. One part it shrinks is the INAH-3 which has been linked to homosexuality and transgenderism. It also fucks with your hormones, and breaks down your original personality, balanced state.

<p>That is because they have not seen the research on INAH-3. </p>

<p>Yes, the forest has to be denser to get lost in it... do you really need that many connections for sexual function? </p>

<p>See work by Simon Levay from the mid 90s. Should be cited on the wiki. Also a BU article or two about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would not doubt they are aware of Levay&#39;s work, it&#39;s not necessarily highly esoteric within the field(though it&#39;s relevance is quite limited). </p>

<p>Furthermore, 1. correlation does not imply causation in the case of INAH-3 and sexuality, 2. You still haven&#39;t offered any evidence that there <em>is</em> a significant difference in hypothalamus(that&#39;s the part of the brain containing INAH-3 in case you were wondering) of marijuana users as opposed to nonusers, weed might &quot;shrink your brain&quot; but the brain has many distinct elements that have varying function(for some people these functions are also quite limited). So if you want your thesis to stand up you should maybe look to see if the part of the brain you want to rant about is actually relevant to the evidence you&#39;d like to cite.</p>

<p>Would you like some help in your research? Try <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988409/">this</a> or maybe <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10826084.2010.482443?journalCode=isum20">this</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope not. But I can&#39;t see how what you say is 100% true, your wording is horrifically vague. Back in the day, girls used to work nights stripping to pay for school or rent or whatever, no violence, as far as sleeze, IDK, ymmv. I&#39;ve talked to a more than a few girls who were independent. Nowadays they don&#39;t even have to leave the house, just get a cam and a twitch account or whatever and they are off to the races, no pimps. If someone girl wants to set herself up as a cam girl and make some cash running her own website, your average pimp isn&#39;t even gonna know where to look to find her. I don&#39;t understand how natural human urges being satisfied and a little money changing hands in the form of a subscription or pay to view fee equals violence and sleeze but that&#39;s just me.  </p>
