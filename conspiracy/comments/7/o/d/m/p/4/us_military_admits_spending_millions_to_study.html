         Several of the DoD-funded studies went further than merely monitoring what users were communicating on their own, instead messaging unwitting participants in order to track and study how they responded.

       <p>

         The project list includes a study of how activists with the Occupy movement used Twitter as well as a range of research on tracking internet memes and some about understanding how influence behaviour (liking, following, retweeting) happens on a range of popular social media platforms like Pinterest, Twitter, Kickstarter, Digg and Reddit.

         explained
        </a>
        one aspect of this story – the importance of controlling which stories “go viral” – in February:
       </p>
       <p>
        The government spends a great deal of manpower and money to monitor which stories, memes and social movements are developing the momentum to actually pose a threat to the status quo.  For example,
        <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/09/the-federal-reserve-has-just-entered-the-counterespionage-era-and-will-be-monitoring-everything-written-about-it-anywhere-in-the-world.html">
         the Federal Reserve, Pentagon
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/dhs-monitoring-of-social-media-worries-civil-liberties-advocates/2012/01/13/gIQANPO7wP_story.html">
         Department of Homeland Security
        </a>
        , and other agencies all monitor social media for stories critical of their agencies … or the government in general.   Other governments – and private corporations – do the same thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why?
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a story gaining momentum ranks high on social media sites.  So it has a high probability of bursting into popular awareness, destroying the secrecy which allows corruption, and becoming a real challenge to the powers-that-be.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Social proof” is a related concept.  Social proof is the well-known principle stating that people will believe something if
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments">
         most other people believe it
        </a>
        . And see
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof">
         this
        </a>
        .  In other words, most people have a herd instinct, so if a story ranks highly, more people are likely to believe it and be influenced by it.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why vested interests go to great lengths – using computer power and human resources – to monitor social media momentum.   If a story critical of one of these powerful entities is gaining momentum, they will go to great lengths to kill its momentum, and destroy the social proof which comes with alot of upvotes, likes or recommendations in social media.
       </p>
       <p>
        They may choose to flood social media with comments supporting the entities, using
