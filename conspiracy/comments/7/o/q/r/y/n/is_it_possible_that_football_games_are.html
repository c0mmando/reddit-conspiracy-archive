       You are projecting but yes these games are meaningless distractions. I wish the youth were not led to such stupid consequences. This game is truly a war simulation and truly idiotic. I grew up in Babylon.

       you grew up in Babylon and also watching the Coliseum which is what sports turned into now days, just without the dying. why do you think the elite pours so much money into stadiums when our people are starving and living on the streets. they also do this in poor countries using the olympics as an excuse ex. brazil. all a calculated effort to keep people asleep and just praying that their team will win so that they can win money to eat tomorrow.

       Those stadiums are paid for with tax dollars. The elite strong arm cities into building them under the guise of potential income to the cities. If they don’t get the funding up front, they demand the tax revenue be funneled to them for upkeep.

       I would say they aren’t the prevalent goers, tickets are expensive. But they are the most prevalent workers, by far. Slinging a $10 beer and cleaning the restrooms for $7.25/hr.

       What if that's the biggest conspiracy of them all? That they orchestrated all of that-- the attacks on 9/11, the diamond back game-- simply so that they could get access to your DNA via that slut in her backseat?
      </p>
      <p>
       They probably tried to collect it from you nicely first. You were just too busy trying to get laid and never took them up on their offers for Free Genealogical Testing/Just Send Us Back Your Spit in this Tube!
      </p>
      <p>
       So they had to resort to their backup plan, and BAM-- here we are today, baffled on the Internet, trying to figure out what's so amazing about u/DirtyElectrcity's sperm.

       Or, the Astros had 304 years of terrible records so they could collect the draft picks to build an elite team.  The GM even announced he was going to execute the plan about 3-4 years ago.

       Known as tanking.  You'll see this happen with at least 3-4 teams in NFL and NBA every year especially.  If you're THAT bad of a team, you're gonna need to rebuild with the draft.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not exactly a "conspiracy" bc everyone should knows sports is aware.  It's the only way to rebuild a team (in the salary cap era) in most cases.

       Intentionally is a stronger word than necessary here.  They fielded a cheaper team made of younger players for years, seasoning the young players and getting good draft picks in the meantime.  Eventually, seasoned players and good drafting yielded a championship.  That script is not unusual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basketball and kinda football will have teams "tank" towards the end of the season to improve draft position.

       Only the Pats and NYGiants have repeated in the past 15ish years.  Winning multiple SBs is hard business.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, are the huge disasters picking cities with very good teams already in place?  It takes years to build a decent team, and, stunningly, a big disaster just happens to hit a city with an elite-level sports team poised to win it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did Katrina know to hit NO?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did the Houston floods know this was the year?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a conspiracy here, it is that HAARP is directing it's weaponized weather at cities that are poised to win it all.

       Apparently justing winning one Super Bowl is tough buisness. The only time the Saints ever won, as talented as they have been, was after Katrina. Thats definetly an undeniable coincidence. Im not taking away anything from them, they had talent and won their way there, but theres no denying the coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe its just as simple as the players having extra motivation; after such a disaster to play extra hard for their forsaken city and fallen comrades. Maybe its partially pity from opposing players, who have the disasters fresh in the minds and feel empathy for their opponents. Maybe its some sinister tech thats hidden from the public eye that makes these disaters happen or maybe its fate and god making these things happen. But there is something to it.

       Yes, there certainly is something to it.  My hunch is home field advantage gets pretty big during those times.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that wasn't OPs assertion.  OP is saying no coincidence, that the games are fixed pending natural disaster/terror events.  I am saying none chance, and if there IS a connection there, it's from HAARP aiming their weather at cities with teams favored to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Curious, was NO favored to win the Super Bowl that year, well in advance of Katrina?

       You're right.  I allowed the factually inaccurate anti-NFL posters here to mislead me on the timeline.  I looked it up this AM, Brees and Payton arrived in 2006, a year after Katrina.  They've been relevant since then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, zero connection.  Or... Katrina hits, conspiracy to now build a great team there so in 3-5 years they'll win it all!!!  Seems unlikely.

       Yeah, the NFL fixed the game so that noted Trump friend/supporter (and universally hated) QB Tom Brady and Trump friend/supporter Robert Kraft would win, just to make liberals feel better. But sure, I'm sure all those democrat voting Bills, Giants, Jets, Steelers, Ravens, Redskins and Eagles fans in the Mid Atlantic or Northeast just stopped feeling bad to stop the "rioting" (citation needed) that was (supposedly) happening across the region because the Patriots beat the Falcons.

       Yeah, youre right. It is fixed. Like the superbowl before that when you've got marshawn lynch and youre on the 2, but the coach says to 'throw the ball'... QB sneak that shit. Just like how Kapernick got his team to the superbowl that one year by running himself, he wasnt really a part of the 'program'

       the conspiracy there was that the coaches didnt want Lynch to get the winning score.  They wanted Wilson to be the baby-face of the franchise.  Lynch is way to urban and does not give a fuck about the media which is why hes my favorite player

       I think this type of thing is more common than game-fixing, which is really a Vegas/mob type of thing, it's not built into the system.  Promoting certain players is a marketing thing, and sometimes they need to be highlighted in-game through designed plays.

       Wanna talk mob influence. I remember a theory back when NY Giants 'made it' to Eli's 1st or 2nd ring. The Green Bay Packers Offensive Coordinator's son was mysteriously drowned the week before the GB vs Giants playoff game. I dont remember too many of the details but there is no such thing as coincidence, right?

       Joe Philbin's kid was pretty drunk...  I think individual franchises do some super shady shit, and the league as a whole covers up a lot of shady shit, but I don't think having an OC's kid murdered is plausible...  I do believe Peyton was doping like crazy though.

       Sport in the U.S is a complete sideshow. It's not really even sport compared to how most other countries see/play it. It's all " franchises " rather than organically grown teams, with no relegation or promotion. It's just a merry go round of teams given their shot at winning.  A lot of U.S businessmen are to co-opt the English premier league to make it this way as well but it just doesn't work here. Fans are too tribal, you can't get away without investing huge amount of money each year on new players, unless you're Arsenal lol.

       It is so very very easy for a referee to craftily fix a game and determine who wins.

       The officials have a huge input into the outcome. They have a huge incentive: if the game can be nudged by the calls so that it is closer then more people will sit on their couch and watch commercials and boost the revenues.
      </p>
      <p>
       How in the world could this incentive for corruption be contained?

       I have looked for video, but oftentimes commentators will mention something and then it happens, like "haven't seen Jordan Nelson this half" and next play is Jordan Nelson for 60 yard td.

       Well last night, the rams are trying to come back. Goff throws an inside slant to watkins. Gruden says, "I was wondering when they'd finally go back to their out digs." Well, the play was an inside slant so wtf. I had a brief moment of confusion. Well the next play comes immediately while gruden is finishing his atatement, and wouldn't you fucking know it? It was a fucking out dig.

       He described it as up 8 yards and to the sidelines. The play that had happened was a slant. Or at least to inside, not outside. The play he described as just happening was the next play ran.

       You're missing what my point was apparently. Or your just misdirecting. Gruden was describing an out route as having just happened, but it didnt. The out route happened at the moment he finished . He called the play they were about to run as if he had already witnessed it. As if he was reading a script, but jumped a play ahead.

       Either way, they are not reading from a script.  Coaches in the West Coast offense will script their first 15 plays, but they do not share those plays with the booth.

       If you can ever find the full game, it's during last 6 minutes of the game. Probably 3 minute mark. I understand the booth is supposed to be smart and know what they're talking about, and so seem to get lucky with my example of the deep pass.... this one seemed off. Like, no way he should have been able to describe the play

       Yeah but commentators watch a lot of game tape before calling a game and guys like Gruden and Romo really understand game calls, can usually tell from the formation and the situation what a team is going to do.

       Lotsa people throwing around lotsa definitions in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Define fixed?  Typically, "fixed" is something Vegas does, it's a gambling term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Influence games is something the refs do, with or without league instruction (NFL says keep game close, NBA says let stars play).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no league is going to announce a fix, nor would Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not doubt people are conspiring to fix games.  That, however, was not OPs assertion.  Of course people fix games, there are movies about it, and the shadowy figure on a college campus offering money for point shaving is a trope.
      </p>
      <p>
       The OP assertion is the league, the NFL, is fixing games.  And that is comical.  Vegas would CRUSH the NFL if there was shenanigans (outside the realm of currently accepted sports shenanigans)(like home field advantage, stars get better treatment, etc).

       yeah my crazy assumption is that detroit is among one of the few teams never to sell out which is why the questionable calls keep happening year after year.

       I am a Raider fan, no need to tell me about bad reffing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people wanna talk football and conspiracy, Al Davis vs the NFL is a conspiracy.  Davis tweaked the NFL for years, and the NFL, no dount in my mind, had the refs call more fouls on the Raiders.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then... the Raiders played a rough brand of football, had "outcasts and misfits" on purpose, and wear black (dark jerseys get called more often than light jerseys).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Raiders for sure had ref headwind.

       Except, the other team was the SF Giants.  So, either would have worked for the conspiracy.

       Disappointed in the amount of replies that laughed this off.  What a bunch of fucking hypocrites.

       People on this sub are so sure that
       <em>
        Reddit
       </em>
       is used by higher powers to influence public discourse, but OP is an idiot to assume the same is happening with sports?  Okay...
      </p>
      <p>
       A post at the top of
       <a href="/r/All">
        /r/All
       </a>
       or an army of shill bots still can’t influence discourse like a professional athlete with a household name can.    You can spread a message to more Americans via Monday night football than you can with Reddit.  It would literally make more sense to use the NFL as a giant propaganda tool than Reddit, thanks to its level of exposure.  Seriously, guys, how many of your friends and family actually know anything about Pizza Gate or other major conspiracies discussed here, and then how many of them know about deflate gate?
      </p>
      <p>
       You all are a lot smarter than me at finding the connections. I just know it would be foolish to assume there aren’t any.

       I think it's obvious. The "Patriots" comeback and win when a republican president took over. Same after 911 to appeal to the nationalists. The pro military propaganda since 911 is obvious and disgusting. I personally think it ruined the game, which is why I been boycotting them for over a decade.

       Atlanta is definitely not Trump country, not after this tweet last January:
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <em>
        Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district [Atlanta], which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump will be visiting Atlanta tomorrow for the GA / ALA game. Will be interesting to see if he gets booed.

       I would say they aren’t the prevalent goers, tickets are expensive. But they are the most prevalent workers, by far. Slinging a $10 beer and cleaning the restrooms for $7.25/hr.
