<p>If we are living in a simulation, it would make sense that the simulation creator has finite resources available. In software we use lazy loading to put off instantiating variables to save system resources until they are needed. If we don&#39;t need to know the state of the cat until the box is open, it would make sense that we would not instantiate the cat until that point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These &quot;simulation&quot; theories only display the limits of the theorist.  We say &quot;simulation&quot; because this is the closest our words come, in this day and age, to the actual reality of Reality.</p>

<p>These days we are really into transhumanism and tech-as-answer-to-all, which also ties into the ancient struggle of Man over Nature and Man over God.  Against this backdrop and these cultural urges, we see a &quot;simulation.&quot;  This way, we can overcome the simulation and...?  This is the lure and appeal of the &quot;simulation&quot; theory.</p>

<p>This observation is limited in scope and relies on the observors culture and millieu... thus fraught with error.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes i like this way of thinking.  analyze <em>how</em> you might build a simulation.  it&#39;s a fascinating rabbithole.</p>

<p>lazy loading has always been one of my favorite design pattern names, and it&#39;s a cool idea too.  i prefer putting contractual boundaries around it though, like say with promises, to make it idiomatically clearer in addition to enabling a point of decoration.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you believe in religion, you could ask God the same question. If you don&#39;t, scientists seem to enjoy getting accurate simulations of life in respect to various controls. Also, people enjoy all sorts of simulation games.</p>

<p>The real question should be who would run a simulation for 4 billion or so years. To that, one might ask if the civilization that potentially made such a thing even still exists.</p>

<p>I am not saying that we live in a simulation, only the there are aspects to our reality that match up with a simulation.</p>

Time could be simulated to run at a much higher factor, so 1 year here actually is only 1 hour outside.

    <div class="md"><p>I created an AI based &#39;life&#39; sim a few years back.<br/>
I never incorporated pain as part of the birth process, but the &#39;mother&#39; did have to take a health hit only because of the resources required from her to produce the offspring.<br/>
This discussion makes me wonder if pain during childbirth is just an artifact of the process and not actually intentional.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too find many many similarities between the way software works and the way our world does. I believe we are in some sort of simulation for sure. Maybe simulation isn&#39;t the right word for it, maybe this is just the steady state of the universe. Simulation inside simulation forever like Inception. </p>

<p>The question is how is forever possible and what does that mean? Is forever correct or a misnomer? </p>

<p>Some people think everything is just one thing that keeps destroying and reorganizing itself forever (on the multi-verse / multi-simulation scale), but all of this is constantly happening while we are in the inner workings right now.</p>

<p>Another similarity to software is the way machine learning code operates almost identically to the way our brain works by learning through trial and error. One could argue this is what our soul does through many lifetimes, and the soul relearns many lifetimes worth of lessons every time the subject comes up in a new lifetime. Or at least knows how to deal with it well if it has experienced similar abstract reasoning events in the past simulation or lifetimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be easier to believe texts that weren&#39;t modified to fit their own means. You can look at Genesis and see that the first books of the bible took from stories of older civilizations. So this shows you can&#39;t take them at face value.

    <div class="md"><p>They did.  That&#39;s why there are so many different versions.  The Bible most modified is the NIV which actually makes the Antichrist seem like he&#39;s Jesus returning.  The word of God is preserved in the King James Bible alone.  This is a spiritual discernment thing which is hard to explain.  When you get saved you are send the Holy Spirit which teaches you all things.  This is the ultimate &quot;spirit guide&quot; that other belief systems have.  He teaches you all things.  He is also called &quot;The Spirit of Truth&quot; in the Bible.  This is what has allowed me to figure out which Bible is legitimate.  I know that is not an acceptable answer for people like the old me so I understand how hard it is to accept but it&#39;s the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a spiritual discernment thing.  Once I realized there was a God and started praying to him for real knowing he was there in my heart he led me.  It&#39;s really just that simple.  The fact is there is a God and he promised to preserve his word.  So that has happened, it&#39;s just a matter of figuring out what that is.  I know in my heart it&#39;s the KJV Bible.  You can read it and compere verses with other Bibles and see the subtle changes that edit doctrine.  You can also go over manuscript evidence as well:</p>
