       The image is faked and/or entirely misleading in its presentation as a part of "pizzagate".
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's put aside whether or not the image is
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       even at the location the screenshot says it is. That is irrelevant, because...
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the sticker on the car windshield, it's "CPS", but not THAT CPS:

      <p>
       It's not Child Protective Services. It's an auto finance company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any apologies/retractions forthcoming? Any honest contemplation about how so many people jumped toward their pre-existing conclusions and screwed up so badly on the facts
       <em>
        yet again
       </em>
       ? Using,
       <em>
        again
       </em>
       , a single incorrect image to once again leap to the highest heights of #pizzagate fan fiction?

       Woah armchair detectives making a mistake, whoda thunk
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if you're so certain its bullshit then an independent and clear investigation should be had into Comet, the Podesta Bros, CF, and wherever it leads
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats wrong with getting the answers that we want? You clearly want us to shut up, you're leaving your cozy echo chambers to come pick fights here as if theres a goal involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are y'all so focused on disrupting the dissemination and discussion of this topic? Maybe because the evidence is so volatile and paints a clear picture when bias is shed and you actually pay attention so you guys have to get in the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm wrong, then maybe you should just go away.

       except that link and that logo stink of bullshit. find that logo anywhere other than that link that ends in CPS-PROOF.jpg. Go to that companies logo and compare the color scheme and actual logo, they dont match. That link that keeps getting posted over and over and everyone just accepting it, makes this whole thing that much more interesting.

       Are there counter arguments to it being "child protective services" ? sure. but that link does not prove shit.

       I mean, I don't know why you would think the Grand Rapids Auto Auction would be in on this. Do you not know what a Proof is with relation to graphic design? The fact that people think CPS-Proof.jpg means it's fake makes the whole argument that much more interesting. Looks like people will latch on to just about anything to try and discredit reasonable discussion when it goes against the PG narrative.

       Are you going to hold that same standard to the view that it's Child Protective Services? Has anyone shown proof this is a sticker for CPS (which doesn't even operate in the DC area)?

       Go to the Grand Rapids auto auction website. Go to their calendar. There is the logo.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been no alternative theory to what the logo is or represents. In the absence of that, since they look nearly identical, that seems like the most reasonable explaination since this whole theory about the car hinges on “CPS” but no one can provide anything else to debunk that it is the subprime auto finance company

       This is an equally unproven assertion.  It resembles the CPS logo, but only slightly.  Besides that, who drives around with a sticker for their auto finance company on their wondshield?

       No, not really. I get your suspicion but until I see a child protective services sticker (from another state, since DC doesn't have CPS) with that exact same look, I'm not sure how you could come to any other conclusion.

       Even then, until you can explain what 11th street has to do with Pegasus Museum two streets over, I still don't get the connection.

        I am not claiming the person is Child Protective Services. Simply that the single link used to "debunk" this, seems totally bogus, does not match the actual company who you are all claiming it is, and nothing adds up there.
       </li>

        That car is more likely from VA not DC based on the inspections and emissions stickers.
       </li>
       <li>
        The "Pegasus Museum" backs up to that house and is accessible from the other side on the alley. It is not two streets over as you claim. You can even clearly see the "kids" painted on the wall that was pointed out a long time ago during those days of pizzagate.

        I dont know who you think is trying to dig into anyones identity.

       I have no idea who that lady is, or who that kid is, but I know I have seen those steps, and that shit is creepy as fuck for street view to capture that scene. It is probably absolutely nothing, but for NONE of the reasons you stated.

       11th street and 13th street are two streets over, so I'm confused by the connection of a random woman and child on street view, who you yourself claim is not from child protective services, to Pegasus Museum, which is not even actually connected to child trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find a woman and child on street view "creepy as fuck", then that says more about you than anything. Maybe seek help. It must be awful for you to step out into public and see women with children.

       The registration sticker looks identical to DC’s. Or at lease provide any evidence it is more VA than DC. It appears to me that VA uses plate stickers for registration whereas DC uses windshield stickers.

       I see people with stickers for their car dealers all the time. Maybe she works there. Maybe it was on there when she bought/financed the car.

       If you don't think it's Consumer Portfolio Services, you don't think it's Child Protective Services, and you don't agree with the premise of the original post OP's talking about, what point are you even trying to make right now?

       No, that's what I'm asking. What, in your mind, am I trying to debunk? So far, we have what looks like an exact match on the stickers, which debunks the child protective services angle. We have no proof whatsoever that it's child protective services.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know that the street view is two streets down from Pegasus Museum, so there goes that angle.

      <p>
       You first.  I've never claimed to know the source of the sticker.  You, however, are acting quite certain.  So, with all of your certainty, find just one example of a Consumer Portfolio Services bumper sticker.  Just one.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are likely 100 or more divisions of child protective services in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia all within a couple hours (or less) drive to the address in question.  I don't have time to seek them all out for window stickers... yet Consumer Portfolio Services is but one company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your task should be quite simple.

       lol. Thanks for nothing! The evidence is there about the logo. Readers can choose to believe what they want and I don't really care if you don't believe this is a window decal for Consumer Portfolio Services and you don't have the time to provide any disputing evidence other than "the logo looks more like a 5 than an S."

       Only slightly?! Are you blind? Colors match and logo matches. Also, there is no CPS in DC. It’s the Child and Family Services Agency. And there is no logo for Virginia CPS.

       There are actually several depending on where you look.  I found one that was particularly interesting.  Took a few seconds with google.  Scroll down the linked page until you find "Virginia Department of Social Services."

       So like the exact point of Reddit? Maybe we shouldn't purposefully be riling people up, but I don't think that was the point of that post at all.

       The only reason to remove a post that isn’t breaking rules is to suppress the info it contains. Citing rule 8 says to me that the mod removing the posts are using their “discretion” as I don’t think the post qualifies as a “meme”. So why? When asked, the mod simply threatens to enforce another rule violation.

       Agreed. Pizzagate is probably one of the biggest conspiracies ever discussed on this sub. I’ve never seen so many attempts to debunk, twist the narrative or derail discussion. If it was nothing you would think people would just ignore it yet every thread related is FILLED with people who don’t believe it so heavily they feel the need to viciously attack anyone still interested.

       Exactly, never before was there such an obvious wall of shills that would stop at no logical fallacy to "debunk" or smear a conspiracy like pizzagate and pedogate. I guess they think it looks normal when a group of what equates to like 200 people come to a quiet thread and debunk some small tangent of the conspiracy and then say the whole thing is fake and 100% bedunked. They base this debunking on their burst of genius which was really just googling for like 5 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will legitimately refuse to use Google to look up supporting evidence but will type paragraphs of neatly spaced strawman on the most trivial and/or fake part of the conspiracy and act like it's the holy grail of debunking. These people will purposefully misconstrue what you say and will ignore anything they can't make sound silly with ad hominem attacks and strawmans, they never use google themselves if they aren't using it against you. They never stop asking for the most impossible pieces of evidence basically asking for absolutely undeniable proof of child rape by elites to be spoon fed to them where they'll either play dumb anyway or say it's a localized case of child abuse and just the "Satanic Panic".
      </p>
      <p>
       Normal people aren't this narcissistic and devoted to downplaying conspiracies about possible sex trafficking, period. Usually they jump to that one gunman story at Comet Ping Pong like it's literally our fault for being suspicious. Why don't you make a post about how LARPing/fake news can cause tragedies or how fact checking is important. Instead they come to these threads to berate us even admitting they're brigading for TMOR or that they cultishly believe its already been disproven basically because Meghan Kelly said so, on top of no full investigation taking place to provide real input from anyone besides internet users. They think the News is so Fake  they have to spend upwards of 40 hours a week to Operation Mockingbird it back to us thanks partly to the TopMindsOfReddit circlejerk.

       What's the difference between 9/11 and pizzagate?
      </p>
      <p>
       On 9/11 we all saw events unfold, what caused them precisely, we can question.
      </p>
      <p>
       With pizzagate there are no victims, no allegations. Pizzagate doesn't even have a "target" really - is it Podesta, Alefantis? Silsby? Luzzatto?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is a smear campaign and a distraction.

       I agree with you, despite thinking PG is bs.  This is the right forum for discussing it, but it’s not a safe place because it encourages critical thinking so theories can, and absolutely should, get challenged.

       Yes and I disagree with the mods on that front. I do not see why it should be any different than the litany of other topics discussed in the past.

       Especially when anyone worth their salt is aware of the pedophilic goings on in the power structures of the world.

      <p>
       Whether the specific individuals and places discussed in Pizzagate are involved is a matter of discussion but there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       pedophiles operating in politics without any shred of doubt and have since time immemorial.

       It originated during the 2016 primaries when CTR infiltrated the politics sub. Obviously a lot of their ilk, including ShareBlue now, have made their way to the conspiracy sub. It’s incredibly obvious though and is confirmed in my subjective opinion by the anamolous voting patterns.

      <p>
       There was a user here called PleadingtheYiff who posted a lot of the early pizzagate threads on t_d I think he fled to voat, not sure the details.

      <p>
       He's trying to monetize pizzagate.

       Or it was a bullshit post and was fabricated? The building she was being dropped off at wasn't even the one the OP claimed it was (it was around the corner and in back).

       Take note: this is how the whole LARP thing works, and how it preys on minds that want to believe it very badly.

       Even after the post is proved to be a dishonest fake, one way or another...it's STILL viewed by the LARPer as somehow additional

       In the end, he reveals himself to those who believed in him. Some walk out in anger, some accept they've been fooled, etc. What I found most interesting, however, is that some
       <em>
        continued
       </em>
       to believe he was the guru he pretended to be. I don't remember exactly what they said, but they performed some of the most amazing feats of mental contortionism I've ever seen in my life. Some people are beyond help.

       This particular half brained conspiracy ya’ll have cooked up is affecting actual people’s lives! It’s super fucked up. How horrible would it be if someone LARP’d through your history and pulled a bunch of random things out of context from your life, and millions of people around the world thought YOU were a pedophile. Every social media account, every YouTube channel, every article about you, will be filled with comments from people who have deemed you a sick fuck that deserves to die. That’s literally what you’re doing to real people that are most likely completely innocent of the bullshit you’ve all accused them of.

       just like this same post, it was debunked because it was clearly fake

       This is fucking simple. Pizzagate has never been proven. I can't prove Podesta or Alefantis isnt a pedophile.  It's just dumb to think they are off the extremely flimsy case pizzagate tries to make. Posts are made frequently on here claiming to be pizzagate evidence those can be debunked like the post from earlier. Claimed he had a Google image of a child protection service car dropping a kid of at an Alefantis property. People looked and Washington doesn't have their child protection named cps and she didn't go into an Alefantis property so that's means boom his claim was debunked

       It's not for the mods to decide what is factually true or not. That's the sole responsibility of the individual user. Otherwise, they'd have to remove Flat Earth posts all day long for not being based on facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that the OP is questionable at best, but I found several new aspects to consider through participating in it. For the mods to remove the post instead of just voicing their individual opinions and observations strikes me as counter-productive, as it stifles discussion and locks "believers" into their beliefs because they may see the censorship as confirmation.

       Can’t believe this has so many upvotes. Why should facts factor in when posting something to a conspiracy sub? Obviously some conspiracies are more factually-based than others, but since when has that been a prerequisite for posting?

       There’s just no room for ambiguity with you, huh? “Completely innocuous” isn’t a valid description for those emails. Some of them are cryptic at the very least, damning at the worst. What does it say about you that pedophilia is a topic which not only do you believe isn’t occurring on a widespread scale, but that you also try to stifle any and all discussion about it?

       And the other way would be yours. Seeing as no Democrat or even Republican lawmaker has tried to file charges and there's no national push at least my opinion isn t on the fringes. Plus no expert in pedophilia have said there's a problem with these emails. So you basically have a fringe belief with no expert consensus backing you up. Just users in here and 4chan and if that's your basis for fact get ready to be wrong alot

       Like I said, it’s happening on a widespread scale. There’s a lot of corruption and collusion involved with it, so I’m not expecting clear cut answers at this point. Pushing for the topic to be discussed is where we’re at now. I’m not worried about being wrong; I’m worried about being on the wrong side of history. Where is your place in the grand scheme?

       This isn't about wide spread pedophilia. It's about trying to claim a man who ran Hilary Clinton's campaign is a pedophile that uses code words that are simple enough for 14 year olds on 4chan to somehow decipher. Who also uses a pizza place as a front for his sexual abuse of children. Y'all aren't slick trying to tie the two together

       Prob should go to a different sub then? Conspiracy-related posts don’t need to be fact-based. Of course many are searching for the truth, but that can be difficult in an age of propaganda and purposeful obfuscation of our mass communication.

       Yeah but what about the one I posted before that about Antarctica? Even I admit it was pretty much bullshit, I thought it was more of just a coincidence that it looked like a thumb, thought it was funny. I was expecting them to remove it but they didn't. I don't see how that post could have more validity than a screen grab of a CPS worker dropping off a little girl at a supposed child trafficker's property.

       Also, now that you've seen you were wrong &amp; ate up a bullshit story without doing any research because it was easier to continue believing / promoting your narrative, where do you get off asking someone to prove a negative? That's the most BS logical fallacy after Gish Gallup.

       Meanwhile the number 2 post on this sub is an image that was BOTH posted before the pizza gate sub and had more votes. There's some selective  enforcement.

       That being said, while it definitely looked suspicious at first, it appeared to be a misinterpretation of the situation. The CPS sticker was not for child protective services, but rather, some insurance company or something. And the address was for a house adjacent to the Alefantis museum thing.

       Seems like deliberate misinfo, considering it takes 2 minutes of google image search to find the logo. I think this is why so many people don't believe PG. Because easily debunked things like this, which are easily debunked even by amateur sleuths, gets so much publicity as some type of evidence.

       Research does not mean confirm. I research the claims and post my findings. I have no say in what the reality of the situation is. I'm only trying to shine light on it.

      <p>
       We can agree to disagree, but I don't think there's anything wrong with describing my reasoning and presenting the facts that back it up, especially when OP is asking for an explanation in the title.

       <p>
        The land is apparently still owned by a Russian emigre named Boris Tochilin, who has since moved to Dumfries, Virginia.

        Then, there’s the big rowhouse in the Embassy Row area on California Street in Kalorama, formerly shared with ex-partner David Brock.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next in McLean, Virginia, the hometown of the CIA and George Bush Center for Intelligence, Alefantes owns four buildings: 6513 Brawner, 117 Randolph Road, 49 Chain Bridge Road, and another on 7703 Dearborn.
       </p>

        At Harrisonburg, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley, a town with a lot of schools and a heavy concentration of sex offenders, near the West Virginia state line, there are two addresses: 1352 Bradley Drive and 148 W. Wolfe Street.

        Washington D.C. in the Northwest quadrant, four properties: 1536 Swann, 1404 P ST, 3334 N ST, 455 Massachusetts Avenue, and 2022 Columbia Road (near Dupont Circle).

        Mama Mia!

        Too bad John Gotti’s not around cause he knew how to deal with Satanic pedophiles who aren’t telling the truth about what they’ve been up to or where they get their money.which happened in the same time frame as the trial of arch-pedophile pediatrician Earl Bradley.
       </p>
       <p>
        David Brock’s home, a 200-year-old heritage house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, was demolished. . .
       </p>
       <p>
        which happened in the same time frame as the trial of arch-pedophile pediatrician Earl Bradley. Brock sold that house for more than a million dollars, but had earlier purchased it for a little more than half that amount.
       </p>
       <p>
        Numero $606,666.
       </p>
       <p>
        he previous owner was a Satanist, and so’s David Brock? It’s a no-brainer, doc.

       You mean all conspiracy theories in general right? Luckily the existence of theories like Flat-earth disproved any legitimacy of any theory. Just like this absurd factually wrong post disproved all the shady stuff around pizzagate.

       So, the deletion of pizzagate subreddit when it was obviously just an information hub at that point. The immediate "debunking" before people finished formulating their suspicions didn't seem shady to you? In fact that's the kind of coordination I see. I also see people post the weakest and most stupid conclusions of pizzagate daily so that also makes me believe there is a coordinated effort to undermine the theory, which in turn just raises my suspicions further. All anyone wanted was an honest investigation. What they got in return was a (most likely) hired actor breaching into comet ping pong putting a bullet through their computer. Maybe that's not enough to raise your eyebrows but I'll argue that's out of naivety. Nothing is certain, but suspicion is warranted imo.

       "doxxing" can be used an excuse for nearly everything. Intent is important when trying to justify bans when they are as vague as that. The subreddit was organic and gained traction extremely fast. Reddit used to be made for the users, thats the whole idea of the site, don't forget that.

       There's some shady stuff around Pizzagate, but a lot of it comes from inferring that Comet Pizza and Ping Pong is a Chuck-e-Cheese type place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like it's just a trendy Pizza place in DC that is popular with liberal Millennials and Xers, and they have some counter culture vibes.  That could easily explain edgy, inappropriate sounding in-jokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone would argue that James Alefantis isn't a bit of a weirdo, but that doesn't mean he's running a secret pedophile ring.  If he is, I'm going to need to see more proof than edgy jokes on instagram, swirl patterns, and multicolored napkins.

       You said people were purposefully posting disinformation just to debunk it. I said people may genuinely post these things. I didn't say it was in bad faith. I mean people genuinely believe what they are posting is true. The comment you replied to was specific but I just took yours at face value and responded to the non specific disinformation movement. Like just disinfo across the board.  I guess you could agree that you would also apply this to things other than PG related issues.

       You said it was a disinformation movement. I assumed you meant in general. But I don't think that post was done in bad faith, I just think the author  was just wrong. Not on purpose though. people who post about PG are pretty passionate about their beliefs in it, so I'd rather not engage tbh because I do have conflicting views and I'm not trying to get into a debate where someone's morals and concern for children are involved. it's a no win for either person. I don't get into it about religion, abortion, or other debates where someone's morals are questioned or dissected. I hope you can understand bc I really try to consider that not everyone has disingenuous motives when it comes to their stance on this issue.

       "evidence"
Man you people are sad. From the outside it almost appears as a psychosis, but I'm certain its more of gullibility issue. You all have proven to be incredibly subseptable to bullshit.

       I think it's sad you think you're proving anything by leaving your echo chamber and coming here to make empty claims, accusations, and illogical fallacies.

       Again, what proof do your have for Hastert and Trump being friends?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the FBI's info on the pedophile symbols? Besta Pizza's logo?
      </p>
      <p>
       Heavy Breathing, footage of their "performance", symbology usage, and artwork used for their events?
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp; Marina's spirit cooking with the Podesta Bros?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis' IG? Whats Pegasus for? What does alefantis translate to?
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened to Welch 6 weeks before the shooting? How possible is it for his single bullet to go throw a door at a ridiculous angle to pierce the maybe only hypothetically incriminating thing in the Restaurant? Why hasn't the FBI contacted the young man 
Epstein, a convicted pedophile, who co-founded the Clinton Foundation.
Where would the 'Lolita Express' fly to? What does Lolita mean? Why did Bill shed Secret Service for over half his trips on that Plane? Funny how Kevin Spacey being on that plane frequently has a new light to it too, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       'A Conspiracy of Silence'? Whose Larry King and what happened in Boystown?
      </p>
      <p>
       'An Open Secret'? We all know hollywood is a powerful cesspool, and PizzaGate is in reference to Podesta's emails. He is a connected man so the topic of PizzaGate is more so about the elite's taste for pedophilia and the systems that uphold their disgusting crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp; I could fucking go on, so tell me. What evidence do you have?

       lol, this user is literally delusional. They've convinced themselves that it's a little boy because their insane theory becomes even more ridiculously insane if it's not.

       I think they are referring to chicken when they say "chicken" and here's my reasoning:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The hashtag
         <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/chickenlovers/">
          #chickenlovers
         </a>
         returns a lot of
         <del>
          almost
         </del>
         exclusively (as far as I can tell) chicken related results, but not every picture has chicken in it. Regardless of whether there's a chicken or not, they appear to always reference chicken with no sexual references at all. Meaning that, based on context of the hashtag, it's likely that #chickenlovers is referencing chickens.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The same little girl had previously been pictured with a chicken plush toy:
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/9qr4psv.jpg">
          http://themillenniumreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/9qr4psv.jpg
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         My logic here is that she has been shown to like chickens, so it's likely the hashtag is referencing chickens.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You mention they're at a pizza shop.
         <a href="https://www.pizzahut.ca/menu/pizza">
          "Meat Lover's" and "Chicken Lover's" pizza
         </a>
         are fairly common pizza names, and are terms that are often used when
         <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22chicken+lovers%22+pizza">
          referencing pizza
         </a>
         . Meaning that, given the context (them being around pizza), it's likely they're referring to chicken.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your definition of "chicken lover" says adult male-underage male. The picture is of an adult male and a little girl. This means that, given the context (no "underage male"), this interpretation doesn't make sense.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Because of these points, I can't reasonably conclude there's a link between the picture you posted and sex. If you disagree, I'd like to read your reasoning, particularly given #4 above.

       I can ask you the exact same thing. Can you find one picture that includes a man holding a baby girl that references chickenlovers in a sexual way? "Ya know".
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument relies on the idea that people can be chicken lovers. Why would I have to find one that includes, specifically, a man and a baby girl. A woman can be a chicken lover (there's at least one of them in the search). A man can be as well (also a picture of a man). There's a few with groups and a few with just a baby. The common denominator: They all refer to literal chickens. If you scroll down far enough, you'll even find pictures that don't included chickens at all. Still clearly referencing chickens.

       It's very hard to prove a negative, especially with regards to pizzagate. But if the little girl has been shown to like chickens, then it's just about what is more

       Could also be a reference to chicken. Here's the difference between our arguments: I'm proving evidence to back up my possible conclusion. You also say, "again", but I don't think you've proven that they are "signaling" before. You're getting ahead of yourself and want the viewer to believe that they are "signaling

      <p>
       The little girl has been doxxed multiple times. Less than 5 minutes of google research should have revealed that to you, too (had you bothered to actually research the evidence you're presenting as your strongest).

I've provided links and evidence that back-up my reasoning and your response has been to simply speculate that it could be other things, while providing zero evidence or sources. Merely speculations. The one piece of evidence you
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       provided, doesn't make sense, given that there's no underage male in the picture. An underage male is a specific part of your assumed definition. Anyone can be a literal chicken lover so my definition actually works, while yours doesn't.

        The little girl has been doxxed multiple times. It's a picture of a man and his daughter. Less than 5 minutes of google research should have revealed that to you, too (had you bothered to actually research the evidence you're presenting as your strongest).

       Nope your arguments are assumptions based on what you

       is true. No real evidence provided by you.

      <p>
       Links and evidence that chicken lover could also mean people that like chicken. Wow, very informing I

       couldn't figure that out myself.

       I actually provided multiple definitions, So your lieing.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Merely speculations. The one piece of evidence you have provided, doesn't make sense, given that there's no underage male in the picture. An underage male is a specific part of your assumed definition. Anyone can be a literal chicken lover so my definition actually works, while yours doesn't.

       I've found other similar pictures in the past, but they've been all personal and I don't want to break any doxxing rules. This one, however, is a business profile, so I think it's fair game.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a picture of a man (and a woman) with a little girl. The one hashtag this picture has reads "#chickenlovers". There are no chickens in the picture. Even the caption doesn't actually mention chickens. We only know for sure they are talking about chickens, and the people who love them, because of the logo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly ask yourself what you think is the most likely explanation, given the context.

       I was asking for a pic of a man holding a baby boy with the hashtag chickenlover.

       You provided a picture of a man and a woman with a girl on their shoulders and what is clearly a AD for some random chicken based shop.

       Given the context of them all being super gay and having straight up sexual art on their pizza shop walls it's pretty fucking likely their talking about loving little boys. And I didn't even bring up the yellow bracelet thing yet.

       Anyone else find it odd that the image URL above literally says "CPS-PROOF" in it? Does this imply it was recently uploaded as proof to this sub? Just my two cents.

        Proof is a common term for graphic arts

       . It implies that the image is a "proof," it has nothing to do with being recently uploaded as proof.

       Is there any evidence the Hispanic-looking woman in jean shorts and flip flops was "dropping off" the hispanic-looking child to the house that is owned by a person with a Hispanic-sounding name (available on the DC Property Tax/Assessor website)? Or could they possibly live there?

       Also, I noticed on streetview that the graffiti has been on the wall since at least 2011.

       You are implying that logical explanations don't belong here and that wild speculations are more valid.  This happens all the time.  The post has been debunked and yet people are still trying to twist it to fit their false narrative.  Burying your head in the sand and ignoring obvious answers is not just how it works because it's a conspiracy theory.

       Maybe for posts like this, they shouldn't be deleted, but annotated with evidence that proves the hypothesis is a mistake?

      <p>
       That way everyone is informed and we can avoid people thinking there's a conspiracy to silence folks. Then this doesn't turn into a spiral of misinformation. It would protect us from our overzealous selves, and keep us from losing any more time than needed.

       Do you honestly not know the difference between a car dealer and a finance company?

       Besides, dealers put their sticker on the rear.

      <p>
       Why?  I've never said that it was Child Protective Services.  You are the one here trying to assert that you know with 100% certainty that this sticker originated with Consumer Portfolio Services.

      <p>
       But you haven't actually proven that.

       Is it so hard to believe that there are actually just fools out there who are believing and promoting this? Does there Have to be a conspiracy of bread crumbs? Why can't it just be that the Pizzagaters are wrong on their own accord?

       11th street and 13th street are two streets over, so I'm confused by the connection of a random woman and child on street view, who you yourself claim is not from child protective services, to Pegasus Museum, which is not even actually connected to child trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find a woman and child on street view "creepy as fuck", then that says more about you than anything. Maybe seek help. It must be awful for you to step out into public and see women with children.

       Nah, so maybe if you haven't been looking into this since the beginning, and you're upset that the post OP is talking about is complete bullshit, you shouldn't be talking as if you know anything about this. Thanks, though!

       The registration sticker looks identical to DC’s. Or at lease provide any evidence it is more VA than DC. It appears to me that VA uses plate stickers for registration whereas DC uses windshield stickers.
