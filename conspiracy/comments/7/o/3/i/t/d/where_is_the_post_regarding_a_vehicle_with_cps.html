<p>Let&#39;s put aside whether or not the image is <em>actually</em> even at the location the screenshot says it is. That is irrelevant, because...</p>

<p>Here is the sticker on the car windshield, it&#39;s &quot;CPS&quot;, but not THAT CPS:</p>

<p>It&#39;s not Child Protective Services. It&#39;s an auto finance company.</p>

<p>Any apologies/retractions forthcoming? Any honest contemplation about how so many people jumped toward their pre-existing conclusions and screwed up so badly on the facts <em>yet again</em>? Using, <em>again</em>, a single incorrect image to once again leap to the highest heights of #pizzagate fan fiction?</p>

<p>I thought not.</p>

<p>Maybe if you&#39;re so certain its bullshit then an independent and clear investigation should be had into Comet, the Podesta Bros, CF, and wherever it leads</p>

<p>Whats wrong with getting the answers that we want? You clearly want us to shut up, you&#39;re leaving your cozy echo chambers to come pick fights here as if theres a goal involved. </p>

<p>Why are y&#39;all so focused on disrupting the dissemination and discussion of this topic? Maybe because the evidence is so volatile and paints a clear picture when bias is shed and you actually pay attention so you guys have to get in the way.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong, then maybe you should just go away.</p>

<p>There has been no alternative theory to what the logo is or represents.

<p>This is an equally unproven assertion.  It resembles the CPS logo, but only slightly.  Besides that, who drives around with a sticker for their auto finance company on their wondshield?</p>

<p>What do you mean only slightly? It&#39;s the same logo, it&#39;s the same color scheme split at the same curve. The same color text on both sides of the curve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not really. I get your suspicion but until I see a child protective services sticker (from another state, since DC doesn&#39;t have CPS) with that exact same look, I&#39;m not sure how you could come to any other conclusion.</p>

<p>Even then, until you can explain what 11th street has to do with Pegasus Museum two streets over, I still don&#39;t get the connection.</p>

<li>I am not claiming the person is Child Protective Services. Simply that the single link used to &quot;debunk&quot; this, seems totally bogus, does not match the actual company who you are all claiming it is, and nothing adds up there. </li>
<li>That car is more likely from VA not DC based on the inspections and emissions stickers. </li>
<li>The &quot;Pegasus Museum&quot; backs up to that house and is accessible from the other side on the alley. It is not two streets over as you claim. You can even clearly see the &quot;kids&quot; painted on the wall that was pointed out a long time ago during those days of pizzagate. </li>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure this is the only company in history to have a sticker that looks exactly like the Consumer Portfolio Services one.</p>

<p>I see people with stickers for their car dealers all the time. Maybe she works there. Maybe it was on there when she bought/financed the car. Sorry I&#39;m not jumping immediately to &quot;she&#39;s child protective services dropping a child off at a house blocks away from a business that 4chan thinks is a sex trafficking ring.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure, just check the google street view from the original thread. How about you find me a Child Protective Services sticker that looks like that. We already have a Consumer Portfolio Services sticker that looks like an exact match. Thanks!</p>

<p>You first.  I&#39;ve never claimed to know the source of the sticker.  You, however, are acting quite certain.  So, with all of your certainty, find just one example of a Consumer Portfolio Services bumper sticker.  Just one.</p>

<p>There are likely 100 or more divisions of child protective services in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia all within a couple hours (or less) drive to the address in question.  I don&#39;t have time to seek them all out for window stickers... yet Consumer Portfolio Services is but one company.</p>

<p>Your task should be quite simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Pizzagate is probably one of the biggest conspiracies ever discussed on this sub. I’ve never seen so many attempts to debunk, twist the narrative or derail discussion. If it was nothing you would think people would just ignore it yet every thread related is FILLED with people who don’t believe it so heavily they feel the need to viciously attack anyone still interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, never before was there such an obvious wall of shills that would stop at no logical fallacy to &quot;debunk&quot; or smear a conspiracy like pizzagate and pedogate. I guess they think it looks normal when a group of what equates to like 200 people come to a quiet thread and debunk some small tangent of the conspiracy and then say the whole thing is fake and 100% bedunked. They base this debunking on their burst of genius which was really just googling for like 5 minutes. </p>

<p>They will legitimately refuse to use Google to look up supporting evidence but will type paragraphs of neatly spaced strawman on the most trivial and/or fake part of the conspiracy and act like it&#39;s the holy grail of debunking. These people will purposefully misconstrue what you say and will ignore anything they can&#39;t make sound silly with ad hominem attacks and strawmans, they never use google themselves if they aren&#39;t using it against you. They never stop asking for the most impossible pieces of evidence basically asking for absolutely undeniable proof of child rape by elites to be spoon fed to them where they&#39;ll either play dumb anyway or say it&#39;s a localized case of child abuse and just the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot;. </p>

<p>Normal people aren&#39;t this narcissistic and devoted to downplaying conspiracies about possible sex trafficking, period. Usually they jump to that one gunman story at Comet Ping Pong like it&#39;s literally our fault for being suspicious. Why don&#39;t you make a post about how LARPing/fake news can cause tragedies or how fact checking is important. Instead they come to these threads to berate us even admitting they&#39;re brigading for TMOR or that they cultishly believe its already been disproven basically because Meghan Kelly said so, on top of no full investigation taking place to provide real input from anyone besides internet users. They think the News is so Fake  they have to spend upwards of 40 hours a week to Operation Mockingbird it back to us thanks partly to the TopMindsOfReddit circlejerk.</p>

<p>Especially when anyone worth their salt is aware of the pedophilic goings on in the power structures of the world.</p>

<p>Whether the specific individuals and places discussed in Pizzagate are involved is a matter of discussion but there <em>are</em> pedophiles operating in politics without any shred of doubt and have since time immemorial. </p>

<p>Take note: this is how the whole LARP thing works, and how it preys on minds that want to believe it very badly.</p>

<p>Even after the post is proved to be a dishonest fake, one way or another...it&#39;s STILL viewed by the LARPer as somehow additional <em>proof</em> of the LARP as a whole instead of (you know) evidence that the LARP might be a fiction led by less-than-honest content creators.</p>

How horrible would it be if someone LARP’d through your history and pulled a bunch of random things out of context from your life, and millions of people around the world thought YOU were a pedophile. Every social media account, every YouTube channel, every article about you, will be filled with comments from people who have deemed you a sick fuck that deserves to die. That’s literally what you’re doing to real people that are most likely completely innocent of the bullshit you’ve all accused them of. </p>

<p>the theory cannot be debunked, the same way believing in god cannon be debunked, but the posts with &quot;&quot;proof&quot;&quot; have been debunked as clearly faked</p>

<p>just like this same post, it was debunked because it was clearly fake</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is fucking simple. Pizzagate has never been proven. I can&#39;t prove Podesta or Alefantis isnt a pedophile.  It&#39;s just dumb to think they are off the extremely flimsy case pizzagate tries to make. Posts are made frequently on here claiming to be pizzagate evidence those can be debunked like the post from earlier. Claimed he had a Google image of a child protection service car dropping a kid of at an Alefantis property. People looked and Washington doesn&#39;t have their child protection named cps and she didn&#39;t go into an Alefantis property so that&#39;s means boom his claim was debunked</p>

<p>I agree that the OP is questionable at best, but I found several new aspects to consider through participating in it. For the mods to remove the post instead of just voicing their individual opinions and observations strikes me as counter-productive, as it stifles discussion and locks &quot;believers&quot; into their beliefs because they may see the censorship as confirmation.</p>

<p>The Pegasus museum under development by Castellum Alefantes LLC on 11th Street NW in D.C. </p>

<p>The land is apparently still owned by a Russian emigre named Boris Tochilin, who has since moved to Dumfries, Virginia.</p>

<p>Then, there’s the big rowhouse in the Embassy Row area on California Street in Kalorama, formerly shared with ex-partner David Brock.</p>

<p>Next in McLean, Virginia, the hometown of the CIA and George Bush Center for Intelligence, Alefantes owns four buildings: 6513 Brawner, 117 Randolph Road, 49 Chain Bridge Road, and another on 7703 Dearborn.</p>

<p>At Harrisonburg, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley, a town with a lot of schools and a heavy concentration of sex offenders, near the West Virginia state line, there are two addresses: 1352 Bradley Drive and 148 W. Wolfe Street.</p>

<p>Washington D.C. in the Northwest quadrant, four properties: 1536 Swann, 1404 P ST, 3334 N ST, 455 Massachusetts Avenue, and 2022 Columbia Road (near Dupont Circle).</p>

<p>Finally, in New York’s Upper East Side: 145 E 48th ST #29F.</p>

<p>Mama Mia! </p>

<p>That’s a lot of pizzas sold</p>

<p>Too bad John Gotti’s not around cause he knew how to deal with Satanic pedophiles who aren’t telling the truth about what they’ve been up to or where they get their money.which happened in the same time frame as the trial of arch-pedophile pediatrician Earl Bradley. </p>

<p>David Brock’s home, a 200-year-old heritage house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, was demolished. . . </p>

<p>which happened in the same time frame as the trial of arch-pedophile pediatrician Earl Bradley. Brock sold that house for more than a million dollars, but had earlier purchased it for a little more than half that amount.</p>

<p>Numero $606,666. </p>

<p>he previous owner was a Satanist, and so’s David Brock? It’s a no-brainer, doc.</p>

<p>The Eastern Shore of Delaware and Maryland are a haven for Satanists of all shades, from tame nature-loving wiccans and entry-level </p>

<p>LaVey churches to drug-crazed heavy-metal maniacs. As if there aren’t already enough fans of Lucifer inside this </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, the deletion of pizzagate subreddit when it was obviously just an information hub at that point. The immediate &quot;debunking&quot; before people finished formulating their suspicions didn&#39;t seem shady to you? In fact that&#39;s the kind of coordination I see. I also see people post the weakest and most stupid conclusions of pizzagate daily so that also makes me believe there is a coordinated effort to undermine the theory, which in turn just raises my suspicions further. All anyone wanted was an honest investigation. What they got in return was a (most likely) hired actor breaching into comet ping pong putting a bullet through their computer. Maybe that&#39;s not enough to raise your eyebrows but I&#39;ll argue that&#39;s out of naivety. Nothing is certain, but suspicion is warranted imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s some shady stuff around Pizzagate, but a lot of it comes from inferring that Comet Pizza and Ping Pong is a Chuck-e-Cheese type place.</p>

<p>Seems like it&#39;s just a trendy Pizza place in DC that is popular with liberal Millennials and Xers, and they have some counter culture vibes.  That could easily explain edgy, inappropriate sounding in-jokes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone would argue that James Alefantis isn&#39;t a bit of a weirdo, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s running a secret pedophile ring.  If he is, I&#39;m going to need to see more proof than edgy jokes on instagram, swirl patterns, and multicolored napkins.</p>

<p>You said people were purposefully posting disinformation just to debunk it. I said people may genuinely post these things. I didn&#39;t say it was in bad faith. I mean people genuinely believe what they are posting is true. The comment you replied to was specific but I just took yours at face value and responded to the non specific disinformation movement.

<p>What about the FBI&#39;s info on the pedophile symbols? Besta Pizza&#39;s logo?</p>

<p>Heavy Breathing, footage of their &quot;performance&quot;, symbology usage, and artwork used for their events? </p>

<p>&amp; Marina&#39;s spirit cooking with the Podesta Bros?</p>

<p>Alefantis&#39; IG? Whats Pegasus for? What does alefantis translate to?</p>

<p>What happened to Welch 6 weeks before the shooting? How possible is it for his single bullet to go throw a door at a ridiculous angle to pierce the maybe only hypothetically incriminating thing in the Restaurant? Why hasn&#39;t the FBI contacted the young man 
Epstein, a convicted pedophile, who co-founded the Clinton Foundation.
Where would the &#39;Lolita Express&#39; fly to? What does Lolita mean? Why did Bill shed Secret Service for over half his trips on that Plane? Funny how Kevin Spacey being on that plane frequently has a new light to it too, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>&#39;A Conspiracy of Silence&#39;? Whose Larry King and what happened in Boystown?</p>

<p>&#39;An Open Secret&#39;? We all know hollywood is a powerful cesspool, and PizzaGate is in reference to Podesta&#39;s emails. He is a connected man so the topic of PizzaGate is more so about the elite&#39;s taste for pedophilia and the systems that uphold their disgusting crimes.</p>

<p>&amp; I could fucking go on, so tell me. What evidence do you have?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they are referring to chicken when they say &quot;chicken&quot; and here&#39;s my reasoning:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The hashtag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/chickenlovers/">#chickenlovers</a> returns a lot of <del>almost</del> exclusively (as far as I can tell) chicken related results, but not every picture has chicken in it. Regardless of whether there&#39;s a chicken or not, they appear to always reference chicken with no sexual references at all. Meaning that, based on context of the hashtag, it&#39;s likely that #chickenlovers is referencing chickens.</p></li>
<li><p>The same little girl had previously been pictured with a chicken plush toy:</p>

<p><a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/9qr4psv.jpg">http://themillenniumreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/9qr4psv.jpg</a></p>

<p>My logic here is that she has been shown to like chickens, so it&#39;s likely the hashtag is referencing chickens.</p></li>
<li><p>You mention they&#39;re at a pizza shop. <a href="https://www.pizzahut.ca/menu/pizza">&quot;Meat Lover&#39;s&quot; and &quot;Chicken Lover&#39;s&quot; pizza</a> are fairly common pizza names, and are terms that are often used when <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22chicken+lovers%22+pizza">referencing pizza</a>. Meaning that, given the context (them being around pizza), it&#39;s likely they&#39;re referring to chicken.</p></li>
<li><p>Your definition of &quot;chicken lover&quot; says adult male-underage male. The picture is of an adult male and a little girl. This means that, given the context (no &quot;underage male&quot;), this interpretation doesn&#39;t make sense.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Because of these points, I can&#39;t reasonably conclude there&#39;s a link between the picture you posted and sex. If you disagree, I&#39;d like to read your reasoning, particularly given #4 above.</p>

<p>I can ask you the exact same thing. Can you find one picture that includes a man holding a baby girl that references chickenlovers in a sexual way? &quot;Ya know&quot;.</p>

<p>My argument relies on the idea that people can be chicken lovers. Why would I have to find one that includes, specifically, a man and a baby girl. A woman can be a chicken lover (there&#39;s at least one of them in the search). A man can be as well (also a picture of a man). There&#39;s a few with groups and a few with just a baby. The common denominator: They all refer to literal chickens. If you scroll down far enough, you&#39;ll even find pictures that don&#39;t included chickens at all. Still clearly referencing chickens.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll ask you the same: Can you find one picture that includes a man holding a baby girl that  clearly references chickenlovers in a sexual way?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The meaning that every definition site comes up with, But which you simply refuse to believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep saying your definitions say that, but they don&#39;t. None of your definitions say that the underage person can be female. They say adult male and underage male. There is no underage males in the picture. Your definition makes no sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok? That still doesn&#39;t disprove my point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s very hard to prove a negative, especially with regards to pizzagate. But if the little girl has been shown to like chickens, then it&#39;s just about what is more <strong>likely</strong>.  Honestly ask yourself what a reasonable person would conclude given the fact that the little girl has already been documented to like chickens. Again, I can literally ask you the same thing: Can you disprove my point?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could just be them signaling their shit again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could also be a reference to chicken. Here&#39;s the difference between our arguments: I&#39;m proving evidence to back up my possible conclusion. You also say, &quot;again&quot;, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve proven that they are &quot;signaling&quot; before. You&#39;re getting ahead of yourself and want the viewer to believe that they are &quot;signaling <strong>again</strong>&quot;, but you have yet to provide any evidence that they have done this before.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cool, This argument would only work if they had any of that specific pizza in the pic, Since most people don&#39;t know that they wouldn&#39;t post it without the pizza.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re only responding to my first link. Did you click on the second link? There&#39;s tons of references to pizza <em>for</em> &quot;chicken lovers&quot;. Not the name of the pizza. Clearly &quot;chicken lovers&quot; is used to refer to the people and not the pizza topping specifically. Why didn&#39;t you respond to that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your assuming it&#39;s a girl when it could easily be a boy considering the staff is all super gay and probably just dresses him up in pink.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The little girl has been doxxed multiple times. Less than 5 minutes of google research should have revealed that to you, too (had you bothered to actually research the evidence you&#39;re presenting as your strongest).</p>

<p>Do you really not see that <strong>you&#39;re</strong> the one making assumptions here? I&#39;m basing my conclusions based on the evidence, not my assumptions. I simply researched the term in the same context as the picture. I&#39;ve provided links and evidence that back-up my reasoning and your response has been to simply speculate that it could be other things, while providing zero evidence or sources. Merely speculations. The one piece of evidence you <em>have</em> provided, doesn&#39;t make sense, given that there&#39;s no underage male in the picture. An underage male is a specific part of your assumed definition. Anyone can be a literal chicken lover so my definition actually works, while yours doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;m basing my conclusions based on the evidence, not my assumptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope your arguments are assumptions based on what you <em>feel</em> is true. No real evidence provided by you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I simply researched the term in the same context as the picture. I&#39;ve provided links and evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Links and evidence that chicken lover could also mean people that like chicken. Wow, very informing I <em>definitely</em> couldn&#39;t figure that out myself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and your response has been to simply speculate that it could be other things, while providing zero evidence or sources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually provided multiple definitions, So your lieing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Merely speculations. The one piece of evidence you have provided, doesn&#39;t make sense, given that there&#39;s no underage male in the picture. An underage male is a specific part of your assumed definition. Anyone can be a literal chicken lover so my definition actually works, while yours doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Again, I will ask you to source that it is a girl. </p>

<p>I have a feeling you will delete your comments/stop replying now.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a picture of a man (and a woman) with a little girl. The one hashtag this picture has reads &quot;#chickenlovers&quot;. There are no chickens in the picture. Even the caption doesn&#39;t actually mention chickens. We only know for sure they are talking about chickens, and the people who love them, because of the logo.</p>

<p>Honestly ask yourself what you think is the most likely explanation, given the context.</p>

<p>I was asking for a pic of a man holding a baby boy with the hashtag chickenlover.</p>

<p>You provided a picture of a man and a woman with a girl on their shoulders and what is clearly a AD for some random chicken based shop.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not doxxing when the photos are public on the internet.</p>

<p>Given the context of them all being super gay and having straight up sexual art on their pizza shop walls it&#39;s pretty fucking likely their talking about loving little boys. And I didn&#39;t even bring up the yellow bracelet thing yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pressproof.com/Graphics_Library/prepress/prepress_k.html">Proof is a common term for graphic arts</a>. It implies that the image is a &quot;proof,&quot; it has nothing to do with being recently uploaded as proof.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence the Hispanic-looking woman in jean shorts and flip flops was &quot;dropping off&quot; the hispanic-looking child to the house that is owned by a person with a Hispanic-sounding name (available on the DC Property Tax/Assessor website)? Or could they possibly live there? </p>

<p>You are implying that logical explanations don&#39;t belong here and that wild speculations are more valid.  This happens all the time.

<p>I&#39;ve never claimed that.</p>

<p>Do you honestly not know the difference between a car dealer and a finance company?</p>

<p>Besides, dealers put their sticker on the rear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about you find me a Child Protective Services sticker that looks like that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why?  I&#39;ve never said that it was Child Protective Services.  You are the one here trying to assert that you know with 100% certainty that this sticker originated with Consumer Portfolio Services.  </p>

<p>But you haven&#39;t actually proven that.</p>

<p>Actually, I did.  I even told you where to find the logo.  I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re aware, but it&#39;s not possible to embed photos into reddit comments.</p>

<p>Actually, it is.  Here, visit their website:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>11th street and 13th street are two streets over, so I&#39;m confused by the connection of a random woman and child on street view, who you yourself claim is not from child protective services, to Pegasus Museum, which is not even actually connected to child trafficking.</p>

<p>If you find a woman and child on street view &quot;creepy as fuck&quot;, then that says more about you than anything. Maybe seek help. It must be awful for you to step out into public and see women with children.</p>
