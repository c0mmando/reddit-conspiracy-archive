    <div class="md"><p>ok im going to try and explain this in the hope it sheds a light on what you are as a living being..</p>

<p>firstly i want you to keep an open mind as some of this may sound like new age mumbo jumbo . it is in fact old age mumbo jumbo but with out the mumbo jumbo ..</p>

<p>frequencies and chakras , know anything about these 2 things ? </p>

<p>no ? yes ? ok lets go ..</p>

<p>higher vibrations and frequencies  mean happiness , simple as that .. good way to raise your frequencies is meditation and music  , dancing , doing what makes you happy .. anything at all uplifting , ever notice how some churches have singing thats uplifting ? gospel music ? i dont want to sound religious here but ever hear of raising of the spirit in the bible ? </p>

<p>see they have known this for thousands of years , so do you , you knew this when you were a child but they took it from you..</p>

<p>heres why they do it , </p>

<p>they are modern sages , dark magicians and they know all about the occult , they practice alchemy and sell it labeled as pharmaceuticals .. get the picture ?</p>

<p>ok heres the mumbo jumbo ..</p>

<p>depression creates bad habits , you eat fast food , you dont get the nutrition you need ..</p>

<p>ever see the noncommercials where they guys all happy because hes eating a balanced diet ?  </p>

<p>hes trying to do you a favor .. and take your money at the same time , more magic..</p>

<p>but , eating helps with raising the frequencies making you feel happy ..</p>

<p>health happiness and well being..</p>

<p>they know the secrets of diet . they know how to heal , they sell you drugs they make that cause side effects .. you need more of their drugs to combat that :)</p>

<p>lets not forget their vitamin supplements .. what a scam that is </p>

<p>the military industrial complex is one big drug cartel..</p>

<p>they push an agenda for oil barons , pharmaceutical manufactures , bomb and weapons manufactures to name a few , they have hollywood and the media  by the balls . scripts go through them and will be rewritten in accordance to their narrative . they create your reality...    dark magicians with dark intentions , lowering your frequencies to make you not just unhappy but under nourished and ill , this leads to negative thoughts ,</p>

<p>to combat this ..</p>

<p>learn about chakras , their frequencies , learn how to meditate based on <a href="https://www.living-one-vibrational-energy.com/chakras">frequencies and chakras</a> . learn them .. </p>

<p>learn what they know and use it to help free your self from their dark agenda ..</p>

<p>from the link </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Root Chakra is located at the base of the spine. It is nearest to the grounding of the Earth. It represents vitality, survival instincts, and the emotions of desire, anger, jealousy and greed. An imbalance of the first chakra may show as a loss of interest in the real world and practical survival, obsessions, addictions, volatile emotions, restlessness, selfishness and a lack of energy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>see their intentions to lower your frequencies ? </p>

<p>im not a fan of mumbo jumbo but this knowledge has been known for thousands of years and practiced by millions of people who seem to have a vibrency and wear a smile ..</p>

<p>if you surround your self with their dark agenda you will be a pawn in the game . negativity ..</p>

<p>the body has 2 polls , a positive and negative . ancient Egyptians knew this and slept with the head facing north  .. they also knew about the body and its secrets ..</p>

<p>so do the dark magicians .. fight fire with fire , know their magic and use it to help your self .</p>

<p>stay positive .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much of this. People need to research quantum physics and how our reality really exists. Due to the fact that everything is energy, existing only due to sound vibrations. Positivity vibrates at a high frequency and negativity at low frequencies. I am absolutely convinced that the powers that be want everyone in a very low vibrating state. We&#39;re much easier to persuade in that state. </p>

<p>Think about why it is that every morning if you wake up to watch the news it is one negative story after another. It&#39;s all shaped to make you feel as though there is danger and death around every corner. To set us all apart from one another. They sell us crappy, processed foods and keep most of our wages low enough that the crap food is all we can afford or at least think it&#39;s all we can afford. We eat meat produced in factory farms where the animals are brimming with anxiety and stress as they are slaughtered. We eat that anxiety and stress. All this leads to negative, low vibrating energy.</p>

<p>Really think about how our world and society is shaped today. What messages are being put into your head? Commercials convince you your life isn&#39;t good enough, every new gadget convinces you the one you have is lame, every store you walk past advertising store credit cards tells you you can make your life better and you can do it without having money.</p>

<p>We can all raise our vibrational frequency by removing ourselves from the system a bit. Maybe that means reading a bit less about conspiracies, being online less, meditate, eat real food, mostly veggies and fruit, read as many books as you can, expand your consciousness so you have an expanded understanding of life.</p>

<p>The people at the top want us all to be dosile, lazy drones who think life is about buying shit. Don&#39;t let them win. Good vibes man. Really think about what that line means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you , people forget that the ancient Egyptians used to sun gaze too , the elite feed us sugar that kills the pineal gland , sun gazing recharges the batteries and they add sugar to everything ..</p>

<p>children are fed sugar in everything which leads to all sorts of problems . kids are full of energy they dont need sugar but parents feed it to them and wonder why the child is acting up . this child is working for the elite , hes bringing so much negativity into the parents daily life screaming for more candy  but all parents do is feed them more..</p>

<p>a willing victim to a dark agenda they know nothing about and scoff at calling us all conspiracy nut jobs ..</p>

<p>when a child plays up it needs something to stimulate its mind , its a wonderful thing to be a child and have a parent who knows how to look after their off spring by feeding their mind with knowledge instead of sugar ..</p>

<p>your post points out something i didnt want to go into , not many in this sub see things clearly as others and avoid it like its new age mumbo jumbo.</p>

<p>animals used for factory farming produce mass amounts of adrenalin</p>

<p>of animals have been frightened or stressed out before death, it actually affects the quality of their meat . glycogen is converted into lactic acid, which helps keep meat tender, pink, and flavorful Adrenaline released by stress before slaughter uses up glycogen, which means there‚Äôs not enough lactic acid produced postmortem. This affects different kind of meat in different ways, but in general it‚Äôll be tough, tasteless, and high in pH, and will go bad quicker than unstressed meat. (Lactic acid helps slow the growth of spoilage bacteria.)this meat causes cancer ..</p>

<p>pharmaceutical industrial complex&#39;s dark magicians have dark magic for us here too.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely agree. I have 2 kids, oldest is 2 and she is just brimming with energy most of the time. We feed her next to no sugar aside from when grandparents come to just shovel it into her. We try to be very conscious parents and want our kids to retain their ability to read people&#39;s energy and to view life and the world differently than the wider culturescape.</p>

<p>Your comment about meat is great, some details I wasn&#39;t aware of but a great scientific explanation of why that kind of meat is so bad for us. From an energetic perspective you have to think that it&#39;s really messing with us as well. Negativity breeds negativity and what could do that more than what we&#39;re putting into our bodies for consumption? Human interaction maybe but that&#39;s it. If people are going to eat meat, we should be treating it in a way that is respectful of all life, ours and theirs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is very true , im going to let you into a secret about eggs , i am sure you know all about battery vs free range eggs but do you know about the  Chalaza  ?</p>

<p>this is the part of the egg that holds the egg in place , the elite dont eat eggs . this part of the egg holds DNA .. it is the worst part and no one will ever tell you this , it is also important as it will show how fresh the egg is , the whiter the fresher the egg </p>

<p>eggs are in everything , it is a whole conspiracy of its own  and think about all the negativity in an egg from a battery farm . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it as the conspiracy of anger.</p>

<p>I personally feel as though the responses and posts all throughout reddit are done by AI. The purpose is to make people sad, scared, angry, upset and then turn them on their fellow man.</p>

<p>You should be into the new age philosophy that your mind shapes the universe because it is the only respite from these &#39;machines&#39;? I do not know what they are but they exist and they create an online world of such venom and hate that it doesn&#39;t matter anymore what side you are on, as long as you are feeding the beast.</p>

<p>There is a way out of this. If you take a walk down the street you will see the decency of humanity. Internet is following suit if television. It doesn&#39;t even seem like profits in fiat currency is what they want, they want us feeling scared and tired and lonely.</p>

<p>If we could create our realities with out thoughts it would make sense why they do this to us. They want to keep us down so that their power is not discovered. That&#39;s really the answer I have come to. They create a wold of fear to keep you down so that you cannot manifest the way they do. However, you do have the power to manifest your reality if you believe and rid yourself of fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This also extends to negativity about yourself. Encountering and battling all these ills can have a real and harmful impact on your mental health. Reading about oppression, scheming, and death will take a toll on anyone with a conscience. We need people who are fighting the good fight to stay alive and healthy enough to continue and spread the truth. So it&#39;s a good idea to give yourself mental breaks, be part of positive communities, or practice different forms of self improvement to help keep yourself in check. </p>

<p>The power of positive thinking doesn&#39;t have to be any sort of esoteric thing... &quot;As Above, so Below&quot; doesn&#39;t even need to mean anything spiritual.

There are real world repercussions to this.  It causes division and suspission. It puts people on edge and stressed.  It makes disagreement hostile and the acceptance of different views more difficult.  </p>

<p>All because the media is fucking with primitive fear responses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nd6es/the_saturn_matrix_and_the_holographic_prison/ds0yt6b/">Here is a thread between OP and I where he got pretty negative with me over a philosophical disagreement. He also talked a lot about rape there too. He misunderstood everything I said, and I suspect that it caused him to get riled up and make this post, along with another from a couple days ago. I encourage anyone interested to read for themselves and make up their own minds about what&#39;s going on in his head.</a></p>

<p>Maybe your posts have nothing to do with that conversation. Like I said, I&#39;ll let others judge if that is the case for themselves. But just in case our conversation did in some significant part inspire this post, let me add these thoughts:</p>

<p>You yourself, OP, mentioned in another comment for that post that you read Alan Watts. It was the top of your recommendation list for reading material for someone else. I am also a tremendous fan of Alan Watts, and it seems to me that you have also missed the point of a lot of what he taught, as you missed many of my points. He didn&#39;t believe in an objective &quot;good and evil&quot; either. The ideas I talked about in our conversation, about how the universe &quot;just is what it is&quot;, those ideas were in-part inspired by his teachings. And they are not negative ideas, they are honest, balanced, and quite literally <em>tautologically true</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like to be negative. And I definitely never implied anything like &quot;I don&#39;t rape kids therefore I can say whatever I want.&quot; You have misunderstood my points from the get go, and now you can&#39;t seem to get over it. I feel genuinely sorry for you, and I hope you can reflect on all of this a little more carefully.</p>

<p>I do hope you well, but if you are going to respond to me with more of <em>your</em> crass negativity, be forewarned that I will not dignify it with a response this time.</p>

<p>Why would you want to ‚Äúmonetize the eshcaton‚Äù? I find that to be a strange username for someone who is of your caliber. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I thought some people might think it was pretty sketchy. It&#39;s a play on the phrase &quot;immanentize the eschaton&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s meant to be a silly pun, not much more than that, like most Reddit usernames (for instance, I don&#39;t assume you necessarily support the supposed beliefs of Quetzalcoatl, nor do I assume, on the other hand, that you necessarily compare him to Hitler or yourself to Tila Tequila).</p>

<p>But hey, if somehow this chapter of history is, in some sense, coming to a close, I guess I wouldn&#39;t mind making a few extra bitcoins in the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest it works... </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent the past year changing my thoughts which affected my behaviour toward me and others. Left my job, spent some time alone thinking about many many things, doing meditation, keeping myself calm and managing stress as I could.
Then I stopped being negative, I stopped stressing and having fear.</p>

<p>Guess what? Found a new job, should be stressful but I am not anymore. Life became ... quite simple and any problems that happen to me, I see them with a big smile and find solutions right away.</p>

<p>I plan on the present and not for the future or based on the past anymore. I mean, now I am truly happy. </p>
