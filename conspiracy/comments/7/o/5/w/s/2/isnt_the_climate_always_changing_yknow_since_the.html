       Yes, the climate always changes. However, it changes at different rates, and it changes for different reasons.   The rate of change in greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere are unprecedented, and caused by human activity.

       unprecedented sinnnnnceee? How long exactly have we been able to measure greenhouse gas?  The earth is billions of years old and because something changes a little in the last 100 years we think we know everything there is to know.

       I bet the Wooly Mammoths were like "dude we gotta stop farting, it's getting hot up in here" at the end of the ice age.  If we were in an ice age and it started warming up, as the earth tends to go in cycles, I bet people would be losing their fucking minds "we're all gonna burn to death!".

       Our ability to measure is recent, however the mediums that we can apply those techniques are ancient. Ice core samples, for example, provide us with ancient levels of gases over a time period.

       Try to think without thought terminating cliches.  No one thinks we know everything there is to know, but we know enough to make statements with different levels of certitude and accuracy.  And statements that human beings are responsible for a great extinction of biomass currently underway is a fact.

       It would be nice to see a reference that supports your view on this. However, take a look at the concentrations of CO2 from the Vostok cores.

       Okay so when comparing the Co2 (in red) to the temp (in blue) you can see periodic divergence between the proposed relationship.  It's most noticable during the peak periods but it's also present during the small ups and downs in minor glacial periods and minor interglacial periods.
      </p>
      <p>
       While some sort of correlation is obvious between co2 and temperature, it's not obvious why temperatures would decline rapidly without a decline in Co2 first and especially if Co2 is being blamed for the warming trend we are currently in which has been happening for the last 12,000 years.

       Its not really noticeable for the peaks except for the initial one, but I did notice how you did not answer the simple questions I asked.

      <p>
       What were the measured peaks of CO2 levels in the Ice cores? What is the C02 level now?  How fast did the changes occur in the past, vs now?

       It is immediately obvious... If the energy input from the Sun decreases, then even with the same CO2 levels, we would see a decrease in temperature.

       Perhaps you don't have any curiosity about what the data actually states, but maybe other readers do.  I am sure by now they notice how the questions of CO2 levels and rates of change have been avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here is Petit on what the actual data showed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The sequence of events during terminations III and IV is the
same as that previously observed for terminations I and II. Vostok
temperature, CO2 and CH4 increase in phase during terminations.
Uncertainty in the phasing comes mainly from the sampling
frequency and the ubiquitous uncertainty in gas-age/ice-age differences
(which are well over 61 kyr during glaciations and terminations).
In a recent paper, Fischer et al.44 present a CO2 record, from
Vostok core, spanning the past three glacial terminations. They
conclude that CO2 concentration increases lagged Antarctic warmings
by 600 6 400 years. However, considering the large gas-age/iceage
uncertainty (1,000 years, or even more if we consider the
accumulation-rate uncertainty), we feel that it is premature to
infer the sign of the phase relationship between CO2 and temperature
at the start of terminations. We also note that their discussion
relates to early deglacial changes, not the entire transitions.

       You're wrong.  The whole carbon tax hysteria is all based on Co2 levels the data actually shows the temperature dropping well before Co2 levels followed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the data actually states is that there is a correlation but causation isn't clear.  Like Al Gore's missing ice caps, the data isn't pointing to run away warming.  We have all seen the climate gate emails and the IPCC omitting data, and NOAA filtering out certain data sets for 'reasons'.  We can look at the Vostok data ourselves and see that the Co2 theory which cap&amp;trade is built around is off the mark.  We can see the increase in solar activity but the climate shame just doesn't stop.  They can't confront the fact that their predictions just aren't holding water.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if other readers are interested in the climate change consensus view then there are no less than thousands of resources which will spoon feed them with it, little cartoons and rebuttals to copy paste.

       The causation of CO2 being a greenhouse gas is based on physics, not analysis of previous trends.

      <p>
       You misunderstand, both the Gore claim, and what is meant by runaway warming.  Models predict a range of possibilities,   the fact that some models predicting an ice free arctic soon were wrong, in no way entails that all models are wrong.  Runaway climate change refers to initiation of positive feedback loops, which in turn initiate other positive feedback loops.  Increasing C02 in the atmosphere leads to increases in temperature, which in turn cause permafrost to thaw, releasing large deposits of methane into the atmosphere. Methane is a a lot more potent greenhouse gas.

       Well we have certainly seen how the denier community distorts what actually occurs with the IPCC or insider disagreements on NOAA not having their data in a publicly verifiable database or using low confidence intervals.    The double standards are obvious.  Any mistake is taken as a confirmation climate change is not happening, but the large amount of lies, distortions and propaganda coming from the denier camp is invisible.

       This is a false dichotomy.  Solar activity and greenhouse gases are factors in the climate.  The question is what is occurring now, why, and what should be done about it?   You can read the actual review of Solar Activity and its influence on the climate here:

temperatures in the early part of the century, but for the
latter part of the twentieth century they consistently find that
using realistic variations, solar forcing played only a minor
role in global warming, in agreement with the practically
constant mean solar forcing since 1980.

       I hope readers would notice by now that CO2 levels peaked at around 300ppm and the troughs were at about 120ppm, with the difference occurring over thousands of years. The average C02 concentration today is around 406 ppm, we were at 300ppm around 1910.

       an example to put it into perspective, we are humans.  Inside our guts we have bacteria to help us digest.  When they are out of balance, we don't feel well or sometimes feel sick.

       If you think of us as the Earth, and the bacteria in our guts as the humans on Earth - the bacteria in the gut are very small and truly a very small part of the total mass of the singular human - yet they have tremendous effects to the functionality of the human.

       It seems to be the conclusion that is entailed if one subscribes to neoliberal ideology.  I mean if you believe that the market is an information processor, and that those closest to it have better insight into what is true - that would be those who got wealthy.  Then climate change is just another problem where a market can be created, and different products (geoengineering techniques) can be attempted, and through competition, a product will be delivered... no more global warming.   That is the prize for all the libertarian think thanks, in the mean time they just push global warming denialism  to buy some time.

       You are totally mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have records of how much oil humanity has pumped.  60% of that amount was burned by us.  That amount exactly matches the rise in atmospheric CO2 to record levels of 400ppm from 280ppm in 1940s.  It is simple accounting and chemistry to verify that we have drastically changed the atmosphere.  There is literally no question about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans may be tiny, but we build machines that are more powerful than us and outlive us.  For example, nuclear bombs are made by humans and could change the climate permanently in 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that humans are inconsequential in the natural order is a complete delusion held by people who have certain cognitive limitations.  It's not really clear how to help people like yourself, but the best thing you could do for everybody else is not publish your opinions.

       Think about what you wrote regarding tiny humans and the nuclear weapons we have built.  Obviously, human technology, tools, and machinery give us the power to change the environment.  You should have figured that out already, because everybody knows about nuclear weapons.

       Just meditate on why you missed that obvious rebuttal of your belief system and stop trying to argue with someone who just educated you.

       It snowed here in AL on Dec 8th, like 5 or 6 inches, which is a lot for us. The last 2 Christmases it was like 75° and it was overall miserable those winters, plus I was pregnant and worked outdoors. Before then it was typically cold winters but rarely did it snow.

Ozone holes closed up and proven they open and contract naturally like seasons (though china and india have so much pollution, they have new human made holes opening up with no outcry).   Nothing is going right and people look at global warming as a shutdown word similar to conspiracy theories and deniers and truthers and so on.  Soon as you say it, they just ignore everything you say as false.  They needed a new word - climate change is that.  The joy of this one is that they are never wrong.  The climate is changing and you can blame humans for "manmade climate change" and theres no way to dispute it.  Something has to change when we do something.  They don't have to say how much and it can be hot or cold, more storms or less, melting or growing caps, etc. and its all "true".   But

       This is a common, completely false assertion. Climate change and global warming are two different things. Global warming refers to the overall, gradual, planetwide increase in average temperatures. Climate change refers to the effects of that overall warming, which are not uniform. It can be cold in New York while the Earth as a whole heats up. In fact global warming would absolutely result in harsher winters in some places.

       No its not, global warming refers to the trend of increasing average temperatures, that is  a fact.  Climate change refers to how that increase will actually affect weather patterns over time.  Because there seems to be a false belief that it entails that every day will be warmer than the last, and that we won't have any more cold weather, or some other such nonsense.  When it actually entails that we are going to be seeing an increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events.

       This is a non-sequitor, as we act based on the knowledge we posses.  We don't say, "I don't want a pacemaker for my heart block, because our scientific knowledge of cardiac physiology is going to change".   We act based on what we know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, while it is philosophically true, that every single scientific theory is open to revision and has a possibility to be revised, it does not follow that every scientific theory either needs to or that it will be revised.  There is nothing prohibiting us epistemologically from getting things right, we just  always have to allow for our beliefs to be revised.

       <p>
        The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming ('no position') represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.

        That hypothesis was tested by analyzing 928 abstracts, published in refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, and listed in the ISI database with the keywords “climate change” (9).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position.

       - stop spreading debunked lies.  They took papers from people without permission or asking what they were about, culled the data and decided, on their own, if something was neutral, for or against.  And this is just a general opinion or position taken - not if the paper proves it or they are hundred percent sure its real and no concensus from the people involved on what cook paper believes climate change is.  You could ask every one of them and their own thought on what constitutes change or not will be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even with this bullshit methodology, they STILL had to lie and use neutral opinions as "agrees".   Fuck off with this shilling of lies.

       The earth will adapt and change and overcome anything we throw at it to sustain life. Always has, always will.

       We experienced the highest re-freeze rate of the ice caps in recorded history.  The earth is living and breathing and will continue to change and we should probably stop pretending that we really have all that much to do with it.  Except for the cows, those bastards need to stop farting.

       Yes, ocean temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels always oscilated, but never the way they are doing in such a small window of time (post industrial revolution).
      </p>
      <p>
       And global warming doesn't mean all the globe is warming at the same rate, air currents can be modified and that could imply some places gets colder than usual while the average temperature of the planet increases.

       Bud, we know a lot more about the Earth and its natural history than you think we do. Not everything, but it's worth learning about! Dig into that stuff and come to the answers yourself, since clearly people showing them to you isn't working.

       You don’t need extensive knowledge of the subject. This is just a case of common sense. The Earth is OLD. And the climate has been been changing on it drastically and more dramatically than what we have experienced in the last few decades. It’s a very simple point I was making, and I wasn’t trying to pass myself off as an arrogant scientist defective robot.

       You’re not responding to what I started saying from the beginning; The world is millions of years old, it has gone through countless dramatic atmospheric changes, so why are we making such a big deal about the last few decades? NONE of the people who disagree with me has directly addressed that simple observation.

       There has only been one massive anthropogenic release of stored carbon in the geological timeline beginning with the Industrial Revolution. Since we already know the results of non-anthropogenic massive carbon releases, the conclusion in this case is readily apparent and preventable in the future.

       Yes, we know the answer. There has been one single massive anthropogenic release of stored carbon in the evolution of humanity. Only one. This is a fact known through evidence.

       Humans (anthro) can only control what they do as a collective (-genic from genesis). So this human created event requires a human response.

       We do know with absolute certainty that no massive release of anthropomorphic derived carbon on even a single percentage point to the modern era has occurred in history. This is an incontrovertible fact. Humans in the modern sense have only evolved in the last 100,000 or so year. We know they didn't have automobiles, factories or coal-fired electric plants.

       Well I’m just wondering (besides what a staunch defendant of the Establishment is doing on Conspiracy Reddit), if there’s no God and no space aliens, that means that you are the master of the universe, doesn’t it?

       First, if there is any meaningful reason behind a conspiracy forum, then reality has a central place. I defend nothing but reality. You seem to be saying that somehow a conspiracy forum is merely a place for jokes and stereotypical ignorance. Defending science isn't defending anyone's "establishment" - just facts.

      <p>
       Secondly, if you can show me gods and space aliens, then we can get them into a laboratory and examine them.

       Thirdly, the universe needs no master. (Aside from He-Man, obviously.)

       If you are skeptical of there being a God or space aliens existing, I can’t debate with you, because apparently you believe you are basically the smartest, or one of the smartest, living organisms in the universe. I have no idea how me thinking it odd that someone who would so strongly defend the whole narrative of ‘climate change’ would be on Conspiracy Reddit and that makes me think that this is only a place for jokes and ignorance. It’s a place for people who doubt official narratives such as ‘climate change’.

       Doubting the current instances of anthropomorphic climate change is a political position promoted by natural resource exploitation industries and nothing else. In fact, doubting science is the

       position of the US Republican Party which is a radical fundamentalist religious organization.

       The argument is welcome by those that rule us. In actuality, you're right, the climate has always changed. It's fucking volatile when measured on a scale as long as the earth is old. However there are certainly changes we have been witness to that suggest that regardless if humans have anything to do with it the relative stability we've enjoyed for eons is becoming less predictable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we talk about what we are doing to proactively prevent massive casualties from happening in areas prone to these warm ocean sort of weather patterns? The Gulf coast? The SE coastal regions? And potentially the whole eastern coastal united states? Or do we just want to whip our dicks out and see who can piss the furthest?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about a constructive conversation about protecting these problem areas like other countries have done on a massive scale? Maybe huge projects the likes of the hoover damn in scale? Because in my opinion these are the kinds of discussions we need to be having now instead of the fucking incessant bickering.

       Natural disasters have always happened and always will.  The earth is a living, breathing organism that changes all the time.  But, it has always sustained life and likely will till the sun goes out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something like the aftermath of Katrina should have never happened, not because a hurricane shouldn't happen, but maybe because building a city below sea level that close to the coast isn't a great idea, and then electing corrupt officials who instead of fixing and updating the antiquated levee system, passed the buck or pocketed the money and allowed it to fail.  It was a human error, but not human caused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course we should do anything we can to curb pollution, improve air quality in major cities, and alllll that stuff, but to pretend that global warming is #1 on the list of things to worry about like Obama said, is ridiculous.

       My only hard stance is let's not argue about how or why and focus on making sure we are doing something tangible now to preserve areas that will be affected. I'd much rather be wrong about everything I've learned with my useless liberal $60k environmental science degree than to be right and no one has done anything but argue about semantics until it's too late.

       One way is by transitioning carbon from the ground to the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate.  This is mainly done by utilizing fossil fuels.    Another way is by cutting down rain-forests, which are important in regulating local climates.

       Humans planted more trees than there were to begin with, since humans began, because they realized they need wood for fire. So we’ve actually improved the environment if we have affected it all.

       The ratio of forests to non forests is decreasing, and is doing so at increasing rates.   Perhaps an analogy would be helpful to show why your statement really does not say much.  If humans grow the most food they have ever grown, it does not mean that they don't starve.  All they have to do is consume more than they grow.

       I don’t think us tiny humans are big enough to affect or change the atmosphere in any meaningful way. I’m all for the environment, protecting animals, clean air and water. But the constant repetition of the phrase ‘climate change’ is definitely part of some conspiracy.

       unprecedented sinnnnnceee? How long exactly have we been able to measure greenhouse gas?  The earth is billions of years old and because something changes a little in the last 100 years we think we know everything there is to know.

       I bet the Wooly Mammoths were like "dude we gotta stop farting, it's getting hot up in here" at the end of the ice age.  If we were in an ice age and it started warming up, as the earth tends to go in cycles, I bet people would be losing their fucking minds "we're all gonna burn to death!".
