        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why are the highest echelons of society trafficking and abusing children in a systematic fashion? How is is that they have done so with impunity for so long with nobody doing anything?
Why are they starting meaningless wars in which the common people suffer? </p>

<p>Yes, there are profits to be made from the exploitation of the many by the few, but why the trafficking, why the secret societies?</p>

<p>As a human being, do you really think humans are that evil to each other without outside help?</p>

<p>The alpha draconians are a very powerful reptilian race that eats humans, preferrably human children. They draw psychic energy and nourishment from eating people. They have infiltrated the highest levels of government and industry to ensure that they get their food and humanity stays in the dark ages. </p>

<p>it only takes a small minority of people to take action, but people have to act.</p>

<p>All it takes to act is to look inside yourself and start making decisions for yourself. It takes practice, but it will set everything in motion.</p>

<p>Find your motherfuckin path and stay on it!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah they def have cloaking capabilities for their craft and prob use the tractor beams sometimes, but i think they are innately able to travel interdimensionally, supposedly its only high level dracos that can do it though. They need energy to travel that way, which sometimes requires ritual human sacrifice, hence the satanic cults supplying the sacrificees.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of reptilian races and applies to reptilian species on earth, i might add, is a strong preference for rituals. You can see evidence of this in our societies. So many rituals in govt, law, religion, and entertainment/media.
One could argue that humans social tendency drives the ritualization of society, but I think there is more to it than that.</p>

<p>Humans breed everywhere dude. Wonder if its happened in space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is the enemy that promotes the theory of evil space aliens from another planet. The enemy did not invade earth, Nay! We invited the enemy with kisses at the door. America is the new Babylon and WE are feeding the enemy. We lower ourselves into enemy territory by participating in the dark ritual called civilization. The ruling elite have been worshipping the same gods and using the same occult knowledge to enslave humanity for 10,000 years.</p>

<p>Like Tesla said, it’s all about, “frequency, vibration, and resonance”. Our society promotes hate and fear which are low vibrational energies. The elite have created the spiritual climate that allow lower density access to our spiritual energy. We can escape as soon as we remember our oneness and truly treat each other with love and respect. Love is of higher frequency and will lift us out of enemy territory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are def theories like that, but you would still have originally seeded the dinosaurs. Supposedly the draconians originally seeded earth with what became the dinosaurs. when the dinosaurs were killed off, the mammals thrived, and a race of reptilians evolved underground where it was still warm and geologically stable. those are the reptilians currently living on earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is a unit that has value. also useful in high tech components. why is it a unit of value? because it is scarce.</p>

<p>is the market being engineered so that it continues to have value, ensuring that it is continually mined? maybe. Debeers does it with diamonds so why not do it with gold.</p>

<p>why would you want a steady supply of gold mined? maybe it is being used for black projects or traded offworld, or maybe its just an arbitrary unit used to keep ppl focused on the socially programmed materialistic reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is evidence, but it comes from connecting the dots throughout history.</p>

<p>I look for constant trends in civilizations and societies, looking for a positive moral, social, or political movement that gets corrupted and morphs into an oppressive materialistic unit of control.</p>

<p>bc stuff:
sumerians, babylonians, old testament. Look for the reptilian references</p>

<p>modern day:
illuminati, freemasons, and other secret societies globally. </p>

<p>If you are looking for fossil evidence and physical evidence theres a lot of crap out there, also a strong coverup but some gems can be found. its up to you to discern though as an individual as you wont get any backing from scientific communities or get serious play in the media.</p>

<p>This, alongside the Galactic Federation of Light Pleiadian stuff is so mindless it even reeks of a disinformation campaign.

    <div class="md"><p>I very rarely comment on this sub, however  I definitely think that this needs to be said.</p>

<p>It is complete BS posts like this that give this sub a bad name. 
I will entertain the idea which you have presented, lets say that it is possible. Where did you provide any evidence that this <strong>might</strong> be true? Notice I am not even saying this is true, I am saying might. In this vomit of words nowhere you have provided any credible argument, logical connection or anything to show any credibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are profits to be made from the exploitation of the many by the few, but why the trafficking, why the secret societies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This already shows me that you lack any deep knowledge in history and have not read any serious literature on any of the topics you are questioning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a human being, do you really think humans are that evil to each other without outside help? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I do think that humans are capable of being that evil and history has great many examples of cruelty of men. I also think that there is nothing unnatural about being cruel or evil since out of billions of people inhabiting our planet there are bound to be those who feel no empathy or remorse and as evolution dictates those individuals will be more successful since they will prioritize their own benefits over others hence bettering their chances of survival. In modern society this transitions into getting better positions in jobs and governments (lack of moral values and ability to put on facade will get you places).</p>

<p>Aside from those two abstract and misleading questions nowhere else in this post you provide any clue as to why you might say or think this way. Below in comments again you spew some BS about Babylon and clues being all around in history and some trends that you follow when society builds up and then gets corrupt. </p>

<p>Bottom line, you are a moron, don&#39;t post shit if you are not ready to actually do the work and show in detail how did you come to the conclusion you are so avidly defending. Read some history and do actual research. Read serious literature from classics of the times you are researching and then their modern interpretation. Read about ruling systems and different societal structures to better understand why society might get corrupt and why human trafficking has been there all through out history. Read evolutionary biology and biology in general to better understand how human minds work, how evolution works. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The alpha draconians are a very powerful reptilian race that eats humans, preferrably human children. They draw psychic energy and nourishment from eating people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you fix your spelling you can actually write scary stories for children rather than post on this forum. Grow up and get a life.</p>

<p>I apologize to the community if I might seem too harsh or a bit aggressive however this post is complete garbage and anybody who upvoted it either is trolling, deluded or has no capacity for making logical judgement. Either way r/conspiracy would be better of without those people. </p>

<p>Who the F do you think you are? I am not the one who posts some outrageous shit on conspiracy forum without any argumentation and logical evidence. You are the one making claims you should defend them and provide evidence, not the other way around. </p>

<p>Anyway kid, have a nice day, we can have serious discussion once you stop believing in fairy tales and grow up, or develop basic logic.
Until then don&#39;t poison this forum with your bullshit, and focus on actually developing yourself as a person and read avidly, so that you can distinguish between whats truly important and how to help people. </p>

<p>Pizzagate is important, 9/11 is important, CIA government overthrowing is important (More important than ever because of current situation in Iran), Cannabis legalization is important, Human trafficking is important, Government mind control program is important. It is important to expose them it is important to dig deeper, since there is vast amount of actual documentation, evidence, witness testimonies and you know that even if it is not publicly acknowledge there is a very good chance of those things being real (as in being purposefully hidden from public). </p>

<p>This draconian reptilian bullshit however is for retard nut-jobs just like flat earth and hollow moon. It is purposefully spread  to discredit conspiracy communities. Do you realize how ridiculous this is? Either you are a shill, a troll or genuinely misguided soul, in either case gtfo of here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a post I made once in response to a question asking why all the pedo stuff is coming out now. It explains some and link at the end for more.</p>

<p>Tl:dr: Draco gone now, only Illuminati left, and they are fighting each other.</p>

<p>A couple years ago the Draco empire left. They were running the shit and had many projects and programs setup to generate certain powerful human emotions because they used the energy it produced.</p>

<p>Since they left many of those projects and programs shut down because there was no need for them anymore. This doesn&#39;t mean it has stopped, just lessened. But as a result, more and more of it is getting exposed. Its more complicated than just that, but you get the general idea.</p>

<p>(Asked to elaborate...)</p>

<p>Apparently, the Draco built the control system on this planet. The human elements of the structure is what we&#39;d call the Illuminati or such. They&#39;re the minions that do the bidding, but it was always the Draco calling the shots.</p>

<p>When the empire left, they handed over control to the Illuminati, who immediately began fighting each other in the power vacuum. You can see this playing out today with all the different factions of the Cabal fighting and exposing each other.</p>

<p>So, they were harvesting our energy. The Illuminati were very much caught up in all that, but not so much getting the same benefits the Draco were. So when the empire left, there wasn&#39;t as much a need for it all. I don&#39;t think I need to describe it all, we&#39;re all very familiar with the sick shit that&#39;s been going on. So with those types of programs dissolving, the truth of what&#39;s been happening has started being used against certain factions. Also people trapped in that crap are more free now to come out than before.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also another layer in between that really strange. They&#39;re called the parents, and they were the interface between the Draco and the Illuminati. They are mostly gone now too, but still a problem for us.</p>

<p>I just posted a nice write up that describes more of what we can expect. Check it if you&#39;re interested. Feel free to ask questions.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/greenlight/comments/7a6kji/the_plan_the_path_of_discoveries_the_change/">https://np.reddit.com/r/greenlight/comments/7a6kji/the_plan_the_path_of_discoveries_the_change/</a></p>

<p>(Asked about why they left...)</p>

<p>That&#39;s a difficult question to answer. From what I&#39;ve gathered, it was a combination of factors.</p>

<p>The control they had over us was actually given to them by us about 16 and a half thousand years ago. Humanity was in a really bad spot and our world was messed us when the Draco offered to take charge and fix things. We took the easy way out, but of course they then went on and enslaved our planet and harvested us and our planet. What they were doing was barely legal, and the stuff they were doing that wasn&#39;t was well hidden.</p>

<p>I guess word of what was happening eventually reached a certain authority and they got smacked down.</p>

<p>On top of this, they are busy in many parts of the galaxy and situations elsewhere needed more of their attention.</p>

<p>Another thing is some cosmic event created by the universe to help balance out this part of space where darkness had really grown. Universe is always working to balance light and dark. Duality is the catalyst for change and growth, so we need both, but too much of either always causes a push to return to balance. The pendulum swinging. So a wave of energy is sweeping through to help with that, and it makes the Draco uncomfortable since they are on the negative side.</p>

<p>One last thing that might have also pushed them away is they might have literally had a change of heart. They have been &quot;feeding&quot; off our energies for thousands of years. Its like a really potent drug and also like a life extension tool. Well, it might be that doing this for so long started to change them, they started to get slight feelings of human empathy and I heard it was almost like a warrior&#39;s respect for his enemy. We humans really are good at adapting, caring, and also our creativity and imagination is something they lack. So they might see us a bit different now then they use to.</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s about it. I know its weird, but I hope it helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing this! Really hope its true about the Dracos having left. Dont think we would have stood much chance.</p>

<p>any idea when they left? It seems like it would be recent, like maybe within 10 to 15 yrs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The guy who I got this from, Shane, never said what races were involved.</p>

<p>But also, it seems that isn&#39;t really too important because apparently race has nothing to do with morality or conduct.  It seems there are good and bad ETs of all races just like there&#39;s good and bad humans.  Also I guess having really advanced technology does not equate to having high spiritually or benevolent intentions.</p>

<p>Its just as complex and mixed up out there as it is down here.</p>
