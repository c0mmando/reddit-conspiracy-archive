       I saw the recent post on here regarding Facebook's censorship programme, so thought I'd share a recent story of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently got into an argument with a Russian on Twitter about the invasion by Germany in 1941, I was arguing that there was a myth (I don't know if its right or wrong) that Hitler feared Russia was getting ready to invade Western Europe so operation Barbarossa was in effect a preemptive strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a few hours of debate, through the auto-translate, the Russian finally said "Russia's borders end nowhere", meaning I presume, that anywhere Russia decides to invade is Russian territory. I jokingly put "Hitler was right then."
      </p>
      <p>
       Three weeks later, I get an email from 'Twitter Legal', saying my post was being withheld in the UK under hate speech under local laws, etc. Needless to say I was a bit concerned, so I've since deleted the account and hoping I don't get a knock on the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things aren't even being judged in context anymore, its making me incredibly worried about the future. It won't be long before any alternative ideas, jokes or even legitimate questions are banned outright.

       My IP address is banned (can’t even create a new account) for saying the word fuck too much. Never directed at anyone. Just as a descriptor (ex “I’m so fucking sick of it”). I’m so sick of people reporting and getting banned for nothing just because they’ve boiled the world down to “what I believe is 100% is true and any other opinion shouldn’t be allowed in my vicinity”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is some of the worst, allowing volunteer mods to perma ban people. Perma bans should be done by admins only. Mods should only be allowed to temp ban. I for one don’t want an echo chamber anywhere.

       And they got hordes of people calling everything racist and demanding censorship of "hate speech" in advance to give them an excuse to do it, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone actually thinks those in power care about "hate speech" think again. Give the government the power to determine which speech is legal or not, and you'll soon find they get to determine what's allowed to be said publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then it'll end up like China where how "good of a citizen" you are is determined by what you post on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       "How good a citizen are you? China hopes to answer that question for every one of its citizens with a numerical rating system based on their financial standing, criminal record and social media behavior. A new translation of the government’s plans for a so-called social credit system sheds light on how China aims to utilize "Big Data" to hold all citizens accountable for financial decisions as well as moral choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       China’s plans to roll out a citizen rating system has been in the works for years. Rogier Creemers, a China expert at Oxford University, recently published a translation of a document circulated through various levels of government detailing the six-year rollout of the program. According to a State Council notice, the central government hopes to have every adult in China assigned a credit code in addition to a government-issued identity card by 2020."

       Hopefully armed thugs will never knock on your door, and I just wasted 10 seconds and a few kilobytes on an Icelandic server somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: hopefully this experience will not discourage you from speaking your mind in the future. On the contrary, you should do it even more. But as you’re in the UK I’d advise you download Tor browser first.

       OK, you did get a smile out of me with that reply! I may not agree with you politically, however I feel I'd get on with you quite well irl.

       Holy shit am I with you on that one, the relentless divide tactics are rife on reddit and so many people fall for it. I appreciate the comedic relief, nothing is worth swearing at strangers over the Internet and boiling your own piss.

       Exactly. I don't really use fb at all anymore. I just ran out of steam you know? And I gotta say, the longer I go without checking it the better I feel. Arguing with strangers just isn't productive at all. I pretty much don't do it unless I'm really drunk and really bored these days. And you're right about that divisive shit. Seeing clips and stuff from fox and cnn etc seem so fake. It's like a bizarre reality show and people eat it up.

       Getting rid of fb was the best thing I ever did. Social media and sensationalist news outlets peddling propaganda are systematically destroying society. What really fucks me off is that we could achieve so much if we united.

       Twitter just followed the laws of the UK and informed you of the action taken because of the UK government. I'd hardly call it censorship by Twitter.

       Bit arbitrary when context isn't even considered. And Id hardly call a discussion on one nation's reasoning to invade another 'hate speech'.

       I'm not saying it is either. It seemed that whatever sort of webcrawler the UK gov has searching for deemed hate speech only looks at the individual tweet and isn't intelligent to make judgements based on context. On its own a tweet saying "i guess Hitler was right" looks damning. That wasn't my point, though. I was commenting on the fact that op's title suggests that Twitter is behind the censorship. I was pointing out tnat it was being withheld due to UK law and Twitter was simply alerting him.
