       i was just wondering if he may had unfortuantly fallen victim to the hollywood pedo ring when he was a child? could that explain why he had allegations of child molestation made agaisnt him? maybe they wanted to ruin his public perception before he could spill the beens
edit: i forgot to mention that ive tried googling it but can only find articles about his allegations.

       "Michael Jackson (1958-2009) was a famous singer and entertainer. Between 1993 and 1994 and separately between 2004 and 2005, Jackson was investigated by California law enforcement agencies for possible child molestation. He was acquitted of all such charges. The FBI provided technical and investigative assistance to these agencies during the cases. The Bureau also investigated threats made against Mr. Jackson and others by an individual who was later imprisoned for these crimes. These investigations occurred between 1992 and 2005."

       I haven't read all the parts of his file... but I did read one part that was the ramblings of one of his stalkers... The stalker thought Michael Jackson and John Gotti turned their girlfriend from half-gay to 75% gay wanted the Crips to be a Christian street gang... that used secret code to talk to the Freemasons. And they wanted to raise money and awareness through their Earth, Wind &amp; Fire remixes... and if no one took them seriously they'd kill George Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those FBI files also have information about his abuse allegations, but I don't recall seeing anything really interesting, but I didn't read all of em.

       Michael was abused as a child and in turn he tried to "love" and protect the children he encountered later on. Maculy Culkin and Corey Feldman both still say he didn't abuse them, but those two were also abused in my opinion... It is a dark dark hole to crawl into but yes I believe he was a part of a pedo ring,

       MJ was a victim not only of child abuse but also physical abuse from his own father- who beat
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the Jackson kids. I think in MJ's mind he was still a 10 y/o...because he never got to grow up. I think a lot of what he was accused of doing with young children would be considered normal...if he was a 10 year old and not a fully grown adult...I think he genuinely was just trying to be a kid and hang out with kids, because his mind was forever stuck in that age due to the abuse he suffered. MJ was most definitely a victim.

       I've loved that song for so long, but it wasn't until recently I noticed the lyrics were "Jew me, sue me, Everybody do me" It was bizarre when I realised, couldn't believe for so long I never even knew that line even though I sang it all the time. made me think maybe it wasn't only about oppression. MJ has made a statement it was only about oppression, when he was accused of being anti semitic though. Spooked me cos I started to listen to some of his other songs like Thriller, and couldn't get the perception he's singing as an adult child who's escaping abuse out of my mind

       Most of us today have accepted that there are things that are the way they are not for any reason, but just because that's the way they are. Nothing has to be the way it is. Why do masses attract? Why is the grass green? Why is there anything at all? There doesn't have to be a reason for everything, because reason is not the foundation of reality. So what's so absurd about connecting to the Foundation of Reality through mitzvot that are beyond reason?
