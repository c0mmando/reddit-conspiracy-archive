Religion is not a basis of fact. Therefore none should peddle it unto others as such. It should be questioned and debated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the God/Devil posts are particularly new...for some, spirituality and belief in a higher power is at the bottom of the rabbit hole. My main difference with your post, however, is that morality is a &quot;man made construct&quot;. I think there are certain aspects of what we perceive as morality that are evolutionarily hardwired into our psyche. Such as the human disgust in reaction towards child abuse or senseless murder of innocents. These are things our own genes tell us are wrong, things children don&#39;t practice but only <em>learn</em> from adults. These are base levels of what it means to be human. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy psychology and would enjoy reading about any morality that is &quot;hard wired&quot; into the brain. Attraction and revulsion are not necessarily markers for morality, but I would entertain the thought. Children will do some pretty nasty things without learning them.

    <div class="md"><p>God hates fear...it&#39;s one of the most common things warned about in the Bible....god hated fear...vs. Satan who uses it to control people and feeds off it.</p>

<p>And for the failings, remember the Bible&#39;s whole message was Christ, who literally died because he loved us despite of our failings. Even when teaching about sin, it was because he understood the devils right to people when they involved themselves in it, as we have free will. </p>

<p>Remember Jesus wasn&#39;t a fan of religion, and the people he was always angry at were the religious leaders...not those he came to save.</p>

<p>Today&#39;s church is fd up. They are the ones who destort gods love and use fear...but still, it goes back to Satan because his purpose is to get people to hate god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless of course this is the Matrix and God is a very meta programmer.</p>

<p>As a life long computer scientist I have since a very young age, maybe 10 or 12 always noticed how similar the “big bang” and “God commanded it into instantaneous existence” sound awfully similar to turning on a computer and launching an app or IDE.</p>

<p>I mean the cornerstone phenomenon of scientific big bang is hyperinflation for the first 10 seconds of existence that then relatively slowed to a crawl.</p>

<p>From a technical/engineering standpoint thats pretty much what happens as your CPU and large bank of RAM after being electrified during a cold boot power on.</p>

<p>Could you accept a programmer God if it turned out we were in a VR prison or some kind of stasis?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In an animated n-dimension fractal network yes I have unfounded faith that it could be seen (although again yet mostly undiscovered..) that certain cellular automata may be both self similar and auto/proto Genesis (or whatever the term is) capable.</p>

<p>Back to the sim-in-yo-sim argument this leads to an interesting situation where Satan the badguy could both be our “god” but also not “god god” at the same time and could be one explanation for the war of sovereignty.</p>

<p>And so whatever scientific angle or philosophical speculation read spiritual book you come from I think we get very near the bottom of our story with a final notation that DNA which is essentially a biochemical programming language made from atoms made from quanta made from vibrating strings of electricity which allow us to once again circle full loop but in the other direction to lead us right back to a quantoelectric computer.</p>

<p>Frankly and admittedly to ignore a wide array of details in this discussion, the overall theory.. this is good enough for me and nearly explains all three pillars of existence pretty neatly in a simple manner which is itself an intriguingly strong signal imho.</p>

<p>But again, using the theory Ive outlined above, elsewhere, to anyone that would listen, I personally have went from militantly atheistic to highly spiritual and happily within the subjective constraints of finding a God that mostly explains existence in a way that also runs congruent to all objective evidence and theories Ive encountered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly at the ultimate ground of existence it is anyone&#39;s guess. My only real observation on your comment is your transition from &quot;militantly atheistic&quot; to &#39;highly spiritual&quot; is quite a swing.

<p>I think that may very well be the point. :) </p>

<p>And yeah I define spirituality quite liberally.. does being in the mountains fill you with happy energy? Sunbathing on a nice day feeling the warmth on your skin as the breeze blows over you? Parenting children through thick and thin? Volunteer at the shelter? Lovingly hand crafting a new cutting edge VR game? Studying information theory? Working through Bible study? Practicing meditation? Pondering quantum mechanics? </p>

<p>If it moves your soul or nudges your consciousness higher laterally or at a meta level  thats may very well be spiritual.</p>

<p>I think at some fairly low level in the structure of existence there is a single source. Both creator and creation. But again that starts to touch on the mysterious improbability field. What do you think? When you get below existence itself.. how/why?</p>
