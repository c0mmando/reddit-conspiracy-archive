       Use the search  bar there's a bunch of videos like this 1. Very intriguing the whole NASA is a front for something they aren't telling us or a way to sifer money for black projects.

       That bring said you can see the iss with a  half decent telescope  on a clear night. So I don't know why they fake something's.

       That boxy bright thing you see in the sky isn't a space station. The ISS is the size of a football field and is hundreds and hundreds of miles away. That is not what an unlit piece of metal hundreds of miles away looks like.  The ISS is just a hundred billion dollar scam. For literally hundreds of billions of dollars you bet they can figure out a way to project a fake space station onto some clouds or shit they spray.

       If this is all it takes for you to be convinced, you're pretty gullible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean sure, you can say that NASA is wasting money on this. But the ISS is an international cooperation. Have you ever seen a conspiracy this complicated and with so many people last without anyone leaking information? It just doesn't make sense. Even North Korea, where brainwashed people are under threat of death everyday, still leaks information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, we have such complicated pieces of technologies now for the common man but to put together a small space station over decades out of large tin can-like modules that's clearly impossible.

       Isn't this a relatively common recording glitch? I know shit about cameras, but I THINK this happens because something isn't updating right. Which is why everything that moves goes crazy while everything that's stationary remains normal. Can someone confirm?

       one is my favorite. Allegedly they are using contact lenses with projections on them, so they see what we're supposed to see. A lot of them seem to be staring up and off when they move things if you know to watch for it.

       I mean sure it could be the pleats in the guy's pants that he's grabbing onto but that's too simple. The real reason is they want to hide the existence of god. They actually captured him and have him hidden in a secret lab underneath the flat earth. The flat earthers are clearly just shills hiding the fact that flat earth is really just a pimple on the ass of a giant space turtle.

       There is a cure for cancer. It isn't 100% though. You take the human element out of science when you think people are just money grubbing machines. History has shown emergence of generosity from time to time.

       You could have argued that there is a vaccine that strengthens the immune system's own cancer fighting abilities that is being suppressed or targeted genetic therapy for cancer cells to repair them that is limited to the chosen elite.

       This is a common artifact of video compression. in order to save data, compression algorithms like mpeg and h264, sections of the video that don't change throughout the stream like the background, are treated like static parts of the image, saving bandwidth. If these areas are replaced with moving parts, like a human, it can easily bump up the data throughput higher than is expected by the connection. The ISS only has ku band internet from what I remember, giving them at most 10mbps download and 3mbps upload in the best condition possible, well under what we consider normal internet, and can easilly be overwhelmed by a video stream.

       Wait what? If something that appears strange occurs that doesn't make much sense to the average viewer but, makes sense to more knowledgeable people of the subject in question, does the explanation become less valid?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take this case for example. Average people will look at the distortion and go "Wtf is this, what happened?", while people who understand how streaming works go "Oh, these are just artifacts of video compression". Is the more complex explanation less valid because it requires a "barrier of entry" to understand?

       Or you could look at it from a non biased perspective, and realize that  if you look at a bunch of compressed videos trying to find evidence it's fake, you'll find it even if it's bullshit. Like the video showing the astronaut fading away.

No matter what people like you will always grin and slurp up their bullshit with a smug smile defending those liars. They can be ultra lazy with the quality of the actual fraud itself because the brainwashing is absolute. The scam is super easy to see through once you snap out of it.

       I see, so it's an argument of "you're either with me or against me, you must be with them". The ego in your arguments is suffocating. I hope that someday I can think so highly of myself despite all evidence to the contrary.

       I am arguing for what I believe to be the truth. Now I know about video compression and using photoshop and messing around with compression codecs and it looks exactly the same. Not even just similar.

       Clearly I am not a real person. I am just a figment of your imagination implanted by they or them to hide reality from... inside your own mind. The call is coming from inside the

       brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to make outlandish claims, you better come up with at least some kind of decent circumstantial evidence cause a glitchy youtube stream is not a conspiracy it's an everyday fact sort of like unreliable weather forecasts. I mean sure the meteorologists can get it wrong because they're morons... but what if they are doing it on purpose? Clearly they got to them.
