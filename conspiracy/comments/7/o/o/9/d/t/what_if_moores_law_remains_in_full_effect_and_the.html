    <div class="md"><p>The slowing advancement of CPU speeds is due to a fundamental problem with how transistors work.<br/>
TLDR: once transistors get too small the electrons just start quantum tunneling through your transistor and it doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
That&#39;s why we&#39;re making quantum computers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of that plus AMD wasn&#39;t giving Intel real competition and so they didn&#39;t push hard.  Its been known for a long time that massively parallel processing is the way to go for traditional CPUs and Intel has been doing there best to keep the core count down and to focus on fast single thread performance.  Then not to mention that parallel programming is quite difficult and Mozilla even made a new programming language called Rust to try to make it quite a bit easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not so bad because there are still incredible advancements to be achieved from redesigned the algorithms used in software.  The problem space was increasing faster than the amount of skilled developers in the world and so just barely good enough code was the way to go for over twenty years.  As an example look at the speed of Javascript engines now compared to fifteen years ago.  That is an incredible difference in efficiency and when Mozilla&#39;s new Rust based engine rolls out then it will blow away the current tech once again.  I&#39;ll agree that we are nearing the end of the line for our current transistors but I don&#39;t think that this emphasizes the weakness in transistors as much as it does our current processor designs.  They could be designed very differently with many thousands of cores and the if the software was designed to use them to break up the problems into tiny chunks then it wouldn&#39;t need such a high clock speed to brute force through it on just a single thread that only delegates to other threads just a little bit here and there.  The problem is people won&#39;t write software that assumes thousands of cores if CPUs don&#39;t exist like that yet and CPU manufactures aren&#39;t going to design and sell them if they will run like complete shit on 99% of the existing software out there written over the last forty years.  So instead we get 8 cores instead of 4 or maybe 16 if its a server since there are lots of tiny workloads to do in that environment.  This is just an evolution that always was going to be a difficult hurdle but I will place a fair amount of blame on Intel for being such a pathetic leader in this space.  Our inevitable destination has been delayed a lot due to their monopoly suckage.  However, things like this do tend to lurch ahead quite suddenly once they break out because its not as though computer scientists have stopped researching things all of this time.  There is certainly a backlog of doctorate level research that needs to be worked through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>50 years? No, lol. Maybe 1 or 2, but even that is stretching it.<br/>
The guys making these computers are in competition. If they had way better tech, you can bet your ass they would stick a fat price tag on it and start selling it before the end of the day.  </p>

<p>Look at the new Nvidia GPUs for example. Nvidia spent <em>billions</em> over the last few years developing that. They aren&#39;t just going to keep it to themselves. They wouldn&#39;t be able to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s a COMPLETELY different thing than computing. We also have functioning (they&#39;re shitty but they work) bionic eyes that work in the same way and there are a few lucky people getting to test them out. The tech of the computer has nothing to do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. Moores law, which isnt a real law like Newtons laws of motion or something, is an observation about the complexity increasing in SEMICONDUCTOR COMPUTER CHIPS. It really has nothing to do with cybernetics.</p>

<p>The OP postulates about computer tech being far more advanced than publicly known, but Moores law hasnt really slowed significantly...</p>

<p>If you know where to look. Desktop computers and the chips they use arent representative of the newest not secret computing hardware.</p>

<p>Maybe the govt has 5nm chips that use graphene or an exascale cryogenic super made by Raytheon under the CCC(cryogenic computing complexity) project. Google that up.</p>

<p>Also look at DARPAs Cyber Grand Challenge where small supercomputers running different temas AIs played hacker capture the flag autonomously.</p>

<p>Forallsecure&#39;s Mayhem AI won. Thats publically available.</p>

<p>As are a bunch of research papers on the latest beyond Moores law chips.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moores law has remained in full effect but so does Amdahl&#39;s law. Dennard scaling stopped mid 2000s.</p>

<p>Moores law has continued because of 3D stacking and will continue on. Its only consumer level chips that have stagnated because there has been no competition, demand or extra money to require that consumer chips get faster.</p>

<p>Thats why until Ryzen, Intel was 4 cores 8 threads for its consumer chips.</p>

<p>The real fastest chips in the world are made by companies that most people dont pay attention to because they arent marketed to consumers at all. Fujitsu SPARC and upcoming ARM and DLU, NEC SX Aurora, PEZY Computing Zettascaler, Micron Automata Processor, and even NVidias Tesla line all increase performance by multiple times per generation, some 10x per 3-5 year product cycle.</p>

<p>Also, its not a matter of brute force for making faster supercomputers and AI computers. Its a matter of how much energy it costs to do a FLOP or move a bit from memory to compute logic.</p>

<p>Even the not classified stuff hasnt really slowed in advancement. Its pretty much just consumer electronics that stagnate because consumers go buy a brand new phone for $1000 thats 10% faster or something stupid like that. A huge company doesnt follow the same shitty logic and as a result the products that cater to enterprise customers are always being made much better than the last gen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. </p>

<p>Moores law is bullshit, becuse it clashes with basic physics. It&#39;s a nice law you can tell first year students, Or to tell people who don&#39;t really understand neither computers or physis, but once you have basic physics 101, Or build your own machine, you see how fucking wrong it is. </p>

<p>Computer CPU&#39;s allways are doubled in speed by making the insides smaller. which is archievable. </p>

<p>The problem is, the heat does not go away. When you basically have a conductor, you can conduct energy till the stars come blue. When you have a semi conductor, and increase the density of transsistors, you have the point where CPU&#39;s, in their present form, need the extra cooling to be able to even remotely operate without melting down. </p>

<p>If you believe moores law is in effect, and inviolated, go to your PC, switch it on, do something nice and processor intensive, open the side panel, and put a chopstick in the cooling to slow it to zero revolutions. Hold itb there and watch wat happens when your customer grade PC runs without cooling. IF you don&#39;t, you have grasped the basic concept that a doubling of the transistor density is without value if you do not have the technology to keep them cool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>your post kind of suggests that strong AI is only a function of processing power, which it is not. there is not much unknown in processing power, it is just finite.</p>

<p>the real unknown right now is the software.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything I&#39;ve ever read suggests that Moore&#39;s Law is actually hitting limits, mostly due to problems with lithography limitations.</p>

<p>I do think you&#39;re sort of onto something, but I think it has more to do with Intel&#39;s business model.  The end of Moore&#39;s law means a real slowdown in the computer market and the end of the incremental processor upgrade.  It&#39;s also possible Intel have been artificially drawing this process out with little competition.</p>

<p>I mostly think it&#39;s not a conspiracy, but I do think we&#39;re getting to the end of the free ride in computing performance, much like we&#39;ve kind of gotten to the end of the free ride with most aspects of the economy, and we&#39;re staring down a long road of mediocrity and flat growth if not stagnation.</p>
