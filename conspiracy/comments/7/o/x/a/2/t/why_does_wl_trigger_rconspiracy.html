        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Whenever I defend WikiLeaks, some American comes in with an <em>ad hominem</em> attack that I&#39;m a Trump supporter. Can someone explain to me why so many Americans on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> consider WikiLeaks to be supporting Trump?</p>

<p>Just to refresh your memories, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/-Leaks-.html">WikiLeaks</a> has informed the world about</p>

<p>*<a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Bank_Julius_Baer">Swiss banks and tax avoidance</a></p>

<p>*<a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service">Secret American Congressional Reports</a></p>

<p>*<a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Scientology">Scientology Leaks</a></p>

<p>*<a href="https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/">American War Crimes in Iraq</a></p>

<p>*<a href="https://wardiaries.wikileaks.org/">Afghanistan and Iraq War Logs</a></p>

<p>*<a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo">Guantanamo Files</a></p>

<p>*NSA Mass Surveillance <a href="https://wikileaks.org/nsa-japan">here</a> and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/nsa-201602/">here</a></p>

<p>*<a href="https://wikileaks.org/tpp-final">TPP Documents</a> and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ttip">TTIP Documents</a></p>

<p>*<a href="https://wikileaks.org/imf-internal-20160319">The IMF and the Greek Crisis</a></p>

<p>At this point everyone was loving WikiLeaks. There&#39;s even plenty there for Americans that are only concerned with with issues that narrowly affect themselves. At that point almost everyone was supporting WL, and daily we had people from the deep state in the MSM calling for Assange to be killed, WL to be shut, calling WL criminal, that they need to be exterminated, etc. WL was considered one of the greatest forces in journalism and politics in history, with impeccable honesty.</p>

<p>And then the DNC and Hillary leaks happened. That alone was enough to convince many people that the MSM and the Deep State had been right all along about WL. Now <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is full of people convinced that the mere fact that WL accepted the Hillary-related leaks and published then somehow proves they support Trump and they&#39;re run by the Russians.</p>

<p>Well you know what? If you believe that, you&#39;ve swallowed the MSM propaganda hook, line and sinker. I&#39;m not sure why anyone who believes there&#39;s some connection between WL, Trump and Russia is even on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>--an independent media organisation that has done an enormous amount to enlighten genuine, bona-fide consipracies--you&#39;ve fallen for the Republican/Democratic false dichotomoty pushed by the MSM, the idea that those two parties are somehow different and not two heads of the same devil, you&#39;ve fallen for the MSM propaganda that WikiLeaks--who revealed war crimes under Bush, tax avoidance, global trade deals that only benefit the extremely rich, global mass surveillance by the West--are somehow some kind of evil organisation. If you&#39;ve fallen for the MSM propaganda that WikiLeaks works for Trump and Russia simply because of the Hillary-related leaks, I think you belong on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, not <a href="/r/conpiracy">/r/conpiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of listening to and believing the MSM uncritically, maybe you should stop to consider well-repected independent journalists and commentators; people like <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/about/">Robert Parry</a>&#39;s site about <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2018/01/01/the-still-missing-evidence-of-russia-gate/">&quot;Russiagate&quot;</a>; people like <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2017/08/03/seymour-hersh-debunked-russia-gate/">Seymour</a> <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-02/seymour-hersh-%E2%80%98russiagate%E2%80%99-cia-planted-lie-revenge-against-trump">Hersch</a>; <a href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=31&amp;amp;Itemid=74&amp;amp;jumival=19441">Max Blumenthal</a>; <a href="https://www.ronpaul.com/2017-10-12/russiagate-and-the-decline-of-journalism-with-robert-parry/">Ron Paul</a>; and that&#39;s just off the top of my head.</p>

<p>So next time someone defends WikiLeaks, stop your gob before you accuse that person of being a Trump supporter.</p>

Don&#39;t be dissuaded by the ignorant and the shills. I&#39;ll never forget what Assange did by leaking those emails, to show that HRC cheated my guy, Bernie, out of the goddamn Primaries. Fuck HRC, Obama, Kamala, Deval, the DNC, and all the rest of the Corporate Centrist fucks for what they&#39;ve done to this country.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really contradict things though. I have a way I <em>want</em> the world to run, and I see the way the world <em>is</em> run. Just because I have hope in a political solution and want to actively fight the darkness, doesn&#39;t make a recognition of said darkness irrelevant.</p>

<p>I stated in my OP, 2 of the biggest things WL did was the DNC Leaks and the Podesta Emails. As a Bernie supporter it was a truly revealing look into the machinations of the DNC and HRC machine, and how they cheated Bernie out of the Primary. Things me and millions of others will never forget. Especially when it comes time to vote in 2020...my vote wont be going to some Corporate whore like Kamala or Deval, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>I have faith in the We The People. In the soverign body of citizens upon which this country was founded. I have faith because the alternative is pessimistic nihilism, which is exactly what they <em>want</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In its purest sense, Politics arises as the peaceful competition between the various classes, races, and groups that make up the Commonwealth. That is at least what it should be in theory. Again, you describe the pessimistic view of these things. There are still some good representatives out there, at every level of government. Non corrupt people fighting for a better tomorrow. My hope is with them.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Patience. HRC losing was the first step. Trump winning wasn&#39;t really a win but it gives us the opportunity to reset the system come 2020, if the work is done <em>now</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>no matter who you vote for, monsanto(=666 in sumerian gematria), nestle, and all other royalty owned corporations are still going to rape, pillage and poison our bodys and souls</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if we pessimistically resign and decide to let them do this evil.</p>

<p>Change comes from the ground up, from the Grassroots. Change comes when millions of People are fed up with the status quo, and make their voices <em>heard</em>. This is happening all across our once proud Republic. On the Left, there is an active movement afoot, lead by Our Revolution, founded in the wake of Bernie&#39;s campaign, to take the Democratic Party from these Corporatist traitors. 8 State Parties have already been taken. It&#39;s such a threat that the Dem. Party literally stuffed ballots at the California Dem convention to stop Kimberly Ellis from gaining the Chairmanship and thus the 9th State in the name of the People. There is real, citizen driven, People oriented change being attempt in this country, right now, as we speak. And I have faith in it. Come 2020 we will know if it succeeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you honestly expect WikiLeaks to fix the world for you? The information is there if you want to use it, whether to better protect yourself or take up the cause and fix the world yourself.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks is a media organization, and it’s not their fault if you’ve never visited and aren’t able to make use of any of the information they release. Others certainly find value in it.</p>

<p>But hey, you’ve never even visited their website, so I can only assume all of this is lost on you. We live in the Information Age, take advantage and learn something before you’re replaced by a robot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry dude but it&#39;s beyond obvious that Wikileaks has been working on behalf of Russia and Trump for the past couple years. We all saw the direct messages between Wikileaks and Trump Jr. People keep pretending that was just some innocent back and forth and yet wikileaks didn&#39;t reach out to any other campaign. Nor did they tell them what and when to push stories. </p>

<p>Wikileaks lied about Russia being a source for them. They&#39;ve said &quot;yeah we can&#39;t tell you who the source is but it&#39;s <em>definitely</em> not Russia. Seth who? Seth Rich? I dunno man, not Russia though.&quot; Too bad Papadopulous knew Russia had stolen emails months before wikileaks dropped them for Russia. </p>

<p>Remember the pussy grabbing tape? Literally 1 hour after that tape came out, wikileaks scrambled to their computers and released a bunch of Podesta emails. Oh thanks wikileaks, what a desperate attempt to soften the blow for Trump. Julian has also said they never sit on information or time their releases. Yeah well that&#39;s a lie too. </p>

<p>All you have to do is just look at their Twitter and it&#39;s obvious that they spend all their time sucking Trump and Putins dick and shitting on their enemies. Wikileaks even bad mouthed the Panama papers because they mentioned Putin. What a joke. A company all for transparency talking shit about the Panama papers. </p>

<p>So for some reason you don&#39;t trust WL when they say Russia is not the source, but when an ex-Trump employee says it&#39;s Russia, well suddenly that guy is trustworthy, because...? You believe Papdopolous because he&#39;s saying what you want to hear, and you don&#39;t believe WL, an organisation with a long history of accuracy and honesty, because you don&#39;t like what they say. You literally have less reason to believe Papadopolous than WL given the latter&#39;s history, you only believe Papdolpolous because you <em>want</em> to believe &#39;Russia did it&#39;. Also read <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2017/08/03/seymour-hersh-debunked-russia-gate/">this</a> from Seymour Hersch; surely you trust Hersch more than Papadopolous?</p>

<p>Yeah, you got the wrong way around. The deep state knew WL was going to drop another bunch of leaks regarding Hillary, because WL always announce in advance they&#39;re going to release material, and so they scrambled to get the &#39;pussy-grabbing&#39; audio so they could try to take attention away from the WL releases and instead divert it on to Trump.</p>

<p>(By the way, if you actually listen to the audio, what does it say? &quot;When you&#39;re famous, women <em>let you do anything</em>. Read that carefully and think about it.)</p>

<p>Please source that. Where is it obvious on their twitter account they support Trump or Putin? And you realise many independent journalists have come to the conclusion that the Panama Papers had very little to do with Putin and Russia?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2016/04/04/inside_the_panama_papers_massive_leak_shows_just_how_extensive_corruption_is_worldwide_implicating_politicians_human_traffickers_and_drug_dealers/">Ben Norton</a> says: &quot;Many Western media reports on the Panama Papers framed the story around Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose close friends are involved in the corruption, but he is just one small part of the much larger scandal.&quot; <a href="https://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/04/04/the-very-nasty-truth-about-the-panama-papers/">Veteran&#39;s Today</a> aren&#39;t convinced by the PP, and quote <a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/04/corporate-media-gatekeepers-protect-western-1-from-panama-leak/">Craig Murray</a> that Russia forms a very small part of the leaks. As they point out, the ICIJ has only released selected data from the PP leaks. It&#39;s funny people accuse WL of withholding documents, but are happy to accept the known fact that the ICIJ withholds most of its data and only releases what it feels like. And yes, the ICIJ is indeed funded by Soros, if you took 2 minutes to do the research. <a href="https://www.icij.org/about/our-supporters/">They openly state on their website</a> that they&#39;re funded by the Open Society Foundation. <a href="https://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/04/10/neo-panama-papers-the-new-wikileaks-scam/">Some even claim the PP leaks are as bad as WL</a>. Take your pick. </p>

<p>Even the man the MSM names as &quot;the most significant financial whistleblower of all time&quot;, Bradley Birkenfeld, said &quot;The CIA I&#39;m sure is behind this [the Panama Papers leak], in my opinion&quot;. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/12/swiss-banker-whistleblower-cia-behind-panama-papers.html">Source</a>. <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-04-12/swiss-bank-whistleblower-claims-panama-papers-was-cia-operation">He added</a> “If you’ve got NSA and CIA spying on foreign governments they can certainly get into a law firm like this. But they selectively bring the information to the public domain that doesn’t hurt the U.S. in any shape or form. That’s wrong. And there’s something seriously sinister here behind this.”</p>

<p>Independent journalist Pepe Escobar argues it was the <a href="http://thenewsdoctors.com/panama-papers-hybrid-war-from-palmyra-to-panama-pepe-escobar/">NSA that leaked or hacked the Panama Papers</a>, <a href="https://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/The-Real-Target-of-the-Panama-Papers-20160510-0044.html">and adds</a>: &quot;Panama—where no one can flush a toilet without the U.S. government knowing about it—is for suckers; the real elite, connected (or profiting) even indirectly from the real Masters of the Universe and the liquid modernity enablers of top of the line turbo-capitalism use hack-proof Luxembourg, Virgin Islands or Cayman Islands connections – not to mention secure, Empire-based Delaware and Nevada loopholes.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wikileaks doesn&#39;t give a fuck about transparency.</p>

<p>Name one organisation that cares more about transparency than the organisation which gave the world the only documents on TPP and TTIP? Than the organisation that gave us the proof of American war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, and had their leaker tortured as a result? Than the organisation that gave us the proof us global mass surveillance by the NSA?</p>

<p>You&#39;re just another one of those on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that just believes everything the MSM has told you about WikiLeaks ever since they release the Hillary stuff; why are you even on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> if you believe the MSM just because WikiLeaks damaged the Hillary campaign?</p>

<p>That is somewhat true, however your post included a comment that I felt like addressing.  If this was just about WikiLeaks, why are you trying to defend Trump’s statement?  If you wanted to post about something else, maybe you should have posted it elsewhere?  At any time you can choose to simply not reply, just like I can choose to address any part of your post that I want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your right on in your assessment. Unfortunately folks are victims of partisan politics and MSM. Assuming that these folks who now bash WL are actual people and not shills or bots, I find it amazing that democrats would be so staunch in their political views to fail to recognize that their very own party denied their base the choice of candidates. I&#39;m appalled at what the DNC leaks revealed. Absolutely appalled. Our vote is sacred. It&#39;s the only gd power we little people have. Democrats, of all people, should be propping up WL&#39;s for ripping down the false illusion of choice that we were fed to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, yes, WL announce they&#39;re going to release stuff. It makes even less sense to release the audio <em>after</em> the WL release, because then people would be talking about that (the emails) first. Obviously they had to release the audio first to take away the attention from the email release that was coming up. Andif you believe WL timed it to come out after the audio, how do you think they new the audio was going to be released, and then managed to upload thousands of emails and release them less than an hour later?</p>

<p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201610131046281203-trump-clinton-leaks/">Source</a>. Where do you think that audio recording came from if not the NSA? And why do you think they chose to release it at that time? And haven&#39;t the MSM been repeating that it&#39;s &quot;illegal&quot; to read WL, and you must only listen to what they say? So the MSM makes a big fuss about the Trump audio, and then tells everyone there was nothing interesting in the WL releases, but Trump saying &quot;when you&#39;re a star they let you do anything&quot; is somehow vastly more important than the WL releases.</p>

<p>Is that the best response you can come up with?  </p>

<p>You realize that one side are Satanic pedophiles and the other side are not.  Assange is making nice with the side that are not the Satanic pedophiles.  </p>

<p>Perhaps, you would make the opposite choice.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot say since 2010-2012 but that&#39;s bullshit. Last time anyone could verify Assange being alive was October 25 2016. We also haven&#39;t had his PGP signature since then. If you&#39;d like more information check the sidebar over at <a href="/r/whereisassange">/r/whereisassange</a>. Some people theorize he&#39;s dead, some people still believe he&#39;s alive, but almost everyone agrees he has zero control over WikiLeaks anymore. Does that mean for certain it&#39;s taken over by the elite and used as their tool? No, but it does mean it&#39;s compromised.</p>

<p>It&#39;s perfectly obvious by now that order to discredit WikiLeaks, the establishment will have to release exculpatory claims that--like the WikiLeaks--the public is able to test for itself.

The Obama administration was demanding that I reveal the confidential sources I had relied on for a chapter about a botched CIA operation in my 2006 book, “State of War.” I had also written about the CIA operation for the New York Times, but the paper’s editors had suppressed the story at the government’s request.

    <div class="md"><p>The entire global establishment has just spent a year trying it&#39;s damnedest to discredit WikiLeaks. They burned NYT, WaPo, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, NPR, BBC, The Guardian and many other propaganda outlets in the process and an exponentially growing number of people--including US voters--are newly aware of what they&#39;ve been up to. That growth curve will accelerate in the wake of Mueller&#39;s investigation and those that will follow from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shitpost extraordinaire. Off the bat using the NYT as a source. Next two links you would think would be evidence <em>against</em> the idea of Russia controlling WL. Not sure what the next two links are supposed to prove. Snowden has asylum in Russia because he was targetted by the US. So now Snowden is a Russian asset too?  Regarding the Panama Papers, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7oxa2t/why_does_wl_trigger_rconspiracy/dsczxjh/">you don&#39;t have a leg to stand on</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Best theory breakdowns:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Best according to you. Snowden is only in Russia because <a href="https://www.laprogressive.com/edward-snowden-passport-revoked/">his visa was revoked</a> at precisely the moment he was passing throug Russia. Oops. All those articles you linked are shown to be misinformed crap by this one fact. You posted six articles saying Snowden is a Russian agent based on the fact he has asylum in Russia, when in fact the only reason he was stuck in Russia was because his visa was revoked <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/26/edward-snowden-moscow-airport_n_3506548.html">while he was in transit to Ecuador</a>, which had granted him asylum. Actually, the last of the six articles actually contradicts your point, I don&#39;t hink you read, or you were hoping no one would read it. The Tech Dirt article actually says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Snowden is under the care of &quot;hostile intelligence services,&quot; it&#39;s the US government&#39;s own fault. Charging him with espionage leaves Snowden very few options if he wishes to avoid being imprisoned. The documents he obtained clearly point out that pretty much all of Europe has been compromised, with various national intelligence agencies working directly in tandem with the NSA. This leaves a very short list of countries that Snowden would be willing to go to and an even shorter list of countries that would be willing to host him. </p>

<p>So, in Schindler&#39;s mind, Snowden is well on his way (if he isn&#39;t already) to being a tool of Russian intelligence. That requires a logical leap others haven&#39;t been ready to take, even if they disagree with Snowden&#39;s actions. They may believe the Russians have gained access to Snowden&#39;s stash of NSA files, but few are ready to state publicly that he&#39;s part of the Russian intelligence machinery. Schindler points out that Snowden&#39;s contact with the Russians preceded his arrival as if that were some sort of proof of his assertions, rather than an indication that Snowden was looking for options that wouldn&#39;t immediately turn him over to the US government. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly you never read the article before posting it as &quot;evidence&quot; that Snowden is a Russian agent, because it clearly is the opposite, actually.</p>

<p>Then you have a lot of stuff about Russia threatening WL. Huh? Aren&#39;t you trying to argue Assange is a Russian agent? And you forget the fact that <a href="https://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/russia/">WL has actually posted material about Russia</a>, even after all those threats from Russia.</p>

<p>And no shit Sherlock, why do you think WL dishes so much dirt on the West? The obvious answer is because there <em>is</em> so much dirt on the West and its allies. Why is the West committing war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan? Why are they forcing through TPP and TTIP that the public overwhelmingly do not want? Why have they been conducting global mass surveillance, even against Angela Merkel, which most people don&#39;t want? Why are they still torturing people at Gitmo, land stolen from Cuba, which most people are against? Maybe if the West didn&#39;t do so much shit, there wouldn&#39;t be so much shit on them. Just a thought.</p>

<p>And what does Assange having a show on RT prove? Have a look at those who <a href="https://www.rt.com/shows/">currently have a show on RT</a>: Alex Salmond, Jesse Ventura, Chris Hedges, Stephen Baldwin, Ed Schultz, George Galloway and Larry King; are you saying they&#39;re all Russian agents?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just gone through half your mega-shitpost and found no merit in it. Maybe another time I&#39;ll pick up on the rest if I have the energy. Judging by the first half, there&#39;s no point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I truly think both sides are as bad as each other, and any huge post with articles from the past 8 years can make a point and sway a position. To say the Russian&#39;s are more evil than the Americans is a stretch, to say any nation is more savage than the other is silly. All of the information released by Wikileaks is credible fact, and has not been disproved - how on earth is that not a beautiful thing?</p>

<p>America, China, Russia all of them are the same, systems of oppression with governments that suppress information. That being said i&#39;m sure Wikileaks do withhold some information, and honestly maybe they have ever reason to. Perhaps they know the true unbelievable extent of the problem and are attempting to topple the worst of the worst to begin with... </p>

<p>We just don&#39;t know the answer, and with that in mind we should just take everything they release with a grain of salt - we don&#39;t need this tribalistic bullshit of country blaming country for corruption that everyone is guilty of...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone made this comment in a thread in /new, I think it&#39;s relevant </p>

<p>Here is the AMA from last year.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9up6ox/">A.M.A. with wikileaks last year?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>The allegations that we have colluded with Trump, or any other candidate for that matter, or with Russia, are just groundless and false.</strong> We receive information anonymously, through an anonymous submission platform. We do not need to know the identity of the source, neither do we want to know it.</p>

<p>The intention of the source is irrelevant in our editorial process. Every source of every journalist has an intention and an agenda, may it be hidden or clear. Requesting the intention from our sources would firstly likely jeopardize their anonymity, and secondly form a bias in our understanding of the information we received.</p>

<p>Their authenticity and their relevance to the public or the historical record are the only preconditions for us to publish the documents we are given.
&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the emails that Don Jr. posted himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Hey Don. We have an unusual idea,” Wikileaks wrote on October 21, 2016. “Leak us one or more of your father’s tax returns.” Wikileaks then laid out three reasons why this would benefit both the Trumps and Wikileaks. One, The New York Times had already published a fragment of Trump’s tax returns on October 1; two, the rest could come out any time “through the most biased source (e.g. NYT/MSNBC).”</p>

<p>It is the third reason, though, Wikileaks wrote, that “is the real kicker.” “If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,” Wikileaks explained. “That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.” It then provided an email address and link where the Trump campaign could send the tax returns, and adds, “The same for any other negative stuff (documents, recordings) that you think has a decent chance of coming out. Let us put it out.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, that&#39;s why people are at least dubious of Wikileaks. </p>

<p>Not to mention the time Julian outed a bunch of protesters in Belarus by giving his friend and friend of Russia Israel Shamir the diplomatic cables early. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In December 2010, Israel Shamir, a WikiLeaks content aggregator in Russia, traveled to Belarus with a cache of unredacted American diplomatic cables concerning Belarus. (At the time, these unredacted cables were not available online.) He met Lukashenko’s chief of staff, Vladimir Makei, handed over the documents to the government, and stayed in the country to observe the presidential elections. Lukashenko pronounced himself the winner on Dec. 19, 2010, with nearly 80 percent of the vote. His nearest opponent, the leading dissident Andrei Sannikov, is now serving out a five-year prison sentence and is reportedly being tortured.</p>

<p>The same month that Shamir was in Minsk on behalf of WikiLeaks, the American left-wing journal Counterpunch published an article by Shamir in which he extolled Lukashenko (“The president of Belarus … walks freely among his people”), derided the dictator’s opponents (“The pro-Western ‘Gucci’ crowd,” Shamir called them), and credited WikiLeaks with exposing America’s “agents” in Belarus (“WikiLeaks has now revealed how … undeclared cash flows from the U.S. coffers to the Belarus ‘opposition’ ”).</p>

<p>He has a Jewish-sounding name, but Shamir is a dangerous anti-Semite. Will Yakowicz, who interviewed Shamir in Moscow for a Tablet Magazine profile, concluded that he is an anti-Semitic Holocaust-doubter. An exhaustive investigation carried out by the Norwegian anti-racist magazine Monitor found that Shamir has a long history of association with European fascist parties. He has changed his name several times, published anti-Semitic articles, and falsely claimed to be a correspondent for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Shamir was also in the habit of offering himself as a speaker at white-supremacist conventions in return for a small fee, daily expenses, flight tickets, and hotel accommodations for him and his wife. (WikiLeaks has since tried to distance itself from Shamir, but recent revelations by a former WikiLeaks staffer suggest that he was an influential part of the organization.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Julian Assange has the perspective regarding US global hegemony that his detractors seem to discount.

<p>If people could let that sink in,  they would understand why WL has a distinctly anti US bias,  or in the case of Trump,   that which damages or reduces the US ability to continue global wars is better for the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has changed, and that&#39;s fine because things change, but it now seems to always just be people arguing &amp; downvoting for wrong-think. I don&#39;t even know what the current wrong-think is in this sub because it has changed so much. </p>

<p>Now we have to defend Julian Assange? Wow. If someone has evidence he is not a good guy, by all means comment with that information and allow myself/others to decide. But lately the comments are so snide and condescending and just downvoted to oblivion. Smells fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there are a lot of disinfo agents and bots within this sub. Sorry, but I just don&#39;t believe anyone who is into conspiracies isn&#39;t a fan of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks considering they are the epitome of getting the truth out there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one issue I have with Julian Assange is that he denies there was a conspiracy with 9/11. How anyone can look at all the evidence and think there&#39;s no fuckery afoot, is highly suspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire global establishment has just spent a year trying it&#39;s damnedest to discredit WikiLeaks. They burned NYT, WaPo, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, NPR, BBC, The Guardian and many other propaganda outlets in the process and an exponentially growing number of people--including US voters--are newly aware of what they&#39;ve been up to. That growth curve will accelerate in the wake of Mueller&#39;s investigation and those that will follow from it.</p>
