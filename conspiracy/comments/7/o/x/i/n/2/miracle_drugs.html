        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone have any drugs that are miraculous to you? The one that prompted me to post this is dihydromyricetin, a truly miraculous supplement (not really a drug) that prevents a hangover and even stops one that’s already in progress. I’ve tried a few more “extreme” substances but this one is beautiful in its relative safety and efficacy.</p>

<p>Order some and try it next time you get drunk. This is no placebo effect, or anything of the sort. You will literally feel it working. Why this isn’t more popular I do not know and I can only assume it stems from a lack of profit, as is the case with many miraculous substances which are surprisingly underutilized. </p>

<p>What else is there few people know about but actually works great? Ideally stuff supported by evidence, which is perhaps a tall order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d be interested in trying this! My miracle drug will get me downvoted to hell but honest to god, Zoloft saved my life. My OCD and PMDD was so bad... it changed my life trajectory. The exact opposite happened when I went on the pill, destroyed my mental health. We all have different chemistry and even if something is just a helpful placebo it’s still helpful. I don’t think people should judge what someone else’s miracle drug is, we should support people’s mental wellbeing and positive outcomes! </p>

<p>I’m going to look this up now, thanks!</p>

<p>I tried numerous ADP&#39;s and combinations, but nothing that did the trick as good as Zoloft. </p>

<p>The best part is that I also suffered from premature ejaculation problems. Zoloft turned me into a porn star that can go on as long as I want to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dimethylfumarate keeps a severe case of psoriasis at bay for me.</p>

<p>It takes about a month or three to fully heal the patches, but the results are nothing short of astounding. The only draw-back are the hot flushes a few hours after ingestion and diarrhoea, but compared to living with a skin condition that causes severe self-esteem issues and depression, it&#39;s just a small trade-off.</p>

<p>The drug&#39;s called Psorinovo here in Holland and I have to pay everything out of pocket, which is an absolute disgrace. Millions of people suffer from that shit, going from one dermatologist to the next, trying all sorts of expensive and dangerous treatments (steroids etc.) that get them nowhere. The only reason I can think of is that it&#39;s much more lucrative to let millions suffer than to give them a drug that&#39;s really not that hard to make, nor expensive to produce. </p>
