       As I said in my title, I am not a natural "conspiracy" person. There are some conspiracies I believe in, others I don't. More often than not, I am looking for a non-sensational explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am somewhat left-centrist in my political views -- not in terms of the politicians in power, but in terms of where most Americans poll on issues like health care, taxes, drug legalization, immigration, social services, free speech, etc. -- and I realize that being left-centrist on this particular subreddit is a death knell for being respected. Well, so be it!
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT, years ago I thought this subreddit was a joke. It was nonsense. However, similar to this
       <a href="https://youtu.be/ofXxinOtPiQ?t=1m25s">
        Norm MacDonald opening SNL monologue
       </a>
       , either I changed my mind, or the rest of reddit got REALLY bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because right now, this subreddit is the only place I've found that reliably allows me to discuss issues, present facts, and get upvoted when I do myself proud, and downvoted when I screw up. The voting tallies on this subreddit have something to do, unlike many other places, with the quality of my submissions and replies.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is REALLY valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of that is due to the work of the mods. A lot of that is due, I will say, to people I can't
       <em>
        stand
       </em>
       who also post on this subreddit, who nevertheless call me out when I have holes in my arguments, or what I'm trying to say. I hate it sometimes...but it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks to the mods, thanks to the community here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep it up, please.

       This place grows on you. I signed up for Reddit years ago because of this sub, and I rarely post anywhere else. In comparison there's actually very few places on the internet to talk about conspiracies where you don't also have to deal with a bunch of crazy racists and people calling each other fag and shill for pages.

       Totally agree. Since you mention it, does anyone know of any other similar places with rational people? I like Godlike productions, but it's about 20% quality and 80% loons, and censored.

       I am not sure if I consider myself a natural conspirator or not, but I have been called every one of those terms here in this very sub because I dared to ask for evidence. While I will admit that sometimes I come off as douchy, but to say that this sub does not have the same issues as other sites is just plain naive at best or lying at worst. I still come here because there are some theories here that I find interesting, but I don't come here because everyone here is so nice and helpful to others who don't share their views.

       Make no mistake though - 4chan will always be superior, no matter the perceived quality of average discourse - simply because of complete anonymity and kost importantly -

       Well thought out conspiracy theories that aren’t simply dual purpose partisan arrack ads are great. There are plenty of conspiracies I don’t buy but I’ll be damned if I haven’t stuck my head down those rabbit holes until 3am on a work night. Hollow earth, flat earth, moon landings, nibiru, Atlantis. Shits fun

       If nothing else it’s fascinating. I used to work nights and listen to Art Bell in the late 90s then go home and check out wacky sites with pages and pages of writups by the likes of Richard C Hoagland. Cydonia civilizations on Mars you name it. It’s all good to me.

       Not everything is about Trump. It just so happens that a lot of Trump supporters are anti-establishment, considering he ran on an anti-establishment platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       18 months ago, if you were a Trump supporter, you were called a tinfoil hatter, bigot, racist and told that you should go back to r/conspiracy. You’d see on almost any sub on this website, let alone the political ones.

       It's becoming increasingly clear that the report button is being abused and used instead of the downvote button.

       That guy is all over threads about Russian collusion, trump negativity and Hillary Clinton posts gatekeeping. Here he is again gate keeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he ran on an anti-establishment platform to dupe these morons. Bernie ran anti-establishment, too. Why do you think they all chose to support trump? It’s not because he has a track record of helping people. He straight spoke to the racists,  nut jobs and “marginalized” whites.

       Don't the shills have the opposite effect though?  Whenever they brigade a thread it kind of confirms the allegations within that thread. I dont like them but they are a good indicator of what is really concerning TPTB. Atm the hot soots threads are any Pedogate or Hillary threads. Lol reading Podesta and establishment supporting comments on conspiracy is certainly weird.

       They're here for the oblivious. They're feigning being on the side of transparency and nonpartisanship. They're leftists framing those cheering Trump going after the deep state as "alt-right" white supremacists.

       Thank you for posting this, OP. I completely agree with you. I don’t post much in reddit due to being shy, but I do spend a LOT of time reading in this sub. Every day I learn something new and it is fun to stretch my mind with new theories here and there as they are presented.
I used to be very set in my beliefs but have come to realize that challenging them is the ultimate task.
I would like to thank this sub as well for giving me something to look forward to every night before I go to bed. Excluding some of the partisan bs, many of these posts are well researched and I appreciate the effort put into them.

        I am somewhat left-centrist in my political views -- not in terms of the politicians in power, but in terms of where most Americans poll on issues like health care, taxes, drug legalization, immigration, social services, free speech, etc. -- and I realize that being left-centrist on this particular subreddit is a death knell for being respected. Well, so be it!

       I honestly think most of us are pretty close to you in that regard.  A lot of us grew up in the era of GWB and the Patriot Act, the Iraq War, the emerging surveillance state, the rise of for-profit prisons, the deregulated banks that blew up the economy.  All of those things are very "right-wing" in nature.

       It wasn't until the influx of these Anarcho-Libertarian-Corporatist "Free hand of the Market" T_Ders that this place got thrown on it's head.  Those people are definitely the loudest here, but I don't think they're the majority.  Besides, any good conspiracist has realized that the Swamp didn't get drained, it got stocked with gators.

       I'd argue everyone is a natural conspiracy person. People have been forming groups with like minded intent to strengthen their bidding for years. The only way you could believe there aren't any conspiracies going on in our world is if you believe there is no black market, and there is no crime.

       It's becoming increasingly clear that the report button is being abused and used instead of the downvote button.

       At least it's a useful tool to see what comments trigger those who are drowning in the cognitive dissonance of the hive mentality.

       That guy is all over threads about Russian collusion, trump negativity and Hillary Clinton posts gatekeeping. Here he is again gate keeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he ran on an anti-establishment platform to dupe these morons. Bernie ran anti-establishment, too. Why do you think they all chose to support trump? It’s not because he has a track record of helping people. He straight spoke to the racists,  nut jobs and “marginalized” whites.
