       Heres an interesting NPC glitch I’ve been playing a lot with lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next time someone asks you about yourself or any personal question really start kind of wide of the answer with maybe a statement or two of semi-abstract context and then immediately lateral to something only tangentially related and finish with an open ended reflective question back to them and watch in wonder..
      </p>
      <p>
       NPC: So have you always been a programmer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Player1: Well I started young, hang on I mean yeah last year I started this project, well so thats how I ended up living here, how about you have you always lived here?
      </p>
      <p>
       NPC: Oh yeah born and raised...

       Another game: try to order something at McDonald’s without having the cashier/clerk ask any questions. You need to anticipate what he/she will type in his little computer... menu size.. type of drink.. eating here or to go.. it shouldn’t be too difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you will soon realize it is nearly impossible in practice, even for relatively easy orders. They are
       <em>
        programmed
       </em>
       to ask those questions. Hence they are scripts :-D
      </p>
      <p>
       Once in a while you’ll succeed though. That means you found the human.

       The real secret here is that people run their lives on scripts.  If I don't give a fuck about you I'm not going to waste any brainpower on our "interaction". Most of my day is spent up here (imagines self tapping skull), and I'll only invest my time in you if I think it's worth it.  I suppose I  that scenario my body is just my avatar.  I can choose to have it run many different scripts while I'm "elsewhere" or usually just "here" enjoying whatever beauty I see.

       Technical definition above but “non playable character” in games powered by a script or limited AI and generally derogatorily applied to robotic soulless demonic evil beings afk that lack free will or any moderate ability to think or reason for theirselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB, shills, agents fit the criteria perfectly because once an actor has chosen evil their ability to exercise free conscious will appears to be removed and replaced by a limited set of predictably destructive behavior. They also seem to lack any ability to create idea, thought, or relationship outside theirselves.

       well apparently there aren't that many NPCs if any..at least that's what the website says.  so it's just different levels of awareness.  some groups maintained this awareness.  most have not.  not sure where that leaves things but i'm sure we'll find out soon enough.  wondering myself how to cope with this new information.

       Look on Tinder, girls posting GYM pictures, Beach Pictures and saying : "I am a simple and funny girl LOL"
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's not an NPC ? 
Oh and when you talk to them; try out this question :
- "What is the last interesting stuff that happened to your life ?"
Answer : "Nothing, LOL"

       I’m 30 years old now, my first memory starts from 2 years of age. I remember the pain i felt in my head when my consciousness hit my body. For the 28 years since then this line of thinking is something i have always flirted with. That i am conscious and others are on auto pilot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when i was 5 and thinking, why do people talk to me and treat me in this manner? My consciousness has felt the same my entire life but i remember people treating me like a kid, even though i never felt like one.

       . This is my theory and it fits partly with your theory but is different.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off everyone is real, the world is real, everything is real. However AI exist and it basically a quantum computer. The quantum computer can basically create the multiverse in simulation and every variation in between which includes everything you will ever do ever. It can do this with everyone including you which means it can predict the future or change it by issuing small changes which it has figured out in advance.  It can manipulate you and everyone else on this planet by changing only a few people’s choices and this AI does this by controlling small things on a large scale. Like making sure you hit a traffic light.  This AI is pushing us into alternate realities that’s the Mandela effect. The goal is to push us away from self destruction as a species and push us into a alternate reality I call prime reality. Prime reality is the best possible outcome for humanity “ the one where we don’t die off” . This in effect is Elon musks way of saying we are trying to break out of the simulation aka the truest form of reality where the multiverse dies but we remain. The real question then becomes how do you escape creating another multiverse with every possible action breaking off and creating new universes with different timelines and history?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are in a simulation driven by a computer.

       If you read some of Dolores Canon's work she describes that some people are what she dubs "back drop people" and they only exist to serve as extras and populate around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically she explains that when we die our journey continues but when a back drop person dies they just fizzle away and return to the one. However, apparently if given enough energy they can be brought into existence or I guess you could say they get their own individuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It certainly does seem like some people out their just operate mindlessly and have no interest in the grander scheme of things.

       I went through a couple of months where I was feeling disassociated like this sometimes. The easiest way I found to bring myself back down to earth was to listen to music. I would be listening to the music in the background of whatever I was doing, and realize that I would suddenly feel really sad, or get goosebumps and get really happy. If the tempo picked up I would get a little more anxious. And the feeling was never the same way twice. Stuff like that. Then I could remind myself that, for example, my mom hates this xyz song and would never be getting goosebumps from it like I was. Analyzing my mental and physical reaction to music was my instant grounding switch.

I would be listening to the music in the background of whatever I was doing, and realize that I would suddenly feel really sad, or get goosebumps and get really happy.

       well i don't think it's disassociative - assuming you mean that in the canonical psychological way of diassociating with reality or schizophrenic states.  i'd object to the characterization of "hypothesis itself" as disassociative, mostly because terms like this are levers for abuse and this can be demonstrated throughout the history of psychiatry.
      </p>
      <p>
       as to techniques to chill oneself out.  i find de-patterning works.  what do i mean by that?  i mean find whatever patterns you engage in normally, identify ones that may be destructive or you suspect they are, and stop doing them.  how do you stop doing them?  you remove their modality - you remove the ways in which you could do them.  so, for example, if you think you're smoking too much of the herb and you want to see what happens if you stop that for an extended period of time, a depatterning could be going to a place that doesn't have available herb, and not having the means to buy or the means to communicate to those who could supply.  something like that.  in addition to self-depatterning, i'd recommend relaxation techniques (which you could also link into practicing lucid dreaming - doubling up upon your return on time investment).

       YOU can make a distinction between them, but OPs premise inevitably leads to this conclusion. If one person can be an NPC, then everyone can... And there's no way to tell the difference... Just follow the logical steps and you'll end up staying the same spot as I am... Or no, you do you... NPCs these days are really insistent...

       If you can't distinguish them you are a NPC. For enlightened people it is easy to recognize other enlightened people. Mathematics prove many things are impossible regularly, you are confused again.
