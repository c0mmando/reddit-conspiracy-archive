    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re interested in no corporations but find yourself drawn to libertarianism, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_market_anarchism">left wing market anarchism</a> is a form of left-libertarianism that is pretty much capitalism without corporations. They tend to view corporations as vehicles for undeserved state privileges which distort the market for special interests. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally support this ideology, I am more inclined to other forms of libertarian socialism, so please don&#39;t argue with me about it. I just thought there&#39;d be some cross interest for people interested in no corporations. </p>

<p>Edit: p.s. for people who hate government currency and want to learn about alternative systems, you might find the bit about Josiah Warren and the Cincinnati Time Store interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here, I prefer other libertarian socialist ideologies such
as Democratic Socialism (just left of Bernie and FDR&#39;s Social Democracy/centrist-ish economics) but I see anarchists as allies
with morals in common.
Plus anarchism seems far more benevolent compared to most other
ideologies on the spectrum.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the SJW/feminist/cringe anarchy/molotov man stereotypes
of left wing anarchists that the corporate media likes to push to smear
the idea of anti-gov/minimal gov socialists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And here&#39;s a relevant quote which explains why this phenomenon occurs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always so interesting to me how popular posts like this are. 80% upvoted as of this writing. It&#39;s like everyone intuitively <em>gets it</em>, but once you start vocalizing and describing in detail what&#39;s happening, once you call capitalism by its name, people flood out of the woodwork to defend it and attack all alternatives. It&#39;s almost like a programed response, people are taught that war is peace, ignorance is truth, slavery is freedom, and how can they know any better? They don&#39;t want to look. But they know <em>something</em> is wrong. They know people shouldn&#39;t die homeless amidst empty mansions and piles of thrown away food. They know they shouldn&#39;t have to slave their lives away making pennies on their employers&#39; dollars just to die in poverty from a preventable illness they couldn&#39;t afford to treat. They know that we can do better than that, for ourselves and for future generations of Americans. </p>

<p>Everyone seems to get that everything in our society is fucked, that the rich and special interests dominate everything, greed and corruption rule, but once you put it into specific words like capitalism people just get triggered. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;capitalism&quot;, per-say...</p>

<p>When one realizes they are part of a big problem and don&#39;t want to be a part of it, one of two things occur; they accept it as life and live with their head down; or they fight it at any cost.</p>

<p>Right now there is a nation divided and a protocol to widen that divide. One half not looking to the future, the other half looking to save the future.</p>

<p>What does this all mean for you though? </p>

<p>That depends on what you want the future to represent.</p>

<p>I learned something stark recently that I had not ever really considered, at heart. </p>
