    <div class="md"><p>They had a lot of guns because that was their business but they also had a lot of reports of child abuse coming from a weird religious themed gun seller compound. They fucked up every single aspect of the raid, the press was there before ATF and the standoff began. Koresh was a religious nut and didn&#39;t want to go because he thought he was either god (or jesus I don&#39;t quite remember) and wanted to stay in his home. </p>

<p>After the ATF got angry and wanted to show how big their dicks were Koresh got scared and wanted a way out but it was too late. They burned the shit down and shot like 10 billion rounds through. They went overkill to prove they were not pussies after Ruby Ridge ended in a loss and ended up making themselves look even worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re comment is shit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They had a lot of guns</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is their right to have. They were in Texas, not California, lots of people have lots of guns there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>that was their business</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is literally nothing to indicate this. They were buyers of guns, but I have not seen and cannot find anything that accuses them of selling any weapons. Randy Weaver, of Ruby Ridge fame, was accused of selling illegal guns, not Koresh - although Koresh was accused of possibly purchasing illegal weapons. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>they also had a lot of reports of child abuse</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a wild distortion of reality. There was a six month investigation that found no evidence of child abuse. The FBI and Janet Reno said the reason for the final siege was that they had information that child abuse was taking place. The directory of the FBI, William Sessions, publicly came out and said this explanation was false and there was no evidence of child abuse that led to the final siege. </p>

<p>The allegations of child abuse came from enemies and ex Branch Dravidian&#39;s that had an axe to grind with David Koresh. The only allegation that may have been true, is an allegation of statutory rape. Apparently, with the permission of her parents, Koresh married a 13 year old girl and possibly consummated the marriage with her. However, even this claim is in doubt. </p>

<p>Truthfully though, it really doesn&#39;t matter, because the ATF has no jurisdiction for such claims anyway. The claims were inserted in the ATF documentation to inflame the media and public so that they not look like such fuckups for murdering a bunch of people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>from a weird religious themed gun seller compound</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They weren&#39;t selling guns and they were no more weird that orthodox Jews, Mormans, Scientologists, Muslims or Amish. By the way, believing in weird religion is your right. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the press was there before ATF</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because the ATF called the press and told them of the raid. The ATF also had video tapes of their own. They wanted media attention for what they were about to do. They wanted good media attention after their fuck up at Ruby Ridge. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Koresh was a religious nut</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He wasn&#39;t any nuttier than any other pastor, imam, priest or rabbi. The media has programmed you to slander this person you know nothing about. Koresh claimed he was a prophet, but that is not any different than a claim by any other religious authority as a gateway and representative of God. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>didn&#39;t want to go because he thought he was either god</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, he didn&#39;t want to go because he hadn&#39;t done anything wrong and he didn&#39;t believe he was God or Jesus. He believed he was a prophet and was the &quot;Lamb of God&quot;. He believed in a New World Order and he believed he would be killed by that New World Order as part of the Apocalypse. It&#39;s crazy, but no crazier than any other religious belief and he was indeed murdered by the NWO. It should also be noted, that he was shot almost as soon as the ATF arrived. If they shot me without even giving me a chance to come out or knock on my door, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be too keen on coming out either. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the ATF got angry and wanted to show how big their dicks were Koresh got scared and wanted a way out but it was too late. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t correct either. The FBI has negotiated with Koresh to come out, and he said he would once he finished his manuscript. As he neared completion, the FBI and ATF led the final siege on the compound. The truth is, the government fucked up, it&#39;s very likely the order for the final siege came from Reno and/or Clinton and it&#39;s very likely the ATF and FBI had no intention of allowing the situation to end peacefully. The Davidians shot several of their agents in self defense and they were out for blood. They had him surrounded. There was no reason for the siege. They had already waited fifty something days and could have waited infidelity. At some point, the people inside would have had to come out. The government chose to murder innocent men, women and children to get to one man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s one of the documentaries linked here, but there&#39;s a great documentary about Waco where they show the CNN footage that was only aired once (live), where the tank knocks down part of a building and starts firing before anybody at the Davidians does anything. Pretty eye opening. </p>

<p>Not sure what was really going on there. Maybe multiple purposes----distraction from Hilary&#39;s healthcare fuckup, putting the white nationalists in their place, killing a bunch of Christians, villainizing supposed child abusers when the real child abusers are under their nose, etc. </p>
