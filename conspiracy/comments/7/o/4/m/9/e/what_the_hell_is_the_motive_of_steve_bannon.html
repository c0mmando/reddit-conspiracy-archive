    <div class="md"><p>Bannon seemed to be at odds with a lot of people in Trump&#39;s administration, especially the family members. He may have never really liked Trump - he may have just saw Trump as a vehicle for furthering his own political vision. Once he got booted and subsequently ignored, he had no reason to hold back on saying how he really feels.</p>

<p>And Trump will throw anyone except family under the bus as soon as it&#39;s convenient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll probably do a post about this myself but I&#39;m thinking this was always in the works. Bannon is Council for National Policy, brought fellow CNP guy/dystopian book villain Erik Prince into Trump&#39;s orbit, and as OP points out, he definitely did save Trump&#39;s campaign (Teleprompter, Cambridge Analytica, Government Accountability Institute, speech writing including portions of Trumps inaugural address directly taken from Bannon&#39;s book). </p>

<p>Bannon played nice with Trump until he started opposing Bannon ideas and/or because he thinks this investigation will end up sinking him...doesn&#39;t really matter. Not only has he encouraged Prince to run for the senate and formed a recent political org to further his agenda, it&#39;s been suggested Bannon himself may try to primary Trump in &#39;20, or at least back a surrogate with the full force of his influence.</p>

<p>Plus, GAI is essentially an oppo research firm...think there&#39;s any chance he and Mercer have aimed that weapon at Trump? They may know more about his financials than they let on. Look what they accomplished with Clinton Cash. </p>

<p>If you are looking for a &quot;coup&quot;-type movement really poised and capable of taking Trump on, Bannon&#39;s your guy. </p>

<p>Right - and then when candidate trump the radioactive laughing stock became president trump the actual president, a bunch of more important people got involved and bannon got the boot. That would piss anyone off, and pissed-off people say nasty things about the people who pissed them off. Simple as.</p>

<p>Or from the other side - it&#39;s all part of the n-dimensional chess game. Bannon had a role in the campaign, campaign ends, time to leave - but why waste an opportunity, let&#39;s pretend to have a big bust-up, make a splash. Like a tag-team who dramatically start fighting <em>each other</em> in the middle of wrestlemania, woah tune in next time sort of thing.</p>

<p>Second one&#39;s kind of mad, but then the whole thing&#39;s kind of mad, so who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a systematic effort by the establishment (or globalists/deep state/elites/whatever you want to call them) to remove any vestige of insurgency nationalists from the mainstream after Trump&#39;s victory on the back of nationalist insurgents. </p>

<p>First they removed Flynn, then Bannon, then turned on Moore (based on flimsy accusations), and now they&#39;re making sure Bannon and his ilk go away for good. </p>

<p>Bannon has been planning to take back the GOP through primary challenges for the 2018 elections, and the establishment can&#39;t let that happen. In short time, he&#39;ll likely be removed from Breitbart and we&#39;ll never hear from him again, and the Ryan/McConnell wing of the GOP will reign triumphant. </p>

<p>As to why he said what he said, consider that this was an easy out for him. Imagine Mueller and his gang come to him and say he&#39;s under investigation, and they can bring some trumped up charges against him and throw him in jail for tax evasion or something like that. Their offer is for him to say something negative about Don Jr. (who he already dislikes), and then quietly exit politics. In return, they will leave him alone. </p>

<p>Notice how on the same day as this, Trump weakly disbanded his investigation into voter fraud, for no reason. </p>

<p>The Trump insurgency is officially over. Everyone associated with it will either betray (like Trump himself) or will be pushed aside. He is now an establishment Republican who will do establishment Republican things, like the tax bill. Bannon is a thorn in the elite&#39;s side, so he had to be removed.</p>

<p>The Republicans had enough voter suppression in 2012, it only failed because the Republican dumb fucks wouldn&#39;t get off their asses and vote for Romney,  they need someone far more openly racist than Romney was and Romney was very racist. </p>
