        Unlike the initial reports suggested about Intel chips being vulnerable to some severe ‘memory leaking’ flaws, full technical details about the vulnerabilities have now been emerged, which revealed that almost every modern processor since 1995 is vulnerable to the issues.
Disclosed today by Google Project Zero, the vulnerabilities potentially impact all major CPUs, including those from AMD, ARM, and Intel—threatening almost all PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, regardless of manufacturer or operating system.

       30% won't be relevant for end users. This effect will almost only be felt by cloud providers that use kernel heavy applications across multiple VMs. The performance impact for endusers is in the 1-5% range.

       This is wrong. An attacker can't take over you system. He can "only" read the content of your RAM. This exploit can't execute code on your system. It can sniff out your credentials and data though.

       Basically multiple vulnerabilities, some zero day, some are just memory leaks, all released the last 3 days, and not one article asking how it is that for 2 DECADES many of these 'flaws' were not known?

       The issue arises if multiple users share an infrastructure. The consultants will likely feel slow down if they use a centralized host, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't speak for other exploits or zero days. Those might very well compromise systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       How it wasn't found earlier is a very good question though. Even more so because 4 groups separately researched the same bug. I'd very interested in the background that prompted the research.

       They seem to be safe from the meltdown exploit. That one is easier to use and implement. The patches that are published now are aimed to prevent it and it only applies to Intel CPUs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spectre exploit is much harder to abuse but also much harder to fix. This can't be fixed by software updates but only by an entirely new CPU design. This will take years until it is resolved. This seems to apply to all modern CPUs. AMD, Intel and ARM.

       Damn... was afraid of that. At least I'm only vulnerable to the other one.

       Meltdown is the big one everybody is up in arms about at the moment. Spectre isn't that big of a deal yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that severe for the end user since the software for the exploit has to be run locally can "only" read information and not execute code itself. The information gained (user/ password for instance) might be used to run code though.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's speculated that it is possible to use this exploit through Java script on web pages though to gain the memory data of your browser, like credentials and key strokes. But this isn't confirmed yet afaik.

       You are 100% correct that the performance impact will be minor for most users as syscalls are not common for average use cases. In fact, everything about this post stinks of ignorance. OP just has an angry rant with many things that he said, being completely false and easily disprovable.

       The Primary concern here is Meltdown, and that is an Intel only bug.

       I am truly concerned with NSA spying and backdoors. But ignorant posts like this do more harm the cause than good. We have plenty of real issues to be upset about like ME and PSP without having to make up fairy tales to attack the NSA.

       This would not help the NSA. You have to execute code locally for this to be an issue. And if the NSA can execute local code on your machine you're fucked anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big issue is for cloud providers since attackers can "jump" VMs with basic user rights. I could read RAM data from a completely separate VM on a completely separate domain if they run on the same VM host.

       Yes and no. They can read the information of the browser only. And only of those tabs in the same process as the infected site.

       It might be possible to extract the stored passwords from the browser though.

       That isn't true, this is a true compromise of the system, the ability to load and execute undetected, these are kernel level exploits to the processor not RAM.

      <p>
       What complicates this even further is the amount of remediation required, it is a combination of hardware specific firmware updates, OS specific updates, and hypervisor updates.
      </p>
      <p>
       AWS underlying infrastructure was relatively unaffected because of the hardware they predominantly use and addressed the issue several weeks ago, Microsoft Azure on the other hand is doing hard reboots tonight across their entire infrastructure to address the vulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't mean there aren't OS patches still needed to be done for AWS and Azure instances that customers own.

       Coin mining is highly GPU, not CPU. This is why people are buying out graphics cards to mine coins... Bitcoin was designed to use the kind of  calculations that are very difficult for CPUs to do, but GPUs were specifically designed for.

       You answered your own question, basically anything from the last 10 years is an open door.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you run into another problem, the OS you can run on old hardware will have known exploits.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the answer is to build your own hardware and O/S and tell nobody how you did it.  :/

       I think most here are missing the point. It isn't the bug that is the backdoor as that's supposedly been there for years, it's the fact that suddenly it's a big deal and windows is releasing a "secret" patch for this 2 decade old vulnerability. The backdoor is in the patch and oh yeah it is gonna slow down your computer "but it is for your protection". Where have I heard that before?

       Security vulnerability of this magnitude and even greater get discovered from time to time. The big DNS flaw that Dan Kaminsky discovered comes to in almost immediately as a HUGE vulnerability with great potential impact. But it, others, and this one as well, were and will continue to be discovered, exploited, and patched. In no particular order.

       It's a very serious vulnerability for cloud providers and hosts.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are no patches applied to the infrastructure VMs on cloud providers are able to read the entire RAM of the host and all other VMs on the same host. Without needing any access rights to the host or VMs.

       It isn't a serious vulnerability for anybody.  At worst, it is a weakening of defense in depth, by decloaking kernel ASLR.  That isn't really such a big deal.

       You can't read kernel memory with this vuln, only locate a target to read.  If there are actual vulns allowing code to read arbitrary kernel memory, those are serious, and the TLB issue makes them more efficient, but that's it.  As a sysadmin, you should be concerned about the actual vulns, not a side piece that accelerates them.

       K, I just read the meltdown paper.  I see why you are concerned.  From my perspective, this is nothing new.  Their exploit uses either an exception handler or a TAX.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here I am disclosing to the public for the first time a vulnerability I have known for 7 years.  Exception handlers are called from the kernel and return using an iret instruction.  You can change debug registers and control registers in the call stack and the iret will clobber those system registers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why MS instituted safe exception handling, but they never explained it to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, at least on Windows (I haven't checked elsewhere) exception handlers let you inject code into the kernel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for correcting me on this, it was more nuanced than I though.  But it is time to fix exception handling, it's been a decade now.

       I agree with you though, The Management Engine is yet another NSA backdoor, and it's not new, since researchers have been pointing this out for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       THE IMPORTANT THING you need to keep in mind, is that the NSA isn't dumb, they don't approach this issue with 1 or even 2 backdoors and tools at their disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA takes a, for lack of a better term, Broad Spectrum Star Trek shield modulation approach.

       <li>
        Hard Drive Hardware Firmware

      </ul>
      <p>
       Basically, we're fucked. And it's not even the NSA per se that scares me it's the 'after market/black market' for all these built in security flaws that results after the NSA is done with it whereby they sell the info and tools to police, private investigators, data aggregators, etc etc etc..

       The TLB issue that is dominating the news isn't an actual vulnerability, it's merely a weakness of defense in depth, because it decloaks kernel ASLR.  ASLR itself is a defense against vulns, but not the first line defense.  And the TLB cache doesn't even fully weaken it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the TLB issue is a total non issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything it's being treated as a major issue because it might also decloak NSA kernel injections, so fixing it might make us worse off.

       the patch IS the backdoor lol.  the performance hit is related to the hidden services that provide a real-time feed to the spooks.  it's an upgrade to an existing backdoor.  just speculation, but the move to get the fix out seems kinda pushy...
