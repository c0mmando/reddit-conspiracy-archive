       Was wondering what are everyone’s personal favourite conspiracy theories related to Disney? Like they own nearly everything at this point, so surely there has to be some juicy &amp; compelling theories surrounding them, are there any that particularly stand out to you guys the most?

       Disney programs children to think the idea of royalty/nobility is a wonderful thing, in reality that is the root cause of all our problems..... people claiming rule over us
      </p>
      <p>
       Walt disneys brother and Disney co-founder Roy Disney was a vatican knight aswell, a knight is defined as a military servant
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no doubt in my mind that the disney family were/are a bunch of pedophiles, because that kind of parisitic behaviour goes hand in hand with the vatican(rome)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also lots of subliminal messaging in disney aimed at sexualizing kids
      </p>
      <p>
       The disney family are parasites on society, absolute scum

       Some theorists talk about Disney's potential relationship to Project Monarch. It's contended that Disney secretly uses mk-ultra mind control techniques to turn young female (and sometimes male) celebrities into "Beta Kittens," ie nympho sex slaves used to promote the sexualization of young women.
      </p>
      <p>
       People looking at this through an occult reality-tunnel tend to believe it's a satanic ritual of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be an over obsession with illuminati signaling, claiming that anyone, literally anyone who wears animal prints, or like the color purple, is a beta kitten. Which would make ME a beta kitten and I'm fairly, mostly, reasonably sure that isn't true.

       I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Disney basically controls copyright law
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, every time mickey mouse comes close to becoming public domain, Disney pulls some legislative strings to extend the deadline.  Now that they're swallowing media companies like nobody's business, they can only gain more control over intellectual property rights and the law that governs them.

       Before he died, Disney wanted to use the land in Florida at Walt Disney World to create a self sustaining community living in an inclosed biosphere. It would have its own nuclear energy and would have an industrial park that would lead innovations in engineering, agriculture, and other industries. In this city all development, media, transportation, and communication would be run by Disney. If Disney had succeeded, his empire would have spread into more industries, including nuclear, industrial, and just about everything else. People would be dying to live like the citizens who were controlled by Disney and the technology used to control every aspect of their lives would make it into every home.

       Disney is satanic.  The Bible forbids magic and witchcraft.  Most Disney movies and shows have these elements in them making kids love it.  Also tons of sexual subliminal as well as pushing people like Hanna Montana on a generation of girls then having her turn into a crazy pan sexual nutjob for them all to follow.  God is real and Disney is working for the enemy.

       If salvation is that hard and arbitrary you should consider yourself doomed, because you are probably making a mistake you can't even discern, maybe the use of reddit itself is a seducing spirit! Who knows man, just get yourself ready for hell because with those rules, I doubt you will make it.

       This has nothing to do with salvation.  Salvation by repentance and believing the gospel of Jesus Christ is the only thing that saves.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have repented of sin and believed that gospel then you are saved no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm simply stating that Disney itself is a Luciferian company.  Walt Disney was an occultist.  If you are a Christian then you believe in Satan and the Bible teaches in the end he has deceived the whole world.  Almost everything in this world is deception.

       The source of power comes from devils (unclean spirits.)  If you research witchcraft they use mind altering drugs (which is called sorcery in the Bible.  Sorcery = pharmakeía in Greek)
      </p>
      <p>
       So taking things like LSD is Sorcery and it's used in witchcraft to "fill your chalice" with devils/demons.  They open your mind to make it easier for them to come inside you.  The more you can get the more powerful you become.  These devils are the source of the magic.  If you become telekinetic, it's not because you are moving things it's simply the devils able to interact with our realm.  They become flesh of your flesh and you really don't know they are there but they will make your will come to bass which is the basic of witchcraft.  Many can live inside a person at one time like Legion in the Bible.  This is where the term "we are Legion" comes from:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:2  And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:3  Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:4  Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:5  And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:6  But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:7  And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:8  For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:9  And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:10  And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:11  Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:12  And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:13  And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:14  And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:15  And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
