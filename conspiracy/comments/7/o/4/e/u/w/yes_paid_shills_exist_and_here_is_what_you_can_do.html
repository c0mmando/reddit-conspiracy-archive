<p><strong>Do Government Paid Shills Exist?</strong></p>

<p>Just now, somebody wrote me a comment that said something a long the lines of, “Do these people (me) really think their comments are so important that there are government-paid shills here?”</p>

<p>Yes, I do, actually (and I am not even talking about mine per se******), but yes I believe words have extreme power in this information age. I think our voices are powerful.</p>

<p>The word ‘shill’ gets thrown around a lot here, and I want to be clear that I am not saying that somebody who disagrees with somebody else is necessarily a shill. There are users here of all varieties, backgrounds, and intentions. There are trolls and there are probably those with mental illness. There are many different types of commenters here, and accusing anyone and everyone of being a shill is not a fair conclusion.</p>

<p>Still, there is massive evidence, that yes, shills do come to forums like this. So, in this post, I wanted to show you this massive evidence, and then I want to explain why your words are more important than you realize. Finally, I wanted to talk about my own conclusions on how these shills operate on subreddits like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and others like it.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Shills Exist</strong></p>

<p>Let us start with the obvious. Shills often are paid by companies  to boost reviews and commentary on certain products. They may also artificially build Twitter followings, likes, and manipulate social media:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-fiorella/cyber-shills_b_2803801.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-fiorella/cyber-shills_b_2803801.html</a></p>

<p>If you have been on the front page of Reddit, you probably have seen those sneaky posts where a product is clearly being advertised, and it is usually called out in the thread or on subs like <a href="/r/hailcorporate">/r/hailcorporate</a>. Why do they do it? Well, it is this simple (from the above article):</p>

<p>“Social proof is the theory that an individual’s beliefs or purchase decisions are positively impacted if enough of their peers believe something to be true or valuable (as represented by online votes, positive ratings, etc.).”</p>

<p>Further, “In an economy where social proof is becoming mandatory for media exposure and sales, cyber shills will be hired in greater numbers by brand and marketing firms, despite their public opposition to the practice.”</p>

<p>Most of us reading have seen these paid corporate shills on Reddit, but the question is, are there really shills pushing certain political agendas? I think it is bad enough that we are bombarded by these sneaky paid product shills, but ultimately, there is something much more sinister at hand.</p>

<p><strong>Government Shills?</strong></p>

<p>When the user earlier made the comment that I was somehow deluded that there are paid shills with a political agenda, I laughed. No matter where you fall on the political spectrum, yes, there is absolute proof that paid shills can infiltrate different online communities to promote an agenda. Whether you agree with this agenda or not, there is still an agenda. Here is an article about Hillary Clinton’s “Correct the Record”:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-clinton-digital-trolling-20160506-snap-htmlstory.html">http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-clinton-digital-trolling-20160506-snap-htmlstory.html</a></p>

<p>This was written during the election, and the article states, “When the Internet’s legions of Hillary hecklers steal away to chat rooms and Facebook pages to vent grievances about Clinton, express revulsion toward Clinton and launch attacks on Clinton, they now may find themselves in a surprising place – confronted by a multimillion dollar super PAC working with Clinton.”</p>

<p>I want to keep this post non-partisan*, as Trump is said to have his abundance of paid shills, too:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/25/study-cnns-paid-trump-shills-made-more-500-appearances-over-last-three-months/218325">https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/25/study-cnns-paid-trump-shills-made-more-500-appearances-over-last-three-months/218325</a></p>

<p>And according to this article, Russian trolls were hired to play as Pro-Trump supporters:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7">http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7</a></p>

<p>Again, wherever you fall on the political spectrum, it is likely you will find shills representing your side somewhere.</p>

<p>Israel is now, for example, paying students to defend it online:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/</a></p>

<p>Whatever you believe politically, all of this is pure manipulation. The fact is, you maybe cannot ever really know for sure who is commenting on posts here and what their agenda is, and that is the problem. If you come onto a forum like this assuming all users have good intentions, I feel that is just simply naïve. The real world does not operate that way, and neither does the internet. In fact, I would say a lot of problems I have had in life have been due to trusting people too much. I know better now.</p>

<p>Let us not forget the thousands of leaks by Snowden regarding the NSA. Whether you believe he was a limited hangout or not, it is clear that the NSA is spying on nearly every citizen, and manipulating internet message boards is not a huge surprise. I cannot even believe that we are on a conspiracy forum, and ‘people’ seemingly believe that all users and commenters are trustworthy. Anyway, here is a reminder of some of the Snowden leaks for those of you forgot:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/snowden-leaks-timeline-2016-9">http://www.businessinsider.com/snowden-leaks-timeline-2016-9</a></p>

<p>By the way, this is not all limited to the United States. Here is an article about the UK Intelligence Agency GCHQ and its online tactics leaked by Snowden:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/14/gchq-tools-manipulate-online-information-leak">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/14/gchq-tools-manipulate-online-information-leak</a></p>

<p>I can keep going and going and going. By the way, I tried to link to “credible” sources, but just know there are endless amounts coming from less “credible” sources that I could have linked, but I wanted to keep this post as “credible” as possible. What constitutes a credible source is ultimately up to you! 😊</p>

<p>Also, do not forget the rise and presence of bots:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/09/01/the-conversation-about-conversational-ai-how-chatbots-and-ai-bots-will-impact-your-business-metrics/#4728d28766cd">https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/09/01/the-conversation-about-conversational-ai-how-chatbots-and-ai-bots-will-impact-your-business-metrics/#4728d28766cd</a></p>

<p><strong>What are their tactics?</strong></p>

<p>When doing this post, I actually found my own article linked to a site (haha, made me laugh!). They actually credited me though! Here is a review of their tactics. I wrote this some time ago, but it is good to review forum sliding, gate keeping, etc., and other tactics:</p>

<p><a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/online-internet-tactics-gatekeeping-disinformation-forum-sliding-and-more/">http://investmentwatchblog.com/online-internet-tactics-gatekeeping-disinformation-forum-sliding-and-more/</a></p>

<p><strong>WHY?</strong></p>

<p>Your words do have power. You have power! Am I saying that every comment made here is good? Am I saying every post made here is good? No. I am saying, though, that there is enough ‘good’ here that ‘they’ really do need shills to infiltrate certain threads. </p>

<p>You do not have to be the president or a political leader or rich and famous to change the world. You can change the world through your words. Am I saying that every little comment or post here is going to make some fundamental world change? NO. I am saying that the potential is there, and the more we band together, the more that potential rises. That is, why, of course, many of the shills use forum sliding and divide and conquer tactics to break up threads.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I wrote a post about the satirical “A Modest Proposal”, where Jonathon Swift proposed impoverished Irish gentlemen to sell their children as food to the rich. It caused outrage and change:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal</a> </p>

<p>This, is, of course, one example, but I wanted to link to an example where critique of the elite can actually lead to change in society. Again, am I saying that every single thing written here is this influential? No! But, I kind of stand by the belief that even if you change one person’s mind, you are changing <em>their</em> world.
Remember, though, language can be used for good or bad:</p>

<p>“But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” ― George Orwell, 1984</p>

<p>“One lie has the power to tarnish a thousand truths.” ― Al David</p>

<p>Still, despite this possible corruption, Ernest Hemingway said,</p>

<p>“All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.” </p>

<p><strong>My Experiences</strong></p>

<p>In the end, the shills are going to be here. They exist, and many of us, including myself, buy into their tactics even when we know there are shills. I am not writing this to convince people to start accusing everyone of shillery – it would not make a difference anyway. Rather, I am writing this so I can reference it for every single time a commenter says paid online shills do not exist. Further, I am writing this to possibly make readers more aware as they sift through comment threads. </p>

<p>I have been on Reddit a long time, and perhaps my days are numbered here. I find it more difficult to have the patience to post, and yes, I do get attacked here a lot, but I also have experienced a lot of good, which I’ll talk about in a moment. Here is my best advice for you all:</p>

<p>• Sort by new and controversial. Look at those who are downvoted. There are usually two reasons. One, they are being a jerk, or two, they may be telling the truth. </p>

<p>• Comment and speak up. You may not think your words do not matter, but when people back me up, it creates more power. Defend the little guy. Defend the guy getting attacked by “shills.”</p>

<p>• Downvotes sometimes hurt feelings - or at least they hurt mine! (Kind of kidding). In all seriousness, it sucks when you write something really well-thought out, and then you see it buried with downvotes. Try not to let it dissuade you.</p>

<p>• Do not buy into their tactics. This is the hardest one. Be aware of their tactics, and when you can call them out, do so. “This is forum sliding because…” or “This is ad hominem because…” Know your list of logical fallacies:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/eng207-td/Logic%20and%20Analysis/most_common_logical_fallacies.htm">https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/eng207-td/Logic%20and%20Analysis/most_common_logical_fallacies.htm</a></p>

<p>• Do not buy into divide and conquer. We all have a different set of political beliefs, but I try to keep the focus on the truth – not my biases. I am Christian, but I try, for example, not to let my beliefs interfere with an atheist commenter. </p>

<p>• Do not let you emotions get the best of you! This is the biggest one I see. I see a lot of great writers here who get so angry and upset, and then they get banned for going off the rails. They are trying “to anger troll” you, and it works! When I am getting really bombarded, I take a break. </p>

<p>Finally, whatever you do, be nice! I find that responding to my haters, even nicely, is the best tactic online – kill them with kindness, so to speak.</p>

<p>Actually, the other day, somebody here messaged me, and they said, “What stood out to me about you is how positively you responded to a snarky comment I made. That changed my view.”
I will never forget that comment (though I paraphrased it). I am not saying I have always been 100% nice online, but I have found remaining “collegial” has been my greatest tool.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Many here may ask why I care so much about writing on Reddit (or imply I am a loser with no life...not true!) Sometimes, I wonder if is a waste of time, but ultimately, at least for now, I do not think it is. Sure, over the years, this place, overall, has become a shill haven, but I still have seen the good here, despite it all, and that is how I try to operate life – looking for the good.
I know people have changed my life here, and I wonder if I can help or change theirs, too.</p>

<p>Think about the times you have changed in life. It was not always one giant, fundamental event. Sometimes it was just a word that spoke to you and changed your view. That is all anybody really needs.</p>

<p>The second are people working for PR firms or other companies that get hired to actively disparage anyone who they find through keywords, that talk about the product or service or issue in a way that goes against a set agenda. </p>

<p>The third kind of shill is like an &#39;undercover cop&#39; that actually gets into a subreddit, an online community and becomes one of their &#39;leaders&#39; or &#39;regulars&#39;. They can influence greatly  the opinion of many just by taking the time to connect with people in that community.</p>

<p>You get this in the real world too, but obviously online makes it much easier.</p>

There was a fresh shill crew that&#39;s been showing up and using obvious vote scripts to project the idea that our r/conspriacy community supports these bogus ass shill talking points. It&#39;s so fucking obvious when they give themselves these obscene amount of upvotes and then downvote the shit out of people who call them on their shit.. Like how fucking obvious can they be? It&#39;s a dead give away...I&#39;m sure the community knows and even the mods are well aware of these actors but yet the mods refuse to ban this type of abuse. The mods will ban people who call out the truth yet refuse to take any action against these shill fucks...  It seems like although we may have a couple honest mods left, there has been some kind of fuckery going on behind the scenes... This is 100% certain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well down vote brigading is stopped far easier last time I was a new user I was not even allowed to downvote until i got like 100 points or something to that effect. That stops random accounts with different ip addresses being created to down vote brigade a topic that they want to block from reaching front pages or being seen.</p>

<p>There have been EXTREMLEY racist and even some pornographic sub reddits allowed on this website and yet the pizzagate sub reddit was banned? hmmm really voat allows that sub to exist though.</p>

<p>Steve huffman admitted to having his own bias cause him to edit and block posts etc if hes afraid to have a pizzagate sub reddit exist he is being controlled or he is not on the side of virtue because his bias is impeding something people want to know about. His bias will stop that from being allowed but allow pedofile sub reddits porn sub reddits and racist sub reddits?</p>

<p>It became clear to me that reddit will block things that voat will not and thats when I made the jump. The only reason more attacks are not launched against voat is because while its the more liberated and free speech and news friendly site it doesn&#39;t pull anywhere near the amount of traffic reddit does. Its because of that that the powers that be dont target it as much.</p>

<p>Now reddit because it has so much traffic the powers that be had the pizza gate sub reddit destroyed when it was getting a little to hot and catching the attention of even the most clueless Americans.</p>

<p>Downvotes have more power to control the flow of information and what will be seen on reddit than voat.</p>

<p>These types of shills are one the things I despise most of all. I value information and clarity of information.

<p>Certainly there are people paid to promote products or ideas. However I know for a fact I am not one of those people, and I know for a fact I have been called a &quot;shill&quot; more times than I care to count on various sites. So I can only assume that those who are concerned with shills see them everywhere there is someone disagreeing with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that your assumption is a bad one. And its why I have a policy of never directly calling someone a shill. No matter how much someone may sound or act like a shill, you can never be sure.</p>

<p>A big part of political shilling is convincing genuine users to do the shilling for you. For example, of course not everyone who posts in r/politics is a shill. But the organizers are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And there it is. The reason that this obsession with shills is an issue. You just referred to people who disagree with you, perhaps even wrongly, as shills, without an ounce of evidence that they are being paid to post that comment. You aren&#39;t a shill because you disagree, you aren&#39;t a shill by being wrong, and you aren&#39;t a shill by being an asshole. A shill is someone hired to influence conversation for money.</p>

<p>By accusing anyone who disagrees of being a shill, you are part of the problem. You are creating an environment where people brush off actual manipulation, because saying &quot;shill&quot; is just a way to shutdown a conversation (much like how &quot;fake news&quot; now just means &quot;news I disagree with&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post!</p>

<p>Some advice I would give is change your preferences so comments that have downvotes under a certain threshold aren&#39;t hidden anymore. Also, never let the number of downvotes sway your opinion. Read all the comments, and if you agree with the comment, upvote it, even if it&#39;s at a -20. If all the real users remembered to do that, we could fight back against their downvote brigades, and their attempts to hide comments that go against their narratives. </p>

<p>If you feel you are dealing with someone who might be here with dishonest motives, demand sources for their claims, and provide your own when responding if possible. Don&#39;t bother calling them out, it&#39;s pointless. Try to beat them with facts if you&#39;re debating them, and then move on. Don&#39;t give them more of a platform to spread their disinformation by continuing to respond. </p>

<p>I guess those are a few little things we can do. For those who are new here, the difference from before this last election season started and after is like night and day as just one example. And for those who think a conspiracy sub wouldn&#39;t be a big target, think again. The minds and opinions of those who refuse to accept the mainstream narrative about everything are the ones they want influence over the most. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not true. It&#39;s actually a field of research in sociology, now. And even if it were true, failure to replicate is not the same as confirming the original research was a &quot;hoax&quot; (intentional lie) as you claimed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t dispute for a second that there are people paid to post on the internet in general or reddit in particular. I was asking why you personally drew so much attention? </p>

<p>Allow me to say explicitly that I think statements like this:</p>

<p>Point towards you being paranoid. How would you know that you had ever seen one of these shills or trolls? Seeing as you think a post about traffic from one single AFB somehow means you personally are engaging in anti shill warfare I think it is far more likely you are imagining things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rules to live by if you want to make the internet a better place for discussion:</p>

<p>1)  Don&#39;t go into discussion trying to &quot;win&quot;. Go into discussions trying to make yourself clear. When it becomes obvious there is no ground to gain, stop. Don&#39;t announce you are finished, don&#39;t declare your detractor wrong-headed or disingenuous. This will be evident to those that read the exchange.</p>

<p>2) Stop accusing people of shilling, in general or toward a specific user. Accusations of shilling drive your own side to you and everyone on the other side away. This is what shilling accomplishes -- polarization. We know shills exist, but it does no good to hunt them. The anonymity and enormity of the internet makes any perceived victory fleeting.</p>

<p>3) Present your arguments dispassionately. Remove emotionally charged language and do not respond to emotionally charged language from others.</p>

<p>4) Similarly, use your vote to reward well formed arguments and punish attacks or overly emotional appeals. It is ESPECIALLY important to downvote and counter bad arguments whose conclusions you agree with, and to upvote well thought out and logical arguments you do not agree with. Promote quality through voting, regardless of agreement. Make your disagreement known in your own post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should understand the toolsets that shills have at their disposal.  Here is a quick highlight:</p>

<p>1) Basic pawn shills use RES (at a minimum), these are the work from home &quot;Social Media Influencers&quot; and startup types.  They still have many accounts but manage them somewhat manually.</p>

<p>2) Funded Shill Networks have access to sophisticated software that alerts them when certain keywords have been posted (anywhere on reddit).  Mention a brand name to find these.  You can find these services online but I will not post them.  These shills are run by PR networks, which provide cover for the brands they manage. They also have mastered software to allow persona management.  1 person for every ~1000 accounts.  Most responses can be somewhat automated like customer support, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PersonX: Something Against Company X</p>

<p>Shill 1: [insert word ] blah blah blah canned response, [insert word]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) Botnet Shills are even more sophisticated and are likely military grade or at least somewhere at that level.  These may be AI controlled and carry out an &#39;agenda&#39; on the front page.  Some agendas include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Police are very nice people, warmed my heart.  Ignore the militarization.</li>
<li>Anyone that is %hite is the devil</li>
<li>Military in good and necessary, lots of evil people out there</li>
<li>Rare puppers, look at this puppy while daddy comes home from service</li>
<li>Feminism, globalism, etc</li>
<li>Populace Polzarization.  There are no grey lines, you are either ANTI-[something] or PRO-(something).  Anti-vax for example.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this level, there are no browsers involved.  Headless cloud services interact with the (admin sanctioned) API to create the illusion of harmony and agreement among the &#39;group&#39;.   </p>

<p>4) The misdirection shills are there to be obvious and draw attention away from the real ones.  These are the long standing accounts that are obviously nothing but a shill.  They somehow stay around to draw attention.  The fake war between Hillary &amp; T_D is a fake war.  The political sphere is just an act and this fake war is part of it.</p>

<p>it&#39;s super common and very easy to implement. just think of all the bots replying to key phrases like the <code>!RemindMe [time]</code>-bot. and those are only the bots plainly visible, because they reply.</p>

<p>it gets really creepy if advanced NLP (natural language processing) is at play. you perfectly masked your trail and your different personas never post with the same hardware and/or IP? well, guess what? you still left a massive trail of language, which is unique to your very tongue. NLP gonna analyze the massive chunks of data and find your very own speaking pattern and compare it to other tokens. frighteningly accurate at that - i have heard.</p>

<p>there are actually already open sourced tools out there, which try to mask your speaking patterns into a generic one. (replacing words, phrasing, formatting style [...])</p>

<p>This is why you jumble words so you don&#39;t activate the hive so quickly.  I have seen the software and a PR agency will monitor ALL media platforms and dispatch an army to dispute any bad press.  Most people don&#39;t even realize their Tweets are geo-stamped and anyone can see where exactly they tweeted from.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-search">https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-search</a></p>

<p>Yes, an actual map with tweets can be displayed, searched, etc.  This is just scratching the surface really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know they exist I encountered a lot of them when I went to a very big forum discussing the murder of alternative health drs. Highly educated drs with masters degrees and PHDS agreed that the drs were murdered and did not commit suicide. Basic discussion took place and countless fake accounts with relativley new creation dates and no way to legitamize who they really were attacked everyone who questioned the suicides.</p>

<p>I checked all the profiles the ones with lengthy family history photos etc on their accounts that could be confirmed to be real people were asking questions. ALL the of the accounts call people stupid tin foil losers etc were newly manufactured fake accounts and there were far to many to be from one person.</p>

<p>People will admit these paid internet trolls exist but then question gang stalking. When really all it is is real life trolling taken to an extreme to try and cause self induced suicide from endless targeted harassment.</p>

<p>Its very real and one day it wont be a secret everyone will know the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its okay my posts are here and just like the citizens commission proved the existence of the cointelpro operation in 1971 some group or some hacker or a whistle blower somebody will come forward with irrefutable proof that our government is employing domestic terrorism against certain people in this country.</p>

<p>They will tamper with mail have people shoulder bump with you hack your phones blacklist and financially block you from any and all opportunity sabotage vehicles etc. They will do it continuously and pay willing third parties and vigilantes to comply with these tactics until the target decides to give up and kill themselves.</p>

<p>They make sure that everything that is done to the target is done in a plausibly deniable manner. The fact that such a large number of people participate lets me know the same number of people would help stage a propagandized shooting. It may be 10 or 20 years from now who knows when but someday somebody who is smarter and in possession of more resources than I will validate everything that I am saying because I promise it is true.</p>

<p>That is why I understand that our government is a terrorist one. There is nobody else in the world with the resources to do something like that aside from government.</p>

<p>Last time something like this was done was by the stasi in east germany. We joke about hilary conjuring hell demons etc and stuff but people really need to be aware of whats going on.</p>

<p>A government that would target and try and push select u.s citizens to suicide would stage a war for profit in exchange for millions of innocent yet ignorant peoples lives.</p>

<p>I know its true because I first experienced it prior to researching it. When the research which came after the experiences aligned it proved it to me. Now as far as microwave beams and some of that other crazy sounding stuff i dont believe that. But the other stuff about gang stalking checked out for me. </p>

<p>It literally is a silent holocaust and if I believe they were not corrupt I would attempt reaching out to the united nations again. I am not a master computer hacker or a former government employee etc but I am a practitioner of common sense and I am aware of my surroundings.</p>

<p>All I can do is pray that somebody who can prove it and has the resources to do so come forward. Their is no telling how many have died behind this. People are saying we are headed t tyranny its already here covertly. The only difference is it will not remain covert in the future if we do nothing.</p>

<p>Your now more likely to be killed by police than a terrorist. That wasn&#39;t always the case in this country. However it is now. We have the largest prison population in the world but talk about being the freest that everyone is jealous of.</p>

<p>If they manufacture propaganda to manipulate social conscious to try and comply with whatever laws are needed to move forward with their end game why would doing anything else surprise anybody?</p>

<p>We will suffer from our ignorance and negligence to do anything about this many will die be killed and be hurt and some children will learn about it in class 50 to 100 years from now.</p>

<p>The people who are acting as the foot soldiers being shills or gang stalkers are convinced they are special and  that something nefarious is not in store for them as well. What they fail to realize is they are the very first in line to be disposed of when the time comes thats the one part that gives me the most satisfaction is knowing they dont even have a clue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! That was a really great summary of how bad things are-Sad but true. It’s nice to know others see what is going on in our country and world really. Although I think more people are starting to wake up slowly there still aren’t many of us. Sometimes it really sucks being the only one who can see the obvious lies and corruption and pure evil. It’s literally insane so insane I start to think I’m crazy! So thank you this post reminded me I/we are not crazy we’re just awake. One day I woke up in the freakin matrix and they are trying to reduce the population and kill and divide us 100 different ways. It’s depressing really but all we can do is pray. Do our best to inform those that seem interested...but I stopped making it my job to warn people of doom. Most are perfectly content taking their blue pill or they say “oh well you shouldn’t let it run your life because what can you do?” I know what I do and as mentioned above the collective consciousness  is a very powerful tool in spreading positivity and social change. 
The only insight I would add to your post... avoid the U.N. That would be the last place I would turn for any help. They are a central player in the corruption. Look no further than agenda 21. </p>

It&#39;s sort of like a good cop bad cop routine.  A commenter will introduce an anecdote about why the company or person is so terrible and everyone should hate them.  Then another commenter will point out how that is actually false or not the whole story, and will you look at this crazy conspiracy theorist who hates something without even having done the research to know they were misinformed!  The casual reddit browser maybe begins to think their hatred of the company or person was irrational.  You can set up and knock down a few easy ones this way, which keeps the actual bad shit more hidden away in the comments and out of view, while providing positive information about the company or person, and establishing yourself as an authority on the subject while making your opponents seem quite the opposite.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Clearly there are operations that spread disinformation, flat earth being a perfect example. And there are a few skilled online operatives that can actually string together an argument with some support, usually through limited hangout and misdirection (&quot;Kennedy was killed by the Mafia&quot; types).</p>

<p>But those operations require far more sophisticated (expensive) workers than the unsophisticated shouting down of fact-focused discussion in an attempt to weary the truth seekers. The intentions of the former are quite difficult to discern (useful idiot vs. knowing liar), the latter is immediately transparent to anyone who has been on the site long enough to be considered for moderator status.</p>

<p>A broad application of the rule against trolling (you may not simply shout down a post, you must explain why you disagree and use facts) shuts down perhaps 95% of the shills by screening out the incompetents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason this is getting downvoted is probably shills. Your article is its own example. This is a great post, lots of sources and research, topical, and prime <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> material. But shills are desperate to maintain their credibility. The more people are aware of their existence, the less effective they get.</p>

<p>This perfectly reasonable post has been posted to <a href="/r/TopMindsofReddit">/r/TopMindsofReddit</a>, interestingly.</p>

<p>Edit: look how positive the comments are, then try to reconcile this with the fact this post has only 60% upvotes.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Can I also just encourage people to upvote? Shills are paid to do it, so they have a disproportionately large influence. Counteract this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another good post. I&#39;d like to add this article where it points out the influx of David Brock&#39;s troll farm, Correct the Record, on reddit and when they targeted Bernie supporters. </p>

<p>From April 2016,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This explains why my inbox turned to cancer on Tuesday,” wrote user OKarizee. “Been a member of reddit for almost 4 years and never experienced anything like it. In fact, in all my years on the internet I’ve never experienced anything like it.”</p>

<p>Correct the Record, which has received $5 million this campaign season and has spent almost $4.5 million of it, according to OpenSecrets.org, outlined its strategy against “swarms of anonymous attackers” in a press release.</p>

<p>Watson previously worked at Brock’s Media Matters for America, where “their whole mission is to debunk conservative misinformation [and] a lot of that ends up being defending Hillary Clinton,” but says she’s never seen anything like this initiative.</p>

<p>“Usually places like MMFA and CTR are defending her against the media and established figures. This seems to be going after essentially random individuals online,” she said. “I don’t know that they’ve done anything like this before.”</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! I have wondered lately if nearly all comments claiming shills don&#39;t exist come from shills and bots. Can any regular user really be so blind as to not see them for what they are? With a sub of over 550,000 subscribers, how many of them are even genuine users? Its a scary thought.</p>

<p>Matthew 19</p>

<p>16Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?”</p>

<p>17“Why do you ask me about what is good?” Jesus replied. “There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”</p>

<p>18“Which ones?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Jesus replied, “ ‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, <strong>you shall not give false testimony</strong>, 19honor your father and mother, and ‘love your neighbor as yourself. ”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real question is how common are they. Most users are not shills. There&#39;s just a lot of opinions on this site. But shills certainly exist. Shills do their thing hopefully long enough until the hivemind starts doing their job for them. </p>

<p>The voting system of the site makes it so easy to game, even playing fair. Adding in extra votes and supporting comments, with a little bit of title talent is a guaranteed front page post. Which leads to the reddit hivemind agreeing with the most popular opinion, even if they believed the opposite just a few months and years ago, like what happened with Wikileaks. It&#39;s so easy to manipulate millions of reddit users. There&#39;s a lot of money to be made. If done right, shills can be very powerful. It&#39;s scary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Church Senate Select Commitee Hearings (on gov intelligence agency shenanigans) from the 1970s is good place to start and then if you can stomach it, imagine how it&#39;s been studied, adjusted and methodically deployed in the years following. </p>

<p>Consider Senator Church&#39;s public statement after the senate hearings and final report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the need to develop a capacity to know what potential enemies are doing, the United States government has perfected a technological capability that enables us to monitor the messages that go through the air. (...) Now, that is necessary and important to the United States as we look abroad at enemies or potential enemies. We must know, at the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left: such is the capability to monitor everything—telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn&#39;t matter. There would be no place to hide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology. (...)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.&quot;  ~Meet The Press appearance 1975</p>

<p>damn... Church alluded to gov ability to completely capture and control all signals using 1970ish and before tech. Then they went and, ya know, kinda invented the intrawebz. To think they don&#39;t wholly own and manipulate their greatest asset/tool is dangerously naive. </p>

<p>What I was trying to get at - is the presence of shills has nothing to do with one&#39;s own interpretation of the importance of their comments. </p>

<p>The government has their strategy &amp; agenda for propaganda which has existed formally for nearly 100 years and involves conspiracies that are both real and manufactured. Establishing a venue where the public could freely have discussions to check government power was was of Aaron Schwartz&#39;s motivations for creating Reddit in the first place. Shilling is a means of de-railing such online conversations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes the information is sensational. This &#39;conservative&#39; bias culture is tantamount to adhering to the fear of ridicule.</p>

<p>Is this why these sources are no good? Maybe the writing isn&#39;t the best either, it isn&#39;t, sometimes I wonder if English is their first language at times, but if the information is overlapping from website to website then that should mean something.</p>

<p>Read all of it and figure out the common points, sift through the opinion or spin bullshit. Aren&#39;t you smart enough for that?</p>

<p>Btw, it&#39;s not up to the OP, me or anybody here to educate you. That&#39;s your job. The only reasonable course of action isn&#39;t to ridicule the sources, but thank the OP for providing them and reading through all of it before dismissing anything.</p>

<p>Anything short of that is tantamount to stupidity.</p>

<p>One last thing. If all those sources aren&#39;t good enough then which website would you recommend as a good source? Are there any?</p>

<p>Neonnettle, for example, isn&#39;t exactly a beacon of clever writing. It&#39;s rough, makes me wonder where English fits on their language list, at least a second language.</p>

<p>I was acknowledging that reading some of these independent sources can be a bit rough. But that does not and should not undermine the content of the story, of which generally are collaborated across several different sites, up to and including the bought and paid for ones. NN and other may also be fake, it&#39;s possible - if they are I would be glad to absorb other, better qualified independent sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best sources are hard documents, firsthand information, and records, and you don’t see these in modern media. That’s why you should find information from multiple sources, instead of one source on each issue. News outlets will present information in a way that furthers their agenda (attracting customers, misinformation, etc), but like you said there will be constants in every article. The problem I have is that there’s a single source provided here for every one of her points, and half of these are from sensationalist outlets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand that. And I understand your point of view. These are conventional, traditional world views being applied to an untraditional time. There is truth written in the articles and unfortunately nobody is trustworthy enough, apparently, to really, completely believe. So we have to act like detectives.</p>

<p>There are multiple sources here. And best of luck finding a site that actually offers hard documentation, I can actually provide one and -still- people won&#39;t believe it, trust me I&#39;ve tried.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a problem about media, good or bad information or bad reporting/writing. This is a problem the western people have in trust. And the very sad historical truth that a people who have been lied to long enough will simply not accept any evidence of the lie. The media and the collective governments have lied so many times about so many things through these decades - all while going unpunished, it had clearly left an impression of helplessness and overall denial. And still, I don&#39;t know anybody able to take a step backward and see this.</p>

<p>Not every media outlet is full of shit... some clearly get over excited, but this is what we get when all the good writers end up with the latimes or Washington post, who are all bought and paid for. Ironically these two outlets are among the sources provided!</p>

<p>It&#39;s like we&#39;re in the middle of a science fiction movie isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Either way way, what the fuck am I shilling for in my conversations with you? I 1000% agree that there’s are shills on reddit. That’s undeniable. Hell, take your new sub for example. Your friend there had 40+ accounts used to manipulate vote counts, fake doxxx people, and shit like that (which makes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7o4euw/yes_paid_shills_exist_and_here_is_what_you_can_do/ds6rjia/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">this</a> comment by you even more funny). You are not living in reality sweetie.</p>

<p>I started defending on TMOR.  Then he PM&#39;ed me as he thought I was being suckered by TMOR when I was really trying to get information.  He then revealed he thought TMOR planted it.  I am pretty familiar with TMOR from modding r/conspiracyundone.  I wouldn&#39;t put it past them to do something like that.  I trust him over TMOR.</p>

<p>Not sure.  Haven&#39;t asked him why if he even knows.  Also, apparently, only some of the accounts on the alleged admin report list were banned, which makes me wonder how the admins decided which ones to ban.</p>

<p>Nothing. Which is my point. Neither of you (that I have seen) has been willing to apologize/own up to your fellow mod staging that fake doxxxing shit. I&#39;ve said it a bunch already. All you would&#39;ve had to do after it happened was say something like &quot;Shit, our bad, we shouldn&#39;t have trusted that guy. What he did was shitty. Although we are against tmor, we aren&#39;t against it in a way that would promote doxxxing/swatting.&quot; Simple as that. But you guys just keep doubling down/defending it. </p>

<p>It is pretty obvious now that you know, no?  :P  Glad I could help, unless you are just saying that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if it does have a gay connotation, women can be gay. So, yeah.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also in urban dictionary:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>a negative term to describe a friend&#39;s friend who does him in the butt.</p></li>
<li><p>A slang usage to define two gay guys having anal sex with each other. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Pretty obvious why it refers to gay men.</p>

<p>Assuming you aren&#39;t lying, I will give you a pass on the butt buddy comment.</p>
