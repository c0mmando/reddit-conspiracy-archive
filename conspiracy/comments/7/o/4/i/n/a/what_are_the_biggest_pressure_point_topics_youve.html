    <div class="md"><p>That would be pretty funny if a russian sponsored media outlet had a better track record of verifiable honesty than all of western journalism. </p>

<p>I have a few questions for you though. </p>

<p>If you found easily verifiable evidence that Russia had backed WL, would it change the authenticity of the leaked documents? </p>

<p>If you found that (let&#39;s just say) Brazilian media was telling a completely different story than US MSM and kept the details honest and void of opinion despite only reporting on TOPICS that advance the Brazilian govts agendas, which media group would you believe when they are at complete odds?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, as someone who believes WikiLeaks has been a Russian mouth piece for some time, I can tell you what problem I have with them. Some of their earlier work was amazing. And it really was built on a wonderful idea, and I think that&#39;s why I got so vehemently angry later. The moment I understood in my own mind, was during an interview Julian assange gave about all the leaks on the DNC. The reporter asked why they had not released anything on Donald Trump. And Julian responded &quot;nothing we know is worse than what you already have heard&quot; and ya know what, maybe he wasn&#39;t lying. But the power of WikiLeaks is not in whether they have modified things, it&#39;s what they don&#39;t release to form their narrative. Look, I&#39;m not so naive to think that every politician doesn&#39;t have dirt, or that only one side has scummy people. But it felt so obvious between the DNC email leaks, and his response to the Panama papers, that he had been controlling what WikiLeaks released to help Trump. WikiLeaks and assange no longer seemed like truth seeking champions of good, but just another group of people using what power they had to influence others world view in a certain way. The power of WikiLeaks doesn&#39;t come from falsifying, it comes from what they choose to release and not release</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll discuss FE with you as long as you&#39;re able to formulate a reasonable argument that makes sense and isn&#39;t discredited by the same exact evidence you use to make your arguments. I don&#39;t believe in FE but I try to take an arguments positions seriously and as an opportunity to learn. The problems I always come across in a FE debate is a lack of understanding, reason, and logic on the part of the FE&#39;er. It seems to me that you need a degree of faith in order to believe in a FE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the other way around really.  I used to be an agnostic that was borderline nihilistic.  After the FE theory I decided to try to debunk it myself.  I went out did my own distance and curvature tests and found the globe model was at least wrong about he earth&#39;s size.  Then turned to observing the moon, sun, stars and found they were much closer than we are told.  You can take a magnifying glass and focus moonlight and cool things the exact opposite of the sun.  The moon has it&#39;s own cooling light.  That alone breaks every bit of the globe model.  High altitude non fish eye lens weather balloon footage compared to what it should look like simulated using software sealed it for me.</p>

<p>Once you realize these things and then see that every space agency on the plane is lying it leaves no more room for agnostic belief.  There is a God.  It&#39;s just a matter of figuring out who he is and what he wants.  That is also the reason for the lie, to hide his existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to try this checking the moonlight temp thing. The sun and the moon seem to be at the center of what many of the problems for both models revolve around (pun intended). </p>

<p>I&#39;m still leaning flat earth/flat plane of existence, its just both sides have points the other can&#39;t answer or explain away. At first it wrecked my world, and I lost literal sleep over it. Now its more peace of mind about there being a creator keeping us in this this Goldilocks zone, in whatever make or model we actually live in.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen so many debunks, and counter debunks I don&#39;t know what to believe at this point. Sorry for the random ramble, I&#39;ve just been been falling back to the idea that the sun and moon possibly aren&#39;t real, literal, tangible entities... but for there to be a heating/cooling phenomenon, they would probably have to be. </p>

<p>This was the conspiracy that brought me to this sub. Pretty much everything else is just more compounding evidence for things I&#39;ve already believed in for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, get yourself a King James Bible and just start reading it.  Our creator gave us his word so we could understand what&#39;s happening here.  Finding this truth out is the best news you have ever had.  God is real and he wants you to know him!  He also came to Earth as Jesus Christ and shed his blood to atone for our sins.  All that you need to do to understand his word (you must be born again in spirit) is know you are a sinner (we all are) and the wages of sin is death and eternal separation from God in a lake of fire.  There is nothing we can do ourselves to get out of this.  The only way out is believing the gospel of Jesus Christ which is that he died, was buried, and resurrected 3 days later for our sins.  He was the final blood sacrifice for sin that washes them away forever.  Our work doesn&#39;t save us because Jesus Christ did all the work for us on the cross.  Repent and believe this and you will be grafted into God&#39;s family and partake in the eternal promises he gives to his children in the Bible.</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FTR I started out as religious as child/early teen, then lost it. Then believe it or not I became a Satanist, who debated against the Bible for fun, and made a hobby of, &quot;debunking&quot; it. </p>

<p>I started smoking pot, which helped me get out of Satanism, b/c its hard to be stoned, and not see beauty in the world, and wonder how things were created. Plus I found it fascinating that we can have receptor sites in our brains, that plants can make compounds for, that bind to them with &quot;lock and key&quot; precision on a molecular level. Things like that make it hard for me to believe in coincidences. I know, it can be explained with that evolution that has more holes in it than Swiss cheese.</p>

<p>As for Biblical scripture that is relevant to this topic for me, Timothy 4:1 really stands out. &quot; The Spirit clearly says that in later times, some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. &quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re familiar with all if the 666&#39;s/marks of the beast in the math of Scientism as well:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m aware of Satan&#39;s signature on everything right in our faces now.  I was an agnostic nihilist for most of my life.  Found Flat Earth/Fake Space then Jesus Christ saved me soon after I started actually praying to God &quot;for real&quot; for the first time in my life.  He&#39;s done so much in my life since then that I would have said was impossible before.</p>

<p>I was a huge pot smoker, even after I got saved.  I was searching the King James Bible trying to justify using it and could find verses that seemed to support it and other that didn&#39;t.  Finally I gave up and simply prayed to God and asked to be shown an answer.  That night I &quot;randomly&quot; came across this page.  I wasn&#39;t even searching for it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1050.html">http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1050.html</a></p>

<p>It talks about the principalities and powers from witchcraft&#39;s perspective.  The thing that got me was the power named &quot;Jah&quot; (under the principality Rege) and his tie to Marley and all that music I used to love so much.  He&#39;s the false God of marijuana.  Every one of these mind altering drugs have devils assigned to them.  That&#39;s why when I did shrooms in college I thought I was inside some kind of vast machine.  Then my buddy and I walked into our frat house room and Pink Flyoyd&#39;s &quot;Welcome to the machine&quot; started playing.  It blew our minds.  A few years later I saw the movie &quot;the Matrix&quot; and now today simulation theory is being pushed by Elon Musk.  This all ties together in the spiritual realm and is part of Lucifer&#39;s grand deception.</p>

<p>All medicine derives from natural origins, and to my knowledge, biblically speaking, Satan never actually created anything. Therefore God made everything, and Satan only corrupted it to other ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to offend or ruffle any feathers of you or anyone, but to my knowledge, mortals aren&#39;t promised to go to the higher heaven when they die in literal scripture. </p>

<p>We are only promised a heaven on Earth, <em>after</em> Jesus comes back to make it so.</p>

<p>That being said, at the moment, I&#39;m more inclined to believe what is written in things like the Nag Hammadi library, which just so happens to fit in as the missing books that the Bible predicted would be edited out by the devil, <em>cough cough evil Catholic Church</em> which states that the Christ is the spirit, not a man. </p>

<p>Jesus said, (paraphrasing, don&#39;t remember actual verse) &quot;I am merely the cup that the wine (word of God) was poured into. We are here to talk about the wine, not the cups we drink it from.&quot;</p>

<p>So in a manner of speaking, I do consider myself saved by God, I just don&#39;t adhere to the idol worship of a man, or believe that,&quot; I am the only way, no one gets to the father but by me&quot; verse. </p>

<p>A lot of editing and rewriting could have been done in the 1,000 years roughly, that the devil church had free reign over the holy book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paul went to the 3rd heaven:</p>

<p>2Co 12:2  I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. </p>

<p>All the old testament saints that were in paradise under the earth also were brought up to the 3rd heaven after Jesus went down there and preached the gospel to them for three days.  That&#39;s when he led captivity captive.</p>

<p>Paradise under the earth parallel to hell:</p>

<p>Luk 16:23  And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. </p>

<p>Jesus going down and preaching before bringing them up to the 3rd heaven:</p>

<p>Mat 12:40  For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale&#39;s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. </p>

<p>1Pe 3:18  For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: 
1Pe 3:19  By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; </p>

<p>Eph 4:8  Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. 
Eph 4:9  (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? 
Eph 4:10  He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) </p>

<p>As far as figuring out what book is correct I can only suggest praying to God and asking him to show you.  It worked for me.  The world is full of deception and unless you can hold a book in your hand and know it&#39;s the word of God you can never find truth.</p>

<p>When the flesh dies the body sleeps but a  soul that is redeemed by the imputed rigorousness of Jesus Christ goes to the 3rd heaven.  The 1000 year reign on Earth will happen after Jacob&#39;s trouble (the Jesuits re-branded this &quot;the tribulation&quot;).  There will be the reign on Earth as well.  Either way the soul goes to the 3rd heaven after death or at the catching away (rapture).  After the 1000 year reign we are promised a new heaven and a new Earth and the Kingdom will never stop expanding.  I think this is the real big bang.  Satan has the world distracted with fake space and the allure of space travel when that will likely be the situation after this world comes to an end and the saved will be able to explore this endlessly growing kingdom in their glorified bodies that have all the abilities of Christ&#39;s resurrected body.  You don&#39;t want to miss out on this!  Repenting and believing in Jesus Christ&#39;s Gospel is the only door out of here:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>He died for you personally.  That&#39;s it.  Nothing else to do but repent and believe in your heart.  Then you will be send the Spirit of Truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of &quot;time zones&quot; are really just man made ideas.  The sun does move around the plane and lights up different spots at different times.  I don&#39;t know the purpose of that vs having everything being lit at once and dark at once if that&#39;s what you are saying?  Only God knows.  The sun and moon act like hands in the gigantic clock we are living in:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that time zones are man-made. They were created in response to the sun moving across the plane. The moon then follows the sun across the plane.</p>

<p>To return to starting position the following day, does the sun move beneath our flat plane? It seems to travel consistently &quot;westward&quot;.</p>

<p>What is the cause of an eclipse, solar or lunar? Is it the sun/moonlight being extinguished momentarily, then slowly rebooting?</p>

<p>Do the sun and moon move closer and further from our plane? Do they/we rotate on any axes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know many answers and I don&#39;t think anyone does!  Human&#39;s pride thinking they can know how everything works seems to be how we got to where we are today.</p>

<p>Job 38 &amp; 39 (KJV) come to mind when thinking about these kinds of questions.</p>

<p>One thing that is interesting is that it does seem like the sun goes in and comes out of portals of some sort.  It could be like a PacMan effect where it goes out one side then comes back on the other.</p>

<p>Ecc 1:5  The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. </p>

<p>That verse to me certainly seems to support a PacMan style sun that goes west the pops back east.  Perhaps it quickly goes under the plane as you suggest.  It also means that pretty much every map and model being kicked around the flat earth community is wrong.  No surprise as it&#39;s led by shills that are probably just replacing one deception with another.</p>

<p>Eclipses seem to be the sun or moon restricting it&#39;s own light.  Analysis of the latest solar eclipse showed that nothing was blocking the light physically.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1zDQRSKnYo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1zDQRSKnYo</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s very interesting stuff and I no longer concern myself with knowing exactly how everything works.  My best guess related to how the sun works is Ezekial&#39;s wheels.  I think the sun/moon/firmament is somehow attached to giant gimbals (attached to the Cherbs) that Ezekial saw which are within the firmament that is acting like a lens:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIqsYvLo6Ts">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIqsYvLo6Ts</a></p>

<p>Just knowing Jesus Christ died for my sins, gave me his righteousness, saved me, and that I am grafted into his family is so amazing that it dwarfs everything else.  There is so much awesome stuff to discover in the KJV Bible!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there&#39;s no use in having a discussion if you already know everything. I picked the cooling moonlight argument because it&#39;s the easiest and cheapest to debunk on your own. I wouldn&#39;t have a hard time coming to terms with a FE model if there were anything to it. If you aren&#39;t adding controls to your data sets, then of course your going to make incorrect assumptions about how things function. The example you&#39;ve given of how you tested the cooling property of moonlight is similar to me taking a temp reading of a swimming pool and the air after nightfall and just because the air is cooler than the pool at that instant, concluding that water independently generates heat. It&#39;s an assumption based off limited data with no controls and it&#39;s incorrect. A discussion should be give and take though so if you want to discuss flat earth, you should expect more out of yourself in the discussion as far as willingness to see the other side and willingness to be wrong. If you already &quot;know for a fact&quot; then you aren&#39;t trying to have a discussion, you&#39;re attempting to lecture and preach. Therefore you shouldn&#39;t be shocked when you get downvoted to all hell for preaching and lecturing people on things that you aren&#39;t even invested enough in to explore for yourself. That&#39;s what I mean about faith. You&#39;re using circular logic and confirmation bias to convince yourself that you are done learning when you haven&#39;t even begun and I mean that as a wakeup call and not at all as an insult. Many never even take the first steps of questioning which you have... it&#39;s a shame that you stopped at the one conclusion but if it makes you happy, I can&#39;t dispute that reality.</p>

You can then focus the moonlight with a magnifying glass and cool it further.  I&#39;m not sure what else you think you need to control for there.  I don&#39;t care about down-votes.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think many people here care about downvotes. I hardly ever apply votes at all. The control for your experiment is lacking due to amount of variables and lack of comparable data to what you&#39;re basing your assumptions on. With a telescope you can really focus the light source and get more direct readings and so less controls and data sets are needed due to the lesser number of variables involved. For example, the type of tree you used to shade one thermometer may be a flowering tree that produces more heat than another type. A base reading of dark night sky and ambient light is a better control in that regard and I&#39;d still want multiple data sets to compare. </p>

<p>As far as the saving of people, what if you&#39;re wrong or picked the wrong god to worship? Nothing in a FE model suggests that christianity got anything right. It&#39;s the other way around actually. You&#39;ve decided that FE is fact and therefore points to some intelligent design but the creator you pick based off of that alone is entirely subjective. The only true knowledge that one can gain is the knowledge of how little they know. It&#39;s the only truth that&#39;s guaranteed to you in this life and most are unable to accept it&#39;s reality. It&#39;s not really shocking to me that FE&#39;ers feel like they can&#39;t &quot;discuss&quot; FE with others when what they really mean is that nobody wants to hear them preach and lecture. That&#39;s not discussion.  The moment someone &quot;knows&quot; something &quot;for a fact&quot; they&#39;ve crippled their own ability to learn any more on the subject. That&#39;s the reality of science and the world we live in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey good luck finding the truth in this world.  Be as rigorous as you want.  When I have two thermometers 6 inches apart and I can control the temperate down of one of them by focusing moonlight on it that is clear enough for me.   I have no need to account for flowering trees or for using a telescope.  Some things are just plainly obvious.  The moon gives off it&#39;s own cooling light.  This experiment has also been repeated by many individuals.  You can do it yourself with whatever rigor you like to convince yourself or don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t accounting for SO many variables. The heat produced by X. The cooling effects of Y. The way that ambient temperature can widely vary and shift by degrees over inches. So many factors go in to temperature that it&#39;s absurd to believe in any conclusion based on the single set of data. It is similarly plainly obvious that the water in my hypothetical emulation of an experiment is producing heat. </p>

<p>Ever been in a body of water that has cold and warm patches that move around due to the motion of the water? Air temps work in a similar way. There are some basic understandings that you might want to come to grips with before you allow anything to become &quot;plainly obvious&quot; on the subject. Again, you are applying faith in place of logic and understanding. That same faith is based on vanity. The vanity that you can or have attained knowledge of a thing with so little input.

    <div class="md"><p>I used Google earth to measure the distance out to points of a nearby lake set my tripod a couple feet above the water level and observe what I could see.  I also watched boats go off into the distance &quot;over the horizon&quot; and pulled them back in with my Nikon P900 and used Google earth to measure how far out they had been.  I basically did them because I didn&#39;t believe the YouTube videos that I was watching.  Once I saw that I got the same result as all the videos I had been watching it gave them credibility.  I was going to to another test with a friend where we put flags at various heights on a boat and then drove the boat out &quot;over the horizon&quot; so I could count the flags but by that point I already had looked into NASA and saw all the deception going on there.  It&#39;s not one thing that gets you, it&#39;s the entire package.</p>

<p>These are the types of tests I was trying to validate:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are some pretty interesting videos. Do you have anything to say about atmospheric refraction and how it affects the results of these sorts of experiments? Given what I&#39;ve read about atmospheric refraction, it seems like if you want to make a conclusion about the curvature of the earth by taking measurements over a body of water, you need to make sure to take the amount of atmospheric refraction into account.</p>

<p>I skimmed through this video that I saw that you posted, and it looks like a good demonstration of why you can&#39;t really conclude that the earth is a globe based on the fact that bodies of water seem to obscure objects on the other side: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tflhWwoqWAw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tflhWwoqWAw</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Refraction is real but it just doesn&#39;t work the way they say it does.  It can&#39;t bend an entire skyline and the same guy that made that little demo proved this by taking a boat across lake Michigan and recording the Chicago skyline that he shouldn&#39;t have been able to see the entire way.</p>

<p>This is another very good video on understanding perspective which is what happens over large bodies of water.  If you imagine yourself looking down a very long hallway, the walls, the roof, and the floor end up converging into a single point at your eye level.  This means the bottom comes up to your eye level even though you know it&#39;s just flat going away from you.  The water does that as well and obscures things at a distance from the bottom up.  The cumulative waves between the camera and the distant object also cause obstruction from the bottom up but this is not the curve:</p>

<p>The entire horizon proving the curve of the earth is nothing but a David Copperfield style illusion they have cast on the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Y&#39;know, I&#39;ve got something to say.</p>

<p>If the earth really is flat, and there really is a conspiracy to convince everyone that it&#39;s a globe, then one of the smartest things the conspiracy ever did is to create (or encourage the creation and sharing of) lots of bogus arguments in favor of a flat earth.</p>

<p>People like me watch one or two YouTube videos arguing for a flat earth. We see that those particular arguments are bogus. And we conclude that the whole thing is probably bogus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep that&#39;s exactly what they do.  They always, always lead the opposition.  They knew people would be talking about flat earth so they set up the Flat Earth Society and things like that to put out the worst arguments possible.  Then they even get guys like Barack Obama to name drop the shill organizations to point people in that direction.  The same way Hillary Clinton name dropped Alex Jones.  They are simply plugging their controlled opposition and it drives people who dislike them to those sources.  I&#39;d say every &quot;big name&quot; in the Flat Earth movement is some kind of a shill.  Some of them give very good information on the actual shape of the Earth and fake space but they push eastern Gnosticism or simulation theory.  They are just gatekeeping the next level of truth.  Once you realize you are on a flat and motionlessness earth the deception becomes spiritual.  There is just as much spiritual deception to navigate as there is with figuring out they are lying about the shape of the Earth and Outer Space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there&#39;s no use in having a discussion if you already know everything. I picked the cooling moonlight argument because it&#39;s the easiest and cheapest to debunk on your own. I wouldn&#39;t have a hard time coming to terms with a FE model if there were anything to it. If you aren&#39;t adding controls to your data sets, then of course your going to make incorrect assumptions about how things function. The example you&#39;ve given of how you tested the cooling property of moonlight is similar to me taking a temp reading of a swimming pool and the air after nightfall and just because the air is cooler than the pool at that instant, concluding that water independently generates heat. It&#39;s an assumption based off limited data with no controls and it&#39;s incorrect. A discussion should be give and take though so if you want to discuss flat earth, you should expect more out of yourself in the discussion as far as willingness to see the other side and willingness to be wrong. If you already &quot;know for a fact&quot; then you aren&#39;t trying to have a discussion, you&#39;re attempting to lecture and preach. Therefore you shouldn&#39;t be shocked when you get downvoted to all hell for preaching and lecturing people on things that you aren&#39;t even invested enough in to explore for yourself. That&#39;s what I mean about faith. You&#39;re using circular logic and confirmation bias to convince yourself that you are done learning when you haven&#39;t even begun and I mean that as a wakeup call and not at all as an insult. Many never even take the first steps of questioning which you have... it&#39;s a shame that you stopped at the one conclusion but if it makes you happy, I can&#39;t dispute that reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can be duplicated with varying results... many have tried to the opposite effect as well. Try my experiment for yourself and you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s very little variance to the outcome. The moon produces more heat than the night sky. </p>

<p>I could link a vid, but there are too many to choose from and you can find them just as easily. </p>
