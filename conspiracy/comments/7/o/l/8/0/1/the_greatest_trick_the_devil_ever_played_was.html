       Buddhism isn’t technically a religion. It’s a philosophy. And they see evil as actions and thoughts instead of having it represented by an external deity.

       You are talking about tibetan Buddhism - which is the newest form of Buddhism and is about one thousand years old. The original Indian Buddhism is more than two thousand years old and they very well have deitys like the Asuras or the Devas. I mean Buddhism basically copies a lot from Hinduism.. And Hindus have so many different gods for all kinds of things it's very hard to tell them all apart.

       There is no fake Buddhism. The Tibetan Buddhism is basically the newest form of Buddhism which is about a thousand years old. The original Buddhism is more than two thousand years old and is basically a copy with added aspects of an even older religion - Hinduism.

       No. It was literally a god (one of the heavenly Kings, the Brahma) who appeared before Buddha and urged him to teach the people what he had learned after he reached enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a nice fairytale like all the other religions too. Tibetan Buddhism refined it a bit to take out a lot of the fairy tale parts. But they still believe in spirits like the Dakinis.

       Asyria, is that where Zoroastrianism comes from? Because that would be pretty interesting since they kind of pioneered the "struggle between good and evil" kind of paradigm in religion.

       Brilliant. It has worked so well, we're only on the brink of extinction. Considering how Christianity is a religion that expects mission work of its people, telling it's followers to go spread the word before the end time, and that worldwide stats show that other religions together outweigh the might of the Christian populace, how do you feel you've dated in the war for heaven? Have you done enough to garner his favor? By your statement, I think not.

       Not a follower of Christ either. We're on the brink of extinction because a combination of neoliberalism, multiculturalism and the sexual revolution has eroded the values and traditions our once great country was originally founded on. The family unit is still around, but only as a mere shadow of its former self.

       By the way, you don't garner His attention or favor. I doubt your knowledge of the Bible exceeds mine, but that doesn't matter. What matters is why do people who claim to believe in God, yet don't follow him?

       I don't believe that that God is the GOD. OT God (someone I believe may have been corrupted,) has the advantage of knowing the outcome. The books give us more questions regarding his motives, his bizarre demands to show adequate fealty, outright
hypocrisy, and jeremiah 8:8. That's what did it for me, anyways.

       The Devil is a Christian invention to demonize the spirit. It's only an aspect of the Christ, but only an aspect once he sees past the pride of being 'the Savior of Light', 'the Vessel', 'Seed of the Mother.'
      </p>
      <p>
       The Demiurge is blind. The Christ sees the fire is the water, past all opposites, the future in one eye; the now in his breath.

       Funny thing is, this is no longer accurate. Nowadays the "devil" is doing everything he can it seems to show us he exists. Look at the pop-culture icons of today and "artists" like Marina A. They are all open about what they believe now. It is trending actually. (and unfortunately)

       this doesn't demonstrate that the devil's scheme is failing, rather, what it shows is that the scheme is growing progressively more successful. Think back a couple of centuries, you could barely write with your left hand, a woman couldn't even decide to be promiscuous without someone bringing up the devil. Cut to present day: occult themes in every movie and every TV show, demonic sigils are centerpieces of company logos and entire clothing lines, secret societies enlisting openly, magic and spiritism trending among the young, yoga and meditation in the fucking Christian church. And nobody even notices anything is amiss!

       If you study the bible and Lucifer's role in it, the narrative of most religions have twisted it.  The Devil has been turned into the boogeyman and held responsible for all that goes wrong in the world.  If someone does something evil...the "devil made him do it."  In truth, Lucifer was loved by God and was his "second in command" so to speak.  Lucifer was really the first true democrat in that he believed that divine power should be shared by all and not be possessed by just one entity, that entity being God.  His unwillingness to accept divine law is what made him fall from God's grace.  But, it should also be noted, that Lucifer was never "kicked" out of heaven and Lucifer has access to the celestial planes, as he always did (altho many say he doesn't).  He just isn't in God's grace because of his beliefs.  He is still loved by God though and proof of this is that God has allowed Lucifer to maintain the powers God bestowed upon him.  It's a lot like King George (God) and the American Revolution (Lucifer and his followers), except Lucifer lost and the Colonists won.
      </p>

       I should note I'm not a religious person, so I am sure people will refute the above.

       That's not what the Bible says. Satan, rebelled against God and was cast down and a third of angels rebelled and followed him. His purpose was to kill, steal and destroy and he still believes he can beat God one day. That's why the Bible says he roams around seeking who he can deceive (destroy) day and night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also remember that modern day versions of the Bible didn't translate the exact way as the kind james version and certain words have a different meaning the how newer versions translate.
      </p>
      <p>
       God hates evil. The Bible is clear on that and the devil turned into evil and is the one who tries to destroy everything god made.

       Since you supposedly believe in this stuff, mind answering a question that's been bugging me?
      </p>
      <p>
       How the hell does the devil, in the pop-culture understanding of the figure, make any damn sense in the context of Christianity? The "pop-culture Satan" is an enemy against God that schemes and opposes and fights God; who is an omnipotent force that decides
       <strong>
        everything
       </strong>
       that does or does not occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I'm seeing this, if the devil's acting untoward, either God isn't omnipotent enough to put an end to it; or the actions of the devil are perfectly in order with the omnipotent God's desires and really not up to Satan when all's said and done.

       There is no set of everything. Think Maxwell's demon. The Devil is God's mean of growth. Yin and Yang together form God. God may know how to get X far, but he doesn't have data for what he has not yet created, and has to send people to figure where to go next. You have to make the mistake before correcting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe God did everything right first, and then realized it didn't mean anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget your understanding of God is built on two thousand years of language growth and decay. Our language is not that precise.

       The devil was cast down the earth and he rule s the earth. That's why there is evil on earth...men chose that when they bit the apple. And that brought the devils reign on the earth (according to the Bible.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Men have a choice because of Christ, this salivation the whole point of the christian religion. God gave man free will. He can't force them no if they choose evil evil things happen on earth. God never planned for evil...human kind chose it when they sinned and genesis says that opened almost a veil.

       How is that even possible? Did evil come from nothing? Did evil exist before God? You're describing an independent force seemingly beyond the omnipotent creator of everything...?
      </p>
      <p>
       If God is the creator of everything, he must be the decider behind every phenomena and every mechanism that allows the presence/creation of a phenomena: even if God didn't create evil, he must've put in place the possibility for it to come about.

       The angels chose to rebel against them, they chose to be higher then god and try to overthrow him. Free will means you have the power to choose.

       We believe in many things. Assuming we're all atheists is preposterous. Assuming we're all Trump supporters, absurd. Super shills, as well.  Christian zealots, radical hate wielding Muslim's, and/or atheist snowflakes. We are not all or any of these in entirety. That is literally impossible.

       There are more then one word for hell in the Bible, one refers to under the earth (maybe the middle of the earth,under) and one refers to the grave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell was a place for Satan and the evil beings who followed him.

       "And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him."
      </p>
      <p>
       God literally did whatever he could throughout the Bible, including Jesus to save people and have them not follow the devil...and people still refuse. God didmt send people to follow Satan but did everything he could to stop them, the Bible is full of him forgiving again and again and people still choosing evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that's why he gives no day or time to be known for his return, because he's constantly giving people more and more time to stop killing, hating and hurting eachother.

       The Devil is a Christian invention to demonize the spirit. It's only an aspect of the Christ, but only an aspect once he sees past the pride of being 'the Savior of Light', 'the Vessel', 'Seed of the Mother.'
      </p>
      <p>
       The Demiurge is blind. The Christ sees the fire is the water, past all opposites, the future in one eye; the now in his breath.
