       Theory: 
FBIAnon and Q have been feeding this forum's content for months. Someone knew there was ready evidence of election interference  (both the DNC and the "Russian" hackers) and set this "oh look at these crazy accusations of malfeasance" game in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not denying there's pedophilia rings, but the conspiracy with the Clintons isn't about CPP. I don't think the FBI or CIA planned on so many liberals voting 3rd party or not at all. The plan was for a Clinton win and the Pizzagate scandal a way to crack down on internet anonymity and censorship. And likely gun control.

       You wish pizzagate was fake news? Why? You have, literally, zero evidence for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like me saying that I wish flat earth theory was fake news. I have no evidence for flat earth theory either.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question becomes, why do you want to believe something so bad, yet has zero evidence, and at the same time, wish there was no evidence? Is it not weird to you that you can't reconcile these things?

       Op said they wished it was fake. Your response " why do you want to beleive it so bad?

       They literally just said they wished it was fake, the opposite effect wanting to it so bad.

       Pizzagate is real, which means people have suffered immensely.  Of course I wish this did not happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zero evidence?   Where have you been the past few years?  It seems like you are not amserious researcher, so I hesitate to waste my time responding.

       How do you define Pizzagate?

       The Lolita Express has been never been a (primary) part of Pizzagate canon for one reason - that would force Pizzagaters to include Trump in their group of elite 'pedophiles' that they routinely talk about wanting killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that actual evidence of powerful politicians engaging in pedophilia or other illegal behaviors is ignored in favor of people getting enraged about social media posts that have nothing to do with them (or illegal acts) or emails they are willfully misinterpreting is PROOF that Pizzagate is nothing but a bullshit partisan attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of focusing on non-existent evidence of made up crimes by democrats, why don't we focus on real, provable crimes by people of all sides? You know, actually fight against pedophilia and sexual abuse while also punishing corrupt people on both sides of the aisle?

       My original comment mentioned Pizzagate/Pedogate.  I did it because the terminology confuses a lot of people.  It is why I asked you to define Pizzagate.  That way, I know better how to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is not a partisan attack.  Both Democrats and Republicans are involved.  In fact, the whole Democrat and Republican labels are a distraction.  They are mostly New World Order globalists who practice a certain religion.  I don't mean Christianity...
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, Republicans are also involved.  Have you not researched any of this?  I don't mean to be rude, but it seems that you would know that both Democrats and Republicans are involved if you researched it.  In fact, Republicans are some of the worse.

       That's not abusive or threatening. It's a word to describe someone who's sexualy attracted to children, as op clearly is. Read their post history if you need proof. What this sub coming to why. I can't call a paedophile a pedo?

       Wait, you're in a conspiracy sub, saying an opposing political/lifestyle/spiritual belief is evidence of criminal activity, that you should be able to libel and harass them for a discussion, posted by limited experienced folks incapable of critical thought or empathy?

       I'm not rehashing narrow claims, nope. I've spoken against this bullshit theory for months, and despite multiple people in this thread and others today, you guys go at my comments about a kid doing drag as proof of pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who's been molested, and called out the actions of molesters, abusers and rapists in real life, this theory is despicable. I also think accusations of pedophilia deserve the respect to be DOCUMENTED and PROSECUTABLE. Anything less than that respect is dangerous to the victims. Shitty blogs and YouTube investigations are proof of immaturity and witchhunts.

       As a molested individual you call upon a call to authority to give your unsubstantiated opinion weight?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Alefantis et al. were not connected to the political elite there WOULD be a real investigation.

       Don't even fucking try to suggest that this is a case of a witch hunt.

       If this was a regular person, they would already be hung. This much circumstantial evidence warrants a REAL investigation... not this horseshit we have all been privy to.

      <p>
       Prosecutable? Don't you need an investigation first?

      <p>
       The DC Police supposedly investigated and then promptly "debunked" pedogate.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the DC Police were challenged to provide the evidence they assessed in their debunking (through FOIA) they quickly back tracked.
      </p>
      <p>
       They NEVER fucking investigated it.

       So don't go around spouting off as if this has all been properly investigated and nothing was found, because you're being ridiculously transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's see a real investigation. I'm open to it being debunked... but it most certainly has not.

       You have a rather unhealthy sense of entitlement and poor reading comprehension. You do realize the police looked into the issue, before the wingnut showed up armed and saw that there was no evidence of anything except homophobic hysteria? "The evidence" is Instagram photos and a band website. (Podesta's emails are obviously encoded, but the link to pedophilia at CPP isn't there, man. It's just NOT.)
      </p>
      <p>
       As to calling me a liar, that's just absurd. I carefully click on shit in this sub. I'm absolutely grateful for finding this forum because it led to me finally facing some long withheld shit and finally purge my Catholic upbringing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just out of curiosity, what in your realm of communication thinks it's ok to insult and throw accusations at people who disagree with you? Many people can agree to disagree here. Calling me a pedophile and a liar because I know drag and don't think Pizzagate is a logical theory seems like an extreme reaction. People also gleefully told me to castrate my non-existent penis because I made a point, not defended a photo shoot.

       Also, I've doubted many claims against the people involved w CPP because I hung out with that scene before, self-important liberals who own dives, work in music/art/literary scenes and their sense of avant-garde humor and "rebellion". Cocaine-fueled narcissism. Childless couples. Men who marry women half their age and acquired gay friends to be seen with. It's all very self indulging and hollow.

       I partially was on board with a lot of Pizzagate stuff until I started looking into the actual evidence available, and I realized we have too many people jumping to conclusions about this.

       It’s like some people are trying to shove a bison through the eye of a needle.  I’m actually concerned how many people take this as undeniable truth with the small, conjectural evidence we have.

       I'm not rehashing narrow claims, nope. I've spoken against this bullshit theory for months, and despite multiple people in this thread and others today, you guys go at my comments about a kid doing drag as proof of pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who's been molested, and called out the actions of molesters, abusers and rapists in real life, this theory is despicable. I also think accusations of pedophilia deserve the respect to be DOCUMENTED and PROSECUTABLE. Anything less than that respect is dangerous to the victims. Shitty blogs and YouTube investigations are proof of immaturity and witchhunts.

       You have a rather unhealthy sense of entitlement and poor reading comprehension. You do realize the police looked into the issue, before the wingnut showed up armed and saw that there was no evidence of anything except homophobic hysteria? "The evidence" is Instagram photos and a band website. (Podesta's emails are obviously encoded, but the link to pedophilia at CPP isn't there, man. It's just NOT.)

       As to calling me a liar, that's just absurd. I carefully click on shit in this sub. I'm absolutely grateful for finding this forum because it led to me finally facing some long withheld shit and finally purge my Catholic upbringing.

       Just out of curiosity, what in your realm of communication thinks it's ok to insult and throw accusations at people who disagree with you? Many people can agree to disagree here. Calling me a pedophile and a liar because I know drag and don't think Pizzagate is a logical theory seems like an extreme reaction. People also gleefully told me to castrate my non-existent penis because I made a point, not defended a photo shoot.
