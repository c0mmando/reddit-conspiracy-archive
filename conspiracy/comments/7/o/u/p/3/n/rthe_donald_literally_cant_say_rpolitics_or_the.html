       They come here and make everything about politics and ignore conspiracy. Seriously, these guys won't even comment on a thread that isn't related to trump/russia, and any time they do it's only to derail a thread never to actually contribute anything. There's even a post right now where all the top comments are trying to get the post removed because it says that the primary was rigged against bernie
       <strong>
        which was proven literally the week of the new york primary in april 2016
       </strong>
       . Ask yourself who is interested in doing this? In only creating noise and not contributing anything of substance, and of promoting the establishment government msm narrative.

       IMO this sub is about 50/50 ration on Trump supporters to non-supporters.  Saying half of us are shills basically means you believe everyone you disagree with is shilling.  Anecdotally that is how I’ve seen shilling accusations play out here.

      <p>
       I don't think that how that math works out. If half of each side are shills, he's likely to agree with the shills that are arguing from "his side."  So only half the people he disagrees with are shills, the other half are genuine. As such, only half the people that agree with him are genuine, while the other half that agree are shills. Shills work both sides.

       I don’t think you’re disagreeing with what I said—just elaborating on it.  Too often, the level of discourse on this sub stoops to “you’re speaking in support of Trump, must be a Russian shill” or “you’re speaking against Trump, obvious Shariablue Soros shill”
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s juvenile, and frankly idiotic.   It gives anyone here an easy out to avoid debating from a position of honesty, logic, and evidence and instead summarily discount any position against the opinion they already hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe in something, bring your conviction to r/conspiracy and use your brain to convince us why you’re right.  Don’t just call everyone who disagrees a shill.  There are many decent people here with viewpoints from a variety of sides—very few of them are actually bots or shills.  Make an actual fucking argument.

       Missed that post but it’s pretty self-evident if you come here regularly.  IMO, it makes this a very worthwhile place of discussion.  All of the other major political subs are ban-happy echo chambers too consumed by hatred of the other side to have any sort of fully rational discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, for instance, you hate Trump but also think Hillary was an awful choice, are liberal in many ways but are a huge 2nd amendment supporter—this sub is by far the best place to talk politics.

       I'm not sure what how regular I am here has to do with referencing a study. but whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       This place is generally extremely toxic when trying to discuss anything. It's at the point where people will start complaining about that horrible
       <em>
        other side
       </em>
       and calling them shills before any of them even post.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realise surely that r/politics isn't particularly ban happy and that the users there only ever grudgingly supported Hillary. The only thing that it's missing from your list is 2nd amendment support, which it is actually more moderate on in average than you might think.

       Chill dude I was just saying I haven’t seen that study but agree with the premise just based off guesswork.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out my other post on this thread to see how fully I agree with how toxic shilll accusations are on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as r/politics, I agree and give them full credit that they do not ban for dissenting views.  However they also will not upvote or consider them even if polite and well-reasoned.  I strongly disagree about Hillary though—the majority of that sub worships her and views her as a near-perfect candidate with few flaws.  Just try mentioning Bernie and the DNC rigging the primaries and be prepared to be called a Russian shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may not be the case overall for liberals IRL, but r/politics is also strongly anti-gun.  They stoop to emotional “think of the safety of the kids” arguments and go full nanny-state.  The infamous Hillary tweet about “think of how many more he could have killed if he had a silencer” was hugely supported there, showing complete lack of basic knowledge that consumer suppressors do not silence guns like in James Bond movies.  Again, try to explain that basic fact politely and you will be met with “Sandy hook bro, you are literally Hitler and want 5 year olds to die”

       I only comment in new. I routinely get upvoted a good amount then if it hits popular I'll get numerous comments attacking me and I'll be downvoted into oblivion. Do you really think the sub that is ground zero for topics like 9/11 and CIA fuckery ISNT full of government funded shills? I've been around this sub long enough to see certain patterns, lingo and tactics that all reek of inorganic discourse. I know the difference between a disagreeing reply and one that is paid.

       You're absoulutely right. Reddit benifits from us, and we're supporting their actions through our continued usage and participation. IMO knowing what we do, if they won't change, continued support is at least a partial of a lapse in moral judgement. The forward-thinking, ethically diciplined choice is to leave completely (though ideally not before writing a post to make you intentions clear widely heard and understood). Besides the sort of inline-advertizing, data-mining and product pushing that
       <a href="/r/HailCorporate/">
        /r/HailCorporate/
       </a>
       catches on to,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7oykux/eric_weinsteins_4_quadrants_how_disconnects_in/">
        "First principal thinkers / Contrarians"
       </a>
       are also actvely shunned on this site. If those thinking critically just packed up and left, this site would lose all credibility and devolve into CTR/MMFA/ShareBlue echo chamber. Blatant organized astroturfing is allowed, and supported by the admins. Reddit's an arm of the mainstream media, with deep pockets, and rich connections to the establishment. They should get exactly what they deserve and desire.

       The dilemma is that no significant portion of the user base wants to actually pay for a reddit replacement.  Any other "free" reddit replacement will eventually be plagued with the same issues and conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's exactly what happened to Digg.  They sold out hardcore, the site sucked, and everyone migrated to reddit thinking it would be neutral.  A few years and HuffPo acquisition later and we are back at the same spot.

       Well I'd say that a significant portion of users

       say donated to Voat.co. I get your point though that more funding of could be massively helpul. With how prolific internet crowdfunding is, funding is an entirely solvable issue. You don't nessisarily need a huge investor nowadays, especially if you get crafty. Some useful reccomendations to heed from the now defunct youtube alternative vidme:

        If you’re considering building your own video platform, here are a few suggestions:
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Monetization
        </strong>
        — Plan to operate at a loss for an indefinite period of time, and/or be operated by a deep-pocketed business with multiple revenue streams and touchpoints with consumers. Give users of your existing products incentives to engage with your video platform, and be wary of monetizing with advertisements prior to achieving massive scale.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Infrastructure costs
        </strong>
        — Explore emerging technologies, such as peer-to-peer storage and delivery to further reduce infrastructure overhead. Consider restrictive storage policies, and own as much of the physical infrastructure as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Audience building
        </strong>
        — Leverage an existing audience, and/or incentivize all platform participants by issuing a native currency (e.g. blockchain) to equitably reward contributors.

       This subreddit is generally right-leaning but occasionally you get waves of shills. But those simmer down as the other subs are much more important than this one which is still somewhat fringe (at least relative tot he bigger subs).

      <p>
       This sub and t_d were the only places you could find Trump supporters during the election. Especially after reddit banned all the alt right subs.

       Yep. Anything that criticizes the Corporate Centrist puppets of the DNC like Obama, HRC, Kamala, Deval, DWS, etc gets a lot of flak from the r/politics crowd. Any discussion of Bernie being cheated by these inept, corrupt fools really pisses em off too. And being a Bernie supporter who is mindful of all this, and doesn't believe in the BS Russia Collusion? Man that

       Capitalization adds emphasis. I want to emphasize
       <em>
        Corporate Centrists
       </em>
       as a proper noun, and as a proper, defined group of people. I want to emphasize Russia Collusion as a proper noun, and as the load of shit that it is. The fact that you notice the capitalization means it's doing its job.

       And? Sorry that Corporatists have co-opted both Parties and the entire US political system. It's a term that

       be used to identify the problem. Words have power. And yes, someone like me who is distrustful of Corporate control is also a Bernie supporter...that's not uncommon. I fail to see what you are trying to insinuate here.

       Ah yes, Mueller. The FBI Director during 9/11, them an who is bringing on known partisans to his investigation, people who have worked with both HRC and Obama, and who has had to let some of them go after it came out publicly that they were vehemently anti-Trump. Yup, this sounds like a totally legit investigation to me.

       I've been following this story since the beginning. If they honestly had evidence that the President of the US directly colluded with the Russian to steal the election they would never have allowed him to become President. But go ahead and claim "that's just now how things work" or "due process". If these spooks had evidence, real evidence, and still allowed him to take office, then they failed at their jobs completely and aren't interested in protecting the country lol.

       It's funny because they don't realize that they betray their own pattern. Fools like him always show up when keywords that I stated in my comment get made, and then mysteriously the comments go from +5 to -5 in 15 minutes LOL...totally organic I'm sure. It's all good though, at least their blatant bullshit lets the username get tagged for what it is.

        It's weird and, along with the slinging around of the word ''corporate'' and the ''being a Bernie supporter'' really reminds me of social media during the 2016 primaries.

       Yup. I've been called a Trump supporter, they've told me I'm a shill, that I'm a fake Bernie supporter and not a real Progressive. Personally, idgaf. I know what I am and I know it pisses them off that I don't fit neatly into their precious little boxes.

       That's what they don't want you to know about them. Now sure you can claim that I'm one of them too. I've been arguing with a moron that claims that NASA is hiding gophers in their photos of Mars. But that's what they don't want you to know about... them.

       I agree. It was crazy to see how it changed almost overnight. It's part of the reasons I even ended up on r/conspiracy in the first place. The subversion of r/politics, then the subversion of r/wikileaks, r/sandersforpresident, and the shutting down of r/pizzagate lead me here and I've never left. Stay strong friend.

The elites are extremely right wing and extremely authoritarian.

       They're NEOliberals (extremely deregulated markets and banks) and NEOconservatives (warmonger foreign policy). Obama/Bush/Clinton are all NEOlibs and NEOcons simultaneously, just different shades of the same
establishment model of corrupt politician.

       Lib vs con is just bullshit to keep us psychologically chained to the corporate duopoly, like marketing.
"I'm a proud lib/con, so I'ma vote muh Dems/Repubs"

       Dems and Repubs:

       I don't personally believe the Dems can reform. It has to be a grassroots movement.
Either that or somehow removing the very right wing NEOlibs and replacing them with legit left wingers and centrists. Also removing money from politics would greatly help.

       That post on the front page is from a spam website and the story is a year and half old. Why is it on the front page right now. People here are well aware of what happened during the primaries. Are you also pissed off at all the people here that Trump cheerleaders from the_donald that try to make sure nothing bad about Trump ever hits the front page?

       Because to Trump supporters, all that matters is Trump. We are allowed to talk shit about Sessions, Kushner, even Bannon after he bad mouthed daddy. But Trump is off limits. Trump himself has talked shit about Jeff Sessions for recusing himself. Which means Trump supporters are allowed to not like him.

       Interesting. I don't go to the_donald often. I assumed they would obviously protect Trump the most but would also voraciously protect his cronies. I guess questions aren't allowed in this sub.

       If they're talking about that post about the court case regarding the primaries, the title was a flat out falsehood.

       Funny how we get posts like this whining that people are criticizing a fucking lie. Seriously, just think about that. A ton of upvotes and comments on this thread because false propaganda was being criticized.

       There are so many, so many good non political conspiracies. Politics is by definition a sham. Trump or Bernie would have to face down Soros or Bibi, Rothschild or Rockefeller, and ultimately they’d still be at the mercy of the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       On conspiracy I only care about what the CIA or FBI is doing politics wise. I don’t care that trump did this or Hillary did this. That’s why I like that trump has so much media against him.

       Serously, everyone loves drawing these equivalencies and showing how they get different treatment, but the admins
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to step in. TD was becoming a problem on a greater scale than pretty much anything else on the site, so yes, they get different, stricter rules.

       Ah, I was referring to the rest of Reddit. I would imagine people who appreciate TD don't see an issue, just like Bernie supporters didn't mind when Bernie spam got real bad. The thing is that TD kept ramping it up by using vote manipulation tactics, brigades (the obvious kind admins can't overlook), and just plain ol' botting. This put the admins, who would prefer to do literally nothing (since they can't win) to
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to step in and change things to defend Reddit for a certain zealous subset.

       Except, how do you, a non-admin, go about proving this claim?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its legitimate question given that Reddit maintains a very biased socio political narrative toward the general userbase and makes changes to the algorithms to specific filter out and suppress views the admins disagree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not the sub engaged in such activities is an equally valid question, but the site's previously documented incidents of suppressing opposing views and silencing dissention should be taken into consideration. Simply throwing out the word brigading and botting on a matter that already caters to a bias you hold simply adds nothing except to further your perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no different than when FPH got shutdown; claims of brigading, botting, harassment, etc were thrown about, but no actual evidence was provided because
       <em>
        everyone already assumed it to be true
       </em>
       and solely on the merit that certain groups found the sub to be offensive to them, popularizing unfounded and unsubstantiated claims that simply sounded plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with
       <em>
        user-initiated
       </em>
       filtering; let the user make the choice. That's a smart decision; you don't want something on the front page, then it shouldn't be there for
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Forcibly changing an algorithm to favor or suppress views is not.

       Fair enough; so you have sources to cite to uphold this claim?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, GOOD. If anything, this subreddit above all others should be the one to cite sources, to provide sources, to provide information for cross-reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, then you should retract that statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       People claimed left and right that there dozens of posts calling for brigading in the FPH and they were right; they just left out the part where the mods shut those posts down because they knew what would happen if they didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not T_D does that is irrelevant; its whether or not you have the source to back that up.

       Great point. There's no functional difference between something getting popular and brigading. Institute rules that can be applied to anyone and then selectively enforce to your heart's content. Meanwhile, they'll leave whole subs up who are dedicated to brigading, and leave proven corporate shills as full-time supermods.

       The brigading is all coming from r/politics. TD can't crosslink to any other sudreddit, but as OP is saying, r/politics links to r/conspiracy all the time which constantly initiates brigades.

       got bot'd so bad during the election, It was 100% bernie, then the bots names changed. I bet it was the same bot network that cause a minor sub with less than 200 users to make the front page of popular with a NN post. Its sad

       Large companies/websites that use a lot of bandwidth. Netflix, Youtube/Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook. Coincidentally these websites have a lot more money to throw at getting posts highly upvoted on reddit than they have to throw at companies like Comcast to stop themselves from being throttled.

       The original comment asked what groups stand to gain from net neutrality. I pointed out those that do, and also that it's a lot cheaper to buy votes on reddit. Neither of these things is false. Obviously my error was that I didn't append "And above all else... the people" to my list, but figured this was obvious, trite, and not the type of group they were asking about in the first place.

       The most recent round of net-neutrality protests were from Soros funded BattleForTheNet, rather than the EFF (the people who should be the forefront of net neutrality efforts). The exact same thing happened to the Tea Party movement a decade ago. A new group (fox news) shows up, starts hosting tea party events and blacklisting the original founders of the movement. Suddenly Fox owns the tea party and the movement's whole direction changes from being anti-old-guard republican to hardcore-conservative-values.

       That's because for a subreddit that should be neutral, they are far from that, meanwhile they had to censor T_D from the front page because they couldn't contain the 1% of this website that had wrongthink.

       Or because T_D was being bot'd like crazy and they were using ever vote manipulation techinque in the book. While I wish r/politics was neutral youll notice every political sub on reddit is left leaning due to the user base. While I am sure bots exist there too the fact that it's left leaning is not a conspiracy.

       You’re right, but only to a degree.

      <p>
       For example the Harvard Flouride study is a well known, and respected paper, but the conclusions drawn from it and the conspiracies related to it are largely absolute bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       NSA spying is another good one, in which it was a something very specific, whereas the conspiracy theories were wide ranging and generally nonsense.

       Well, it's not my job, so it's obviously entertainment, as for "shits and giggles", I guess that's subjective, and dependent on your definition of what that is.

       Using one of the examples above, if somebody posts the Harvard study in to fluoride on Reddit and states it is proof that governments the world over are deliberately altering my state of mind by putting fluoride in the water I will have a genuine interest in that conspiracy theory. If I then go and read the Harvard study and discover that it is not proof of that at all (it isn't), then I guess all future posts of a similar ilk will have an element of "shits and giggles" about it for me, yes.

       The Harvard study does not provide any evidence that the government is using fluoride to control our minds, nor does it attempt to even hypothesise that. No other source material is needed to show that.

        They then analyzed possible associations with IQ measures in more than 8,000 children of school age; all but one study suggested that high fluoride content in water may negatively affect cognitive development.
       </p>
       <p>
        The average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points for commonly used IQ scores with a standard deviation of 15.*  Some studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas.

       <p>
        Seventeenth-century philosopher and scientist René Descartes was highly interested in anatomy and physiology. He discussed the pineal gland both in his first book, the Treatise of Man (written before 1637, but only published posthumously 1662/1664), and in his last book, The Passions of the Soul (1649) and he regarded it as "the principal seat of the soul and the place in which all our thoughts are formed."[7] In the Treatise of Man, Descartes described conceptual models of man, namely creatures created by God, which consist of two ingredients, a body and a soul.[7][58] In the Passions, Descartes split man up into a body and a soul and emphasized that the soul is joined to the whole body by "a certain very small gland situated in the middle of the brain's substance and suspended above the passage through which the spirits in the brain's anterior cavities communicate with those in its posterior cavities". Descartes attached significance to the gland because he believed it to be the only section of the brain to exist as a single part rather than one-half of a pair. Most of Descartes's basic anatomical and physiological assumptions were totally mistaken, not only by modern standards, but also in light of what was already known in his time.[7][59]
       </p>
       <p>
        The notion of a "pineal-eye" is central to the philosophy of the French writer Georges Bataille, which is analyzed at length by literary scholar Denis Hollier in his study Against Architecture. In this work Hollier discusses how Bataille uses the concept of a "pineal-eye" as a reference to a blind-spot in Western rationality, and an organ of excess and delirium.[60] This conceptual device is explicit in his surrealist texts, The Jesuve and The Pineal Eye.[61]
       </p>
       <p>
        In the late 19th century Madame Blavatsky (who founded theosophy) identified the pineal gland with the Hindu concept of the third eye, or the Ajna chakra. This association is still popular today.[7]
       </p>
       <p>
        Rick Strassman, an author and Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, has theorised that the human pineal gland is capable of producing the hallucinogen N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) under certain circumstances.[62] In 2013 he and other researchers first reported DMT in the pineal gland microdialysate of rodents.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Pineal Gland has an ancient history of having a Spiritual purpose, being the seat of the soul, and being responsible for the spiritual development of people for thousands of years now from Indian and Tibetan cultures, as well as Celtic, Christian Mystic, Judaism, and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Studies showing that it lowers IQ, cognitive impairment, and pineal gland calcification have a number of connections to what Conspiracy Theories have been saying is true for decades now. So in actuality, you are wrong

       That's just putting up a straw-man argument, it's easy to gather a few outlandish stories and then suggest that the entire fruit basket is rotten. People forget that the very same can be said about the mainstream media, most of it are lies and half truths as a form of indoctrination, sources spreading actual information to the people are few and far between.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's the entire crux of this discussion, some people believe that they adhere to this moderate and widely accepted source of news when they flick on their TV and read their newspaper, and then treat the crazy bunch who get their ideas on r/conspiracy and alternative sources as gullible fools who've lost track of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is that the alternative media is largely a result of the people losing trust in the old media, and to find out what is actually going on in the world, you can no longer stick to watching 30 minutes of evening news, you need to rely on alternative sources, you need to start applying critical thought and figure out what's going on. Of course, that has its own problems, since critical thought is not really taught in schools it is now somewhat of a lost art, which leads to people falling in traps of outlandish theories. That doesn't mean you should throw the baby out with the bathwater. If you do not spend a good amount of time reading things outside of the mainstream media, you're largely oblivious to what's going on in the world, on the other hand, if you only stick to the fringe, then you'll lose track of reality just as well.

       You're absolutely correct in everything you say about critical thinking, and I also agree it's not the entire basket that is rotten, although unfortunately, it seems to be the majority of it recently. I don't think my picking of just a couple of examples, of many, in response to a claim that r/conspiracy has been proven right means I am guilty of making a straw man argument though.

       We talk about stuff before its proven to be true in this sub all the time. When the NSA spying on its citizens came out via Snowden, the posts on the front page of r/all about this topic had many replies saying "I guess the folks at r/conspiracy were right" leading to a flood of new users coming here to check us out.

       Same deal with the T_D'ers when they saw how biased the leftist media was, they learned about CIA/Washingtonpost/Amazon Servers connection, Operation Mockingbird, rigged primary, wikileaks dumps, so that also sent a lot of users from there over here.

       Seems like a mixed bag of scandals that happened throughout history, a lot of which predates reddit. There's legitimate and proven items such as ECHELON and really fringe stuff like chemtrails.

       I thought the chemtails thing was all about the condensation trails from the jet engines. These warfare simulations with nuclear tests and chemicals tests are pretty widely accepted.

       Peculiar how things can go from "fringe" to "widely accepted" in the span of a few minutes. Ask yourself what it is that you think is fringe. Perhaps it's just your assumption of what people think about chemtrails?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be honest here, "all about the condensation trails" is a pretty vague statement, and so is "warfare simulations". I mean, where does one end and the other start without applying actual scrutiny to the details? They flew planes across the country for decades and sprayed the population with things that in some cases made them sick. You'll have to admit that's a pretty good match for a chemtrail description, so why would you now state that it doesn't fit the chemtrail story? Perhaps you formed and idea about chemtrails in your head that was so outlandish that it could never be true, to the extend that when you're faced with evidence, you can't but disconnect the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you understand how the truth is buried, then you understand why you shouldn't look at the most outlandish version of a story and then discard the whole topic because it's too crazy a story for you. There is a very fine line between "fringe" and "widely accepted", sometimes, it's just a matter of wrapping up the story in a neatly written article.

       Also, we get funneled here ... finding a place where certain principles of openness and pondering are more so welcomed and cultivated.  To do so, typically requires a bit of respect and manners for even (especially) those that one does yet know or have been with acquainted.
       <br/>
       For these reasons, see these shifts as opportunities to touch minds and diddle hearts.  More folks are looking this way, let's show them what real discernment and truth-seeking looks like!

       That being said, this is a conspiracy sub. It has nothing to do with Donald Trump. If I wanted to talk about Trump getting criticized I would go to the correct subreddit for that. This sub is about finding the truth to the lies and corruption that our politicians and establishment has been conducting for nearly a century now. Anything else is just a distraction.

       I think you overestimate how much we are bothered by him considering that his unpopularity is fueling a democratic resurgence that reverses republican gains since 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and...the very title of this post is whining on behalf of t_d and you say it has nothing to do with t_d.  You talk about finding truth to lies when trump is one of the biggest liars in modern american political history. That is very typical of the complete lack of awareness of your average Trump supporter.

      <p>
       About ruining this sub...i think it is obvious who turned it from talking about cia and ufos and bigfoot-ish stuff into a non stop anti hillary political witchhunt day afyer day. Again, a lack of self awareness propels your thought process

       That's correct, most of the people who were apart of the Trump campaign were posting here quite frequently in 2016 or earlier. I joined a discord which a ton of pedes and randoms were there mostly shit posting but many were linking to reddit conspiracy articles for any news that was popping up or yelling about twitter/facebook/youtube censorship, most of it past things like Clinton/Obama/Bush era scandals and speculations.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people seem to forget that T_D was censored  and all their users saw it as well as the open public that was connected to anyone witnessing it. The influx went to conspiracy, voat, youtube, or dropped back into random internet forums.

       Anyone who frequented conspiracy and or TD when Wikileaks dropped the Podesta emails knows there was a lot of crossposting between the subs. I was initially subbed to TD on a different account and came here once I saw they were also going through the Wikileaks emails. I think that’s where a lot of the TD userbase initially came from as well.

       This isn't about a T_D pity party, this is about r/politics brigading. T_D users aren't allowed to crosslink in the subreddit so brigading is impossible, whereas no such rule exists in r/politics. It's hilarious that half the highly upvoted comments in this thread say that T_D is brigading when trying will literally get you banned from that subreddit.

       When I say "real users", I mean sincere users of this subreddit as opposed to users in r/politics who are thrown into the thread from a link in a comment. Are you suggesting that bots upvoted this thread?

       Logic would back my original assessment, that the brigading started
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the thread got traction. Just think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, accusing bots of manipulating threads is a really weak line of argument. Do you have any real evidence that T_D users have ever used bots, or is that just you're own way of justifying things that don't match your own views?

       Bots are a much weaker argument than brigading. As for evidence, remember what this thread is about after all. T_D users get banned for crosslinking, but r/politics allows crosslinking all the time. That's pretty good evidence for brigading right there.

       It sounds like you're a Canadian that feels like an outsider in your own country. You seem unliked in every other sub you post to, (except r/conspiracy), do you feel the downvotes further entrench your feeling of victim hood?

       I see you're getting defensive. Reddit lists r/politics as one of your most active subreddits and that's a fact. Just accept that I caught you out in a lie, instead of lashing out and attacking me. When someone devolves into petty insults that's a sure sign that they can't defend themselves with reasoned arguments, and you've just devolved. Sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also sad that you feel it's ok to "attack a used up radio shock jock". You must live a sad life if you find pleasure in attacking others.

       Trump is at 42% approval as of today. (source:

      <p>
       Considering 50% of the country will disapprove of him no matter what he does, those are actually really strong numbers. It just so happens that most of the 50% that will never support him waste all their time on reddit as well. Always be wary of echo chambers, like r/politics which I noticed is one of your most active subreddits.

       Surely you see that is true of every President in history. Are you going to tell me that Barack Obama's low of 38% were some "really strong numbers" because "50% of the country will disapprove of him no matter what" ?

       And yes I post regularly on
       <a href="/r/politics">

       . I am a left-leaning centrist. I used to post on
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       until they banned me after making comments that were negative about Trump's cabinet choices (largely financial/banking industry guys). So yeah I'm well aware of how dangerous "echo chambers" can be, and feel that way particularly strongly about
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald

       <a href="/r/politics">

       is, but if
       <a href="/r/politics">

       Yes I agree, that is usually true for every president. However, you're the one implying that 42% is a low approval rating, not me, so you've just proven yourself wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       And r/the_donald is definitely an echo chamber, but it doesn't hide that fact like r/politics does. Just read the rules, it's literally a fan page for Donald Trump, whereas r/politics pretends like it's objective even though they ban users for supporting Trump.

       42% is low. The difference is that you're making excuses for it, and I'm not. Furthermore you're not seeing the connection between a low approval rating, and uptick in negative commentary and discussion about a candidate. You're looking for bots and shills when you should be reading polls to better understand what elements of Trump's behavior have caused the most recent sub-50% numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your defense of
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       ...it's not really worth it to go into. If you think echo chambers have ANY place in a critical thinkers life (fan page or otherwise) then it's a waste of my time to discuss it with you.
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       is not simply a "fan page for Donald Trump" as you state, and I think you know that deep down...otherwise you wouldn't be drawn to a place like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       with other people who spend a lot of time trying to unravel the truth from all the bullshit.

       is liberal because of the liberal user-base, not because there are literal rules that make it impossible for dissenting users to have their voices heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why it's so ironic for you to say others have cognitive dissonance...that is literally what YOU are doing by holding two subs to completely different standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course, even more cognitive dissonance when you refuse to admit that maybe liberal users simply don't agree with trump's policies and vocalize it here. Instead you'd rather believe that "shills? or "bots" are invading the sub to influence opinions here.

       And by the way, you'd probably be on this sub-reddit speculating about the conspiracy behind it...

       people on that sub will also use participation on this sub or t_d as proof that you are a troll or that your argument is invalid. Even if you are simply posting an article from a non-right wing source that happens to paint the left in a negative light, they will dig into your post history to try to invalidate it

       You, me, and all the morons on that sub know and remember that they touted themselves as the most fair, the most unbiased, real news, etc. The same bs fox preaches nonstop to their viewers - delegitimize the opposition and tout yourself as the honest savior.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole spin of "it's a fan page we're supposed to be an echo chamber" came after getting called out again and again, the same way fox news hosts constantly backpedal and say "it's just opinion, it's just analysis, this isn't a news show!"

       Reddit has a double standard for this sort of thing.

      <p>
       You can be banned for saying jews have privilege, but if you say white privilege is real then you get reddit gold and 10,000 upvotes.

       I've been starting to believe that the users of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       share a lot of similarities with users of t_d. Maybe it is wishful thinking, but I just can't think that the views of these subs are a reflection of of the majority of users on Reddit. I think both subs are mostly comprised of trolls, very young people who don't fully get it yet, and of course shills/astroturfers. For me it can get really depressing seeing these extremely polarized users knock each other down to new lows in front of us, and that being the biggest voice on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What gives me hope(? I guess you could say) is lurking on this sub and seeing the number of subscribers slowly increase by almost a thousand every day. I've been keeping track and since about august this sub has increased by at least 90,000. That has to mean at least new people are coming here and willing to get a primer on "waking up" and are getting tired of all the obvious bullshit going on in our mainstream pop culture.

       The website I use actively controls subreddits in fear of letting their site appear like something it isn't.

       Now, when those dumbass reasons are because of partisan nonsense. You're damn right I'm going to complain.

       Whats the point of net neutrality and basic freedoms if we have dinks in the shadows are operating to make sure comments disappear and certain topics are avoided or never appear to the eyes of the /all.

       I don't see how that is cool with anyone? Unless they actively enjoy having their bubble of curated content with a skewed perception of how many on the internet interact and react.

       I've only been on here a few months and mostly just lurk but even I've noticed how anything worth talking about on here always turns to a trump/no trump shitfest. Why are things always broken down that way? I really hoped and still hope that this sub gets back to the heart of the matter so to speak.

       I’m being serious here. Who in their right mind goes on and reads r/p0l0tics. It would be like watching CNN. What sane person watches CNN. You get more accurate news watching South Park. 
Then again sometimes I do go on  r/p0l0tics when I get really high just to fuck with them. It amuses me.

       Logic would back my original assessment, that the brigading started
       <em>

       the thread got traction. Just think about it.

       Also, accusing bots of manipulating threads is a really weak line of argument. Do you have any real evidence that T_D users have ever used bots, or is that just you're own way of justifying things that don't match your own views?

       Yes I agree, that is usually true for every president. However, you're the one implying that 42% is a low approval rating, not me, so you've just proven yourself wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       And r/the_donald is definitely an echo chamber, but it doesn't hide that fact like r/politics does. Just read the rules, it's literally a fan page for Donald Trump, whereas r/politics pretends like it's objective even though they ban users for supporting Trump.

       Oh and...the very title of this post is whining on behalf of t_d and you say it has nothing to do with t_d.  You talk about finding truth to lies when trump is one of the biggest liars in modern american political history. That is very typical of the complete lack of awareness of your average Trump supporter.
