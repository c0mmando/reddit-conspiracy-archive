       If two ((or more)) grown people have a consensual relationship what is so wrong with it?

       If a man is feminine or a woman is more masculine what is wrong with it?

       Though I tend to agree with your support for the LGBT community, and have myself cautioned people against taking hatred for certain Cabal leaders of Jewish descent from spiraling into hatred for the whole group, I can explain why it's looked on distrustfully here. It has to do with the family- a lot of people see gay rights, transgenderism, and attacks on traditional masculine and feminine roles as an attack on the Family, and the Family is the absolute most important building block of society. I agree that the Family needs to be defended, I just disagree that allowing gays to marry each other really harms the concept in the end. But many disagree with me, and it's because to them LGBT rights etc. is an attack on the fundamental building blocks of society.

       Except traditional “masculine” and “feminine” are very Eurocentric ideals and a lot of societies don’t adhere to them and everyone turns out fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the attack on “family” aspect can be disproven too. I know plenty of straight parents who were awful to their children, neglectful, and abusive and plenty of gay parents who were amazing and gave their children everything they needed. Of course it goes backwards too. The genders of the parents have nothing to do with their ability to raise a family.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I know you disagree with the hate here, so the statement isn’t towards
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       specifically, it’s mainly generally for the people who do think that way.

       American society abandoned "traditional family values" decades ago with the explosion of deadbeat dads.  So this "focus on the family" narrative seems ridiculously late as far as I'm concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, a portion of my career is working with LGBT families and, while not exempt from issues that affect all families, they parent with more care and intention than most straight families I know.

       I'm not really arguing with you here. I don't have an issue with LGBT couples, I have known several personally, both as mentors and as good friends, and have no issues with them. But what I described is literally how some people see this issue.

       You might have it backwards. Nothing wrong with gay people but there is something from with feminizing men against their will. There nothing wrong with Jews but plenty wrong with unchecked Jewish supremacy.

       Unborn children inside the womb are aborted against their will.

       Can you explain, feminizing men against their will?  That is such a funny sentence.  I would say attributing roles and how men should behave and women behave since birth is definitely, against someone's will.

       Female hormones in the food we eat, the plastic shit we buy the water in most college towns is saturated with birth control. Which they say now causes cancer. I'm not making this up. Who do you think is easier to control, a bunch of healthy males or a bunch of soyboys? Nobody should ever be forced to do anything they don't want to do all I'm saying is be aware of the toxic environment that is being cultivated for us and fight against it if you want what's best for humanity.

       So you define a healthy male as what, meat-eating?  Lower belly fat, low T, sitting on couches all day, angry all the time healthy males?  I'll go ahead and order the spy burger all day compared to that health.  This is a tiredparadigm.  You started your reply with reason, ended it with sterotype.

       The LGBTQI's and whatever letters they've added today hate labels and want equality so they make their own flag, create their own 'community' and give themselves an acronym label. The world's gone absolutely bat shit crazy with hashtags and 'trendings' and this is merely one example. The propaganda machines are in work here and I think thats where the conspiracy lies. And Jews are cool in my book.

       Trust me; most of the LBGT community is embarrassed by the overzealous ones as much as the rest of y’all. But most of us are just normal people who don’t give a shit, we’re just sick of being afraid of being fired for who we are or other general unfairnesses. It’s like having to be afraid of being fired solely because you’re short.

       When it was created and when it was implemented as a Social Justice moniker are very different. I voted Yes for same sex marriage as I believe in equality, But when someone says that they identify as LGBTQI or start insisting people refer to them as their preferred pronoun, now were just going down silly street. If I meet you on the street I do not care where you put your genitals...

       Iam not sure who "you guys" is so first let me start with the fact it isn't that I resent your categorization of me as much as I am offended by it and refuse to accept it.

       Second, this is a conspiracy sub.  I disagree with more theories I see than I agree with, but for the most part the people who post them are people I rely on as solid sources of information.  I don't want to speak for anyone but I suspect that most, because they are open to many ideas, are fine with LGBT, or whatever labels ignorami wish to put on people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, while I see some bias against Jewish people in general I consider it ill informed noise.  However, in the same way that I didn't dislike South Africans in the 1980's I absolutely despised the apartheid state that people were forced to live under, so if you are picking up an anti-apartheid Israeli state vibe please rest assured the conspiracy isn't in a religion it is in the suppresion of human beings.

       Because the psychological basis of the conspiracy theory is fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the fear justified? Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on the theory itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is, in turn, why there are so many right-leaning individuals interested in conspiracy theories; the American right in particular being a fear-based belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The foundation of the anti-LGBT theories rest on the conceit of “cultural Marxism”, itself a dramatic misinterpretation of the source material you are welcome to google for the phrase. The anti-Jewish (Sorry, anti-Zionist) theories also have this basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in the oddly large number of religiously-based conspiratorial beliefs; and the oddly religious idea that is an all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful Illuminati conspiracy and you have the perfect conditions for fear of anything not straight white middle class America.

       I make that assumption based on a lot of arguments and interactions with them. Mostly I base the conclusion that a non-zero number are hiding antisemitism with anti-Zionism on how they frame their arguments; it is never “a Zionist faction” or “Zionists in Israel”, it is always “Israel” and “Israeli intelligence” and calling me goy and shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There never seems to be any gradient to their arguments differentiating Jews and Zionists
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       when they get called on it. Like now.
       <em>
        Then
       </em>
       there is suddenly a total difference and how could I possibly not see that before, etc.

       Wait so let me get this straight you think saying that "Israel" vs "Zionists in Israel" is different? Why? Obviously they are referring to the people who created the state of Israel and not the innocent people inside the country... If you said that the U.S. should go after Syria does that make you anti-syrian?? Your logic makes 0 sense so stop claiming your bs.

       Very good reply to these guys.  They push the limits of hate, I read one personsay take Israel out, and then you call them on it and they back off like you are the problem.  Screaming about the Cabal on the internet does nothing to solve the problem except prove weakness to the situation.  Go out and feed some homeless person then see if you feel like hating on the internet all day.  Chances are you won't.

       9/11 and Holocaust was the link.  I called him out and he backtracked.  You defended the term take Israel out like it was some sort of political action.  Im saying, that phrase is used inviolent terms.  Do you not agree?  Do you yourself use this phrase in a nonviolent way?

       amen! I’m bi ((well, 80% leaning towards women but still bi nonetheless)) and it’s just disheartening. Sometimes it’s hard to stomach all the shit that’s on here. Calling us vile shit and accusing the whole community of being pedos? Like no, it’s not the same, it never was, and it never will be. The LGBT community doesn’t stand for it and never has!

       Also can I please tattoo “men, you’ve run the world for a hot minute now and it’s not going to great, so sit down.” on my forehead? I will fucking credit you because it’s the greatest thing I’ve ever read.

       You may absolutely tattoo that on your forehead, n don’t worry about the creds cause I don’t think it’ll fit 😂
It’s exhausting reading secondhand opinions on how discrimination is “fake news” when I lost everyone I’d ever been close to when I came out. I’m not trying to turn anyone gay, man. Just tryna eat some pussy without being attacked as a human.

      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you this why is "it not going so great" right now? You can look all you want externally but the answers really lie internally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to be a victim and but your perception of your world is your reality and only you have the power to change it. So why think of world or this sub or this "masculine macho man" as the Boogeyman out to get you?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all searching for the same thing love, peace, and unity. Why create this illusion of separation through your thoughts and actions? Your expectations will eventually become your reality if you believe long enough and have enough energy so why expect hated towards you? What you search for with your thoughts you will eventually find so instead expect and search for acceptance rather than having the "masculine macho man sit down".
      </p>
      <p>
       You can choose to see those extremely rare posts as the norm or you can choose to see it for what it is a single person who is misguided. Your choice of how you react to it internally will control how you see things externally. The choice is yours

       Is it a conspiracy that your account doesn’t have a lot of posts and you just happen to comment on a post that’s related to your interests? Like come on! Why would I make an alt account to do this

       Because you come off as a narcissist. Most of your posts start with: as a bi woman, instead of just posting your opinion and letting it stand on its own merits. You also post pictures of yourself looking for positive affirmation. It wouldn't be a stretch that you would create another account to have conversations with yourself so you can talk about about the fact that you're into guys and girls. No one gives a shit about your sexual kinks, this isn't the place to have you identity validated.

       First of all, when I do state the fact that I’m bi it is to add where my viewpoint is coming from. Why I am qualified to speak on what I’m speaking on. It’s never just randomly shit out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, suddenly being a cosplayer and showing my art is “looking for validation” now? I give two shits if someone thinks I look good in cosplay or not. I post it because I’m proud and because it’s the place to post it?

       You came in here complaining about nonexistent hate against the LGBT community to validate your victimhood. If you want to talk about the moon landing why not start a thread about that? Your pictures aren't limited to cosplay (playing dress up isn't art), you post selfies as well. Next time you post here use the sliver of your personality that contributes to the topic of this sub, rather than the sliver that seeks to confirm your oppression.

       Oh my “victimhood” goes far beyond this. But I’m not a victim. It’s called being a survivor of many things and I use it to uplift people. 
And I have posted plenty of shit on the Elsagate sub. I just prefer to lurk on here because people are shit ;)

       Evidence is spoonfeeding? The fact that you think you are beyond reproach and that your accusations should be accepted without question really makes you look like a narcissist. You don't think gays are represented in the media? Wow. People disagreeing with teaching their young children about the sexual kinks of a fraction of the population is not hate sorry.

       They won’t, but it’s fun to watch them struggle to rationalize those fears with their belief that they’re “totally not racist or homophobic”.

       In the meantime, every argument you or I make deconstructing those irrational beliefs is not a wasted effort. Not to your own debate abilities nor to any lurkers who may see the comments.

       How are any of those things homophobic or transphobic? Believing that gender dysphoria is a mental illness (which it is) does not mean you're afraid of transgenders, its science.

       Well, saying things like “transgenders” gives me some potential information already about your level of familiarity with the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender dysphoria is the mental illness
       <em>
        resulting
       </em>
       from the decidedly not mental illness of having a neurological makeup that is not consistent with your biological makeup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender dysphoria =/= transgenderism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ascribing LGBT folks being “normalized” in the media as a dastardly plan to change the populace already seems to presume that any of that is objectively a bad thing, and nearly always ignores that you cannot turn somebody gay or trans. It is fundamentally an inability to recognize that these people have always existed in these numbers, but have been suppressed by the same kinds of attitudes that believe in “cultural Marxism” as an actual force dissimilar from normal cultural transmission in the modern age.

       Sorry transgender folks, does that offend your sensibilities less? Schizophrenics, as well as people with other mental illnesses like depression having different neurological makeups, that doesn't mean its not a mental illness. I don't care if the media "normalizes" LGBT, I care that people like you ignore science to placate the delusions of the mentally ill who should receive treatment instead of having surgeons make a science experiment out of them. I care that people like you seek to ruin childhood by teaching kids that they might be the opposite gender and should consider hormone treatment because it makes you feel enlightened and progressive. There are plenty of examples where your ilk have kids and push this shit on them so they can use them as a status symbol.

       Fact is, there is a great deal of nuance in my opinion of transgender folks and the future they have in society; but you wouldn’t know that because you presume I advocate for children making transitional decisions at young ages. This lack of nuance seems to be extended to your own understanding of the subject, in general.

       You should quote the whole thing. I said comes off like a narcissist, which implies that it is my feeling, not a statement about reality. Cherry picking quotes so you can try to white knight for someone isn't an honest way to make an argument.

       Yeah, man, like I said. The implication that talking about issues related to a person’s own identity be it “hyper-masculine white male” or “lesbian” can ever be construed as narcissistic, is a shitty way to make your own arguments.
      </p>

       You’re attacking the arguer, not the argument. And you did in fact “start it”, so now here we are arguing about who is being a narcissist and a white knight and whatever other BS instead of discussing the issues.

       Yeah, it is what you said. You went browsing through OP’s history and found points that support your conclusion of narcissism. You spent precious little time debating the issues presented and jumped rather quickly to a deconstruction about OP’s motives and constitution.

       The original issue was whether or not OP was talking to her alt and I gave evidence to support that theory. I'm sure you missed that since you were so excited to white knight for a helpless woman who you think can't defend herself.

        I’m not a brainwashed CIA pawn pushing my agenda to persecute the masculine macho man. I will say to such men, you’ve run the world for a hot minute now and it’s not going so great, so sit down.

      <p>
       Let me ask you this why is "it not going so great" right now? You can look all you want externally but the answers really lie internally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to be a victim and but your perception of your world is your reality and only
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       have the power to change it. So why think of world or this sub or this "masculine macho man" as the Boogeyman out to get you?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all searching for the same thing love, peace, and unity. Why create this illusion of separation through your thoughts and actions? Your expectations will eventually become your reality if you believe long enough and have enough energy so why expect hated towards you? What you search for with your thoughts you will eventually find so instead expect and search for acceptance rather than having the "masculine macho man sit down".

       I don't see any of the issues you have outlined here, but I do think that people should have the right to express their opinions and if others have an issue they are free to also express their own opinions, do you agree with that statement, or are you for outright censorship? If you have issue with anything someone else says then you should argue what they say, do you not agree?
      </p>
      <p>
       Freedom of words is essential to a free and open society and without the free expression of ideas we would not have ever created such an intricate civilization. If you are hurt by words then use them yourself to counter what you think is wrong. the issue that I see with what you are saying is that you are insinuating a case for censorship. I will never think this is the right path, a path like this leads to a full on dictatorship.

       Now if I walked into an anti LGBT hate group, that rhetoric is expected, and yes, I would defend their rights to say it.

       But people just mindlessly attacking people when it’s not appropriate, spewing hate just because, isn’t something I stand for.

       Can you provide examples of this hate you see? I hang around new for this sub and I don't see what you are saying there is so much of... I do however see a bunch of what I perceive to be concern trolling. This is where someone has a objective with what they post, like censorship. If someone is personally attacking you, that's what rules are for and that would be what blocking and reporting can help you with. I agree that you should not be personally attacked for how you choose to live your life, but I also think that an idea is fair game for discussion, no matter what that idea may be.

       The problem IMO is conspiracy is subjective.  One person thinks the liberal media is the big conspiracy, another thinks the military industrial complex propped up by conservative politicians quest for endless war is the big conspiracy.

      <p>
       Both of these folks may agree completely that 9.11 was a fraud, but differ in the details of those behind the curtain.

       I can't speak to all the negativity on LGBT, or gays, I try to ignore it.  There will always be those frightened of anything different I guess.  Sorry you feel like you aren't welcome here, because you are.

      <p>
       It isn't helping that some Lilly commenter runs around here spewing nonsense about male brains being the problem with our society, I suspect merely to cause a disruption and derail discussions.  Muddy waters around here unfortunately.

       Here is one solid post
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is hatred scattered in random comments. It’s not just me, read the thread and you will see other people were experiencing it too. I’ve never gotten hate
       <em>
        directed
       </em>
       at me here, I’m mainly a lurker, and I don’t usually discuss my sexuality unless it’s relative to the convo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit there is more hatred to the Jewish people than there is to the LGBT community, but both are prevalent

       i remember when i was just starting to get into 9/11 truth and a troll attacked me and said i was a jew hating anti-semite
      </p>
      <p>
       i knew i didn't do anything to deserve that, so it was shocking to hear
      </p>
      <p>
       what this troll assumed was that i was looking at suspects, when in fact i was merely looking at evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       after i was done looking at evidence, then i started looking at suspects
      </p>
      <p>
       and thats when the trolls allegations against me started to finally make sense

       I wasn't calling you a shill or alluding to you being one. I'm just saying what a shill proved. One post out of
       <em>
        nine days worth of posts
       </em>
       hardly seems like something to be upset over. And to bring it up nine days after the fact? Your post could've gained more traction had you not stewed for nine days. I respect the point you're trying to make, but I think it's just one post among many that are clouding what a conspiracy sub could be.

       My understanding is that anti semitism is an emotional factor behind one of the most popular conspiracies - the new world order, one world government. I am new to learning about the history of this conspiracy but there is always some evil mastermind group behind the plot, and it's usually attributed to jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think conspiracy theorists are necessarily anti LGBT in that they usually advocate for less government restrictions and general social tolerance. But the recent alt right movement is nostalgic for tradition including traditional gender roles. They're concerned about declining white birth rates and focused on white only families. So in that context there's some anxiety about LGBT whites hurting their race by not reproducing. Or they think LGBT people have fallen into the multicultural snowflake trend, which again gets somehow linked back to a Jewish plot.

       I think that

       to be the case - but the new generation of conspiracy theorists (Alex Jones era) have definitely bucked that trend.

       Captain Apollyon's comments are true. Fair enough people can't help being gay, but the 'LGBT' issues, and transgenderism particularly, seems heavily influenced by both propaganda
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       chemical pollutants. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to realise why you would want a male population who are passive with a low sex drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Jewish thing is difficult. I don't want to single out an entire ethnic group as being evil, and for the most part they aren't, but they did kind of start it by saying they were God's chosen people, and by starting the main source of monotheism which has murdered millions over the course of thousands of years. Additionally, over history from Rome to present day, they have shown themselves to infiltrate, subvert and profiteer off the destruction off of a host nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange how they've been kicked out of so many countries over the course of a thousand years. Yet its everyone else who has the proble, right?

       I believe it is all relative. In a conspiracy sub, i do not believe all this hate adds anything to a conversation
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if I walked into an anti LGBT hate group, that rhetoric is expected, and yes, I would defend their rights to say it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But people just mindlessly attacking people when it’s not appropriate, spewing hate just because, isn’t something I stand for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course people have the right to say what they want however it’s all about right time/place.

And yeah...discrimination is not even close to being “fake news”.

       Sorry to hear you lost everyone, that narrative is much too common and that’s why it’s dangerous to keep perpetuating hateful rhetoric and polarizing people based on their queerness.

       Is it a conspiracy that your account doesn’t have a lot of posts and you just happen to comment on a post that’s related to your interests? Like come on! Why would I make an alt account to do this

       I’m not a brainwashed CIA pawn pushing my agenda to persecute the masculine macho man. I will say to such men, you’ve run the world for a hot minute now and it’s not going so great, so sit down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you this why is "it not going so great" right now? You can look all you want externally but the answers really lie internally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to be a victim and but your perception of your world is your reality and only you have the power to change it. So why think of world or this sub or this "masculine macho man" as the Boogeyman out to get you?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all searching for the same thing love, peace, and unity. Why create this illusion of separation through your thoughts and actions? Your expectations will eventually become your reality if you believe long enough and have enough energy so why expect hated towards you? What you search for with your thoughts you will eventually find so instead expect and search for acceptance rather than having the "masculine macho man sit down".
      </p>
      <p>
       You can choose to see those extremely rare posts as the norm or you can choose to see it for what it is a single person who is misguided. Your choice of how you react to it internally will control how you see things externally. The choice is yours
