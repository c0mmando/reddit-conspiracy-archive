        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello everyone.</p>

<p>I’d like to share my current theory on the recent news of UFO disclosure. It’s a long one, so grab a beer/bowl, kick back, and please feel free to share your ideas or argue my points.</p>

<p>I believe that the reason we are finally seeing UFO disclosure after all of these decades is because TPTB can no longer hide their super advanced technology. </p>

<p>There has been more pressure on governments now than ever before to reduce emissions, and to pursue a greener future. What if I told you that the last 3 decades could have been ecofriendly and emission free? </p>

<p>It’s also pretty convenient that right as China announces that they will be trading oil in Yuan, and the value of the petrodollar is threatened, that we get this bombshell disclosure. </p>

<p>I believe that world governments have had zero-point, anti-gravity, fully ecofriendly technology that does not hurt our environment for the last 3+ decades. Why haven’t we used it you ask? Well that’s simple my friends, for the same reason all other vile things happen in this world: money. </p>

<p>If you had a self-sustaining generator in your house that was capable of powering your home and charging all of your vehicles without the use of fossil fuels or electricity, who would benefit from it? Whose wallets would swell thick with cash if you were capable of fully sustaining your energy needs in your own garage? </p>

<p>I believe that we have passed the need for our industrial age technology. We’ve reached a point as a society where our energy needs have outpaced the availability of fossil fuels and electricity. I know it, you know it, TPTB know it. That’s why I think they are using UFO disclosure to slowly trickle out this super advanced technology. </p>

<p>Why use UFOs? Well that’s because of the fact that; if a civilization is capable of traversing the vast emptiness that is space, they must have this zero-point/anti-gravity technology, right? Only a civilization capable of reaching faster than light speeds are able to do this, right? Wrong. I believe humans have been capable of this since the 1980s, at the least. Now, I won’t argue where the knowledge or technology came from, we can save that for a different discussion. </p>

<p>How angry would people be if they found out that they’ve been forced to spend outrageous amounts of money on gas and electricity, while simultaneously polluting the environment? I would be furious if I found out that I’ve paid probably close to 50k on gasoline in my life, when I could’ve paid nothing and charged my vehicle for free from home, or even had a vehicle that did not need any kind of fuel. 
I would be furious if I found out that I’ve been paying electric companies $300-400 a month for the last decade for a resource that I do not even need to use. </p>

<p>The bottom line is, we’ve been fooled for a very long time. Governments have been using and developing this technology for a very, very long time, and I don’t think they can hide it anymore. </p>

<p>I believe they are using UFO disclosure to slowly introduce this technology to the public. There are two ways that they could do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A fake UFO crash will happen sometime soon. From it, they will recover “alien” technology that is so far advanced that they cannot explain what it is. From it, in the next few years, they will reverse engineer zero-point/anti-gravity technology, and make it commercially available. It might not be on a consumer basis quite yet, but I could see it finding it’s way into military vehicles pretty quickly. They’ve been using it for so long in secret, I bet they’d love to be able to use it and not have to hide it. </p></li>
<li><p>We receive disclosure about a crash that has happened in the past, where advanced technology was recovered but was not able to be back engineered due to the complexity/cost to create, until now. Then slowly we will be blasted with articles and news reports about this new wave of crazy advanced technology. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I like to think that we will get alien disclosure soon after, seeing as private aerospace companies are making their way to space and eventually Mars. I personally believe there are aliens on the moon, and on Mars, we are just not allowed to know about it. Eventually though, private space companies will send their own people to the moon and to Mars, and at that point we will be passed the point of no return. </p>

<p>I believe full disclosure is coming soon my friends, but not for any noble reason. It’ll simply be to make TPTB more money is all. </p>

<p>Edit: Spelling. </p>

Hi.
You tell me! what an intellectual species would or could want from a primitive species that puts itself as the model of all life? Why do you think that an alien smart enough to get here would allow only governments of the world to know they excess? This alien idea is a money industry for cons. A species smart enough to get here would not have their mode of transport break down like an old American car. The world of aliens is always a fuzzy picture story with nothing but innuendos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I agree, no way would a ship just randomly crash on Earth. That’s why I said they’d fake it. Either one would just randomly drop, or it would be shot down. </p>

<p>I personally think we are currently a part of the Zoo model. We are nothing more than subjects of observation or experimentation. </p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be easier for them to observe us if we didn’t know they were there?</p>

Hi.
The problem I have with that train of thought is you put too much importance on the specie&#39;s value to some other intelligence that could replicate use in plain sight. We have nothing to offer and if we did they could take it but even that would mean an aggressive nature but aggression lessons with technology. I think mysterious are entertaining and see how it can overtake a logical mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never mentioned anything about aggression. We can observe a primate in captivity without hurting it. </p>

<p>Who’s to say that aliens are anything like us at all? We could be as different to them as we are from dogs. Would you not be interested in observing a species of sentient dog? </p>

<p>Who knows, maybe there’s some sort of prime directive that inhibits them from direct intervention, so all they can do is observe. </p>

Hi.
You put too much human thought in your scenario. We are thinking like the primitive species we are. Humans have nothing to offer but violence,greed, and intolerance. Now what intelligent species would want that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think OP is not insinuating that we are somehow worthy of them coming here because of any assumed human greatness.  </p>

<p>I think it’s not too farfetched to believe that other living species in this universe would benefit from observing other living civilizations, noting where they are and noting how far along they are in their technological advancements.  Perhaps not just for “observe” but possibly also for “report”.  I don’t think it would be to gain anything but information about who and where we are as a species, then they probably fuck off and leave us alone.  Perhaps for mapping purposes?  But you questioning why we would ever get ahold of their technology is very much justified.  I still wonder why they would ever do such a thing if they have done so.  It doesn’t add up.  </p>

<p>That’s like us looking at monkeys, observing them, and then handing them Tesla Coils, AK-47s and an automobile.  Giving them such things would be ridiculous because not only would it take them forever to even make them work, but it would be ridiculously dangerous if they ever did figure out how to use them because they don’t understand them.  </p>

<p>If we have ANY alien technology, I’d say it would have had to have crashed here somehow.  But that’s just my theory on it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, bot guy is misconstruing my argument. I never said this technology was alien. I believe humans developed on our own. </p>

<p>Through media, movies, and other forms of conditioning, we are lead to believe that this technology is strictly alien. Because if we found out we actually had it and it was being kept hidden, the masses would be furious. </p>

<p>So they will use UFO disclosure to justify introducing this technology to the masses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve thought about that extensively.  Because like I said, a crashed space craft would be the only reason we would have it unless we created it ourselves.  I just can’t believe an alien species would ever give us any technology.  Unless they did it as some sort of sick experiment to see what our dumb asses do with it.  </p>

<p>I am on your page because I still think there is much more to what happened to Nikola Tesla and so many other great scientists who were seemingly controlled by government/big investors.  And that’s just scratching the surface.  There has to be advancements that we, the people are in the dark about.  Wether those advancements are the kind of technologies we are talking about is still up in the air to me, however.  </p>

Hi.
I do that to draw human minds like yours who sees man created grammar as the right words to  justify his male cultural mind forming. The easiest thing is to write man garmmer like your mind of others wants. Do you think your alien frinds will only connect to humans who speak proper man created gammer?

It has a lot to do with it and how a human mind is drawn to certain thoughts. What a human studies has nothing to do with what an alien knowes or wants to know... don&#39;t project ..

    <div class="md"><p>Some I think they&#39;ll hold onto for another reason than just money. (Which could be argued to be legit, even though it does fall into the power aspect which goes along with money.) Basically if you develop a line of tech that makes mass-energy conversion possible (particularly on an energy output scale that can affect gravity), then there may be some very inherent dangers that go with that technology. Looking at the surface it&#39;s like this wonderful clean power source. But knowing human nature since we&#39;ve been able to tie rocks and sticks together, you know the weaponization aspect will still come into play. Somebody might see a way to tweak some values here and there, or alter a component out of the original specifications... And you have a thing that makes Hiroshima look like a firecracker in comparison.</p>

<p>And given all the critical development with something such as nuclear technology, and all the problems with proliferation once that cat got out of the bag. If there&#39;s something better out there, they&#39;re going to do everything in their power to not let that scenario play out again. One of the strategic points of keeping hold of a wildcard like that is you don&#39;t play it unless you absolutely need to.</p>

<p>So yeah I don&#39;t discount the positive aspects that may exist. But if it can also make a better bomb (or something to that regard), it&#39;s also going to be yet another reason why the public will never see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a really good point actually. I guess I was giving humanity the benefit of the doubt, but I hoped this technology would only be used to benefit mankind. </p>

<p>I see your point, and yes, we’d defiantly stretch it as far as we can, including weapons. Plus, the idea of a gravity bomb is terrifying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, just spin it that if Russia had gotten this technology 30 years ago that we&#39;d all be speaking Russian now, but now the US military is advanced enough that we don&#39;t have to worry about that threat anymore. Here you go America, no more electric bills ever again, thank you and you&#39;re welcome.</p>

<p>If they really have some fancy non-toxic/non-explosive/etc. energy source that can solve all our energy needs for the low low price of whatever it costs to stick a brick in the garage, then hey, I&#39;ll take it!</p>

<p>Oh, that gives me another way they could spin it - &quot;If we had released this 30 years ago, it would have been so expensive that only a few people would have been able to have this stuff. By taking our time, we were able to develop the technology to the point that these devices are small and cheap enough that everyone can have one.&quot; You know how large computers were in the 80&#39;s, right? Now something tons faster you can stick in your pocket. Thus, that would be a plausible excuse.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be angry, I&#39;d just be glad that they ever decided to make this stuff available! If all they need is an excuse so they can release it without getting lynched by an angry mob, I&#39;ll help them come up with one!</p>

<p>However... if that existed it would make me worried about what <em>other</em> technology the government has that we don&#39;t know about. Are they going to manipulate our thoughts and turn us into remote-controlled robots who can&#39;t control our own movements?? Scary stuff.</p>

<p>As to the UFO stuff - I dunno, we could ask the whales if they saw anything unusual. I&#39;d think at least the blue whales would be able to comprehend complex stuff like that, since their brains weigh more than we do. If we learned their language we could talk with them about it. They might be pissed at us for all the hunting we&#39;ve done over the years and not want to talk, but I think if we stop that they might come around eventually.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It’s also pretty convenient that right as China announces that they will be trading oil in Yuan, and the value of the petrodollar is threatened, that we get this bombshell disclosure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting theory, but the Yuan is not ready for prime time as a reserve currency.  Between the lack of transparency in the Chinese economy, exchange rate manipulation and the nature of the Chinese government, nobody is seriously interested in using the Yuan as a reserve currency.</p>

<p>I think it would be virtually impossible to reverse engineer an alien technology as advanced as some kind of saucer tech.  Imagine in 1948 trying to reverse engineer a current-day (2018) Chinese smartphone with people who didn&#39;t speak Chinese, especially if you only had one copy.  You wouldn&#39;t even know how to charge it and the circuit board would be 3-4 giant ICs.  I doubt we&#39;d even have the tools (O-scopes, logic probes, etc) to analyze it for another 20-30 years, let alone reproduce it.</p>

<p>Now think of what it would be like with an energy source which defies our understanding of physics.  Even a thermodynamic analysis wouldn&#39;t make sense, let alone explaining the operation of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no, I get that. My primary argument however is that we created this technology ourselves a long time ago. </p>

<p>In an attempt for TPTB to avoid a large scale lynch mob, they will say this technology came from a UFO. </p>

<p>I don’t actually believe that it came from a UFO for the exact reasons that you stated. I’m more so a believer that inventors such as Nikola Tesla invented and tested these concepts as early as 1900, but it was suppressed by the growing eclectic industry. </p>

<p>Plus, it’s also interesting that there have been a lot of very recent news articles about Tesla and his inventions. Do a quick google search and you’ll see several articles as recent as a day ago. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fiction, but it tackles the idea there is a government office tasked with identifying disruptive technologies and hiding or crippling them to prevent disruptive social change.  It was a pretty entertaining read.</p>

<p>My problem with that idea is that it seems like it would be tough to keep those genies in the bottle.  The US is embroiled in all kinds of global conflicts which regardless of how you skew their &quot;true&quot; purpose would be a lot less hassle if they could be solved.</p>
