    <div class="md"><p>If your grandfather isn&#39;t around to ask about Freemasonry (the best way to learn more about it.) , I suggest you pose your question over at <a href="/r/freemasonry">/r/freemasonry</a> there are a lot of active and knowledgeable members of the Masonic Fraternity there.</p>

<p>Freemasons are as diverse as the population their lodge resides in. <em>Freemasonry</em> is a little easier to define. Freemasonry is essentially one of the oldest systems of self improvement, and focuses on morals and ethics as well as improving yourself through study of liberal arts and sciences, and lastly it gives a man food for thought about how to make the most of his time on Earth.</p>

<p>It also happens to be a worldwide group of people with a deep and rich history, which while incredibly interesting to members, tends to fall short of the tall tales and conspiracy theories that have surrounded it for 300 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is essentially true, though it neglects to recognize that there have always been varying sizes of subsections of members who have conspired in secret to achieve a designated goal or to keep a specific truth from becoming public knowledge. Not all of those are necessarily nefarious conspiracies, but some certainly were.</p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be anything like a grand Masonic conspiracy against the rest of us, from what I can discern, and most Masons will think they&#39;re simply part of a club for comradery, but a psychopathic subsection of members may well have such &quot;evil&quot; plans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an endlessly interesting topic. On the one hand, a conservative 80% of Freemasons don&#39;t seem to be at all aware of the power their club really holds. Another large part probably is aware but considers their work important and beneficial for the world. And the top of the proverbial pyramid appears to have utterly nefarious and &quot;magical&quot; intentions of one kind or another (by all likelihood still considering themselves to be the good guys who clean the world from suffering (by practically killing those who suffer)).</p>

<p>The hidden (or not so hidden) symbology in state architecture is a mystery in itself. Is it included as a dog whistle that is only understood by those who know its meaning? Are there multiple levels of meaning? Are they actually &quot;magical&quot; artifacts meant to bless the buildings with success of some kind? How I wish I could get all my questions answered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. It seems to me that the structure of the organization is designed and functions as a catalyst for personal growth, and the vast majority of members utilize it as just that, without any &quot;evil&quot; notions whatsoever. It can also function as a platform for deliberate cooperation, both overtly but also in secret, as it brings some of the most intelligent, well-connected, and powerful individuals together to exchange ideas, goals, and worldviews.</p>

<p>Some goals may seem &quot;noble&quot; to intelligent sociopaths, but evil/satanic to the general public, and the lodges may offer just enough protection and secrecy for those individuals to conspire towards achieving those goals (depopulation, upward money distribution, educational corruption, the list is endless).</p>

<p>Freemasonry is not the cause of these issues, but it can be a facilitating factor, in my view. Would you agree?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What this person says is the propaganda they use to lure you in.  It is the exoteric (public) side of Freemasonry.  The esoteric (hidden) side of Freemasonry is much darker.   They worship Lucifer, but you are not told that until you rise to a certain level.  By then, you have already taken certain oaths.   It is like a pig-in-a-poke.  </p>

<p>Oh, if you are Christian, you should consider this.  In one ritual you will do, you will be asked to spit on the Christian cross.  If you do, then you will rise higher.  If you refuse, they will tell you that you made the right choice, but then you will not move any higher.   </p>

<p>Freemasons are Gnostics because they believe that the serpent (Lucifer) in the Adam and Eve story is the good god because he gave humans knowledge.  The other god is the bad one because he lied to humans about having knowledge.  </p>

<p>One thing you should know is that Freemasons are free to lie to non-Freemasons, so expect this if you decide to ask them.   </p>

<p>As for your Grandfather, you should see what degree he rose to.  That will tell you how far in he was.   </p>

My point was that its frustrating how many non members claim to know more than active members, I promise you all, you&#39;d be very disappointed... unless your idea of a conspiracy is dusty old manuscripts and piecing together how Free Masonry originally started, because that&#39;s about as controversial as it gets.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve got this down to a science, via ritual and peer pressure and the dolloping out of knowledge piece by piece. I am not quite up for making the commitment or vow, because it does feel like it COULD BE (not saying it is) a deal with the devil. </p>

<p>What would you call that art then?   I am genuinely curious...  </p>

<p>It looks Masonic to me because of the two columns.   We all know about the pyramid because it is on our currency.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In masonry we do talk about the biblical columns that stood outside of Solomons temple. We use Solomons temple as an allegory to build or improve one&#39;s self. </p>

<p>As for the art here&#39;s the artists point of view:
The 1997 work is called &quot;Vox Populi,&quot; which is Latin for &quot;the voice of the people.&quot; The hand with the raised index finger represents deliberation, argument, the gesticulation of a speaker giving his or her opinion. The hand with an open palm represents the act of voting or taking an oath.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible there&#39;s more to it than that, most art has layers of symbolism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have read that Solomon&#39;s Temple was not an actual temple.  It is all allegory.  </p>

<p>Interesting.  I will look up Vox Populi.  It is interesting to have that there since the voice of the people was ignored when establishing the Federal Reserve, IRS, and Federal Income tax.  </p>

<p>You are right.  There are always at least two meanings- one for the initiated and one for the profane.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understood.  I expected such a response.  </p>

<p>So, your position is that one cannot truly know unless they join and take a death oath.  Fair enough.  </p>

<p>Freemasonry is not a secret society or a society with secrets.  It has all been revealed to the &quot;profane&quot;.  </p>

<p>Freemasonry is now a society that keeps secret the crimes and degeneracy of its members.  You know it is true.  Like you said, straight from the tap...  </p>

Its absolutely a society with secrets, they just are far more tame than you would prefer to imagine. If someone commits a crime they get kicked out.

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of criminals in Freemasonry.  They commit crimes all the time, and they are not kicked out, especially if it furthers the NWO agenda.   You are a NWO globalist, right?   A Bolshevik...  </p>

<p>Why would such a society have secrets?  The only reason to have secrets is to hide crimes and hide an agenda.  Maybe it is to prevent accountability, too.   </p>

<p>If Freemasons want to help humanity, then they need no secrets.  They would just help.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah not a fan of the kids thing.  bit of a showstopper.  but it&#39;s a bit more complicated than people think.  we&#39;re in a sim.  there are competing groups - and this is what they do.  we really don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.  it&#39;s total incomplete knowledge of the larger picture, which is why i like to focus on the things around me and being good to them and trying to be responsible and sustainable.  the rest is a kind of craziness.  and to reiterate not a fan of harming others.  it just doesn&#39;t seem like the best way to do things.  but again, i have incomplete knowledge and i can&#39;t say for sure.  guessing from the infinitudes of things i&#39;d say it&#39;s better to be nice, and to be proactive in educating others.  bad people will do bad things, and it&#39;s ok to protect yourself from that.  and bad people will conspire to do bad things, and it&#39;s probably ok to be aware of these plans and to plan around them.  it&#39;s not as simple and monolithic i don&#39;t imagine as people think, particularly when the whole sim thing problem is added on top (and how many layers that goes for who knows).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It should also ring alarm bells when things are &quot;secret&quot;.
It just sounds like a way to infiltrate governments.
If the top people of a group are benevolent, they wouldn&#39;t be
holding important secrets from humanity.</p>

<p>I like this JFK quote:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/AqaoESW.png">https://i.imgur.com/AqaoESW.png</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s a claim that freemasonry was benevolent knowledge and then
the Luciferian idiots hijacked it to prevent us finding the truth....not sure I believe this claim though. 
Maybe there&#39;s a satanic strain or something alongside the &quot;legit&quot; one, supposedly.</p>

<p>Or it could just ALL be satanic shit at the highest levels, maybe excluding some lodges
with normal decent people who didn&#39;t get the satanic memo, somehow.
I don&#39;t know how it works but if there&#39;s secrecy involved, I&#39;m not buying it.</p>

<p>There seems to be links between freemasonry and Babylon, ancient Egypt, knights of Templar,
satanic zionists/satanic Jews (rather than normal Jews?) and satanic catholics (rather than proper Christians).</p>

<p>I need to do much more research though and see what the hell this is all about.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the deceptive freemasons (or satanic variety or whatever)
give double or triple meanings to symbols so people second guess wrong.
E.g. G in the freemason logo could mean god, geometrical creator, generation, etc. -_-</p>

<p>I find it strange that a group that supposedly is not a religion,
heavily involves religious stuff, and the freemason claim of &quot;trying to be a moral individual&quot; blah blah
is contrasted with the fact that a lot of freemasons are literally Satanic/Luciferian scum.
Was the group infiltrated or was it a deceptive tradition all along?</p>

<p>The waters are heavily muddied, but to what extent I can&#39;t say.
There must be many half truths in there.</p>

And now you say some guys in their books say something and because it agrees with the rubbish you hold in your head to be true it must be. That&#39;s not how the world works.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t expect you to get that because you&#39;re wrapped up in it. I&#39;m not suggesting something&#39;s wrong with you; anyone is vulnerable to it. I&#39;m saying that I can&#39;t convince you you&#39;re wrong because you&#39;ve already convinced yourself you <em>can&#39;t</em> be wrong.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how conspiracy theory nonsense works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you didnt look at anything, why say something about it?
You labeled me ignorant for reading conspiracies the same way someone would label black people as thugs or white people as supremacist.</p>

<p>You chose not to present facts but attack on the basis of a type of speech. Narrowing down singular points of non truths you cannot argue against without providing zero context of the idea. You are this and that and proving negation is impossible. Of course it is if you find a fact and back it with truth. But that&#39;s too hard, you would actually have to argue points, positions and evidence, knowing you may lack them, you lash out in personal attacks and insults.</p>

<p>I hope that your accusatory stance is met in public with truth and breaks down that wall of ignorance. Until then, good day to you sir.</p>

<p>When you&#39;ve spent decades studying the occult, it&#39;s complex.</p>

<p>But I wouldn&#39;t loose any sleep over it. Most initiates just attend dinners and look out for eachother.
It&#39;s only the higher ups who are involved in some serious shenanigans.</p>

<p>Hitler wanted Freemasons out of the country as much as he wanted zionist Jews to leave.

    <div class="md"><p>It should also ring alarm bells when things are &quot;secret&quot;.
It just sounds like a way to infiltrate governments.
If the top people of a group are benevolent, they wouldn&#39;t be
holding important secrets from humanity.</p>

<p>I like this JFK quote:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/AqaoESW.png">https://i.imgur.com/AqaoESW.png</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s a claim that freemasonry was benevolent knowledge and then
the Luciferian idiots hijacked it to prevent us finding the truth....not sure I believe this claim though. 
Maybe there&#39;s a satanic strain or something alongside the &quot;legit&quot; one, supposedly.</p>

<p>Or it could just ALL be satanic shit at the highest levels, maybe excluding some lodges
with normal decent people who didn&#39;t get the satanic memo, somehow.
I don&#39;t know how it works but if there&#39;s secrecy involved, I&#39;m not buying it.</p>

<p>There seems to be links between freemasonry and Babylon, ancient Egypt, knights of Templar,
satanic zionists/satanic Jews (rather than normal Jews?) and satanic catholics (rather than proper Christians).</p>

<p>I need to do much more research though and see what the hell this is all about.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the deceptive freemasons (or satanic variety or whatever)
give double or triple meanings to symbols so people second guess wrong.
E.g. G in the freemason logo could mean god, geometrical creator, generation, etc. -_-</p>

<p>I find it strange that a group that supposedly is not a religion,
heavily involves religious stuff, and the freemason claim of &quot;trying to be a moral individual&quot; blah blah
is contrasted with the fact that a lot of freemasons are literally Satanic/Luciferian scum.
Was the group infiltrated or was it a deceptive tradition all along?</p>

<p>The waters are heavily muddied, but to what extent I can&#39;t say.
There must be many half truths in there.</p>
