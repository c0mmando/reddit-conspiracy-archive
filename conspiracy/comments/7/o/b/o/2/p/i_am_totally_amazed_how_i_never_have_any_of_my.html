       This sub is constantly under fire from "shills". Some come as wolves in sheeps clothing. Why is there so much support for the use of marijuana here? Do people really think that our society needs to all get high? I know people are going to make their own decisions, and I respect and honor that. Ie: decriminalization is fine with me, but lets be honest: marijuana is not the answer the problems of society. Do not fall for the trap.

       Some people, whom I know personally in Illinois, do use this stuff for medicine. I am a huge advocate for this because my mom and my step dad died from prescription painkiller overdoses. If they had medical marijuana I know for a fact they would still be alive today. It may not be the best thing to do all of the time, but as far as medical applications, it outweighs prescription painkillers by far. Plus alot of people in here are usually for individual rights. So it kind of falls hand in hand with advocation.

       The legality isn't my concern. It's the fervor in which it's being peddled to the masses. Claims that it cures cancer and other dumb shit that gets voted to the moon.

       Except that those things were being talked about way before any partial legalization took place.  And its pretty much scientific fact that cannabis oil can help with symptoms.  No one says it cures cancer.  You're gonna have a bad time here if you dont come correct with facts.

       It isn't about getting high. Marijuana has lots of medical uses. It is easy and cheap to grow, which big business\pharma doesn't like. Alcohol and tobacco are far worse.

       I use it every day (low dose infused coconut oil) for anxiety and pain relief. Works great and I'm not high from it.

       Right. The counter-culture that Nixon worked so hard to supress because they were all marijuana users (hippies and African Americans) was because they were too easy to keep programmed.

       Firstly, marijuana is a Mexican tobacco and has nothing to do with cannabis. This was part of the smear campaign in the 30s to associate the plant with Mexican immigrants etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cannabis should be legal nationwide and there isn't one single cogent argument to the contrary.

       I'm not attacking legalization. I'm attacking the way it is being peddled as a benign wonder drug that guarantees success. Do you have kids? Are you excited for them to start using marijuana at age 12 because they've only heard good things about it? I don't see anything being presented about the dangers of drug use.

       Also this forum is not peddled at 12 year olds so not sure where you are drawing this from. The reason I made a comment on legalization was because you said you were for 'decriminalization' which is a stupid way of saying it should still be illegal but no one get punished for it.

       You didn't answer. Are you a parent and are you advocating the use of marijuana to your children? Society is not just this subreddit. Society as a whole has a moral issue.

      <p>
       Decriminalized, legalized, I don't care. There needs to be education that shows the real world, rather than the corporate shilling of the positives of marijuana only. Today we either have the goons who think marijuana cures cancer, or the goons that suck pharmas dick to make claims against mj. Everything is driven by money.

       It should be legal and regulated like any other substance and that includes an age limit. It is very simple.

       So wait you're advocating that it be regulated like everything else, right? So it should have like Surgeon General warnings and things like that that would potentially stop people from wanting to use it, right? Because that's not how marijuana is currently being presented it's being presented as it been nine drug that only has positive effects.

       Yes I'm fine with a surgeon general's warning, it wouldn't contain much. Bronchitis being the basically the worst thing that can happen and only for people who smoke ungodly amounts. It has never been linked to cancer in any medical journal in history. It really is rather benign when compared with any other controlled substance on the planet.

       Yes slang would be fitting since it is an actual descriptor. Marijuana is not weed it is tobacco.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes Cannabis has never been linked to cancer
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       despite the carcinogenic effects of smoke. If it had a link to cancer you better believe the federal government would be shoving this down our collective throats as proof of the dangers of the Devil's Lettuce but it hasn't and never will.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to worry about society collapsing from chronic buds I assure you. You are just reciting the same nonsense from the 30s that made it illegal. You strike me as someone who hasn't ever tried the plant before.

       As someone who lives in a state that has legalized recreational use, I can tell you that it is not producing anything of value. Don't use the "tax revenue" argument either, because the taxes collected are not earmarked for anything in particular and are just being funneled to the cronies that made the legal dabs happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       A place I visit often, Colorado springs, used to be such a wonderful place. Now it is a homeless mecca and littered with head shops and corporate weed stores. I'm not exaggerating either, the place is a shit hole of bong stores. I'm all for the occasional bong store, but with the explosion of the industry, everyone wants to get their piece. Society needs more than just weed stores.

No I don't act like there's not commercials for alcohol on every show that hasn't even been brought up in this conversation so you don't know what I think about that what I do know is that marijuana is currently being pedal to the high rate as a benign drug and a wonder drug at that it clears cancer!

       I am not a user but I don't oppose legalization. I guess I see it the same way I see alcohol: A recreational drug with abuse potential that has to be used responsibly. However, I am curious, can you please post some evidence of the link between use and success?

       I didn't say anything about legalization. I'm just concerned that marijuana is being peddled as a completely benign wonder drug. There are posts on The Daily claiming that marijuana cures cancer making it to the front page of this subreddit. That doesn't even make any fucking sense. It is like alcohol, and doesn't necessarily 100% impede your ability to succeed. But it's going to definitely be a major roadblock for people who don't have that extra bit of determination. I know people who run businesses that are afflicted with all sorts of disorders using drugs and everything else. But they are definitely the outliers.

       There are functioning crackheads too. There are outliers. My problem is that marijuana is being peddled is so benign that it's going to get so many people involved with it, that can't deal with life like you and I do. I could go and probably do mushrooms every fucking day and still be a success but that's not going to be the case for most people.

       I have a question op, do you live in a state that has legalized recreational use? If so, next time you happen to be around a shop, people watch who goes in and out of a dispensary.  I do this every time I go to one and I am always taken back at some of the types of people that purchase marijuana.

       You are 100% correct. And I speak from personal experience. It absolutely is part of the control system, and not ironically one of it's hooks is that it 'frees' your mind. It does change your perspective, but blinds you from the fact that the regular user is has become even more controlled than before they partook. I also am 100% convinced that specific Media content is designed to work in concert with the altered state of the regular user. I would say this reality pertains to all drugs, whether legal or illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana does have legitimate medical uses, but so do many other natural plants. And for the record I don't believe ANY substance should be illegal to consume. What a person puts into their body is their own damn business and right. By making a substance illegal you actually create a criminal underclass (see: Prohibition and the Mob) and thus connect this community with the real criminal underworld of; murder for hire, organized crime, human trafficking(slavery, underage prostitution), child pornography, snuff films, etc.

       Cbd has been show to help quite a bit with cancer and other illnesses. Because of the classification of the substance, the medical community is held back  more so then they are with other chemicals. Having a relative with Parkinson’s for the better part of my life, I’ve seen first hand what the benefits of marijuana can do to better a persons functionality. Night and day. The conspiracy isnt of the subculture indulging, but big pharma knowing you, I and everyone else can grow a plant in our back yard and take away a large portion of their profits.
      </p>

       Yes, like anything else in life, one can over do it. But with so many legal substances that are detrimental, it’s childish and foolish in this day and age to allow this probation to continue.

       Actually I have no doubt of Marijuana's health benefits. But there are MANY plants that have healing properties. They are using the health benefits of Marijuana as the hook to draw in the wary. Marijuana is a trap. And a devious one at that.

       It does. I'm not going to claim it doesn't. Your friend is an outlier. The cold reality is that mj use is not going to make the man like it is being peddled. Your friend could probably shoot heroin everyday and have the same success. Determination can overcome.

       So you think heroin and pot are similar? I'm guessing you have very little experience with MJ? I dont think you realise how many VERY successful people smoke pot. Lazy people will be lazy with or without pot, hard working motivated people will be successful with or without it. Being high just makes it easier to accept being lazy.

       Don’t agree at all. There are plenty of extremely successful people who are notorious stoners. Obviously there are people who get high and are just lazy bums but that has more to do with the person than it has to do with pot. Marijuana also has a lot of medical potential. I personally use CBD oil and smoke in order to treat my colitis and I’d never go back to using traditional medications. I’m in college and marijuana allows me to live a normal life and if anything allows me to live a better and more productive life because of it. Also have a friend who’s younger sister uses CBD oil for seizures and it’s changed their life too. People can abuse anything and there are concerns with every drug but comparatively Marijuana’s dangers are minimal. I just believe there are way more serious threats to people’s lives than marijuana.

       I blaze every day and I know for a fact I would have achieved a lot more by now had I not. Absolutely makes me apathetic and lazy. I love who I am, but I know I’m in a hole because I love to stimulate my reward centres. I’m not freeing my mind or getting spiritual, I just like how it feels.

      <p>
       Funny how the overwhelming response here is anecdotes of some millionaire you know who blazes daily. That’s hardly scientific. think of how many poor and demotivated individuals you know in your life who blaze vs success stories who blaze. Overall, I smoked myself retarded... i know this. I wish I hadn’t, but I guess I like myself more when I’m a retard than when I was a judgemental asshole.

       It's all dependent upon the individual.

       I have a friend who is a regular smoker and owns everything he wants, and much much more. He's just a determined individual and doesn't get lost in the amazement of being high ... which is ridiculous anyways.

       It's all to do with what you want in life and how you're willing to tackle your problems and what you're willing to do to get where you want to be.

       And all the deaths from alcohol and opiates are to be ignored? Somebody is shilling for the alcohol and tobacco lobby here. They offer no evidence aside from the anecdotal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignore Colorado and the benefits of medicinal cannabis as well as the effects legalisation have had on the communities that benefited from legalisation.

       You didn't answer. Are you a parent and are you advocating the use of marijuana to your children? Society is not just this subreddit. Society as a whole has a moral issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Decriminalized, legalized, I don't care. There needs to be education that shows the real world, rather than the corporate shilling of the positives of marijuana only. Today we either have the goons who think marijuana cures cancer, or the goons that suck pharmas dick to make claims against mj. Everything is driven by money.
