       It’s less cushy than you’d think.   In fact, most positions aren’t paid.   It’s like a life long internship that MAYBE you’ll get a job with, if they absolutely need you.   They’re just happy to have a dupe on retainer that thinks they’re part of club at no cost.    Basically, they just make sure you don’t go hungry.

       I mean, you want a clearance? Work for the government and get a clearance. There's nothing stopping you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you end up with your clearance, however, you'll notice that it doesn't put you in another "tier" of citizenship.

       Anecdote:
      </p>
      <p>
       years ago a company i worked for had me mentoring new hires for a phone support position.  i worked with one kid who wasnt cutting it, gave my opinion at the end of his 2wk 'trial' period, and he wasnt hired on.
      </p>
      <p>
       a year or so later an FBI agent showed up at the office and asked to talk to me.  he was doing the background check for this kid (who I barely remembered) who was going through the hiring process for some gov't job - he wouldnt say what.  he asked a bunch of questions, took some notes, shook my hand and left.
      </p>
      <p>
       i really wanted to tell the agent they should up their standards there.   and i get that  being a phone monkey at a call center isnt an exciting job, but he was like 20 at the time and we paid pretty well with no real requirements other than not being a dumbass.
      </p>
      <p>
       so yeah, i dont know if he got hired but he made it far enough to get the background check so they'll probably take any schmuck who wants it

       This is not what Shipp says in the video. He is citing
       <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/">
        this series of articles in the Washington Post
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Washington Post says: "Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's very different from "owns and controls 1,931 large private corporations including Google". Shipp does not claim that in the video, as far as I could tell. Also, it's 10,000 locations where top-secret work is done, not "10,000 secret government sites set up since the Twin Towers demolition".
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1,271 government organizations are
       <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/methodology/">
        sub-units of about 45 agencies.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/gov-orgs/">
        45 government agencies are:

       Also, Shipp has never claimed to have been deputy director, as far as I can tell. His
       <a href="http://www.aim.org/benghazi/members-of-the-ccb/kevin-shipp-former-cia-officer/">
        bio on aim.org
       </a>
       says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Kevin Shipp, a former CIA Officer and Antiterrorism expert, held several high level positions in the CIA.   He was assigned as a protective agent for the Director of Central Intelligence, a counterintelligence investigator, a Counter Terrorism Center officer, a team leader protecting sensitive CIA assets from assassination, a manager of high-risk protective operations, a lead instructor for members of allied governments, an internal staff security investigator, and a polygraph examiner. He was tasked with protecting the CIA from foreign agent penetration and the chief of training for the CIA federal police force.  Mr. Shipp functioned as program manager for the Department of State, Diplomatic Security, and Anti Terrorism Assistance global police training program.  He is the recipient of two CIA Meritorious Unit Citations, three Exceptional Performance Awards and a Medallion for overseas covert operations.  He is the author of From the Company of Shadows–CIA Operations and the War on Terrorism.

       I’ve always wondered if police states are relatively uniform in size and expenditure throughout time, in relation to the size of the country and influence exerted.    If by studying thoroughly the Stasi or KGB we could come to a far better estimation of the size of our deep state, get an idea of their front organizations, and how they would likely conduct themselves in this day in age.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve also wondered if the ‘missing trillions’ were merely budgetary items that couldn’t be publicly claimed, presumably for clandestine operations domestic and abroad.

       I've argued with people online who say the give can't pull off conspiracies.

       I told them there are 854,000 people with top secret clearances, and three are many with it above that.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people aren't sitting around doing nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a hundred Facebook friends, it's likely one of these people is not who they say they are, or don't do for a living the thing you think they do. The spies and gov. agent types are everywhere.

       Anecdote:
      </p>
      <p>
       years ago a company i worked for had me mentoring new hires for a phone support position.  i worked with one kid who wasnt cutting it, gave my opinion at the end of his 2wk 'trial' period, and he wasnt hired on.
      </p>
      <p>
       a year or so later an FBI agent showed up at the office and asked to talk to me.  he was doing the background check for this kid (who I barely remembered) who was going through the hiring process for some gov't job - he wouldnt say what.  he asked a bunch of questions, took some notes, shook my hand and left.
      </p>
      <p>
       i really wanted to tell the agent they should up their standards there.   and i get that  being a phone monkey at a call center isnt an exciting job, but he was like 20 at the time and we paid pretty well with no real requirements other than not being a dumbass.
      </p>
      <p>
       so yeah, i dont know if he got hired but he made it far enough to get the background check so they'll probably take any schmuck who wants it

       Yeah it does. It would mean you'll thereby be privy to secret details that you are then unallowed to divulge to those uncleared.
