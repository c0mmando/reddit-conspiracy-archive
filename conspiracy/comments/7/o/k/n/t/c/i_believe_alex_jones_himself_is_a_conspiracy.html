    <div class="md"><p>That site is crazy. Crazy in the sense that it&#39;s mind blowing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m literally starting to believe Alex Jones is Bill Hicks. That&#39;s a lot of evidence in one place.</p>

<p>IF that actually is true and they are the same person, I wonder whether Hicks intentionally went into this or whether he was threatened and blackmailed into doing the Alex Jones persona. Or worse....is he perhaps a victim of some sort of MK-Ultra brainwashing? I shudder to think about this stuff honestly. If you know the shit they pull behind the veil, you&#39;d know that even something like this isn&#39;t too far-fetched to occur....</p>

<p>I tend to think that the Bill Hicks character was already a psyop. But they weren&#39;t getting the results they wanted that&#39;s why he/they created the Alex Jones character to serve as a limited hangout. </p>

<p>Actually, running into /redpill on reddit, I had to add a new definition to my repertoire of understandings about red/blue pill.  As it&#39;s quite different.</p>

<p>Anyway, there is a <strong>root</strong> idea.  The massive transformation of how one thinks/acts in the world, or the sinking back into old ways (ignorance)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used transformation of thoughts (therefore actions) because it&#39;s a more neutral way to see it if someone has some personal issue with the ideas behind the red pill as described in The Matrix, or any other more focused manifestation (politics or gender dynamics)</p>

<p>The fact is, the red pills im aware of (The Matrix and gender dynamics) make a ton of sense if you dont get emotional about it or fall into the traps laid by society to continue taking the easier to swallow, detrimental blue pill.  </p>

<p>r/redpill here on reddit is for instance, smeared by the misogyny card which is actually quite far from the truth.  They deal with negative influences (upset men) and shills in the form of misogyny but it would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater if the entire knowledge of the very eloquent and logical individuals that post there and have posted there.  It&#39;s like saying becase theres &quot;reptilian shape shifting politicians and celebrities&quot; posts here on conspiracy that we should dismiss the main premise and logic behind the best of our investigations.  </p>

<p>Obviously the above is kind of a plug for amy guys or girls who want to learn about complex gender dynamics beyond the politically correct institutionalized, usually feminized academic system.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree....kind of.  I ran into him when I was redpilling also.  Problem is I think he&#39;s kind of a red pill lite.  People are going to &quot;redpill&quot; weather the government likes it or not so why not have a controlled opposition?  Isn&#39;t his apology for pedo (pizza) gate suspect?  I was in the middle of that and not once did he really come out say the elites are raping and killing kids....yet he apologized for it anyways. So I do agree he is a step in the right direction I decided to go my own way in the end...the guy is just too suspect and I believe he&#39;s controlled opposition and a Freemason shill.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Khashoggi">Adnan Khashoggi</a> was a Saudi Arabian billionaire international businessman, best known for his involvement in arms dealing. He is estimated to have had a peak net worth of around US$4 billion in the early 1980s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average person would never suspect a rich Saudi of being involved with Israeli intelligence, let alone being a paid agent of Israel’s sophisticated (spy) terror organization, <strong>Mossad</strong>. But that’s exactly what Khashoggi is, according to at least one former Mossad case officer, Victor Ostrovsky, and two Jewish journalists, Dan Raviv and Yossi Melman. The Mossad has a term for people like Khashoggi—an Arabist, a Mossad field agent who poses as a Muslim. Aside from these three sources on Khashoggi and the Mossad, most of the available information linking Alex Jones and the 9/11 Truth movement leadership with Khashoggi (and the Mossad) has been compiled by investigative journalist <a href="https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/the-growing-complexity-of-alex-jones-israeli-connections/">Daniel Hopsicker.</a></p>

<p>From their base in Tampa Florida, Khashoggi and El Batrawi controlled <strong>a network of companies, all using the word “Genesis” in their name.</strong> The number of Khashoggi-owned Genesis companies we’ve found keeps growing. There is, or was, Genesis Aviation, Inc., Genesis Aviation II, Genesis Diversified Investments, Genesis Studio and Production Corp., Genesis Media Group, Genesis Properties, Genesis Intermedia; GenesisIntermedia.com.; Genesis Delaware; Genesis Florida… The list, it do go on. And on.”…</p>

<p>And then there’s the Genesis Communications Network. There’s actually two of them, seemingly unrelated, but they’re so extremely similar in the fraud department to each other and to “Saudi Genesis”</p>

<p><strong>The first GCN is a so-called “patriot” network hosting Alex Jones and Dave Van Kliest</strong></p>

<p><strong>The “Saudi Genesis” companies specialized in marketing to the masses, through infomercials and on the internet. Everything from Plastic Surgeons Crème to ab-energizers to fraudulent get rich quick schemes like “Trade Your Way to Riches,”  created after Ramy El-Batrawi of Genesis</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is a businessman, salesman, entertainer, and journalist.  He&#39;s simply combined all his talents into one &#39;pulpit&#39; that only the internet or radio could provide.  He&#39;s an evolution of Vince the Shamwow/Slap Chop guy.<br/>
His shtick is the Grove and Bilderberg videos that made him famous along with his brash personality, and using his showmanship he began satirizing the &#39;breaking news&#39; fake news structure that he witnessed on TV.  He is actually (in his design) a mirror (bizarro) image of CNN.  What AJ recognizes is that &#39;there is a war on for your mind&#39; and that the audience is largely incapable of filtering information, and is susceptible to &#39;first input&#39; and repetition.  So if CNN (et al) are going to throw every piece of spunsense (spun nonsense) and the kitchen sink at millions of viewers 24/7 in order to obfuscate truth, then his job is to do the same to block or refute and idea that they have your best interest in mind.<br/>
There&#39;s a reason he&#39;s not selling you guns, or manuals on how to make IEDs or weapons, or encouraging violence.  </p>

Bill Hicks, I mean Alex Jones is (99% certain)  a cia disinfonaut. I make this assertion because the content of his rantings and ravings is suspiciously latent with both real fringe shit we think has a good chance of being real, and lots more that&#39;s raw sewage and fear mongering. The purpose of this tactic is to smear shit on everything he talks about, drawing credibility away from those conversations, and further away from those they/we call the conspiracy theorists of thw world.
All while hawking overpriced schlock to the fringe communities that believe in taking care of your own health and that BignastyPharma is literally selling poison.
After all when the thoughtful and (strange word to use but It more or less applies:) Moral folk are being stripped of their schmeckles as much as possible that&#39;s serving them.

The actual choice of the use of the sauce is backseat to the symbol of the mcguffin.
Instead they ate that shit up like they somehow took it literally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you compare AJ from 2017 to AJ from like 2000, there is quite a bit of difference in the information he presents to his audience. He definitely sold out. He more than likely began receiving threats, and decided to take a deal and not talk about certain things anymore. Plus, he is probably the best (or worst depending on how you see it) fear monger I&#39;ve ever seen. </p>

<p>A few months ago, Jake Morphonios (EndTimesNewsReport) received a letter from an unknown source who offered him basically like a contract and &quot;funding&quot; aka hush money (he showed the letter on one of his videos), if he would stop investigating certain things, and only cover the topics the source approved of.</p>

<p>I really believe Jones did this. When you look into Jones&#39; past employees, who either were fired or left on their own volition, they all refer to the same reasons why they wouldn&#39;t cooperate with him. If you guys are interested, look into Melissa and Aaron from Truthstream Media, if you haven&#39;t already. They left Infowars on their own terms, and because of an NDA, they cannot disclose the details, but did dance around why they left. </p>

<p>My guess was because Jones wanted them to cover certain topics, but when they brought up their own, he didn&#39;t want to hear any of it (bc of his deal obviously), so they left and created their own YT channel, which is amazing btw. I&#39;d put my money on some of the content they create now is what Jones was unwilling to cover, but that&#39;s just purely me speculating.</p>

In case you don&#39;t know, Stefan Molyneux started out as a libertarian atheist philosophical debater but transitioned into a right-wing mouth piece. And Darkmatter is an outspoken atheist. </p>

<p>If you take note of the start of the video Darkmatter shows how Stefan Molyneux went further right-wing pro-christian conservative the more subs he got because they were his audience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s a kind of camouflage, perhaps. Increase the noise to signal ratio. One of the biggest arguments against any conspiracy is the element of coordination that is necessary to maintain the conspiracy. </p>

<p>A conspiracy of one is the easiest to maintain, whereas a conspiracy involving thousands is just not as likely. How do you keep thousands of people quiet about something, especially if it reaches national or international stature? </p>

<p>I.e. “Do you mean to tell me that the whole government, all air traffic controllers, first responders, the military, the airlines, etc. we’re all in on 911??? That’s impossible!”</p>

<p>The answer is partly to hide in plain sight by flooding the signal with noise. That way even if somebody leaks, you don’t have to have as tight a control over the message because you can dismiss anything that hits too close as ‘more Alex Jones conspiracy bullshit’.</p>

<p>That being said, I think AJ is just a guy who stumbled onto a way to monetize conspiracy theories. </p>

When Alex finally got some real air time he made a fool of himself and any of us that supported him.. they literally walked him off set because he went forward and attacked Morgan&#39;s character (witch was far off point of what he was getting at) it was very obvious go me then he is nothing more than a charismatic face and has no intention of anything more than playing his role.. also if you want some insight to him.. watch the Joe rogan podcast with him and Eddy bravo.. Alex drinks a bunch of whiskey and smokes pot and happens to open up about himself.. and he truly addresses the fact that he is bill Hicks... Drunk man&#39;s words are a sober man&#39;s thoughts...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe you just think that because you aren&#39;t taking enough nascent iodine and super male vitality to flush out the gay-frog chemicals the globalist psychic vampires put in your water. /s</p>

<p>But seriously, if I wanted to discredit conspiracies, I would take a multi-pronged approach; Deny in the mainstream media, dilute and mix with other bat-shit crazy ideas (like flat earth etc), so Alex could fit that bill, whether he knows it or if he&#39;s a pawn of the deep-state or not. Problem is that just because Alex says it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bullshit any more than anything else and sometimes I think he gets things right. I treat him as entertainment, and a guy trying to make a buck, I consider his spiel as a thought experiment in critical thinking and sanity check against the mainstream bullshit. 
Question everything, take everything with a grain of salt. It&#39;s a crazy world. Be an open minded skeptic. </p>

<p>There’s quit a bit of drama to read up on between Kelly Jones and her ex husband Alex, including accusations of parental alienation. She posts a lot on the evil social media about being censored by YouTube and fb in her attempts to inform the world of her custody battle with Alex.  Someone should reach out to her on Facebook and see if she’d do an AMA?</p>
