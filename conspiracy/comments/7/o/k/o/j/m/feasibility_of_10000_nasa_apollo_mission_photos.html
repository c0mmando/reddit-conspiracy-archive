<p>“Once on the Moon, on the lunar surface in the dress, in the life support system, you couldn’t see the camera. They couldn’t bend their head that far down to see the scale … They had no viewfinder – they had to aim by moving their body.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>– Jan Lundberg, chief designer of the Hasselblad cameras allegedly used by the Apollo astronauts</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“They had to effectively guess where they were pointing the camera.” –  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>HJP Arnold, the Kodak executive who supplied the Ektachrome film for the missions</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who don’t find that at all unusual, here is an experiment that you can try at home: grab the nearest 35MM SLR camera and strap it around your neck. It is probably an automatic camera so you will have to set it for manual focus and manual exposure. Now you will need to put on the thickest pair of winter gloves that you can find, as well as a motorcycle helmet with a visor. Once you have done all that, here is your assignment: walk around your neighborhood with the camera pressed firmly to your chest and snap a bunch of photos. You will need to fiddle with the focus and exposure settings, of course, which is going to be a real bitch since you won’t be able to see or feel what you are doing. Also, needless to say, you’ll just have to guess on the framing of all the shots.</p>

<p>You should probably use a digital camera, by the way, so that you don’t waste a lot of film, because you’re not going to have a lot of keepers. Of course, part of the fun of this challenge is changing the film with the gloves and helmet on, and you’ll miss out on that by going digital. Anyway, after you fill up your memory card, head back home and download all your newly captured images. While looking through your collection of unimpressive photos, marvel at the incredible awesomeness of our Apollo astronauts, who not only risked life and limb to expand man’s frontiers, but who were also amazingly talented photographers. I’m more than a little surprised that none of them went on to lucrative careers as professional shutterbugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then again, you would have to spend every second on the moon taking photos. Instead we see them mostly bouncing around and sometimes playing golf. Also we haven&#39;t been given very many &quot;rejects.&quot; There are albums that I&#39;ve been sent to that show what look like bad exposures and other weird visual things but not ones that look identifiable as on the moon. In other words it could just have been created with photo editor or whatever, after the fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is McGowan talking about a single Apollo mission or all of them? Is he taking these 10,000 images to all be images taken on the surface?</p>

<p>10,000 in a single mission that walked on the stages seems unlikely.</p>

<p>10,000 over the course of every mission that walked on the moon, spread across each indivual astronaut that walked on the moon, seems much more likely.</p>

<p>When you say they spent more time doing gravity experiments, what proportion of moonwalks were spent doing that? Could another astronaut not take images <em>while</em> one guy was dropping hammers and stuff?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>McGowan&#39;s main point isn&#39;t the amount of photos -- although Jack White calculated that for Apollo 11 to bring back as many photos as they did, someone would have to take a pic every 50 seconds they were on the moon -- but the preposterousness of the task of using such cameras in such conditions while wearing their gear. </p>

<p>Take the Apollo 15 &quot;jump salute&quot; photo for example. What are the odds that it would have been captured perfectly focused and framed on the first try? They couldn&#39;t even see through a viewfinder, let alone tell whether the photo turned out or not at the time. </p>

<p>In my opinion the cameras would never have worked anyway. They would have had to be incorporated into the life support system, which they were not, and were powered by simple D batteries that I doubt could tolerate such temperature extremes. Furthermore we are told there is an abundance of unpredictable interstellar radiation as well as the radiation in the Van Allen belts. This would have been bombarding any photographic film constantly to the point that minus any lead shielding all the film should have been whited out. </p>

<p>I am not obligated to answer you, and have no interest in doing so. I believe in some conspiracies, and do not believe in others. I will not engage in your silly excercise.  Your &quot;proof&quot; that the moon landings didn&#39;t happen: &quot;Some pictures don&#39;t look the way &quot;I&quot; think they should&quot;. And when given evidence, such as why or how, it&#39;s met with childish resistance. Because you simply refuse to believe, because &quot;reasons&quot;. </p>

<p>Saying &quot;It&#39;s obvious&quot; repeatedly does not make it fake.  It just self-reinforcement of what you believe. But, as usual, that&#39;s the sum total of your evidence, remember the photoshop thread? I still remember that, you have no evidence. None. ZILCH. NADA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;(The) cameras featured a mostly-automated process, thanks largely in part to the electronic motor. The astronauts needed only to set the distance, aperture, and shutter speed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...use of special-designed locks for the film magazines, levers for the aperture and distance settings and featured a simple sighting ring.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Based on experimentation on earlier Apollo missions, exposure settings for the different kinds of expected lighting conditions were worked out in advance. The guidelines were printed for the astronauts on the top of the Hasselblad film magazines.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For some of the more important photographs, the astronauts utilized exposure bracketing, varying the exposures one stop up and/or down from the recommended setting, to ensure a good result.&quot;</p>

<p>Each of the magazines had 70mm medium format film, with a capacity of around 200 shots per magazine.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing some searches and you can find technical details on every camera and film magazines they used for the still and motion photography. <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/film-magazine-hasselblad-70mm-apollo-11-lunar-surface-0">Apollo 11 had 9*70mm magazines that could take 160 color or 200 B&amp;W photos for example.</a> If you dig you could find their weight, I don&#39;t think it will be very much. I suspect time was more of a factor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(3) The Data Camera was given a silver finish to make it more resistant to thermal variations that ranged from full Sun to full shadow helping maintain a more uniform internal temperature. The two magazines carried along with the Data Camera also had silver finishes. Each was fitted with a tether ring so that a cord could be attached when the Lunar Module Pilot lowered the mated magazine and camera from the lunar module to the Commander standing on the lunar surface. The exposed magazines were hoisted the same way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is the casings were anodized but maybe I am wrong. Anyway, if you have a more reflective surface you reflect more heat, maintaining more consistent temperatures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that is ALL missions. Regardless, I can tell you they we&#39;re mainly using Hasselblads which were 6x6 frames and they were probably outfitted with extended roll magazines so they didn&#39;t have to change rolls too often. It would be a huge bitch to change film in space.</p>
