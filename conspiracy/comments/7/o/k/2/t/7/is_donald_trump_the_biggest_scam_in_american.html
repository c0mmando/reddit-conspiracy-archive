       This guy seems to be big mouthed and proud at first but when it steps in all he did is to serve Israel first, not america first.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't keep away illegal Immigrant invaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't prosecute Hillary which was literally making herself unelectable via a series of fiascos, including pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't purge the controlling forces of Obama and Soros from his office and employs Goldman Sachs employees onto his office.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't expose the 911 false flag and deep state secrets and instead acts obediently to Deep state plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was waging war against North Korea, Syria and Iran in an accelerated pace similar to Obama who destroyed Egypt, Libya, Syria, Ukraine and crippled Hong Kong in just 4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       After his election he follows and bleches out the same lies that Obama said during the United Nations annual conference.
      </p>
      <p>
       And at last, his voice became completely different from before he was elected, dull and boring, mind controlled maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is defintely a scam where you were choosing between a quick death (Hillary) and the slow death (Trump) which the slow death always wins as intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another proof that president elections are scams that tried to keep the peasants obedient to their masters.

       Sure,  its a great scam to talk about bs.    But this talk about Trump is basically irrelevant.    The genocide,  corruption,  financial ruin of this country is far more important and started long before Trump.    Trump is great because its a diversion to talk about him compared to the real issues.

       they are putting so many diversions out there but they cant stop the wave of consciousness that has already begun...it is only a matter of time before everyone is aware of the truth and what they  have been doing to everyone for so long.
the answers are out there for anyone who takes the time to look...

       I can't decide what to think right now. Maybe it's playbook. Maybe they just send him out there as a whirling dervish to distract us from what's really happening. Hell, who knows. It's crazy.

       Do your own research and then trust your gut. That's all you can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       And listen, if you choose- there is
       <em>
        nobody
       </em>
       at that level you can trust.
       <em>
        Nobody
       </em>
       gets there without either some blind luck (not Trump's case) or without compromising their morals to some extent. Trump has always had an angle beyond making America great again. The moment you stop believing he simply loves America and start considering his real goals, they become fairly obvious. He's a shallow, self-serving guy who skates through life by not caring about any wreckage he leaves behind him. It's not hard to be successful with an inheritance and those particular traits.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I could easily be wrong. Like I said, trust your gut and always examine the motives of the people you're measuring. Nobody in power is a saint, and all of them have branding consultants.

       Oh absolutely. I don't trust any politician, no matter what letter is by their name. Partisan politics is the biggest load of bullshit that we're fed on a daily basis. How so many people are still fooled by it is a mystery when you really don't have to dig very deep to see it.

       Kinda like religion though, it's more comfy to believe. But once you see through it you can never go back.

       Obama had 2 terms - 8 years.  Trump has had one year.  Are you comparing total deports by first year to first year?

       No, and that’s exactly my point. You’re making the implication that this comparison is being made, but it isn’t. Pick any year from Obama’s presidency and the number will be higher.

       What do you think my method of comparison is? It’s a fact that more people were deported in every year of Obama’s presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s also true that the number of deportations had been on the rise throughout Bush’s presidency. I believe they peaked in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know if the lower number of deportations from 2017 has anything to do with Trump, but the number was lower. It was.

       Wtf dude, I’m literally saying you can pick any single one of those eight years and that the numbers will be higher than 2017.

       Tell ya what, you pick one single year of Obama’s presidency and we can compare that year to 2017 and see which one had more deportations.

       You could easily make the argument that Obama was a bigger scam. He didnt just not live up to many of his biggest promises, he actually did the opposite to them in an extreme way. All that is clear is that we're not being given the real story on nearly anything

       To be a scam he would have had to have hoodwinked a large number of people. But that's not the case. Most of the people who voted for Trump agree with what he's doing now. They don't feel duped.

       Yes he is an egotistical moron.  But he was what the country needed with the direction we were heading.  The numbers don't lie.  America is much better off since he got in.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On Thursday, The Hill published a report from John Solomon which featured former FBI director James Comey’s original draft on the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. The draft showed that the term “gross negligence” was used multiple times and specifically said that there was evidence to conclude that Clinton committed a felony. Anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok, who texted about having an “insurance policy” against Trump’s election, softened the language in Comey’s draft so Clinton could avoid possible criminal charges.
       </p>
       <p>
        A senior law enforcement official told Solomon that the DOJ “was exploring whether any issues from that probe should be re-opened but cautioned the effort was not at the stage of a full investigation.”

       <p>
        Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered federal prosecutors at the DOJ in December to begin interviewing FBI agents about the evidence they collected during a criminal investigation into the controversial Uranium One deal, which directly involved the Clintons.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are multiple aspects at play in this investigation, from the Obama administration threatening a witness to stay quiet because they did not want him testifying to Congress because it would impact the 2016 presidential election, to the Russian officials who were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering directly connected to the Uranium One deal.

         The Obama Administration Ending Investigations Into Hezbollah

      </ol>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In December, Politico published a bombshell report about how the Obama administration ended a massive federal investigation, dubbed “Project Cassandra,” into the Iranian-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah. The Obama administration’s decision to sabotage the investigation so it could secure the Iran nuclear deal allowed Hezbollah to traffic hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cocaine into the United States and allowed them to operate “the largest material support scheme for terrorism operations the world had ever seen.”
       </p>
       <p>
        A little over a week after the report came out, congressional leaders announced that they were launching an investigation into the Obama administration’s efforts to end the Hezbollah investigation. This could include investigating Clinton because she was Obama’s Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 and the State Department was involved in the Obama administration’s efforts to end the investigation, according to the report. Politico reported, “Further complicating the picture was the role of the State Department, which often wanted to quash both law-enforcement actions and covert operations due to the political backlash they created.”

       Depends on what you consider a scam.  Obama is a muslim and non-American puppet installed by cia would have to be the biggest fraud perpetrated on the US people.  Trump being a nationalist/populist is going to be up there though.  He's a Zionist and likely wasn't supposed to win, but was controlled opposition from the start.  His family is Jewish, his partners are Jewish and
       <a href="https://imgur.com/gDdV9U3">
        everyone in his cabinet and appointed positions are jewish
       </a>
       .  Everything he does benefits Israel and Israel first.  His position on Syria and the fake gas attack benefitted Israel.  They are literally naming streets and buildings after him and its only been a year.  Acknowledging Jerusalem as the capital and pushing for it hard has no benefit for America and makes no sense as the supposed mediator between the two states and with everyone else staying neutral and ignoring how Israel has made all these land grabs in their apartheid state.   But they still did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no, its not the biggest scam, but he isn't the man portrayed by media or his campaign either.
