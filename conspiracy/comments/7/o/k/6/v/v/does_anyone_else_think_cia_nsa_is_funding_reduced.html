I see constant ads with people asking for the weather, when I window is visible in the same shot, and when pressing a button on your phone can give you the same info. I mean, is it really that hard to press play or google something these days? These devices are being promoted more than anything before and they don’t do anything revolutionary except creepy stuff people don’t want to acknowledge.</p>

<p>I mean, my AirPods surprisingly made my life a little noticeably better. This shit truly seems pointless so I really cannot fathom why people are going along with it. </p>

<p>A study of patent applications filed by Amazon and Google with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reveals a vision for an Orwellian future in which digital assistants eavesdrop on everything from confidential conversations to your toilet flushing habits to children’s movements and the books on bedside tables. They would know when you go to sleep and whom you wake up with.</p>

<p>The patents reveal the devices’ possible use as surveillance equipment for massive information collection and intrusive digital advertising. </p>

It cracks me up that of all places, r/conspiracy has the &quot;deer in the headlights&quot; look on this one. Like the Reddit PTB are immune to the lure of the almighty buck or something. ; )</p>

<p>This summer, a $600 million computing cloud developed by Amazon Web Services for the Central Intelligence Agency over the past year will begin servicing all 17 agencies that make up the intelligence community. If the technology plays out as officials envision, it will usher in a new era of cooperation and coordination, allowing agencies to share information and services much more easily and avoid the kind of intelligence gaps that preceded the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weaponised propaganda technologies and the panopticon. </p>

<p>We can go well past Luther&#39;s exploitation of the printing press; all the way back to early Rome, where large gaudy cocks were carved into almost every wall – these are all propaganda technologies, as primitive as we would consider them now. </p>

<p>Staying in ancient Rome for a bit, we also find that <em>mass entertainments</em> have always been used as weaponised propaganda technologies: sport and circus intended to busy the masses and always get them to <em>choose a side</em>, to pick teams in effort to divide themselves, amongst themselves. The very theatre of <em>democracy</em> is another, similar, propaganda technology, with the same ultimate aim of getting the populous to <em>divide themselves</em> so that they will never rise up to meet their true oppressors.  </p>

<p>It is no coincidence that these technologies become ubiquitous shortly following their militarised release for the public masses. From radio, to television, to the HD flatscreens that manipulate us subliminally (look up patents US 20020188164 A1 and US 6506148 B2 for examples), to gaming systems that <em>game us</em>, to the mobile phones that monitor your gait and biorhythms to the degree that it can tell when someone else is holding it other than you: these have <em>all</em> been subsidised by military interests and rolled out <em>en masse</em> for a reason. </p>

<p>Early structural-functionalist experimentation on the populous includes H. G. Well&#39;s 1938 <em>War of the Worlds</em> radio broadcast, which was used to test just how much the masses had come to trust the propaganda technologies by that stage. Facebook openly admits to social experimentation of its userbase in its own terms of use agreement. Pokemon go was another example of such experimentation, whereby people can now be controlled by augmented reality through their &quot;smart&quot; devices to the degree that an individual can be made to &quot;do our bidding against his will and even against such fundamental laws of nature as self-preservation&quot; (Sheffield Edwards, describing early dopamine based precursors to the technology using hypnotism and manipulation through tones and signals). </p>

<p>All the while, these technologies are <em>always</em> framed in terms of <em>entertainments</em>. By such entertainments are we encouraged into smaller and smaller demographics from which we are encouraged to find only differences between ourselves and others, dividing ourselves amongst ourselves. </p>

<p>The other side of this is <em>the panopticon</em>. A form of prison developed by Jeremy Bentham, the panopticon was a circular form of bastille in which the inmates were never able to tell if they were being watched, which would instil in them a feeling of <em>always</em> being watched. By creating such an environment, the inmates are conditioned to become, in effect, their <em>own jailers</em>. The name derives from the Greek <em>giant with one hundred eyes</em>, Panoptes. Foucault (<em>Discipline and Punish</em>) describes how this panopticon system has been adopted as the control mechanism in modern society where no bars or chains are necessary to keep every free-ranged slave in line. </p>

<p>These technologies serve both as militarised propaganda tools, and as tools of social control, and of course, monitoring. And the other side of this mass surveillance is the <em>people behind the peephole</em>: the very least among us, bound in their tontine by their common raping and pillaging; <em>these</em> are the ones surveilling us, gathering dossiers of dirt each of us, because <em>that is just how psychopaths think</em>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Smart TVs have already microphones and they can use them. Same with mobile phones, so I&#39;m not too crazy about that topic and would definitely never buy a Alexa/Home device anyway, <strong>but;</strong></p>

<p>I was at a launch party of a privacy think tank and there a former intelligence wistleblower got exactly that question. She told us her theory that Jeff Bezos / Amazon got a 200* million USD contract (over 10 years) from NSA to develop software to analyze the data that they have. She said 12* other ABC Agencies were also interested in the software and got their own contracts with him/them. Now - Imagine all that money, </p>

<p>Bezos also recently bought the Washington Post. Now it&#39;s kind of funny that the Washington Post is leaking all these stories that hurt Trump. She was suggesting both: That these agencies get to get back at Trump by using this newspaper to leak those infos and of course that they have an interest into getting these into every home.</p>

<p><em>I might have messed up numbers, and I didn&#39;t fact check the story. But it sounded interesting.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Even for a multi-billionaire like Bezos, a $600 million contract is a big deal. That’s more than twice as much as Bezos paid to buy the Post four months ago,” Solomon wrote. “Bezos personally and publicly touts Amazon Web Services, and it’s evident that Amazon will be seeking more CIA contracts.”</p>

<p>Former CIA official Ray McGovern said that “what emerges now is what, in intelligence parlance, is called an ‘agent of influence’ owning the Post – with a huge financial interest in playing nice with the CIA. In other words, two main players nourishing the national security state in undisguised collaboration.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may be off topic but I&#39;ve been an avid reader of sci-fi since school.</p>

<p>About 15 years or so ago a friend introduced me to Peter F. Hamilton and his space operas. I was so enthralled with his concepts of expanding human consciousness and brain power with wetware and until the past few years like an idiot I&#39;ve have jumped at the chance if it ever became feasible or affordable in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Now though with the way everything is just used to spy on, package up and control us that has gone. Imagine how easy it would be to just turn us all into drones.</p>

<p>Now if the devices worked independently without connection to a central server to process all the information it might be another matter. With quantum computing and the huge leaps that have been made in storing huge amounts of data on tiny devices it should be feasible, yet now they have gained this amount of control will they ever let it go? I very, very much doubt it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The push is because they are concerned Apple will make their own version and eat up the market share. Also holidays and many people would like a somewhat useful gift for 40 bucks.</p>

<p>They can sell at a loss to help other parts of there business like search etc. There could be something nefarious but the reason it is  pushed right now is simply capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, we&#39;ve all got smart phones already which can do all the nefarious spying any self respecting surveillance overlord could ever want. Selling Alexa at a loss is just about securing market share. Same reason Sony sold the PS3 at a loss for a long time, the average customer will spend far more than the loss over the products lifetime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything we say in &quot;private&quot; might be worth a bit to uncle sam.  But I think the sad truth is that it&#39;s worth loads more to companies like amazon/alphabet/apple.  When the CIA might just find value in data from potential terrorists or divergent citizens, the big data companies can find value in literally every single action of every single person and use it to influence what they buy.  The paycheck you blow on a new device is a drop in the bucket when these guys are in charge of what you blow all your other paychecks on.  That&#39;s why these devices are so cheap.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the tech companies try to limit government access to their data for financial reasons and they outbid the government hiring rates to increase their efficiency. </p>
