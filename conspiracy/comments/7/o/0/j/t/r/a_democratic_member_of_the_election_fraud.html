       A democratic commission member sued because information was being withheld to certain members; the judge sided with said commission member:

       Obviously I have no
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       evidence on this, but it looks to me like Trump and/or his staff were going to try to manufacture misleading or incorrect election fraud data for their benefit and hide it from the democrats. Since that information must now be made available to all members of the commission there is no way to hide it, so he disbanded the effort.

       They were trying to make specious bullshit claims to prevent people from voting.

       This has been the GOP strategy for years.

       Good thing they got caught here. Already a lot of wins for electoral fraud with gerrymandering and bullshit voting machines, nice to see the slide temporally halted at least.

       They don’t care about potential voting fraud unless it looks good for them.

       They're probably referring to the voting organization group that claimed they helped bus people to the polls, which isn't a problem if they're just providing money to get buses to bus legal voters to polling places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignoring the actual issue of why we put polling places so far away from people who need to vote there (actual voter fraud) and instead making up this pretend time story that they bussed in people
       <em>
        from out of state
       </em>
       to vote, which is a fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear now that Trump's voter fraud commission was set up because Trump was shouting about fake votes (how could such a beloved man NOT won the popular vote? Right?) and then the GOP decided to use that as a chance to get some abusive voter registration information and get blanket authority to pass regressive voter registration laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they had to "show their work" to the public, they burned it all and decided there was never any voter fraud. Yep. Sounds like they really believed in what they were doing.

       LOL. How do people still trust this group at this point? They've been caught multiple times lying, selective editing and committing borderline fraud in an attempt to make things look like they happened that didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to correct your actual point. Neither Bob Creamer nor Scott Foval are DNC officials. Both were contractors for some groups doing work for democrats. Neither of them admitted to any fraud, but Foval talked about how it would be easier to get away with it
       <em>
        if you didn't
       </em>
       bus them in, but did it with cars instead. This isn't the same as saying he was planning it or had done it. Certainly neither of them admitted to actually bussing anyone in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, without the raw footage, which they have not released for this (as far as I know), believing any video they put out is naive, considering how dishonest they have been in the past, and just believing what you want to believe, instead of being critical of sources.

       There was quite likely fraud for Trump, as per the voter suppression efforts like Crosscheck, the massive disparities with both pre-election and

       It’s ridiculous to say that Trump would cheat with his committee without considering obstructionism or partisan politics.

       It’s much more likely that politicians will go to any length to obstruct the other party’s agenda, it happens every day &amp; has always been that way.

       How can we know if there is or is not? If we can't check anyone's ID at the polls, we have no way of knowing whether there is fraud happening or not unless the fraudsters are very blatant about it. But if they're at all low key about it, there's really no way to ever catch them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's put it this way -- if we stopped checking for things, then there's a whole lot of things we could say "never happen" but that doesn't mean we're correct. How about if we stopped asking for ID at the bank? Would you be ok with it if you visited a bank only once every 2-4 years and they just let you withdraw all the money in whatever account you claim is your account? And the bank has no cameras so if you complained that your account was closed but you didn't close it, too bad, there's no way to prove it wasn't you because it's illegal for the bank to ask for ID. Nobody would be ok with that because it's ridiculous and voting shouldn't be any different.

       You absolutely can check id at the polls. You just have to provide the id and not charge the voter for it otherwise it's a poll tax
      </p>
      <p>
       And you have to make it easily available. You can't just shit down dmv's in predominately black counties - Alabama
      </p>
      <p>
       It shouldn't be too hard to cross reference the names of people that voted in the presidential election and the death certificate records in each state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they're only available back a decade you should be able to find a decent amount of those that voted, since that's what people claim is the biggest way it happens

       Sure you technically
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       but very few states are able to do this not because of logistics but because of crazy tinfoil hat wearing Democrats always pretend that any kind of voter ID is equal to lynching.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that respect, it’s a completely partisan issue because the GOP and minor parties all seem to be in agreement about it. Most countries in the world do it with no problem yet were to believe that an advanced country like our own couldn’t possibly pull it off. So even when states come up with great plans and have the ability to implement it, one specific group al aye gets it shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s pretty suspicious at this point because the Dems kinda seem like the cheating husband who won’t let his wife ever see his texts. It’s just not remotely believable that we’d get this all wrong but every effort gets stopped (or rolled back after vague unsubstantiated complaints that can never be proven or disproven).

       You're implying trump disbanded to cover his tracks. Not true at all and false info by OP. Very shameful of OP to spread misinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The suit was actually filed so that the democrats could cover their vote rigging tracks. Disbanding commission means democrats can no longer hide their voting records or methods. Trump knows that democrats get many of their votes through illegally whether it's by illegal immigrants, people hired to vote more than once or using deceased people to vote. This is why he is pushing for voter ID requirement.

       We disagree on that, obviously decisions to disband things matter, they don't become irrelevant because they are disbanded. I really don't know how you could come to that line of logic

       Voter ID laws are a solution is search of a problem. I don't oppose them idealistically, but there has been almost no evidence of actual in person voter fraud, and the consequences seem to disenfranchise a lot of voters. So realistically, they seem like unnecessary and are more likely to erode our democracy, rather than protect it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony being that Alabama has one of the most strict voter ID laws in the country, and republicans were still whining about "in person voter fraud" after Moore lost. They basically said that their own law to stop fraud was useless.

       Of course many Democratic states long obstructed the commission and flat refused to provide data. This was the reason for the commissions deadlock and complete uselessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, the need to spin the motivation for dissolving the commission into being 'Trump has something to hide,' not that the 'Democratic states had something to hide,' is a massively needed Democratic PR push.

       Also demanding all voted data be centralized under unaccoutable Trump lackies is insane. It never had anything to do with fraud it was about getting all voter data to Trump and Cambriage Analitics for next election.

       Bi-partisan? You do realize the only democrat had to sue to get the information right? And trump decided to shut it down after that lawsuit to prevent the information form being given to the democrat. There is nothing bi-partisan about that scam of a committee.

       Yes, after 7 months of obstruction and lack of progress, the commission was ended. You may use some mental gymnastics to speculate one wild stretch of a reason for its ending. Yet, there are many very much more likely reasons for ending the program. This includes the Democratic bill H.R. 3029 attempting to de-fund the commission and (D) Chuck Schumer's threat to deny funding. Add that to the at least 21 states who refused to comply with public data requests and the constant criticism and crying about the effort and pretending that investigating voting fraud would make it harder for people to vote by the media, several opt-eds, liberal mouthpiece "law experts", and other highly publicized fear-mongering.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was public data that has no scary centralized control worries. No one was getting secret insider information.
