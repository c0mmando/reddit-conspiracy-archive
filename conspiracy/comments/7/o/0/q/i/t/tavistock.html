        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Tavistock Institute which was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation is a research program involved in human behavior, social sciences, and psychology. Today the Tavistock Institute is covertly involved with social networking sites, alternative media, and conspiracy forums. The USAF and DARPA run covert programs on the internet using research developed from the Tavistock Institute and Tavistock Clinic. Their goal is mass manipulation of society through social networking and psychological torture on those researching &quot;conspiracy&quot; or the criminality of those in power. The word &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot; is a term these criminals created as a form of neuro-linguistic programming to automatically discredit those that research or investigate criminality. The Tavistock Clinic is stationed in London and is directly involved with the British government. The United States Department of Defense and intelligence agencies are infiltrated by British Crown knights and Freemasons serving the British Crown. To even mention the word &quot;Tavistock&quot; on a conspiracy site will get you banned almost immediately. The websites Conspiracy Outpost, Godlike Productions, and Lunatic Outpost are Tavistock operations. The Moderators Cinnamon and UKshep on Conspiracy Outpost are highly trained Tavistock agents and extremely sadistic. Craig Oxley is a high level member of the Tavistock Institute which was financed by the Rockefeller Foundation. There is a statue of Prometheus at Rockefeller Plaza. Craig Oxley&#39;s site states on its header &quot;Support the Promethians.&quot; The Russell, Parsons, Carnegie, and Spencer families are covert managers of the Tavistock Institution. Andrew Russell, 15th Duke of Bedford and Marquess of Tavistock is the top overseer. This organizations is pure evil and involved with ruthless mind control and has the entire internet running brain reading software. Dr Eliat Aram, Robert Branagh, Joel Featherman, Joanna Hill, Julie Newlan, Christopher Warhurst, Alice Long, and Cliff Oswick are all Council members of the Tavistock Institute and also ruthless criminals.</p>

<p>Major &quot;Alternative Media&quot; outlets are part of the FBI&#39;s COINTELPRO operation or similar agencies and programs intended to infiltrate political organizations in order to disrupt, subvert, and radicalize them. They operate as fishing nets drawing in opposition. The legitimate opposition that they cannot manipulate are targeted and persecuted. The government works with privatized organizations like Stratfor Intelligence which gather information on the legitimate opposition. These groups are then connected with secret societies who covertly carry out persecution for cash payment. Secret Societies use criminal style initiations to incorporate its members so that they can blackmail their members if they try to turn against them. Secret Societies are organized crime syndicates and include Jesuits, Freemasons, Knights of Columbus, fraternities, sororities and they work with less organized and official groups like Wiccan cults, and New Age cults. Facebook uses the Tailstock&#39;s brain reading software as part of their social engineering program. Organized religion is also involved including Christian Churches and especially the Church of Latter Day Saints. Freemasons and Jesuit agents at the Department of Defense work with the British Tavistock Institute and run the COINTELPRO operations based on Tavistock&#39;s programs. The Tavistock Institute works with British intelligence which works with the CIA and USAF. They are involved with most of the major alternative media outlets like Godlike Productions, Lunatic Outpost, Conspiracy Outpost, David Icke Forum, Infowars, and DiscloseTV.  Alternative media channels like these use brain reading software and along with disinformation agents that gather intel on people who speak out. Their goal is to understand and control the minds of their opposition. The ones involved are all ruthless sadists.</p>

<p>There is only one thing at the very, very bottom of the hole; a choice, to do good or evil, to love or fear, freedom or control, courage or cowardice. </p>

<p>Choose wisely, good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Applied with strong faith and a willingness to develop a childlike discerning heart, described elsewhere as one of the ultimate fruits of the spiritual harvest, after all, the persecution spoken about above by these ‚Äúsadists‚Äù ends up leading you straight to the capital G in God. </p>

<p>I would take their pain and cowardice away in a second if I could, but sadly, they themselves are the only ones that can do that.</p>

<p>Happy beings and happy choices do not result in ‚Äúsadistic‚Äù behavior and thats a fact, Jack. So although you may very well take my family, take my body, and even take my life, you will not claim that you were happy. And I will claim to have given all for God, badass love, limitless creativity, and ultimately, for each and every one of them too.</p>

<p>The record and judge, will write the record. üòÆ</p>

<p>however, it was developing large research and  training programs. These were financed by foundation grants, especially  from the U.S., and were administered by the Institute through what was  called the Research and Training Committee (RTC).</p>

<p>Till 1994 when they just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavistock_and_Portman_NHS_Foundation_Trust">stopped</a> covering it up...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may also be interested to know that on 7/7, the London terrorist attacks, the bus blew up outside the Tavistock institute. It had been diverted to Tavistock Square. </p>

<p>On that day, 3 tube trains and a bus exploded. Cctv didn&#39;t get any evidence, Cctv in London is run by an Israeli company. I was running late and missed getting on one of the tube train that blew up.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the uk&#39;s 911 &#39;terrorist attacks&#39; which were definitely a false flag, watch the Ripple Effect documentary. </p>
