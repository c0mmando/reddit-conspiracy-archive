      <p>
       The article was published 6 days ago. Here's some of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it means: A senior U.S. official said that after two days of talks the U.S. and Israel reached at a joint document which included understandings on countering Iranian actions in the region. The U.S. official said the document goal's was to translate President Trump's Iran speech to joint U.S.-Israeli strategic goals regarding Iran and to set up a joint work plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the table: The Israeli team was headed by national security adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat and included senior representatives of the Israeli military, Ministry of Defense, Foreign Ministry and intelligence community. The U.S. side was headed by national security adviser H.R. McMaster and included senior representatives from the National Security Council, State Department, Department of Defense and the intelligence community.
      </p>
      <p>
       As part of the understandings that were reached the U.S. and Israel decided to form several working groups according to the joint goals:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Covert and diplomatic action to block Iran's path to nuclear weapons – according to the U.S. official this working group will deal with diplomatic steps that can be taken as part of the Iran nuclear deal to further monitor and verify that Iran is not violating the deal. It also includes diplomatic steps outside of the nuclear deal to put more pressure on Iran. The working group will deal with possible covert steps against the Iranian nuclear program.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Countering Iranian activity in the region, especially the Iranian entrenchment efforts in Syria and the Iranian support for Hezbollah and other terror groups. This working group will also deal with drafting U.S.-Israeli policy regarding the "day after" in the Syrian civil war.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Countering Iranian ballistic missiles development and the Iranian "precision project" aimed at manufacturing precision guided missiles in Syria and Lebanon for Hezbollah to be used against Israel in a future war.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Joint U.S.-Israeli preparation for different escalation scenarios in the region concerning Iran, Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       Submission statement: The US and Israel have agreed to use covert activities regarding Iran. Surely instigating civil unrest through manufactured protests would be on the list of covert actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we are already seeing the ramifications of their covert activities?

       well let's see.  they did mossadeq.  they did the shah.  they did the iraq/iran war.  now they're in again.   and every time the rationalization makes no sense.  so who knows why they're really there.
      </p>
      <p>
       there's talk of the mid east having a gateway (perhaps natural) in or near yemen.  this wouldn't be that surprising to me.  so perhaps that's why they're trying to consolidate the entire region.  it looks like a bruise emanating from saudi how many diff places they've toppled.  there's clearly a reason we're not being told why.  saud and israel for instance have been working together the entire time on the sly.  yadda yadda yadda.  we're getting complete bullshit from our media and the explanations don't make any sense at all.

       I'm not familiar with this twitter account at all, just saw it for the first time today...but whoever they are..they're connected. Lots of footage from inside Iran...and they've taken to labeling certain Shia security forces as ISIL/Daesh...
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty interesting stuff no matter what..I can already see that the big media push will be on the "Baijis" security/terror force.
