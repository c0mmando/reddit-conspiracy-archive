       Cryptocurrency could already be the path to an authoritarian state as every transaction is publicly viewable. People think that it's a way to conceal your identity but it's the exact opposite.

       It's totally true. All they have to do is match your id to your wallet, and suddenly
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       can see
       <em>
        every single transaction you have ever made
       </em>
       . If you notice, you can't buy bc with cash, you sign up to an exchange whereby you send them a copy of your id. From there you buy some crypto and transfer it to your hardware wallet. That's totally traceable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Precious metals do pretty much exactly what Cryptos do but they are truly anonymous, and while they have drawbacks, at least they don't promote further enslavement

       Transfer you BTC to XMR and anonymously send it to another exchange, and transfer back to BTC. Problem solved if you're really that paranoid.

       I mean you say all this, so I'll assume you don't use a credit or debit card for your transactions. Im sure you pay your electric bill in cash.

       Thats just it. The majority of the global population do not understand it which is 95% (obviously estimating) instead of insulting someone for not understanding it, extend an olive branch of knowledge and resources to further growing the crypto community.

       Honestly, I've been wanting to by some crypto currency with cash for a few weeks. I keep finding scam site after scam site according to Reddit, and still haven't found a site that I can use cash to buy crypto. Maybe someone will come along here to tell me how though.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is the big problem. It's not accessible. Until that happens, it is still a pipe dream. Once it is accessible, easy, and quick to use (like I can buy stuff at a store instantaneously like I do with my credit card), it won't take off and will just be the currency people use to do illegal stuff.

       Coinbase is easy. And it's not about buying stuff. It's about hedging against an increasingly worthless fiat currency known as the US dollar. Scarcity is your friend when owning an asset.

       You better hedge yourself before it's too late. That $20 will be worth $10 in 2 years time. (If not sooner)

       Lol. I doubt it. America is like the banks it bails out. Too big to fail. We can say what we want about the government and the world stage but we are not going anywhere. Especially in two years. Unless theres a catastrophe on a global scale. Every generation thinks they are the doomed ones. Infrastructure will be rebuilt and new great companies will be made with great new inventions across all fields. Have you ever asked yourself where does all the money go people use to buy these crypto currencies? All the fees to trade it go in whos pocket? What happens when there is no more buyers and  every one is left trying to sell it back to fantasy land ? Once taxes and laws are implemented we will see who the winners and losers are.

       I'll take you up on that challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FACT is that when they print more money, the value of your dollar goes down and my btc goes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple economics bud. I'm not saying the "end is near" I'm just tired of working for something that gets constantly devalued by TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many years have you studied finance, economics, worked in the financial industry and or crypto industry? Because it doesn't sound like much at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could make the same argument about no more buyers of gold, but gold only goes up compared to the dollar over time because one is scarce and the other isn't. It's not that difficult of a concept for someone who actually studies this stuff on a daily basis.

       Let me start buy saying who ever makes money with it god bless. But as a long term thing its not resonable. You can study it all you want. Its brand new and you cant compare it to anything else besides maybe the tech boom in the early 2000s and how many companies made it out of that bubble. You never answered my queation either...what happens when governments demand identity and want taxes? Besides the fact you can do shady shit with it wheres the actual value? It will only take one "terrorist organization" or extreme money laundering and the whole thing fails. Countries having their own markets is what keeps the balance. Why would the entire planet want to use only j.p morgan bucks ,walmart dollars, or amazon coins? It doesnt make sense when you look at the whole thing amd what it could turn in to. Thats why it will fail.

       Just saw this one - you're all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btc just celebrated its 9th birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tech crash was an amazing buying opportunity. I would be ecstatic to see btc at $100 again.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the govt demands ID, then either give it to them or move to another country. I'll deal with that when it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can do shady shit with cash. We sent tons of cash to Isis.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would money laundering or terror groups using btc cause it to crash? It's happened before and btc only gets stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a currency or an asset. It doesn't mean counties could have their own market and there are other cryptocurrecies out there. Plus we live in a very globalized market that has only increased productivity, not hindered it. Not many counties have their own secluded market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the world uses USD as the base currency. Which is basically "FEDbucks" and pretty close to a jpmorgan coin.
      </p>
      <p>
       It actually makes a lot of sense when you study finance and economics. That's why I was more than giddy to buy my first btc in 2013 and never looked back.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could fail, but so could the US dollar. If I had to bet, it obviously won't be on the dollar. But time will tell. Best of luck to us both!

       And i forgot to re ask you since you study this all day every day. Who is on the other end getting the money exchanged for crypto currency? Why do they want actual money instead of idk bananas? Back it all with apples and bananas since actual money is so terrible.

       Apples and bananas are not scarce assets. That's why. Apples and bananas are actually a lot closer to the dollar than gold, silver or btc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually do study this every day. I went from being a stockbroker to working for a crypto exchange last summer. So to answer your first question, the money goes to whoever is selling the asset. It's how markets work. An asset is traded and the seller keeps the profit. When you buy a car or house, who gets the money? The seller who purchased the asset earlier in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who gets the fees for trading on the exchange? The people who build and/or work for the exchange that people are willing to pay to use. So essentially I receive some of that money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any other questions? This is fun.

       It's an asset. It already is taxable as capital gains. If you accept it as payment, it's taxable income.

       Good luck with your day job and slaving away until your 65 working for a dollar that goes down in value faster than you can get a raise. I just spent two months on the beaches of Thailand and could quit my job tomorrow if I didn't have passion for what I do.. I don't have to slave for the next 40 years and that's something I'm truly greatful for. I'll attribute it to knowing a good thing when I see one..

       Youre trying to push a ponzi scheme bro. Sure theres some winners but theres more losers. And i truly wish you the best and i hope your greed doesnt back fire before you can enjoy your luck. Im not impressed by your year long cypto currency fun or what you have. So personal attacks arent needed buddy. But hey if thats what makes you feel better . clearly the big ol bank accounts haven't made you humble and the good lord dont accept bitcoin. Good luck out there.

       Bitcoin is not a store of wealth. It is a medium of exchange. You should not “invest” in it IMO, but rather hold it for the purpose of spending it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus are the 2 functions of money; we have forgotten it in the West because the dollar (and dollar-backed currencies) have (more or less) been fulfilling both roles.
      </p>
      <p>
       But go to the third-world and you’ll see people trade with the legal tender, and save in dollars (or gold).
      </p>
      <p>
       After we separate money and State, it is my estimation people will trade in p2p crypto-money (superior to precious metals as a medium of exchange) and save in gold or silver (superior to digital money as a store of wealth).
      </p>
      <p>
       Look into FOFOA’s freegold exposé for additional insight on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       One another thought: crypto-enthusiasts should
       <em>
        welcome
       </em>
       the demise of a given crypto-currency, as that would mean the emergence of a better one. That’s what it’s about: competition and trial-and-error. Thus it doesn’t make sense to hold large amounts of it for long periods of time (unless you’re a gambler).

       Regarding the 4% own 95% of BTC statement, that’s quite false.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like saying the bank owns all money it keeps instead of the people who use it. Yes, 95% of BTC is kept at banks (like Coinbase.com) but it’s allocated to users.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is really saying is only 5% of Bitcoins are kept in hardware wallets or cold storage, which isn’t really too surprising.

       Money is not wealth. When you print money you don't print wealth, why do you think the buying power of a currency sinks at the rate you print? Because money is just an arbitrary object that is suppose to REPRESENT other objects that actually has value. So when you print more you are just diluting the already existing currency. Your choice of using a currency is 50% of what makes that currency valuable.

       Whoever spends newly printed money first, spends it at a purchasing power that has not yet adjusted to the inflationary effect that this newly printed money has on the market. That's an issue directly tied to the insidiousness of usury and the scam that is fractional reserve banking.

       I'd have to disagree. Yes, money is just currency. But you can use this stuff that is printed from nothing, and create real value from it. 
For example, to pay for weapons to be made (cost money), in which case you secretly send (cost money) them to your proxy army (who you pay money) whom helps sow discord across the planet, which in turn gives you a reason to keep creating and giving more funds to your miltary or nation. Over time, you can acquire whole nation's from this meaningless paper (if you know what you are doing). Or another example is, over time you can acquire what you want people to think, by using money to pay for people to sow discord via the MSM and throughout the internet.
       <br/>
       And the rich more or less generate limitless funds due to the interest their money (debts) earns sitting in the bank (instead of trickling down into the economy).

       No I believe it is the opposite. It is more than just bitcoin. There are a bunch of promising cryptos. All of them decentralized. Not a single world cashless currency issued by a central bank of the world to enslave everyone. The people decide which coins they believe are valuable by owning, trading and using them.  I see it like the dotcom bubble.. a bunch of ideas that are in their infancy most of which are crap and won't amount to anything but some will survive and become legitimate. Now it is all totally unregulated and you have manipulators like John McAfee running pump and dump scams so it's a far cry from the libertarian dream of sound currency. The exchanges are always overloaded and the sites go down all the time so it's a wonky system but everyday there are more options to spend your coin online. Overstock accepts several. If it comes together the right way it could be the death of the banks. Sadly I'm sure it will all be used against us but until they figure it out it's fun to gamble on and hope for the best.

      <p>
       I'd say over half if not 3 quarters of the people who invest in crypto simply follow the gains and mcafee type hype, they have no idea about what they are investing in apart from the basics.

       A clever marketing and shill campaign can very very easily swing 'the people' towards and coin (((they))) chose. Out of all the search engines why is google pretty much the only one people ever use?  Did the people choose it or were they led to it?

       A solid crypto trader/investor will do his own research, using various sources and platforms. A casual trader will most likely follow certain traders on twitter, or do some reading on reddit or join telegram groups and will primarily look for calls from others. Super casual investors invest in what they see on the news.

       Eh, there's room in the market to pump and dump shit coins AND hold onto coins that actually have some decent tech behind them. You'll see both proliferate in the short term. In the long term, if a coin is solid, people will stick with it and word of mouth will spread, with them eventually overtaking the pump 'n dumps, which will slowly fizzle out as people realize their technical flaws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin requires too much electricity. That's bad for the environment. I'd prefer a coin that can secure the chain without using so many resources.

         Look at Puerto Rico right now. As of 5 days ago, they have restored power to 55% of the population months after the hurricane. Imagine if you were in the group of the 45% who don't have reliable power sources right now. Trying to use your BTC would probably be pretty damn difficult. Most likely not impossible but not easy.

         A bit more nefarious but it latches on to my example above. What if someone didn't like you so much. Maybe your name is Julian Assange or Edward Snowden. I'm not so sure your money couldn't be taken very easily making life pretty hard on you. People go on about how secure it is if you are careful but I'm not so sure. We don't even know who invented it. That's a bit weird.

         It is insanely volatile. I keep a notebook next to my computer and I just jot things down. I am taking these numbers off the top of my head because I discarded that page but a week or so before Christmas I was watching some of the crazy price movements so for 3 days when I'd think about it I would look up the price and then jot it down with the time/date. At one point I watched it swing about $500 in an hour and over the 3-day period, I saw swings as wild as 2k per 1 BTC. In theory, you could check your BTC balance, make a quick shopping list then drive to the store, find the items you want and then have lost $500 in value (
         <em>
          or maybe more

         An all cashless society can be a dangerous one. Take a look at
         <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/mar/29/10-lessons-cyprus-bailout">
          this list
         </a>
         that was pulled together after Cyprus decided to bail out their banks by making the questionable move of
         <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/29/bank-of-cyprus-depositors-lose-savings/2595837/">
          taking a high percentage of money from people's accounts
         </a>
         to help the government and very banks who created their financial problems.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         And a final point on the move to an all cashless society which is tied into number 5 above as well. Take a look at what happens when countries start implementing
         <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-interest-rate-policy-nirp.asp">
          negative interest rate policies
         </a>
         . At that point, you are paying the bank the pleasure to have your money. If the government needs a little juice the central bank and deflate interest rates some more because they are trying to encourage spending which just drives down your savings and increases debt. You don't have a choice in the matter. If all money is electronic and your country goes negative you are screwed. If we maintain a system of every country having a central bank of their own but a one world currency your bank is making float (
         <em>
          they do it anyway but this just feels even more wrong
         </em>
         ) off your money as they do overnight lending to other banks in other nations.

       <strong>
        tl;dr:
       </strong>
       There are a lot of f'd up reasons why people should not want this. Sorry my list is so long but it is actually pretty hard to summarize it down because there are so many bad things about this.

       Because his arguments are that of an ignorant non-investor who makes easily rebuttable points. Do some research. It's going to the moon bc the dollar is going to the dirt. We continue to print, your buying power goes down, and my btc goes up. It's simple economics and you better do your own unbiased DD before you miss the boat completely. A diversified portfolio minimizes risk. Your portfolio of stocks and bonds aren't fully diversified until you hold at least 10% in crypto.

       LOL... everyone is an ignorant investor except when they are not.

       I hold hard currencies, precious metals and stocks across industries. Raytheon made me a lot this past year because I saw what was coming with Trump and I went heavy on defense stocks whether I agree with the morality of it or not. I was also an early BTC investor but jumped out because I'm pragmatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it to you this way. My work heavily involves sales. Things coming in and things going out. Every quarter I'd rather stand in a QBR (quateryly business review) with sales people who are going to tell me the truth about what their projected sales are rather than those who inflate numbers because of perceived job security. I need to know if the business is forecasting at 5% growth or 5% decline so I can make smart decisions on what to do next. Don't worry about saving your ass... worry about sharing the truth so the right choices can be made for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTC is kind of the same way. When it swings so rapidly and no one can predict where the hell it will end up I'm not interested because it gives me no clear picture to the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you all make a bunch of money off it I'm happy for you but don't get butthurt when others raise valid concerns.

      </p>
      <p>
       Btc is only traceable if you make it that way. Plus there are fully anonymous alts like xmr.
      </p>
      <p>
       Volatile doesn't matter because it only went up. Don't check your stocks everyday either bud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btc isn't going to be used to buy goods. It's a hedge against the dollar which is going down causing btc to go up. We printed billions and will continue to do so. I'll take something with scarcity that can't be devalued overnight by a FED.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever you're arguments are worthless. Sorry you missed the boat there bud. I assure you crying about it won't change the inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 years from now the USD will be nearly worthless. $100 bills won't even make good toilet paper

       i actually believe bitcoin is dying. the mining wastes too much energy, the transaction is slow and high fees. nobody, except rich people trying to "invest", is going to use it from now on.
      </p>
      <p>
       sure... keep the stories floating in "person X made amount Y with bitcoin!" -- doesn't change the fact that nobody can use it effectively. i assume they gained some form of control of it (sooooo much invested in bitcoin mining) and because of that it is lately hitting mainstream outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       we have enough other cryptos. cryptos are here to last. bitcoin can be honored as a pioneer, but i doubt it will remain at "the top" for much longer. the market spread and doesn't channel into a single crypto.

       The average is 2000 tps (I missed by a decimal, lol). Peak daily is 4000 tps. The total capacity is 56,000 but only peaks at 18000ish.

       So if 1 MB every 10 minutes is 7 tps, we would need 500 MB blocks for 4000 tps, 250 MB used on average. So a node would only need 3-10 mbps (depending on average transaction size, block time, which varies, and capacity utilization).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for storage, a fork would be needed to compress or prune the blockchain.

       That's just the result of bcash manipulating the situation. It will pass, bcash will die, miners will come back to the OG btc and the lighting network will kick ass.

      <p>
       If you want to know about a real conspiracy in the crypto space, look at xrp, xlm and all the other fake crypto currencies being pumped in order to steal btc from the smaller investors. Buyer beware. If you're buying xlm or xrp you better know what you're putting your money into. Darwinism will cause a lot of fomo's to lose their fortunes.

       Not commenting on Bitcoin in particular, but p2p crypto-money is an important stepping stone in the direction of fully separating money and State. Our generation will fulfill

       When we finally take the monetary prerogative away from the fake sovereign (the State), and place it in the hands of the real one (the individuals), it will mean an end to poverty and war.

       No, bitcoin and all crypto is using it's own blockchain or blockchain derivative.

       You're correct except that last bit. AI's totally exist. In algorithmic archaic states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember IBMs "Watson?" That was year's and year's ago. I am not saying it is skyrocketing forward like most technology but it's for sure moved ahead and maybe even in the black budget areas is even further ahead (speculation) but AI is a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell Google uses a form of AI. The phone I'm typing on has an even more archaic form in it's autocorrect as it learns words from repetition or from manually being added to its dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying we have Turing test capable AI but it's a large spectrum with, afaik, a pretty amazing yet dated example having been showcased by IBM through Jeopardy years ago.

       The blockchain? You mean the blockchains right? There's more than one... enjoy your worthless fiat. Anyone else ready for their dollar to collapse in the next 6 months? It's happening. Look at the technical analysis and buy gold/btc (not crap like xrp which is designed to steal the wealth of ignorant "crypto investors"

       With over 1,000 crypto currencies, I don’t believe one will lead to a one world currency in our lifetime. Bitcoin formed at the cusp of the 2008 financial crisis as a way to eliminate the need for banks. A P2P electronic payment system that does not require a middle man (banks) or regulations to abide by.
      </p>
      <p>
       The underlying tech that powers bitcoin is where things really shine.  Blockchain technology is going to shape the world in ways the internet has done.

       It's about who controls the supply. Crypto exchanges do not control the supply of money and they can fractionally reserve it essentially creating more out of thin air.

       I wonder how many people here understand economics or how our current financial system opporates. The same system that we used to dispise in this sub. Not sure what happened to r/conspiracy. I though people here would be more accepting of putting the power back into the hands of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except that a lot of ppl here seem to be defending the status quo, Rothschild banking system, that is actually at the heart of nearly all of the major conspiracies we used to talk about here.. until it became a mindless political battle ground, that is.

       Well Bitcoin specifically has many problems that will likely stop it ever succeeding.

       The current market is alternatives looking to solve those problems - some of them are pretty sketchy looking, centralised, and heading towards banks.

       The thing is - why have a "gold" digital currency when you can have a digital currency that actually works? The "store of value" argument is all they have left; nobody wanted bitcoin to be a "store of value" ignoring everything else.

       Yeah, Bitcoin is only pseudonymous. We need an anonymous coin. Which there are a few out now. But who cares whether it was started by the NSA? The source code is publicly available and has been forked into new coins. Not sure if any are anonymous enough that the issue will never come up again/another new coin doesn't need to be developed, or if there's still work to do. But people like free money and if they weren't able to get on one coin's bandwagon in time to make a killing, they can develop their own coin.

       The whole point of crypto currencies is to introduce a cashless society. Where it will require a computer of some sort (smartphone), an account, and of course electricity and connection to the internet in order to buy and sell. ALL transactions can and will be tracked. And your ability to buy and sell can easily be shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say so far it's been a rousing success. The Alt Media is complicit in it's introduction, from those who are knowingly pushing it (like Andy Hoffman, who accidentally exposed himself and the 'agenda' at SGTReport) to those who are just following the herd, and those motivated by greed (which I would say is the majority). Remember Alt Media is NOT Truth Media. There are some Truth seekers and tellers in the Alt Media, but not near as many as you might think. And every day the Alt Media becomes more and more polluted by those who either want to control it, or destroy it.

       There are much simpler ways to hijack bitcoin - a 51% attack, overmining, collecting all the coins, using energy signatures to track mining locations, etc. It's not just the crypto that can be attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple NSA attack on bitcoin 100% guaranteed to succeed:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Acquire millions of dollars worth of miners, and slowly turn them on until you discreetly control 50-90% of the mining capability.
       </li>
       <li>
        Right after a difficulty adjustment, turn off your miners or switch them to another shitcoin.
       </li>
       <li>
        Watch the 2000+ block cycle grind to a halt, the mempool moon, and everyone try to dump the coins as fast as they can.
       </li>
       <li>
        Collect cheap coins, turn your miners back on, control the chain.

       51% attack is tough. Very expensive as of now. Unless of course they have a mathematical trick to solve for mining.

       Yeah, but if we're seriously talking state-level actors, 51% attack is expensive but easy. $ per gigahash isn't super bad, even.

      <p>
       But it's probably easier to just do something like limit the block size and cripple the coin instead ...

       The current hash rate is: 8,481,426,187 GH/s. The fastest miner is Antminer S9-13.5TH/s, which costs $2,500. That means it requires around 300,000 miners for $7 billion. I think the catch will be getting that many miners. If someone starts buying so many miners, either people will get alerted or the price will shoot up, making the whole exercise pointless.

       The problem will be powering so many miners, cooling, not to forget if so many miners go off the market, price will shoot up, making the whole project costly by a factor of a hundred. So, the only way they could get away is if they build miners themselves secretly.

       They get funding for such an exercise from the parliament of their countries. Almost all countries spend a significant portion of their budget in defense. I doubt anyone is going to allow them to withdraw money to fuck with bitcoins. But doing research on quantum computers, they can get their funding under the garb of scientific research.

       Cryptocurrencies are decentralized. That, to me, goes against the concept of a "one world" currency.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cryptocurrency could already be the path to an authoritarian state as every transaction is publicly viewable. People think that it's a way to conceal your identity but it's the exact opposite.

       Wouldn't the elite hate this? After all, they have more to hide than your average consumer.

       For these reasons bitcoin will fail. The only one world currency that would work is one that gives the people who are doing shady things the ability to hide and has a central controlling point.

       Is it truly decentralized, or is it rather that the central source, and thus control, is simply hidden?
      </p>
      <p>
       To say it doesn't have a center is akin to saying it doesn't have a source - and we know it has a source. The question is whether or not the people who have any control have too much - and if so - what their intentions, backers or supporters are.

       You would think r/conspiracy would have been all about something that took so much power away from TPTB, but instead of supporting the change we've always dreamed of, they bash it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No wonder taking down the TPTB is so hard, the ones who constantly talk about it are nothing but talk! If they really believed in half the shit this sub constantly complains about, they would have been supporting btc since the first day they heard about it. Instead they just want to complain more. Without doing any research of their own.

I'm a luddite for even suggesting that you absolutely NEED at least enough long term food supplies secured in a safe place for you and your family to last until the next growing season and youd better have some seeds and supplies for then too. Oh! but your a NY city girl/boy [add whatever the fuck gender you want it WONT MATTER!]  when the very same peeps who control ALL of this fake fiat currency flip the switches !  I wonder how many of you will be able to survive more than a week? no matter HOW secure and ostentatios your particular 'lair' is. b/c most of you have made careers off of playing with OPMs and you HAVE NO OTHER REAL LIVING skill sets!  but hey what do I know? Im just a refugee from the corporate belly of many beasts [IBM etc etc,] who is now a goat farmer. oh yeah, and a sharp shooter and a medic. LOL good luck with your 'everything is awesomer in the cities' lives'  DONT COME ROUND HERE WHEN IT GOES TO HELL FOR YOU! I already have the community I will be supporting.

       Regarding the 4% own 95% of BTC statement, that’s quite false.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like saying the bank owns all money it keeps instead of the people who use it. Yes, 95% of BTC is kept at banks (like Coinbase.com) but it’s allocated to users.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is really saying is only 5% of Bitcoins are kept in hardware wallets or cold storage, which isn’t really too surprising.

       I'd have to disagree. Yes, money is just currency. But you can use this stuff that is printed from nothing, and create real value from it. 
For example, to pay for weapons to be made (cost money), in which case you secretly send (cost money) them to your proxy army (who you pay money) whom helps sow discord across the planet, which in turn gives you a reason to keep creating and giving more funds to your miltary or nation. Over time, you can acquire whole nation's from this meaningless paper (if you know what you are doing). Or another example is, over time you can acquire what you want people to think, by using money to pay for people to sow discord via the MSM and throughout the internet.
       <br/>
       And the rich more or less generate limitless funds due to the interest their money (debts) earns sitting in the bank (instead of trickling down into the economy).

       You're correct except that last bit. AI's totally exist. In algorithmic archaic states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember IBMs "Watson?" That was year's and year's ago. I am not saying it is skyrocketing forward like most technology but it's for sure moved ahead and maybe even in the black budget areas is even further ahead (speculation) but AI is a thing.
      </p>

       Hell Google uses a form of AI. The phone I'm typing on has an even more archaic form in it's autocorrect as it learns words from repetition or from manually being added to its dictionary.

       I'm not saying we have Turing test capable AI but it's a large spectrum with, afaik, a pretty amazing yet dated example having been showcased by IBM through Jeopardy years ago.

       Ninja Edit: Eth and Stellar is where it's at (though now I sound like an IBM shill with the name dropping and Stellar)

       Whoever spends newly printed money first, spends it at a purchasing power that has not yet adjusted to the inflationary effect that this newly printed money has on the market. That's an issue directly tied to the insidiousness of usury and the scam that is fractional reserve banking.

       Transfer you BTC to XMR and anonymously send it to another exchange, and transfer back to BTC. Problem solved if you're really that paranoid.

       I mean you say all this, so I'll assume you don't use a credit or debit card for your transactions. Im sure you pay your electric bill in cash.

       I'll take you up on that challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FACT is that when they print more money, the value of your dollar goes down and my btc goes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple economics bud. I'm not saying the "end is near" I'm just tired of working for something that gets constantly devalued by TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many years have you studied finance, economics, worked in the financial industry and or crypto industry? Because it doesn't sound like much at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could make the same argument about no more buyers of gold, but gold only goes up compared to the dollar over time because one is scarce and the other isn't. It's not that difficult of a concept for someone who actually studies this stuff on a daily basis.

       Youre trying to push a ponzi scheme bro. Sure theres some winners but theres more losers. And i truly wish you the best and i hope your greed doesnt back fire before you can enjoy your luck. Im not impressed by your year long cypto currency fun or what you have. So personal attacks arent needed buddy. But hey if thats what makes you feel better . clearly the big ol bank accounts haven't made you humble and the good lord dont accept bitcoin. Good luck out there.

       Perhaps not in the way you're familiar with from video games and movies but AI certainly exists.  Google (which is an AI) neural nets and deep learning.

       Basically almost all new software is taught rather than programmed. This includes speech and image recognition software, some stock trading programs, self driving cars, etc.
