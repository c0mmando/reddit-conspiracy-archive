<p>Can you source this?  Because I can hear the 911 call-taker typing away every detail and as I understand it, these notes are always provided the swat team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no, it was just an educated guess.</p>

<p>9/11 operator has to pass along info to police dispatcher, who has to pass along info to units on the street. That’s a literal game of telephone where the <em>most</em> important info is what the situation is and where the situation is. Everything else would be at risk for information decay.</p>

<p>I’m not saying people weren’t at fault. People were totally at fault. I’m just saying how that failure ended up killing somebody. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, depending on exactly how much time they have until they arrive, that may not be possible.</p>

<p>As far as I recall, SWAT units are basically gearing up as they ride to the destination. A lot like firefighters. They lounge around in their basic uniforms and have to spend the trip being briefed about the situation and prepping firehoses or guns and stuff. Listening to an entire 9/11 call eats up quite a bit of the trip that they might want to use looking at a GPS map or something (of the wrong house, in this case).</p>

<p>This wouldn’t have happened if the SWATer hadn’t said he was going to kill more people. That means every second is a potential death. If he’d just said he’d had a gun and hostages, SWAT would have been much more methodical.</p>

<p>This also wouldn’t have happened if cops weren’t <em>fucking itching</em> to shoot somebody, but that’s another debate entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s good, but howstuffworks seems to be mostly talking about situations that naturally develop from situations not requiring SWAT. Not a hostage situation which would immediately necessitate deploying SWAT units.</p>

<p>Rapid-response special weapons and tactics units are installed in many major cities. They’re generally already at police headquarters; these are dedicated units who only deploy on specific missions.</p>

<p>In smaller municipalities, SWAT is drawn from regular officers, and that would necessitate they gather at HQ before deploying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fine, but like I pointed out in the OP, every police dept in the country has known about &quot;swatting&quot; for a long time now.  To continue operating like every 911 call that triggers the dispatch of SWAT is an actual active hostage situation, etc...without being constantly vigilant of signs of &quot;swatting&quot; says to me they just want to kill someone, even if it&#39;s an innocent someone.  In short, the police/SWAT need to be held accountable and charged with manslaughter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That show took great pains to demonstrate reality through the lens of fictional characters. The writers were former cops and newspaper writers. At least one actor was an actual gang member.</p>

<p>I’ve since read actual books about the setting of the fiction, and gotten a pretty good idea about the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>So yeah, it’s fiction, but saying that was mostly just a quip, so don’t get any ideas about where I get my information about life.</p>
