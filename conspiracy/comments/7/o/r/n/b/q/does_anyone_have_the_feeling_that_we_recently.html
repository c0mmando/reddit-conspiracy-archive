        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe that Hillary Clinton losing is all due to the relatively free flow of information thanks to the internet. </p>

<p>I have been exposed to more alternative news and &#39;alternative facts&#39; this past year than ever, and was for the first time able to form my own opinion based on these new perspectives. </p>

<p>Previously, media, the self-proclaimed purveyor of truth, had very strictly been able to control thought, only exposing its subjects to a certain viewpoint that would align itself with the agenda of the mass-media. </p>

<p>Internet has shamed traditionalist media into a corner they will never be able to escape as truth of the power structure controlling the mass-media is now freely expressed on the same information avenues mass-media needed to adapt for.</p>

<p>Hillary winning would be the perfect story of how things now would be &quot;better&quot;, following how everything became &quot;better&quot; after we had our first black president.</p>

<p>She lost because the lobbyists had not figured out how to close the loop around freedom of speech completely in time after the advent of the internet.</p>

<p>Things are not perfect, but comparatively to what could had been had if not enough people understood the importance of freedom of though and speech before someone like Hillary could be installed in the White house... Damn, this is the first time in my life that I have so much hope for the future. </p>

<p>The democrats REALLY want that as a weapon to stop &#39;fake news&#39; and &#39;hate speech&#39;.<br/>
(everything that makes them look bad.  that frog is racist you know.)  </p>

<p>They worked for a decade to get that ready for use.<br/>
And it just got ripped down.  lol</p>

<p>&quot;The Spoils of War: Trump Lavished With Media and Bipartisan Praise For Bombing Syria&quot; <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/04/07/the-spoils-of-war-trump-lavished-with-media-and-bipartisan-praise-for-bombing-syria/">https://theintercept.com/2017/04/07/the-spoils-of-war-trump-lavished-with-media-and-bipartisan-praise-for-bombing-syria/</a></p>

<p>NBC journalist Brian Williams (who years ago <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCl4Y5-mfL0">lied about being shot down in a helicopter in Iraq</a>)  nearly has an orgasm over &quot;beautiful weapons.&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agSUiItNzz8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agSUiItNzz8</a></p>

<p>CNN host Fareed Zakaria said &quot;I think Trump became president of the United States&quot; after bombing Syria. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLUvhjRTpwE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLUvhjRTpwE</a></p>

<p>Last, but not least, Fox News, which routinely praises Trump and military action. &quot;More war&quot; is the one thing a lot of Pundits, regardless of party, agree on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clif High (creator of the algorithm Webbot) correctly predicted Trump&#39;s victory, due to the linguistic prediction software he turned loose on the internet. </p>

<p>One of the things High says is that not only did he see Trump&#39;s victory, he saw the elites panicking because their &quot;entrainment technologies&quot; were being disrupted somehow. It goes beyond TV propaganda, or Facebook ads, according to High. </p>

<p>They&#39;re using frequencies (from WIFI) and all sorts of other exotic technologies to game mass-psychology and behavior. It&#39;s been an effective way to subliminally manufacture consent from the public.</p>

<p>The whole suite of technologies were rolled out for Hillary, but for some reason they weren&#39;t working. Something was jamming the frequency.</p>

<p>I like to think that the mysterious change in the Earth&#39;s &quot;Schumann Resonance&quot; [i.e., the resonating frequency of the planet) had something to do with it. Like God Himself intervened, lol.</p>

<li><p>The guy thats shown disdain for the 1st Amendment by complaining about the limits on libel laws? </p></li>
<li><p>The same guy urging for journalists to be jailed?</p></li>
<li><p>The same guy trying to keep a book from being published?</p></li>

<p>What world are you living in? The guy lies constantly. Its not even subtle half truths he literally says things that are easily verifiable as total bullshit. Remember the wall Mexico was supposed to pay for?... You know, the same one Trump just made a request for $18 billion from the tax payers to fund?</p>
