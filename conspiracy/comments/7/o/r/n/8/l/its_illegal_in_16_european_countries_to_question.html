       This isn't some white supremacists or Neo-Nazi post trying to get people to hate anyone, I am in fact completely against that because that's excactly what I believe they want us to do. But making a subject illegal to discuss in certain countries should only raise questions. Should it not? Seems like a huge red flag to me. If our own government was willing to kill its own people in order to advance their agenda in the documents of Operation Northwoods, why would any of us doubt they would lie to us.

       I wonder if it would be illegal to say this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Everything that is illegal to say is everywhere and always most likely true.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Serious question. Can any experienced European lawyer answer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, is it legal to say one is “agnostic on the Holocaust?” - i.e. is it it just illegal to deny it, or do you
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to accept its reality?

       I'm polish so I mostly just know Poland's stance. Each country is different. Most just make denial illegal. I think Czeckoslkvakia and Germany also have cast doubt illegal, but this is not the standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel I know you can publicize material, basically research, about parts of it even if it casts doubt on angles as long as it's scientific.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some countries it's only illegal when publically available. Basically you're fine to say I don't know except I'm not sure of two previous countries stance. A local might need to clarify.

       Both points would depend on
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial">
        the country in question
       </a>
       - there is no general European law on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first, it would likely depend on how direct to the Holocaust is. If you are discussing more generally, it may be OK, but if the context of the remark is the Holocaust, or it is obvious that is your intent, it may be proscribed.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the latter, that would depend on the wording of the law. Most require outright denial, or are broader BUT require intent to align oneself with Nazi ideals, but there are a few where I could see being "Holocaust agnostic" causing trouble (e.g. Luxembourg covers "contest[ing], minimis[ing], justifi[ing]or den[ying]" - merely questioning it
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be seen as contesting/minimising, or Liechtenstein covering "coarsely trivialises" - not accepting it as fact
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be seen as trivialising the matter).

       This is actually a really interesting question, and makes me think of another one.  Is it illegal to say something that formally implies "the holocaust didn't happen"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ex: if I know what I'm talking about, the holocaust didn't happen, and I do in fact know what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if that is illegal to say, "it's raining and it's not raining" should be illegal to say--a contradiction implies anything, and in particular it implies "the Holocaust didn't happen" (and for that matter "the Holocaust did happen").

      <p>
       The Nazis questioned whether other races were worth keeping, they decided they weren't. They questioned if the jews were secretly sabotaging them in WW1. They questioned if degeneracy should be allowed. They questioned a lot of shit. I don't know if it leads to another war but it leads to hate for no reason other than ignorance/bigotry disguised as skepticism.

       <p>
        Do you think its possible that denying people human rights (freedom of expression) could lead to the death of millions of people?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yeah definitely but I don't know if denying history is a human right much like threatening people with violence is technically just speech but can lead to problems. Denying people religion has lead to wars, denying representation has lead to wars.

       Agreed. That there was a plan in place to get rid of the Untermenschen (largely but not exclusively made up of the Jewish population), culminating in mass murder, is basically beyond question IMO. However, the fact you can't question elements of that without legal issues is troubling (I don't find most of them to be valid questions, but people should be free to ask them nonetheless).
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, it is somewhat easy to slip from questioning parts of the Holocaust to making anti-Semitic statements (intentionally or otherwise).

       to me these kind of reactions are questionable. whether or not you believe the holocaust happened, taking people from their homes and throwing them into lengthy court trials and/or jail for their opinions is extreme. especially considering the lenient sentences rapists, abusers, murderers can end up with.

       They aren't professing an opinion, they are trying to rewrite facts about a fascist regime. You cannot hold an opinion of historical facts, you can hold an opinion on naziism but what they're doin is like having an 'opinion' on whether the ocean has water.

       You’re not getting it. The question is should I be able to speak out and make the statement that the ocean doesn’t have water without getting arrested. The statement is absolutely irrelevant, no matter how absurd, controversial or offensive it may be.

       But now imagine if a literal world war was started over the question of if water was really there or not and if deserved to exist in the first place. Look how much unnecessary harm the Armenian genocide denial has caused and ask yourself if it is really that important to engage in fascist denial of facts just so you can have a miniscule extra bit of freedom.

       But this is like a double fascist. Is it fascist to disallow fascist views of history? It isn't like they are rounding people up and asking them their beliefs, it is shutting down public acts of misinformation that help spread nazi ideology.

       First, in the eyes of freedom of speech, there are no ‘fascist views’ there are no good or bad, right or wrong views. There are only views (that you can have an any opinion on) and people have the right to express them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, a bit off topic, but you’re being disingenuous by saying that holocaust denial is a ‘fascist view’. They’re just skeptical of events, there doesn’t have to be any political alignment. Saying holocaust denial is inherently supportive of the nazis is like saying 9/11 conspiracy theorists are inherently supportive of Al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Ladin.

       I don't think a majority of people going around denying the holocaust are doing it for fun or are qualified at all to comment on history. And maybe they aren't politically aligned but they are being used to support a belief, now the Nazis can say, "hey, look at all these people that agree with us!" It is the same thing that happened with Charlottesville, republicans failed to  disavow racism for so long they had people actually marching and chanting blood and soil and the president defended them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as a last note, I'm not really for denying free speech but it seems like it was an actual problem over there with it spreading again and this is a light law to help curb it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the law requires that said speech be "qualified for disturbing public peace" either by inciting "hatred against parts of the populace" or calling for "acts of violence or despotism against them", or by attacking "the human dignity of others by reviling, maliciously making contemptible or slandering parts of the populace".

       Are you arguing that we should leave academics up to the common man? College is like 5k and 2 years part time in the US, not too much to sacrifice if history is your passion. It doesn't need to be a PhD but maybe a little more than home schooling.

       Anyone can have any opinion. Freedom of thought is closely tied to freedom of speech. Governments should be wary to limit either. 
Teachers are not free to discuss a litany of things whist in the classroom, but an individual should be allowed to hold any idea, no matter how stupid, so long as it remains an idea/speech.

       You’re so close to getting it. Speech that incites violence should not protected, there you are right. Speech that is hateful should be protected.

       It isn't "hateful words" its hate speech, it is defined in laws and taken seriously. Allow people to constantly shit on a specific group of people and it can become
       <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/stochastic-terrorism">
        stochastic terrorism

       and get people killed. It leads to shit

       Can you see the same scope of slander against male circumcision despite being a pseudo-scientific procedure that to this day still claims the lives of 300 newborn babies and mutilates many more in the US alone?

       The issue isn't whether or not there were camps where Jews were imprisoned.  That much is plain and it ins't much different than what the U.S. did with people of Japanese heritage.  The issue is whether or not the Germans systematically and intentionally murdered and eliminated 6 million Jews via gas and cremation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things were pretty bad in Nazi held territories toward the end of the war.  The allies had cut off all supplies.  Food was becoming scarce.  Diseases were being spread within the camps.  I'm sure many Jews
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       killed on purpose within these camps.  But 6 million? Systematically?  I don't think so.

       Go visit Auschwitz or any of the other concentration camps. Combine that with tens of thousands of testimonies of the people imprisoned there, worked there or the soldiers who liberated them. Something like that is absolutely impossible to fabricate and make stick for 70+ year without a single one of them breaking.

       The reason it is illegal is because hate speech is illegal and holocaust denial goes hand in hand with that. It is the most well documented and well proven genocide in human history. Read some of the material and educate yourself; I'm sure you will change your mind.

       The very idea that speech can be hate is impossible.

       That phrase is one of the greatest examples of mind control I've ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone says crazy things, you just don't listen. Or don't hang out with them. They destroy their own reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       To place someone in a cage for producing vocabulary implies the minds of his or her audience is weak beyond my wildest dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is pure manipulation and it attempts to create fear. To silence not those who speak the truth, for they always will, but to scare the herd.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no arguing this reality. Accept it or live a lie.

       What defines "hate" in your mind? Just so we are clear on the definitions.

       The problem is that someone always listens. This is why extremists can spread lies and make troubled people accept it as truth. It is easier now than ever before.

       I don't "get" hating. Dissappointment I understand. I think all hating comes from a place of not understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't think "hate" is an emotion a person is ever supposed to feel. It feels like a fabricated concept that gets pushed a lot to keep people down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way life "is" for many people now, maybe they feel it. But we were not "designed" for this. Humans are doing something wrong. We took a wrong turn somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who blindly follow must learn to think for themselves. We must teach them. We must give them the tools to achieve free will. There is much hope for humanity, but it must come from individuals' inner self.

       All authority comes from within you. Your own moral compass is very important. You can talk and listen to others, but the end-call is your own.

       I don’t give a shit about Holocaust debate or theories.  The issue here will always be about free speech. When in doubt, free speech is always better than censorship. Especially censorship that leads to prison time of its disobeyed.

       More like Nazis that want to dismantle history just like it has be done 1000s of times in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I just wanna add to this discussion that it is NOT banned either in germany nor poland to actually researche the holocaust in a scientific way. 
I think if you actually find 100% prove that no nazi crime ever happend then it shouldnt be a problem to deny the holocaust.
A big problem with the holocaust denying community is their non scientific way of working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there has be gone a lot of science into the holocaust and its pretty much undeniable. We have hundrets of thousends of victims and witnesses. We have hundrets/thousends of holocaust criminals (members of the SS, Gestapo, Wehrmacht, other german/vicyfrance/polish/italien authorities) litteraly providing sources and account for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most european countrys try to stop people from undermining and whitewashing the holocaust (which actually happens in a lot of countrys). Time is allready moving us fether away from the holocaust with everyday. Whitewashing the enitre thing would speed up the process of forgetting the valuable lesson learned from them. A lesson so horrific and brutal learned that it changed the way we view humanity aswell changed the way our goverments work and how we humans live together.

       I truly do not care about holocaust denial or acceptance. It’s not my fight and it’s full of mine fields.

      <p>
       The important part of your post is that you’re attempting to distinguish those who agree with you and those who don’t and defending the position that those who don’t, should not be allowed to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t care what issue we’re discussing, there is never an excuse good enough to justify censorship to the point that your jailing people for speech.

       Look up Fred Leuchter, he had some scientific points about the supposed gas chambers. Look into how they were designed. If your being serious you have no idea what you are talking about when you say "science". Please provide your science here because I guarantee there is none.

       What I don't understand is how actual historians have been able to revise the number of people who died in the camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the one hand, if an ordinary person says the 6 million figure isn't accurate they risk legal action being taken against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how is it different for a professional historian?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if it is different for them, and people in authority accept that the historian's new figures are more accurate than the old ones... how can they take legal action against a regular person who's pretty much saying the same thing?

       Antisemitism is a real problem and you have to look no father than 4chan for direct proof. People blame their own problems on "bankers" or literally (((them.))) Exactly what Hitler did. People naturally gravitate towards scapegoats and historically this is the worst one, besides maybe capitalists in general which Mao and Stalin killed in millions as well. In fact Stalin killed far more jews than hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway words are harmful. They are violent. They are FORCE. So are thoughts. If someone is crazy we put them in mental hospitals. If someone is sick with a contagious disease we QUARANTINE them. We need to section off and directly oppose mind viruses like holocaust denial and antisemitism before these crazy people get the ethno state or whatever it is they want. Many jews still face violence and this started off as idea first. We need to strike at the source of the problem which is the idea. Government needs to get involved in people's heads, pronto.

       If it's so true then what's wrong with questioning it. We've been victim, as a society, to untold lies and conspiracies by our governments. If it's so easily verifiable the  show them the truth. If you can't handle people being ignorant then perhaps you don't j ow enough of the truth yourself.

       In Australia it isn't even taught in schools that over a period of +100 years, early settlers killed  75% of the indigenous population.  No one denies it happened, but failure to make it a part of the curriculum only to spend months learning about WW2 - we're ignoring genocide our country was a part of.

       All the worse with the more recent understanding that they were one of the oldest living cultures on Earth.

       Banning conspiracy talk creates more conspiracy talk because banning talking about a conspiracy is exactly what people guilty if said conspiracy would want. What do these self righteous assholes think they're doing? Stopping people from questioning the holocaust? If conspiracies about powerful families had been banned,  I sure would've been way more interested in them way earlier than I was. Banning a conspiracy theory immediately gives it credibility, even one as ridiculous as holocaust denial. I'm gonna look into it now and put myself in the shoes of a holocaust denier, before it becomes illegal where I live.

       But now imagine if a literal world war was started over the question of if water was really there or not and if deserved to exist in the first place. Look how much unnecessary harm the Armenian genocide denial has caused and ask yourself if it is really that important to engage in fascist denial of facts just so you can have a miniscule extra bit of freedom.

       The issue isn't whether or not there were camps where Jews were imprisoned.  That much is plain and it ins't much different than what the U.S. did with people of Japanese heritage.  The issue is whether or not the Germans systematically and intentionally murdered and eliminated 6 million Jews via gas and cremation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things were pretty bad in Nazi held territories toward the end of the war.  The allies had cut off all supplies.  Food was becoming scarce.  Diseases were being spread within the camps.  I'm sure many Jews
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       killed on purpose within these camps.  But 6 million? Systematically?  I don't think so.
