       Yeah, the phrases are outdated and don't make much sense now (although I think they're based on the Cold War more than the WWI, which saves Spain at least).

       has an interested map that shows, technically, what countries are first world, third world, etc. It's a little amusing to see countries like Zimbabwe or Namibia technically classified as First World countries, while Ireland and Sweden are not.

       To be fair, the countries were aligned with each other pretty much the same in the Cold War as in WWII. I was always taught that First World was Capitalist countries (aligned with US), Second was Communist (aligned with USSR), and Third was.... the rest, basically.

       You sooooo desperately want him to support your racist, authoritarian collectivist narrative. It's sickening. I just threw up in my mouth. And the worst part is people like you do this under the pretense that you're helping these people. You're taking advantage of them just like they are your little pet slaves. Meanwhile people who actually want to empower the third world with free markets are demonized, SAD!

       Cant believe all the downvotes for pointing out the facts. Oh its liberal reddit I remember and they think youre a whitey being racist.  Your name looks Japanese and the self evident truth is Japanese, S Koreans, and Chinese are the lighter skinned and far more advanced of all the oriental nations.  Coincidence?  Did the evil white man make Chinese, S Koreans, and Japanese smarter, wealthier, and more culturally enriched than Filipinos and Vietnamese with the African slave trade? Progressive logic is hard to process.  I guess the first step is to ignore reality and historical evidence.

       Is it tho? I mean there are some countries out there that are just not developed at all and in fact haven't been pillaged by first world countries. Some countries are just unlucky in that their location sucks and their resources suck. So they are kinda SOL.

       I'm talking on a global scale tho dude like land ownership in Africa in this day and age is not in high demand. And agriculture can be done just about anywhere. So that wealth created sure can be good for local economies but on a global scale people aren't rushing to African land to snatch it up for the Agriculture or just because it creates wealth. There are just simply better areas to do that if you're trying to make money. Which is my whole point. On a global scale African areas are just not even close to as desirable as other areas on our earth.

       What? I feel like you're just making things up.  There has been a huge land grab going on in Africa by large agribusinesses for years.  Chiba, Europe, the US, literally everyone wants African land.  What are you even talking about?

       You linked me an 8 year old article are you aware of that? If there is more recent articles about the land grab I'd love to read up on it. A lot has changed since 2009.

       I don't even understand the point you're trying to make.  First you say nobody wants African land and farm land is worthless.  Then you say of course China and India want African land because they have billions of people to feed.  Then you copy and paste a paragraph from the article I posted that supports the OP's argument even though it seemed like you were arguing against the OP the entire time. I can't even tell what you're trying to say at this point.

       The quote I quoted was these African nations are not selling land to the people of their nation but instead selling it out to other countries. Thus in turn hurting the locals. OPs argument is that big nations raped the smaller ones and now are trying to rebuild. My point here is that these African countries are selling their land at the cost of their locals suffering. Hence the quite. "since the state often formally owns the land, the poor run the risk of being pushed off the plot in favor of the investor.." So is is the major country coming in and using power and leverage (like I talked about) to get the land or is it the small country's fault for selling themselves out?

       The way it works is that moneyed interests put leaders in power who do their bidding.  They leaders who are bought and paid for sell out the people.

       I know but why does that happen? Because the people don't have any power or their country as a whole is susceptible to abuse. All that can be stopped with honest leaders who put the people first.

       Did I? We were discussing developing nations and then you decided to say something about the poor people not doing something about it. Then you brought up the United States. Idk where I switched arguments but I know you sure did. Have a good night.

       Sub-Saharan Africa has a lot of natural resources, the only thing holding them back is low average intelligence. The Arab countries got relatively powerful for a while and they had way less in resources than Sub-Saharan Africa.
      </p>

       And that argument doesn't apply at all for India which has a rich history spanning millenia.

       After World War 2, Japan was ruthlessly destroyed and occupied by a military power that dictated its entire form of government to them.  Germany was also ruthlessly pillaged and systematically destabilized, especially by the occupation by the Allied powers and the partitioning of the sectors. (i.e. "East Germany).  There is no reason to call these countries "developing countries" and there is no correlation between "developing countries" and ruthless pillaging and systematic destabilization.  All the major powers except Britain were ruthlessly pillaged and systematically destabilized in the last 250 years, and today, they are the great powers.  These include US, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, France, and Germany.  In fact, if you follow current news, there is a theory going along that one of these powers (Russia) is attempting to politically destabilize another one of these powers (United States).   So, maybe thing about it this way... All countries have threats that attempt to pillage their resources and systematically destabilize them.  The ones with robust political systems survive and thrive and the snowflake countries fail and blame the successful countries.   But "developing countries" does sound better than "snowflake countries."

       Well 3rd world is surely used in a despective way. A lot of our problems are caused by economic stagnation and even the places that are somewhat more advanced like Argentina and Chile aren't allowed to develop their own nationalism.

       All of our problems could be solved easily if it wasn't for the elites influence.

       What many people don't know about Africa is that many Africa countries still pay "reparations" to France, largely in the form of debt (with interest) that France imposed on said Africa countries to compensate France for the improvements they made during their colonization. The French government has stated that they will never end this relationship with their ex-colonies as their economy would fail if they did. To get these African governments to agree to the obviously shit deal, the French used violent coercion in the form of assassination and extortion.

       SO you don't think there is ANY possibility that these people simply weren't as good at organizing themselves? You don't think the people were accountable at all for their actions? Was it 100 percent white man and his capitalism's fault?

       What about Venezuela who shit the bed recently? That was 100 percent outside influence?

       Strange though that colonized countries in Africa still do better than those that weren't colonized. It's also interesting that he same folks who espouse the beliefs of this tweet might suggest the US was built on free labour. At the same time some places where labour is basically free - like Africa - are subterranean shitholes. Doesnt add up. Hows south africa doing in the last 20 years lol? What's also interesting is that former Asian colonies seem to be doing better than former African colonies. Curious. Were they less ruthlessly pillaged? I don't see any tweets about that. Africas hope now is china coming in and turning it into a farm. Hell if left alone in 1000 years Africa will still be a shithole. At what point can
       <em>
        a people
       </em>
       just cope with he fact that in zero percent of the world they're successful. Like seriously. When left to their own devices where are they successful? Even with resources and a workforce. Nowhere. Zero places. Oddly china crawled out of the stone age with cheap labour and are modernizing at a rapid pace. Strange. How's Africa doing competitively? Digging up corpses to dance with them and getting the black plague. Hunting albinos. Both obvious follies colonialists brought. Traditions in Europe.

       The routes of early roads and trains were set up with radians to the interior of countries to the coasts, not to facilitate connections of their cities or people or to improve native indigenous communities, it was just one big conveyor belt to get anything of value to the ports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since these were set up, and the capitalist system mimicked in attempt to be like the west but to do that they trade away rights to the world bank and governments...It results in the same rape of the countries wealth as it did back then.

       I don't even understand the point you're trying to make.  First you say nobody wants African land and farm land is worthless.  Then you say of course China and India want African land because they have billions of people to feed.  Then you copy and paste a paragraph from the article I posted that supports the OP's argument even though it seemed like you were arguing against the OP the entire time. I can't even tell what you're trying to say at this point.
