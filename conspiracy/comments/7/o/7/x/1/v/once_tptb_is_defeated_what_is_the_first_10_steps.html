       If a revolution happened and somehow defeat the TPTB and their influence, basically the world will finally be in the hands of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So realistically, what is the first thing or first 10 steps to do as a 'reformed' government?

       Universal fucking healthcare. So everyone can get help. Plain and simple. The health industry in America is a business and that's it. Do they really want to cure you? No.. then they would lose returning customers which is great for business...
      </p>
      <p>
       Prisons need to change. As it's also a business for profit and not actually fixing the root cause of why they are there.. most prisoners release end up going back at some point. again. Returning customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our food.. pumped up with chemicals that lead to health issues. Almost as if they are the same business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idc about paying taxes as long as it actually goes to something useful and not lining political pockets.. if you don't have a 7 figure job what's the point?

       the first thing ANY gov has to do is implement a system by which its rules can mutate, and roll back.  that system HAS TO be a narrative structure.  the modes of mutation HAVE TO be limited and clearly defined.  it's appending single responsibility rules.  and you need this in a language everyone can speak so that everyone can both understand the rules and they can contribute suggestions on rule improvements.  the complexity of gov is a monster that needs to be tamed.

       hmmm.  we don't have anything yet that's human and machine readable, or written in a globally understood language.  we don't have it so that it can be modelled easily such that it's testable and predictable.  we don't have any of that shit.  really at a fundamental level our designs suck.  the single best social design we currently use (and btw it's still broken) is the legal system - which understands at a basic level the need for narrative.  but it's still written in its own domain specific language and it's not available to the average citizen, and as a result it's been corrupted (because the cohort is one of our checks and balances).  so that's a problem.  we have the means and the nerds to rewrite all that shit and we should.

       you're throwing slogans around.  tell me how you can have accurate communication
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       agreement on terms.  you simply cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
       so that removes your language critique.
      </p>
      <p>
       on the others, i haven't said anything.  so you're pigeonholing my statements into a model that you have no idea based on what i wrote if that's what i'm saying.  you're just pushing that model, which btw is not representative of what i wrote or even think, for what reason?  if the only way you can conceive of things is thru pre-packaged models that have been provided to you, then you're probably gonna have a bad time.

       this is impossible really.  what is gov but consensus on collective action. that's what it is.  consent is unavoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
       what you want is a way in which you can have a spectrum of different ideas for how to live and have them not bang against each other, particularly when they are diametrically opposed and irreconcilable.  so you need to allow self-selection so that people can choose the rules they want.

       that's The $64,000 Question! Start by "draining the swamp" as much as you can to expose the horrible slimy things which lie just below the surface, they're ambush predators like alligators!

       And so far DT's making some heavy weight moves
       <em>
        which are not being reported in Any way by the MSM
       </em>
       but that doesn't really matter as DT doesn't
       <em>
        rely upon
       </em>
       the MSM like the Cabal have for the past century so he DGAF and communicates directly to the people with his tweets ... and Q. Who imo is someone
       <em>
        very close
       </em>
       to him. The guy's a fucking enigma and few people have a solid 'handle' on him and what
       <em>
        really is motivating him
       </em>
       to do this. IMO he's a rich Patriot who wants to leave both a historical legacy for not just his kids and fam in general, he
       <em>
        really wants to
       </em>
       STOP all these fucking pizza and pasta enterprises from continuing, and he's not alone,
       <em>
        far from it
       </em>
       in fact ... there are many world leaders completely UNconnected to the Luciferian Illuminati Cabal and who would like nothing better than to see it eliminated
      </p>
      <p>
       How else do you explain the incredible displays of foreign leaders to him when he visits them? They
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       the backstory and are
       <em>
        happy
       </em>
       to help, as for most of them, they aren't in the position of power to deal with such high profile people, BUT the Don sure is!
      </p>
      <p>
       He's been dealing with the mafia trying to shake him down
       <em>
        forever
       </em>
       and to survive that takes some quality street smarts
      </p>
      <p>
       and never forget he has a few dozen
       <em>
        extremely competent
       </em>
       advisors (in their own fields) including the top NSA and the military people, including Supreme Court judges, of which he's appointed ~20 since he became POTUS
      </p>
      <p>
       and last but not least, he thinks Assange should be pardoned! What does that suggest to you about him? It's the opposite of what the DNC
       <em>
        tried very hard
       </em>
       to achieve, extradite him and lock him up
      </p>
      <p>
       What any dictator  does with 'dissidents' no?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the D's no dictator, narcissisistic sure but evil? No.. He's a fucking Boy Scout compared to the likes of the Bush's, the  Clintons et al!

       OK, lets be realistic:
      </p>
      <p>
       The so-called powers that be (the World Regime) will never be fully defeated. As a rebellion we have to be realistic about this, we have to see the world through the way of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       At best we can have the current World Regime reduced to a balanced out equal force to the people's authority. That is the basics of balance, of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a utopian world one could exterminate all evil but that is very unrealistic, even cartoonish. Those who sell you this construct or paradigm have very different plans for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       A revolution should aim at bringing balance, not at rooting out evil since that is not possible (if you can anyway, well great. Just don't aim for it or you will end up very disappointed).

       I mean the way i see it is, if USA can be expelled from TPTB's influence and actually in the hands of the people. Then shouldnt that spark a much bigger light around the world to do something. USA is like the Elite's playground, if action can be taken and somehow a dream turns in to reality. Im sure the people in UK will follow through, basically atleast The West will be 'reformed'. I no this doesnt sound realistic at all but just a thought. Now China and Russia would be the tricky ones.

       OK, so what are you saying here because you only seem to imply that it concerns "my opinions". Clearly you don't understand ?the way of truth?. The concept of ?balance?.

      <p>
       So, you have the floor, enlighten us all please, how my "opinion" is so very wrong and how you are so very correct.

       I'd seriously doubt that your "TPTB" love me, again you have no understanding of ?balance? and ?truth?, which is fine because it shows that you can at least learn much more from your own willful ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that too is the way of ?truth?. It takes a while to learn that because learning the way of truth, studying it is a very intense process. You've got to have a love for it or you won't last a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your above comment has all the symptoms of a person that is limited in his will to fully want to understand the world and way of truth.

       There have always been authoritarian rulers throughout history. Because some people feel the drive to dominate and control others. That's a part of human nature, it's baked in to society. There will always be some who seek to dominate their peers. The struggle to free the individual's will from the collectivist authoritarian society will never end so long as you want to keep living in a society with made up of human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't mean we should abide those who seek to control. We'll never "exterminate all evil", but we should still fight it when we see it. You make it sound like we should just accept that authoritarian pressure. Just because we'll never defeat it completely doesn't mean we should submit to it.

      <p>
       I never said that people should submit to oppression and authoritarian regimes. I point out that there is a natural balance between good and evil that will never go away. It can't because it is part of the natural system. Light and darkness, good and evil, male and female, up and down etc
      </p>
      <p>
       That is where it starts when we want to solve this dystopian problem, by first acknowledging that this balance exercise is real and will always be with us.

       Then we have to move on to containing the evil, the oppression and darkness so that we can harness it to stay fit, alert and sharp.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I too would like to have no evil and no oppressive regimes it simply is not realistic. We can want it but that doesn't mean we can ever get that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a difference between accepting that evil will always be there and trying to contain it and submitting to the rule of a tyrannical World Regime.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is also what I mean with the way of truth. If we can't be honest about the fact that we need to balance out good vs evil then we are not being honest with ourselves, and then we will never get to the actual balancing out of the forces that fuel us.

       The more you respond like this, by insinuating things that are not even part of the reality - not the truth by far, the more you make a fool out of yourself. I'm not even going to refute any of your insinuations because it is more fun to let you live in your bubble. THAT is super entertaining,
