    <div class="md"><p>Nah. The reason is because marijuana use breaks certain thought patterns in your mind. Makes you harder to brain control.  I think weed messes up mk ultra victims and makes them more open-minded thus making them &quot;dangerous and malfunctioning&quot;.</p>

<p>There are also other benefits like it regulating your homeostasis, etc etc.</p>

<p>Basically marijuana has the ability to mess up a lot of fake structures put in place by tptb.</p>

<p>Also side note. All addiction stems from depression. Alcoholism, gambling, drugs, etc etc. Marijuana defeats all addictions. Opiates addiction too.</p>

<p>It could singlehandledly solve our homeless issue, rampant drug abuse issues, and that&#39;s just at the bottom of society. The benefits would only trickle up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&lt;In terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state,&quot; Trump said while taking a handful of questions during a political rally at a casino outside Reno on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>His comments came hours after the third Republican debate was held in Colorado, which legalized marijuana for recreational use in 2012. &gt;</p>

<p>Well, he certainly said State issue. But I hardly see that as a campaign platform statement.</p>

<p>It ain&#39;t. Look up the town of Huntington, Oregon. What was once a dead rail town is now a thriving community all thanks to marijuana.</p>

<p>Our laws already address that. Ever wonder where your gallon milk comes from? Or your French fries? I&#39;ll give you a hint, a lot of it comes from migrant and illegal workers in agriculture states like Idaho. As sad as it is, if you like cheap groceries at Walmart, then you should be opposed to Trump/Sessions immigration and green card plans.</p>

<p>And Huntington Oregon is not all of the western states, but you&#39;re still missing the point.</p>

<p>What Sessions got was leverage.  Given the stakes for western states (i.e. they need those cannabis tax dollars) it&#39;s very likely they&#39;ll start to play ball with the feds on curbing illegal immigration.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone wants to kill a new industry - but the #1 priority of this administration is fixing immigration policy.  If California and Washington continue to play sanctuary games, you can bet that the fed will move to take away their cannabis revenue, but I don&#39;t think it will get that far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow are you down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Again - not a single law on marijuana has changed as of today.   The only thing that memo did was put this back into federal oversight.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re concerned about veterans, how about we also talk about how many of them are on the streets or not getting the funding they deserve because of the 10&#39;s of billions of dollars a year being spent on services for illegal aliens in the country.   </p>

<p>That&#39;s part of the problem too - perhaps a bigger one than marijuana therapy can solve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As of 2011 nearly 1 in 2 inmates wasn&#39;t a US Citizen.  <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2014/11/when-it-comes-us">https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2014/11/when-it-comes-us</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard different numbers - so lets cut that number in half just for fun.  Still a huge percentage of the prison population.</p>

<p>As for what percentage of those kids in school are illegal aliens, it&#39;s a hard number to get at, but even if it was just under 2%  - as this Washington Post article states, that would be 2% of a $634 billion dollar US education budget.   <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/11/21/how-many-k-12-students-are-illegal-immigrants/?utm_term=.b25a4f4ae36d">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/11/21/how-many-k-12-students-are-illegal-immigrants/?utm_term=.b25a4f4ae36d</a></p>

<p>And that would be understating it - because that tracks just latino children - not illegals from Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>Consider that Los Angeles alone made $1.3 Billion in welfare payments to illegal aliens in 2015/2016 by the cities own admission. (Don&#39;t just attack Fox News - the information is there so it&#39;s not an opinion.)  <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/03/la-made-1-3b-in-illegal-immigrant-welfare-payouts-in-just-2-years.html">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/03/la-made-1-3b-in-illegal-immigrant-welfare-payouts-in-just-2-years.html</a></p>

<p>So yeah, it&#39;s a lot of money that could be going to veteran&#39;s services, social safety net for our elderly and education for our own childrene.  </p>

<p>The Constitution is pretty clear that the states already hold that right. This is why alcohol prohibition required a constitutional amendment. That was the only way for the federal government to have the constitutional authority to mandate prohibition of a recreational drug. This is why the federal government hasn&#39;t stopped states from legalizing cannabis even going back to when it was medical only, they lack the Constitutional authority to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Between being diagnosed and dying from it, every single cancer patient is worth anywhere from $200,000 to a million dollars to the medical community and pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>And despite all of the money that&#39;s been poured into cancer research the recognised treatments are essentially what they have always been for decades on end, namely surgery, radiation and chemo. </p>

<p>In some jurisdictions doctors are actually prohibited by law and can lose their licence to practice for using or recommending any other treatments or therapies but those three even after they&#39;ve all failed and the patient is doomed to certain death in short order.</p>

<p>So yes, OP, the potential of the natural compounds in marijuana to either cure or hold any cancer patients disease at bay and the major finding but little known fact that our own bodies do in fact produce those very same compounds and have built-in receptors specifically for them to help maintain our health at the cellular and genetic levels can have a huge financial impact that doctors, hospitals, and big pharma simply don&#39;t want to risk and will oppose and forestall any progress in that direction just as much as possible until they can find some other way to recoup that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s overcoming that lack of support and repression that gives the advantage to all the others who actually benefit from keeping marijuana illegal and criminalizing and punishing ordinary users which is actually the only aspect of that which actually is detrimental to their well-being.</p>
