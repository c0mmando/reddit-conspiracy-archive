        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I will give a little bit of background of myself. I believe in things that most people don&#39;t. But I am also fairly well educated, have benefited greatly from schooling, have learned digital production in video and graphic form, have seen things with my own eyes, and also understand mathematics and physics. I also know several academics in many fields that I grew up and went to school with, and I know people in Hollywood, people that work for the news. I know engineers, geologists, physicists, mathematicians, teachers, doctors, surgeons - experts in many fields. I feel blessed to know so many talented people. </p>

<p>I often take theories with a grain of salt, and put them on a back shelf somewhere, and then I wait and see. Is there evidence or is there support? And if it passes that stage, it can grow to a belief. </p>

<p>I know we only know a fraction of what is out there, most of it is filtered down, and much of it has background stories. I like to piece together the puzzle. </p>

<p>This brings me to a lot of people in this sub. I hear people shouting that it&#39;s always CGI! That&#39;s everyone is in on the lie! That people are controlling us to their own ends, that everything is an amazingly well orchestrated, and perfectly executed psychological play, and were it not for the internet sleuths exposing &#39;CGI&#39; artifacts or &#39;green screen&#39; proof, then we&#39;d all accept the lies. </p>

<p>Some of it IS a lie. But so much of what conspiracy theorists say is indefinite proof of their narrative, is definitely NOT proof. And I wonder why people will instantly believe something, just because it goes against the common narrative. What determines a narrative that you can accept, and what determines a narrative that must be a lie? </p>

<p>I always hear that those people that I grew up with, are part of some cabal. They are part of some lie. That they were sworn in to secrecy. That my friends in media are expertly crafting computer graphics to fool people. They are definitely not. They are just as normal as you or I, they just went to school and tried to get a job like all of us. So I can say with absolute confidence that not one of them is part of some higher conspiracy. But it seems to me that people here are so detached that scientists are actually people, with families, and who are trying to get a good job and make a living. They have insecurities, they yearn for truth. So much of what they do is so mundane and normal. </p>

<p>Yet in this sub, I hear people talk about engineers and scientists as if they partake in this mysterious concerted effort to hide reality from us. None of what they know is insider info. You can learn all the math and physics you want. You can have all the access to same instruments, you can take all the same courses, you can learn all the same things they do, to HELP you think critically about conspiracies. Because yes there are plenty. But not nearly as many as you think. </p>

<p>So what makes you not critical of a conspiracy theory that is based on CGI, or that relies on millions of people orchestrating a complete lie, and what makes you think that you are alone in thinking about why or how? I ask this not to be rude, but to learn. </p>

<p>I think about things like UFOs, who killed Kennedy, shadow govts, chem trails, etc. I wonder about them. But I also do my best to understand math, political science, computer technology, graphics tech, film production techniques, human psychology and the rest. Why do the learned arts and academics not mean more to people when used as a tool for trying to debunk things? There is so much we can&#39;t explain by just looking at it and judging with just our eyes. There is so much we can&#39;t explain by just saying &quot;it&#39;s obviously CGI&quot;. There is so much more to understand than &quot;it&#39;s a massive ploy to make people do so and so...&quot;. Scientists are even more critical of themselves and the work they do because it can be disproven at any moment by someone who knows enough math or statistics. Proof must be verifiable by a second or third party always. </p>

<p>I just want to know what drives you, and what makes you know that you&#39;re right, without knowing more than you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to start a discussion - Let&#39;s start with the media. The media doesn&#39;t sell &quot;business as usual&quot;. They try to craft sensation where there is normalcy. This is common. It&#39;s called spin. It&#39;s a natural tendency to sell something. You might do it on craigslist if you&#39;re selling a used tarp. </p>

<p>You could say - Tarp used to shelter family from hurricane Irma for sale. Use it to defend against the elements and keep your loved ones safe. </p>

<p>That&#39;s spin, it&#39;s normal and it&#39;s not a conspiracy. </p>

<p>If you have 100 people selling tarps in different parts of the country, you&#39;d think there would be 100 different ads right? Well like in family feud, some things are more common than others, and you&#39;ll have a natural bell shaped curve, or a zipf curve, with a &quot;tall head&quot; and a &quot;long tail&quot; where most people say the same thing. Like - tarp used for firewood. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re objective, then this is a tarp &quot;narrative&quot; and not only that it&#39;s a mainstream narrative. It doesn&#39;t mean they got together to organize the idea that tarps are for covering firewood. It doesn&#39;t mean that tarps can&#39;t be used for another purpose like sheltering your family, and it definitely doesn&#39;t mean that the people presenting tarps as firewood covers WANT your family to be vulnerable. </p>

<p>What&#39;s my point? I&#39;m trying to say that there&#39;s something called emergent traits. Something that seems like its orchestrated, but it happens to fulfill the needs of people in a similar or like fashion independently from one another. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my argument for sensationalizing the news. But then what is the news? It&#39;s usually an hour of people telling us in an emotional way, what people are doing wrong. </p>

<p>Who decides what is being done wrong? That&#39;s also another emergent feature. When most people agree that something is wrong, like stealing, then the newscasters tell stories about it. When most people are more scared of getting assaulted on the street, than having a billionaire take away their savings, then the news covers that more. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an <em>emergence</em> of a trait, from normal group psychology. The news is always trying to be popular. It&#39;s a business. What seems like calculated betrayal, is really just a hunt for a dollar. You hear what I&#39;m getting at? </p>

<p>Basically - you don&#39;t have to premeditate 9 out of 10 of the things people think are a conspiracy for it to happen just naturally, based on what people like, and what people think people like. It&#39;s almost like it would be more unbelievable to think there&#39;s a way to communicate with everyone down to the camera men (also just dudes with jobs) and orchestrate an entire information war against people, because it leads to a couple more dollars. </p>

<p>In fact - it&#39;s the people that are placated by listening to shit music and not speaking up and taking part in educating themselves.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fact, what this is, is just the emergent solution from looking at the problem. Lion is hungry, needs to eat to survive. Zebra comes to the watering hole regularly. Lion doesn&#39;t want to spend energy searching for prey, Lion moves to watering hole. I argue that this is completely natural, it would happen 10 times out of 10, and there is absolutely no conspiracy. Zebras become Lion food so the lions can live another day, and Zebras get faster and smarter to avoid becoming lion food. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To get this out of the way, it&#39;s usually not natural except in some cases for animals to prey on animals of the same species. So humans preying on humans isn&#39;t as natural as cat and mouse. BUT - humans do prey on humans. That&#39;s not part of the question. You know? It&#39;s just where the discussion is heading. Just because they lie cheat and steal, doesn&#39;t mean everything up including why we sleep at night time is a lie cheat and theft. </p>

<p>fun fact: before electricity, people used to generally go to sleep at dark and wake up at 3:00am, called the witching hour. Some people would run errands at this time. And then they&#39;d go to bed for something called &quot;second sleep&quot;. You can google it. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t do it anymore. It&#39;s not because electric companies want to take away our 3:00am wake up. It&#39;s definitely not. Yet - the way things go, some people might start to think there&#39;s a conspiracy to change our sleeping patterns. Rather than people all just wanting to stay up past dark together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure? You can look on the sidebar next to the word conspiracy and find my “preconceived notion” as you call it. I took it straight from a very widely accepted definition. You’re being extremely unfair in attacking how I define a conspiracy. Conspiracy is not usually used to define animal hunting behaviors. I really would like to emphasize that you are putting me out because I am sticking to basic definitions. I don’t think that’s fair. And I think you are telling me things that you believe to put my statements down. I have been fair, and polite, and used the same definition for conspiracy used in the forum. I discussed animals with you, but I don’t think hunting animals are a conspiracy. I’m sorry and I won’t believe that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, dude/dudette. I&#39;m just doing a drunken ballet, reciting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know one thing; that I know nothing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All I can say, is, look inward entertaining thoughts, while not actually accepting them. If there is evidence, persue it, but... one thing I&#39;ve learned, is that the more you &quot;learn&quot; the more questions you have. It&#39;s an endless cycle, and imo, one in which we are not supposed to fully understand. That would defeat the point and purpose of why our soul beings chose to be here.</p>

<p>Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I think it is very important to never really get caught up in believing I am right.  Its more like thinking in probabilities, things are probable or they are not.  There is no conspiracy or main narrative that I take with 100% absolutism.  </p>

<p>There are a couple important strings to follow when trying to discover truth.  </p>

<p>1:  Follow the money.  One of the best ways Iv&#39;e found to find truth when stuck between two sides of the spectrum, of whatever issue is to ask &quot;who gains financially/power from this?&quot;  When someone is poised to make bank off of their version of the truth, that is a huge red flag against their &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;researchers&quot;.</p>

<p>2: Logical Fallacies.  Learn to recognize them.  When comparing conflicting truths you can safely eliminate point of view bu identifying common tactics used in their bullshittery.  Ad hominem is the easiest to see, most common, and most damning in my opinion.  Basically, people who shit-talk instead of present their viewpoint and support it with evidence end up on the losing side in my mind. </p>

<p>3: Perspective!!  Start with a diverse group of &quot;reporters&quot;/&quot;news sources&quot; that interest you and you enjoy.  (studying truth isn&#39;t worth it if you are bored)  Try to get conflicting point of view and watch how the points are debated.  If you can study all angles of an issue, you are guaranteed to get closer to the truth.  If you only hear one or two positions you may never get close.  Eventually you will find a core of sources that consistently get closer to the truth then others.  But even at this point don&#39;t believe anything at face value.   </p>

<p>4: Listen to the pundits.  After being lied to long enough via mainstream propaganda, you can get a feel for the type of false narratives that they like to spin.  You can learn allot about the globalist agenda by watching some amount of regular media. (This said, I prefer to watch 0 of the mainstream media.)</p>

<p>5: Sources.  When you have time, and especially when you are investigating a new talking head/youtube channel, check their sources on a couple of stories.  Even if they don&#39;t cite their work specifically, you can search around and see if you can find evidence to support their claims.  </p>

<p>The truth is extremely abstract and exactly subjective.  All you can really do is look at it, study it, and collect as many data points as you can.  The more complete your data set, the more dots you start to connect, the more things start to make sense.  The only way to know the TRUTH, would be to be the entire universe.  </p>

<p>Another paradox of the truth, is that the more you learn, the farther away the TRUTH seems.  In other words, you more you learn the more questions you find.  </p>

<p>In my opinion the search is worth it.  Just pay attention, learn from your mistakes, and with experience you will trust yourself and have a good idea of what is going on.  </p>

<p>There’s one thing certain with science is that it can be disproven. </p>

<p>So what you meant to say is that you distrust science journals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is when I ask you, have you written a single scientific write up? Have you learned the scientific method as a recipe for being objective and have you done your very best to not screw up? Because I have. And I can promise you there was no damned agenda except passing my class. And every single thing I learned was to make it so people like you, anybody would have full 100% transparency as to 1. My hypothesis, 2. My materials I used, 3. My exact methodology so they could repeat it themselves, 4. My exact results with statistical analysis done, 5. The discussion of what these results mean, and 5. My thoughts as a researcher. </p>

<p>I learned how to do all of this so that if you wanted you could prove me wrong using your own science and research. I didn’t go through all of that so you could scoff and mock me without even TRYING to prove me wrong. Just deciding to not believe me. This is why I don’t trust you. I give you everything from the measuring stick I used to the gender of people in my study, daring you to prove me wrong. And you just lie back in your comfy chair, behind your computer screen and say no. I’m not going to learn anything about any of what you did. I DECIDED you are lying and that’s enough. </p>

<p>That’s what the church did during the Spanish Inquisition. Except even they tried to back up their claims. You are just mocking as if you’ve earned some right. So - you lost me. You have a voice, but you don’t have my respect. Try not to defame too many people. </p>
