<p>If it came to light somehow that the earth is indeed flat, the following would happen</p>

<ul>
<li>the <strong>entire</strong> establishment pertaining to heliocentric astronomy would be discredited. We&#39;re talking about hundreds of years of &quot;research&quot; proven to be concocted BS and flushed down the toilet.</li>
<li>NASA and other space agencies would collapse. </li>
<li>Heliocentric astronomers would be disgraced and called to question. Revered figures like Einstein, Newton, Galileo, Eratosthenes and the entire ball earth gang would be exposed for what they were all along: fools claiming to be wise.</li>
<li>governments would come under pressure to explain why they had been spending tax payer money to fund fraudulent &quot;space&quot; agencies and researchers.</li>
<li>people are going to rise up and revolt. </li>
<li>people would ask <em>&quot;if they have been lying about the shape of the earth, what else have they been lying about?&quot;</em></li>
<li>religious institutions would point to their books and say <em>&quot;aha! our books were right all along!&quot;</em> and would seize power by force. Since mainstream science has collapsed, people would turn to the religious right for information on other matters.</li>
<li>this time there wont be any &quot;scientific&quot; resistance. Since, it would have been shown that the &quot;scientists&quot; are either liars or complete idiots who couldn&#39;t figure out the shape of the earth, no scientist would dare to show his face, let alone stand in the way of the religious right taking over.</li>

<p>Yea I genuinely think people would. The earth suddenly being called flat wouldn&#39;t change <em>anything</em> food isn&#39;t suddenly going to be free is it? Of course people will go to work.

<p>If the earth is flat there must be a creator who made it so. </p>

<ol>
<li>because that would make it stationary and not rotating.</li>
<li>would prove we have never been to the moon.
3.they are stealing billions for fake space programs.
4.gravity cant exist</li>
<li>All the brainwashing from media would be tossed out.
6.we havent discovered everthing on earth but are crazed to look to the stars.</li>
</ol>

<p>think about it the ISS space station never does a full 360 to show us everything.</p>

<p>How did we put man on the moon in 69 if we are stuck here.</p>

<p>if the earth is flat and stationary the whole heliocentric model falls apart.</p>

<p>The biggest conspiracy in the world is you walk on this earth yet you dont know what you are walking on</p>

<p>Right, but it does shield that object from outside sources of EM. Since its not interacting with EM signals outside of what its producing what is creating that attraction &quot;down&quot;? </p>

<p>It would be like putting some atmosphere in a jar, its separate from the wind outside.</p>

<p>Since we know that cutting an object off from all EM Signals still gives that object weight and its still attracted down we know there is another field permeating that EM shielding. We call this gravity. </p>

<p>Nope. Even those taken without a fisheye lens shows curve. Like here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RATP53l9MA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RATP53l9MA</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/2tknKav">A screenshot.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/S0kAptC.jpg">A few more with a line drawn across the horizon.</a></p>

<p>The screenshots were taken in a re-upload done by another youtuber. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;v=Pv4Hwk17F8Y">Right here.</a></p>

<p>A thing to note is that some flat earthers will use fish eye lens footage in order to make a curved horizon appear flat. Even then, you can still see the curve at the center of the camera.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The horizon is always perfectly flat and rises to eye level. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Without a frame of reference, your eyes won&#39;t be able to tell if it drops or not. You can use a theodolite to disprove such a claim.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://imgur.com/iB89TnJ">here</a>. Here&#39;s another one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXdDXou4XXM">done with a stabilized drone.</a></p>

<p>How thw fuck do you explain the moon  obviously being a ROUND object. Why would the Moon be round and the Earth be flat? </p>

<p>Wouldnt the Moon just be another &quot;flat plane&quot;? </p>

<p>Why when I can see Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and Venus do they appear ROUND? </p>

<p>Would they not &quot;flat planes&quot;? </p>

<p>Please, get the fucm over &quot;flat earth&quot; there is no fucking evidence as you and that con artist eric dubay try to portray yet there is COUNTLESS fucking scientific writings ect that explain a round planet. </p>

<p>Get a grasp on reality and pour this effort into something worthwhile. </p>

<p>The Earth is not flat. YouTube does not count as Scientific research and eric dubay (the main figure behind this modern theory) is such a con artist he also trys to say Dinosaurs arnt real and Nuclear weapons are a fucking hoax. </p>

<p>It is far beyind a joke and legitimately concerning that so many people in 2018 believe  the god damn earth is flat. </p>

<p>Demonstrate to me one simple thing that will convince me otherwise - Show me the fucking Edge of the &quot;flat earth&quot; - if you can do that you will have converted the unconvertable. </p>

<p>We have countless images of countless things leaked to thw public. You should surely be able to supply us with this very simple request. </p>

<p>We have supplied you with Scientific, Photographic and Basic Evidence since the 1700s - So surely you can supply us with this ONE piece of information. </p>

<p>I&#39;m at work, so will play this flat devil&#39;s advocate as time permits if you want, but there <em>are</em> big problems with the globe, and also yes, problems with the flat plane.</p>

<p>And at the risk of sounding gay for Dubay... He is my favorite flat earther on YouTube. Every conspiracy theorist has some hitch that will make you go hmmm, from shape shifting lizard people to nukes not being real, to the earth possibly being flat. I like him, wouldn&#39;t be ecstatic about dinner with a vegan... But wouldn&#39;t be my first to entertain.

You will still see sold in 2018 things called, &quot;levels&quot; that have water with a bubble in them. They&#39;re on cordless drills, and various other things as well, b/c water is always level, and air always rises up and center.</p>

<p>Science says the earth is roughly 70% water, so ergo the earth is at least 70% flat. Also all air would rise to the top. I know, Australia is upside down, but like u/anothername2remember (hope I remembered that right, ironic) said earlier- what are they seeing if we have both the sun and the moon in our hemisphere?</p>

<p>I also know that stars spin backwards down under, but also see the problem with that, that you can probably see for yourself right now. Assuming you have an office or computer chair that spins... put something on the floor, and pick a light or object on the ceiling. Now position yourself in the chair where your head is upside down, and spin, and you&#39;ll see that objects on the floor still appear to revolve the same way as the object looking up at the ceiling. Spinning the same direction, is spinning the same direction regardless if you&#39;re looking at the floor or the ceiling.</p>

<p>I know, ships going over the horizon, but globers always seem to show still images, while flat earthers always show video to prove zooming. Also its interested to note that&#39;s one of those contradicting logics that&#39;s always thrown at us. &quot;You can see curvature- look at sails over the horizon!&quot; &quot;We are too small to see curvature, the earth is too big for us to ever see far enough, so it always just <em>looks</em> flat.&quot; Globers always play both sides of the argument as it is fitting to them.</p>

<p>As for Australia, we can debate gravity, but I have seen the earth being flat debunked with the stars spinning opposite directions. Also the argument that they are seeing a different sky, but yet both the sun and moon can be seen in the same sky on a regular basis.</p>

<p>As for, &quot;Why can&#39;t we always see the sun in the dark on a flat Earth...&quot; You can be driving on a foggy day, and not see headlights shining directly at you, until surprisingly close. Fog is essentially a ground level cloud, so the same phenomenon applies.</p>

<p>Thats not true at all</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpAGXpusAiQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpAGXpusAiQ</a></p>

<p>Watch how the ship disappears bottom first. </p>

<p>As for zooming... Its never bothered you the limits? Or the fact that they never follow a ship for as long as possible?  Or that they are elevated? Or that youtube compresses their videos so of course you cant see ships far away?</p>

<p>I still dont understand your original experiment. Things are upside down if you are upside down?</p>

<p>Why does the southern hemisphere have entirely different constellations? </p>

<p>Riddle me this then. </p>

<p>How can the sun illuiminate the bottom of the clouds if it never sets? Like so:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Wm7tgr.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/Wm7tgr.jpg</a></p>

<p>So two phenomena are happening in that image that are not possible if the Earth is flat. </p>

<p>First the bottoms of the clouds are being illuminated secondly that mountain is casting a 90 degree shadow. If the sun never goes below the horizon how is that possible?</p>

<p>Yes, I looked up your rare event of selenelion, (which still isn&#39;t explained on round earth) but I was referring to the common occurrence of <a href="https://goo.gl/images/mlb7HW">this.</a></p>

<p>Again, it appears everything else can easily be explained by distance, and the law of perspective. The clouds and mountains are closer.</p>

Critical thinking requires looking at all sides of an issue, 1 photo proves nothing really. I&#39;m not telling anyone to believe the earth is flat. All I think is people need to do their own research, thorough research, not just what NASA, who started right after Admiral Byrd came back from Antarctica with tales of endless land without ice and riches beyond belief. Then came the Antarctic Treaty which is the only thing 53 countries agreed on. It&#39;s a hell of a lot more than a photo.</p>

<p>Sure we can. What are your thoughts on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkhxPm15PFo">how weight has been observed to change with latitude</a>, or even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy0erMiS6xs">demonstration of the Eötvös Effect in aircraft?</a> It makes perfect sense with what we know with gravity, as well as the Earth&#39;s rotation (Such as objects weighing less on the equator and more the further north/south you go).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6D9uyaIuYA">The curve of the Earth is factored in flight plans by international pilots</a>, and they also use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_H2PzgwOaU">globe models for accurate navigation, such as WGS84.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V03eF0bcYno">You can even do a simple Sun angle experiment on the equinox with multiple observers.</a> It matches the globe model and its predictions, while at the same time not making sense whatsoever on a flat earth. If you take into account that the Sun doesn&#39;t change in angular size or speed throughout the day when viewed through a solar filter, and that in the equinox the Sun will rise due east and set due west regardless of of ones latitude, then it just becomes worse (Go ahead and try to model it).</p>

<p>The spinning ball is an incredibly accurate model of reality which can make predictions. What type of relevant model, map or predictive power do flat earthers have that compares to it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. The hostility I see around here toward anyone &quot;they&quot; disagree with baffles my mind. I don&#39;t comment much for this very reason, you say something conspiratorial and you&#39;re a shill or a bot or you&#39;ve only commented X number of times or your account is too new blah blah blah.
On topic: you have a Christmas tree full of ornaments, most of them are round, does that mean every single ornament ever will always be round? Because we look up at the sky and the moon and sun are round, does that automatically mean the earth is round? Going with that thought process, that the earth is round because the moon and sun and any other planets you can see are round, they why aren&#39;t stars round too? 
I&#39;m not on either side of the argument but I&#39;m open to any ideas and I don&#39;t get angry if someone has a different opinion. BUT, I have questions about the official narrative, why are there no actual photographs of the earth from space that are not photoshopped? How in the world did NASA lose all the footage of the moon landing? Wouldn&#39;t that footage be kind of important? Is there a difference between a ball and a circle? Why are we able to sometimes see the sun and moon at the same time and what are they seeing &quot;down under&quot; if we can see them both at the same time? Why do people assume there is an &quot;edge&quot; if indeed the world is flat? Why aren&#39;t people allowed to go to Antarctica, I mean anywhere in Antarctica, not just the areas some higher-ups have decided we can go? What did Admiral Byrd see that caused him to say there is more land beyond the ice wall than there is &quot;in the world&quot; and it is rich with all kinds of useful stuff and how in the world did 53 countries come to an agreement with The Antarctic Treaty when we can&#39;t even get 53 people on this board to agree on 1 thing without fighting?
These are just a few of the questions I have and there is absolutely nothing wrong with questioning anything. There is nothing wrong with people having different opinions. There IS something wrong with knee-jerk reactions and ridicule just because you question something. This is just me asking a few questions, I, and I alone, approve this message. And I don&#39;t care what anyone else believes because everyone is allowed to think and/or question anything you want. Isn&#39;t that basically the reason for places like this? Hostile snark does no good for anyone but the snarker who maybe gets a kick out of riling people up. This, my friends, is my opinion. The world, regardless of it&#39;s shape, would be a pretty boring place if everyone agreed with everything, disagreements, reasonable disagreements without insults, lead to conversations and exchanges of different viewpoints. Why is that a bad thing?  </p>

<p>In my opinion believing the flat earth is fine, convincing others its flat is my problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m open to FE more and more each day, but I find it obnoxious to try to convince anyone of anything, especially something like this. We can both look up at the same sky and possibly see different things, here&#39;s a ridiculously extreme example given to me by an 8 year old girl that blew my mind: my eyes are blue, her eyes are green, do we both see the exact same color sky looking thru my lens of blue and her lens of green? FE is a crazy concept to wrap your mind around, it took me months to even consider the possibility so I set out to debunk it by doing as much research as possible, and not just a few YouTube videos. One thing leads to another and all of a sudden something that seemed insane starts to make a bit more sense. I would never try to convince anyone of anything, everybody has to believe what they believe, nothing wrong with that. Maybe my Catholic school upbringing makes me more susceptible to certain ideas, some people believe the Bible is a Flat Earth book with all the firmament talk, but we probably will never know in our lifetime.</p>

That is what science is, because if you look at what science tells you about the earth its off so they go and create another theory to explain that one, take each step and critically analayze it, im not trying to cause an arguement or trying to convince you.

    <div class="md"><p>Just out of curiosity, have you ever sat on a beach and watched a ship &quot;disappear&quot; over the horizon? The mainstream line of thought is the ship disappears over the curve (even though it comes back into view with a telescope or zoom lens), there are mathematical equations that tell you how the curvature is calculated, so okay, that can work looking straight ahead, but what about when you look from side to side? I&#39;ve yet to see any sign of curvature looking side to side and I live near the ocean, spent a ton of time staring at what looks like a straight line.
As far as the Bible is concerned, we have to remember there are eleventy million translations of the Bible, as well as many many books thru the years that have been left out of the Bible. From my understanding, not saying I&#39;m right, but from my understanding, we have to go back to the original unaltered Bible in its original language, I just went to Catholic School, studying the Bible in its original unaltered form and language? Way over my head. I just like discussing things.</p>

<p>Yes, visiting a friend in Florida a few years back we fucked around with his telescope at his condo on the beach. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lets think this through. At sea level if we lived on a ball what would we expect to see at all points around us? A straight line. </p>

<p>That is what we expect to see even if we live on a ball. Think about being very small and standing on a beach ball, why would the horizon curve? Its the same distance from you at all times, a straight line. </p>

<p>This is why its important to understand the context. You think ancient peoples really knew anything about a dome over the Earth? They had no way to experience it even if it were true. They were talking about the sky</p>

I love a good conspiracy and I figure, whether something ends up being true or false, it fills my mind with ideas I may be able to use in the fictional worlds I create. Even the whole moon landing conspiracy fascinates me and my Father worked on the guidance systems for Apollo 11 etc, he worked for a time with Werner Von Braun (sp?) but until the day he died, my Dad told me nothing even though I&#39;d beg him to tell me something.

    <div class="md"><p>True, it is hard to rationalize 2+2=5 when you know it has been proven for a millennia that 2+2=4. It can be frustrating for sure. I think we should practice ignoring their claims or only responding civilly with something credible. A lot of people dislike censorship and for good reason, too, but I think there should be censorship for negativity, albeit negativity is subjective to everyone and the idea of it could be abused to allow full-scale censorship.

    <div class="md"><p>The more important point here is that 2 represents a natural, unchanging quantity by definition. And four represents a natural, unchanging quantity by definition that just so happens to be twice as much as 2.</p>

<p>What FE Idiots do is question <em>the definition</em> so they can believe their fairy tale. They&#39;ll say, &quot;well, what if 2 isn&#39;t always 2?&quot;</p>
