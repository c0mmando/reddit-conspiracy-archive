    <div class="md"><p>25 years ago, if you would have asked a random American about something like the Federal Reserve, they would either have looked at you in bewilderment or they would have conveyed that it&#39;s how the Treasury Department handles our money. Today, much more of the American population is aware of the scam. We are now at a stage where the media is forced to manage the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; due to the sheer number of people who are now conscious of how deep the elite&#39;s manipulation  of society is. The elites would love everyone to go back to sleep, but with the advent of the internet, it&#39;s just not possible for that any longer. They must now manage the public perception using the very same tool that helped them wake up to the corruption. </p>

<p>Enter people like Alex Jones and David Icke. These characters have taken on the leading roles as the leaders of the awakening masses. They both also portray themselves as the clown, in order for the media to have an easy target to discredit. Is it any wonder why the mainstream media gives these types of characters so much time on television, while the other lesser known corruption researchers get banned from platforms yewtube, facefuck and twatter and thrown down the memory hole? It&#39;s very interesting that suddenly both candidates for US president in 2016 either mentioned Alex Jones or were in direct contact with him. Think about that.  </p>

<p>They are still trying to get away with their corruption any way they can, for as long as they can and they are forced to use the internet to do it...for now. Eventually, the internet alone will not save them because people still speak to each other face to face, which is much more powerful than any form of media and is something they can not stop. Talk to your family and neighbors in person about the subjects that you feel important. Do it tactfully and tastefully, don&#39;t bully them into your point of view. Some may brush you off, but some will eventually listen. I&#39;ve witnessed it firsthand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s...surprisingly accurate. You could also compare it to boiling a frog. Give them a little heat at a time and they won&#39;t jump out. But turn up the heat all at once and they flee. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not just the elite who can gain from this though. Half the reason I look through conspiracies is to connect narratives and follow the money. If you invest in the right narrative, you can get a large return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets see this from two initially different perspectives that eventually merge:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You monetize the hype and controversy, this stuff sells like crazy</p></li>
<li><p>You put it out there but with a twist, like yes this or that happens but not for the reasons that conspiracy theorists say. Such case it is with the latest movie Geostorm. &quot;Yes we have such geoengineering facilities but only to protect you. The theorists call them geoweapons but that is of course preposterous.&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By admitting and twisting the &quot;theory&quot; they defuse the truth bomb, at least in the perception of the general public.</p>

<p>Eventually it works great to condition people to anything.</p>

<p>Give them a few &quot;whistleblowers&quot; that &quot;expose&quot; how the government is spying on us and a few years later the people couldn&#39;t care less anymore about it. They are used to it, it&#39;s become old news and part of their lives.</p>

<p>You put war on TV news for a few decades and eventually most folks find it perfectly normal that  the world is constantly at war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s called controlling the narrative. 911 caused a big spike of distrust in the government.  Then the world found out nsa was spying on us. </p>

<p>Nothing is done without reason!
It’s just a guess at this point but I think the government is testing something truly horrific for the purpose of protecting against terrorism. This is due to the time lines leading up to 911. </p>

<p>Start at 1990’s
A: depression medication became rampant 
B: prescriptions to children and teens became normal 
C: 911 happens
D: nsa spy’s on the public
E: terrorist groups are created and funded by our government.
F: heterosexual, whiteness,males, gender roles and families are attacked in media and education 
G: society flips then gays, transsexuals, black live matter, communist, feminist start to attack what society considers normal. Media follows, education follows and society starts to follow.</p>

<p>What’s the point?
To create a mentally unstable generation who believes the government is lying to them. The nsa’s job is to collect data on these people’s lives” Facebook and smart phones invented during nsa program”.
Terrorist groups who hate America and Americans are funded and used to consolidate power in middle eastern countries. Endless news cycles about terrorist!
Mentally unstable generation of children reach college. </p>

<p>If I had to guess is that they want terrorism to happen!
They want people to revolt against them. My guess is AI control  system designed to predict and protect the government. </p>

<p>I remember waking up must have been Monday morning, turned on CNN and heard &quot;Conpiracy theories&quot;  and switched it to MSNBC and also heard &quot;Conspiracy theory&quot; being used, I got a little giddy lol.  Anyway, I remember telling my friend that day, &quot;Looks like they declared war on conspiracy theorists.&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m about 70% sure that they started harping on &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; the day before Trump Jr&#39;s comments came out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason is to smear the legitimate conspiracies by associating them with the more far-out ones, like (no offense people) shapeshifting reptiles and flat earth. So that if you question the official narrative, you&#39;re labelled and lumped together with the most far-fetched crazies (who are probably plants anyway)</p>
