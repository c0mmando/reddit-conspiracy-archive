<p>Not necessarily. Anti-Matter and ways of &quot;warping&quot; space have been proposed as FTL candidates. If you can believe that the Universe has no end, why can&#39;t I believe that FTL travel might be possible in the distant future?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Actually, by listening to and mapping the CMB radiation we <em>can</em> look back pretty damn far, to about 360,000 years after the Big Bang based on inflation and our current understanding of the Universe and Physics. The CMB is the remnant of that expansion, the residual noise of radiation the universe left behind in its expansion. This tells us quite a bit about the Universe itself.</p>

<p>That said, I think that rather than multiple Big Bangs within the context of our own Universe, it is far more likely that what we understand as the Big Bang is really the opposite end of a Singularity at the center of a Black Hole, which is what Holographic Theory seems to point towards- that all Information in a 3d Space can be encoded on its 2d edge. This would be analogous to a Black Hole and its Event Horizon. I think it&#39;s possible our Universe exists within a Black Hole and that all Black Holes may contain Universes.</p>

<p>Bigbangs on top of each other would cancel the previous one thus making it impossible to know what was before.</p>

<p>Holographic comes close leonard susskind is on the right track but it will lead to 2d universe and that means simulations.
so in a sim you need some kind of clock speed to run it all . speed of light is related to the clock speed of the sim. if in one cycle the process is not calculated because of too difficult of a calculation the speed of light is broken. thus no FTL</p>

<p>The reason I don&#39;t think this has to is because we have physical phenomena in our own Universe that can explain these rules. This doesn&#39;t require an exterior force. If a Black Hole and its Event Horizon can describe the connection between 2D/3D I don&#39;t think we need to say we live in a simulation...I think we could jsut accept that the Universe and its dimensions work on a deeper level and are intimately connected. Which would also eliminate the need for the overarching CPU to &quot;regulate&quot; the Universe and thus allow FTL.</p>

<p>I think you and I agree on a lot more than we realize, I just don&#39;t think the Universe is infinite. </p>

<p>Feynman said there are only particles in this world, yet we know of waves. where are the waves? they are not here. If an particle is not seen it is everywhere until it becomes an particle, speaking of infinities. luckely they go into + and - and cancel each other out, maybe the same goes for the universe</p>

<p>Maybe from a Philosophical POV, but as far as modern Astrophysicists are concerned the math checks out and the Universe does have an end. I agree that for all intense and purposes, it seems endless, and as far as the human life is concerned it is, but in reality it <em>does</em> have an end, just as it had a beginning. It is expanding, which means it is constantly going from a current state into a new one. If we had the technology to travel FTL (and I mean super FTL), we could conceivably reach the edge of the Universe. The fact that it is expanding means it isn&#39;t endless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, we are talking about differences between Philosophy and Science at this point. The Math and observational results of our own part of the Universe support that it isn&#39;t endless...the standard model and modern Physics in general doesn&#39;t support an endless Universe theory.

For example, think about the size of an electron and how far away it is relative to other electrons. Sure, our universe is expanding, but what is it expanding &quot;into&quot;? Our concept of our universe itself may be limited in scale by our understanding of what it actually is. There may be an infinite number of big bangs existing for an infinite amount of time.

<p>You can&#39;t use the word likely in this context because there is no information to base that on. We have explored one planet pretty well, it has life (including us). When we explore some others and find something then we will know.</p>

<p>OTOH; if we explore and don&#39;t find anything that still won&#39;t tell us much because of the huge numbers of planets. But term &quot;likely&quot; is meaningless here.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time working with probability and statistics so maybe you can help me here.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say there are 10<sup>12</sup> planets (someone else&#39;s number but it&#39;s probably as good as any). There is one of those planets that is known to have life. There is no other information.</p>

<p>Could you show me how you would calculate the &quot;Laws of probability&quot; that any of these other planets has life from that information? Could you post the equation?</p>

<p>You are correct, there is a 1 in 1 chance there is life on earth. All other planets the answer is null.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a college work study job in the mid 1970&#39;s working at the small local airport. It was sparely used by small private planes and in the summer, fire fighting aircraft. Generally a pretty backwater place, small town of less than 10,000.</p>

<p>My duties largely consisted of punching holes in new FAA releases to file in binders, and tearing off the airport weather tickertape. I did this every day for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>My boss was an old timey FAA geezer waiting to retire; straight, square, and government drone through and through.</p>

<p>One day he handed me a government business card. It was a 1-800 report a UFO hotline call card. I didn&#39;t know why he gave it to me and I looked at it with question and put it in my wallet. I kept it slotted in a pocket of my wallet for years.</p>

<p>One day I made a call at pay phone and left my wallet in the phone booth. Not knowing it was even missing, I got a call from a local Good Samaritan who had found my wallet in the phone booth and wished to return it to me. He came to my house and gave me back my wallet, refusing any kind of reward (I was a poor student in a sad state of housing.)</p>

<p>After he left I looked through my returned wallet - everything was there. Drivers license, cash, bits and stuff, all there.</p>

<p>The call 1-800 UFO card was gone. I&#39;ve never seen another one.</p>

<p>Just sayin&#39;.</p>

<p>I don’t recall any face to face communication with any ETs or anything like that.  What Jim Sparks relates in the video that’s in the second link I posted is honestly pretty amazing.  He says he’s almost always fully awake during everything that&#39;s happened to him.  That’s incredible.  In my case, I was a young kid and was absolutely terrified as it was all happening.  It’s the most frightening thing that’s ever happened in my life by far - and I&#39;m middle aged now.</p>

<p>That said, I don’t recall ever actually being harmed.  I was frightened simply because I had no idea what was going on, what was happening was completely like nothing I’d ever experienced before or since, and nothing was ever explained to me while it was happening.  Wish it would have been.  That would have likely helped a <em>lot.</em></p>

<p>Frightening/traumatizing as it was or not, however, I am A) utterly fascinated by ET existence on and around this planet now, and B) I absolutely <em>know</em> (not &quot;believe&quot; - know) that ETs exist here.  No question.</p>

<p>We are <em>beyond</em> not alone.</p>

<p>We have Mythology, Rumor and Witness testimony - None of which are PROOF of E.T life existing on, in or around Earth. </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we wait for #1. Disclosure or #2. Actual Contact? </p>

<p>UFO is not assumed to be anything apart from exactly what it stands for. </p>

<p>It is people that watch too much TV that go ahead to assume Aliens, Aliens, Aliens. </p>

<p>I live 1km from Australias largest Airforce base and let me tell you this - some of the shit they have is mindboggling. No doubt Humans have ALOT of secret tech that has not been shared with the public. </p>

<p>Elon Musk said something at this one conference about how it would take 10 million years for an advanced species to colonize the galaxy with von neumann probes, and that&#39;s at sublight speed. He went on to conclude that they&#39;re likely watching us and we&#39;re not smart enough to know that.</p>
