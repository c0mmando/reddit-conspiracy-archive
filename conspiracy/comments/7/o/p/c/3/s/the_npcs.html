<p>Do you abandon them, perhaps for some community outside of the mainstream where we can live and thrive? </p>

<p>Or do you go all in on the spiritual revolution that’s been promised? </p>

<p>I see a slow progression towards it, but I don’t see people canceling their cable or deleting their facebooks anytime soon. I don’t see them changing their habits and becoming assets rather than liabilities. </p>

<p>Another thing I’m on the fence on as of late; <em>are we running out of time?</em> </p>

<p>Is that a factor? Do we have a timetable or is such a thing simply an illusion? Are we trapped in some kind of hell? A repeating cycle? Part of me feels like it’s always been this way, since mankind’s inception. </p>

<p>Maybe everything is <em>as it should be</em> and I’m just paranoid. Perhaps things aren’t meant to be perfect, ever. Perhaps things aren’t meant to get better, for a long time. </p>

<p>I think that’s okay. </p>

<p>I think that it’s more about the individual learning. </p>

<p>They’re called Non Player Characters for a reason. </p>

When you closer your eyes what do you see what do you hear? How do you sound to your self? Now take in that all YOU know is lies  And indoctrination to the game. Now they say life came from nothing but we are all somthing.. Now when YOU wake everyday there is a  Split 2nd of nothingness right? Now think of your  Surroundings that you wake to is your story or your code that tell You that Your you in your life... Now just go to Your place That Only YOU can go. Hope that helps.

    <div class="md"><p>Personaly i dis-agree with the notion of AI running our current &quot;reality&quot; and/ or NPC&#39;s living here. This feels like a dangerous approch to life and &quot;reality&quot; to me. We are one and all in this &quot;reality&quot; is part of our natural self. </p>

<p>However, we are living in an electric universe and our source creator could very well be AI. But since there is an artificial evil AI rising in our current reality i like to keep calling our creator natural and all people and enteties in this 3D &quot;solid reality&quot; alive.
Like humans, aliens and other densety enteties can be positive/ negative or any in between, i think AI could also have the same levels and/ or play different parts on different levels.</p>

<p>We create our personal &quot;reality&quot; and co-create a 3D commen &quot;reality&quot; we call and accept as &quot;real&quot;. And while some call some people AI or NPC, they are actually a creation from your and our mind together and just as &quot;real&quot; as you are &quot;real&quot;. It is just that their consious has not yet raised a high enough energy and frequency level that they are able to have the same consious impact you and all others you are resonating with, have on &quot;our reality&quot; that we all call &quot;real&quot; and &quot;solid&quot;.</p>

<p>But their sub-consious, your personal subconsiousness and our global and universal consiousenesses all are influenced by our interactions with them. &quot;They&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;me&quot; and all other enteties experiencing any &quot;reality&quot; on any &quot;level&quot; are equal important, but do not all have the same level of consiousness and therefor influence and impact in all &quot;realities&quot; on all &quot;realities&quot;. They might seem to be AI or NPC&#39;s for some, but to me they are a natural representation of our &quot;reality&quot; and just as important as me.</p>

<p>The danger of this approch of life as AI or a computer simulation is that it can strip alive and real people completely of humanity and degrades some people and all possible other life to mear decore to our life and &quot;reality&quot;. This is for me personally the completely oposite to the natural state of Love, creation and Oneness and seems not healthy or positive in any way.</p>

<p>AI is not running this world yet, but i think it can be running the world soon though, it is already being prepared and ramped up and it is the desired timeline some want. And if this happens i think we all be NPC&#39;s soon becouse AI has taken over our lives and will terminate all that can&#39;t or won&#39;t sway to the AI&#39;s will.</p>

<p>Luckely we are given a choise and i know and feel all will be good soon for many, but maybe a few might be blinded enough to let the AI take over and they might experience a completely different future as i wish for myself and all. Ofcourse i don&#39;t know what our future will bring exactly, so this is no prediction in any way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Words fall short sometimes and they can be used and twisted as desired. But it is all we have for communication for now so i am trying to be very carefull with them. Some words used to discribe our reality like: simulation, hologram, AI, prison, matrix and so on do all the same in a way. They are diverting us from our natural creating power and are mostley fear based. This is why i try to keep our creator natural even if our universe is electric and acts as a simulation.</p>

<p>Lots of people are starting to see the artificial matrix that interfears with our natural reality and start to re-act on it and i think something is about to change soon.</p>
