       The fanfict dossier was so fanciful only BuzzFeed (the bastion of truth) would publish it. And every comping-at-bit, Trump-hating journalists would have given away nonessential body parts to break a Trump-killing story -- But they could not verify any of it. In fact, they probably smelled a rat, and stayed away.

      <p>
       Pay to play is the now legal,  but corrupt practice employed by politicians to shake down donors for huge speaking fees,   huge donations,   and other "favors" (bribes) in order for these donors/corporate sponsors to be able to have access to politicians and input into the creation of new legislation.    In other words,  the  rights citizens are supposed to have are being sold off to the highest bidders,  and citizens do not have input.    Citizens United gives "free speech" status to money in politics.

       Yeah,  but the DNC and its hacks in the FBI were so certain that it would stop Trump from getting elected that they called it their "insurance policy" despite the fact that Hillary's campaign was totally anemic.

       They're two different things. The dossier wasn't the "insurance policy". The "insurance policy" was the FBI having plans in place to continue investigating Russia if Trump won and tried to shut them down.

      <p>
       Those plans were not the dossier, which was oppo research paid for by both the Republicans and Democrats before the FBI was given a copy to investigate.

       Oh,  bs.    Now you are splitting hairs when we know that either way you say it,  its the same damn thing,   the FBI having a political agenda to stop Trump from interfering in the deep state agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really needs exposing is how the US was using ISIS against Assad.    What really needs explaining is how the US has been eliminating secular states in favor of Islamist regimes that are taking over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump needed to have some guidance,  that's what it came down to.    Lynch and Bill Clinton were seeing to it that it would be there,  whatever you want to call it.

       I'm not splitting hairs, I'm telling you that the "insurance policy" wasn't "the dossier". It doesn't even line up with the timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "insurance policy" was for if Trump got elected, the dossier was released
       <strong>
        before
       </strong>
       Trump got elected. Their "insurance policy" was plans for keeping the investigation alive after Trump won so he couldn't just trash it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's wild is how nefarious you believe that is. What would you say if the FBI had plans to protect an investigation into Clinton from a President Clinton, had she won? Would you object with the same scenario if it we're just reversed? Do you believe a President is above the ability to be investigated for potential crimes?

       Its dated a week before the Bill Clinton meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch,  it was commissioned by Bill Clinton's wife's campaign,  surely with her knowledge!

       I am all for putting Trump in jail,  but these clowns are making a mockery of the justice system,  which is going to come back and haunt all of us.

       Also look at the FBI guy that Mueller had to fire because of conflicts of interest.    The credibility of this kangaroo court is laughable,  when the people doing the investigation are so incompetent and such political hacks.

       You don't care,  do you?    Would be fine with Obama or Hillary continuing the genocide and war crimes in your name as long as its Democrats,  huh?    I am done with both corrupt parties.   These needless wars are why there are millions more refugees now than any other time in history including WWII.   Oh,  and what they did to Bernie,  all the pay to play,  what a sham of scum.    Both sides belong in the same damn prison.

       You're all over the place. All I'm saying is that the dossier and the "insurance policy" aren't the same thing. Look past your outrage for one second to realize that these two things shouldn't be conflated.

       How do you know what the insurance policy means?   How do you know the dossier wasn't part of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And insurance policy would be whatever it took to keep the investigation open or to cause a meaningful indictment.    You don't know what you are talking about.

       At least I know its a sham.   You seem to think there is some substance to it,  as if Trump actually is a foreign agent,  man,  talk about delusion.

       Russian collusion rabbits are red. Steele dossier rabbits are yellow, so I just figured it out Red plus yellow equals orange. A very fitting color indeed. Stop chasing orange rabbits. I’ve been told on various social media platforms when referencing the Clinton Foundation and the Awan Bros spy ring in Congress to “stop chasing white rabbits.”

       I think he's a racist who allows wealth and success to override his racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: He has to choose between a average wealth white man and a very wealthy black man, he'll choose the wealthy person because he thinks that puts himself in good company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has has to choose a poor white person or a poor black person? He'll choose based on skin color if wealth isn't there to help him.

       Finally, someone asks a pertinent question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care a rat's ass about Trump or Clinton. We need to get to the bottom of this DNC treason.

       Thank you.

        They're two different things. The dossier wasn't the "insurance policy". The "insurance policy" was the FBI having plans in place to continue investigating Russia if Trump won and tried to shut them down.

       Oh,  bs.    Now you are splitting hairs when we know that either way you say it,  its the same damn thing,   the FBI having a political agenda to stop Trump from interfering in the deep state agenda.

       What really needs exposing is how the US was using ISIS against Assad.    What really needs explaining is how the US has been eliminating secular states in favor of Islamist regimes that are taking over.

       Trump needed to have some guidance,  that's what it came down to.    Lynch and Bill Clinton were seeing to it that it would be there,  whatever you want to call it.
