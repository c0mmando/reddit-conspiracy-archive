        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I went to the grocery store, man, was it awful. I haven’t been in while. I liked to stay stocked up on food. Literally walked in with the intention of smiling at every person I crossed paths with. (I did this last week at the mall, just an experiment; I wore headphones and simply smiled at random people). One singular lady repaid the kindness. </p>

<p>And she worked there, so who knows how genuine it was. </p>

<p>I recently moved to a small(ish) town. I thought it was supposed to be friendier? I mean literally half of these people have some kind of disability and probably assumed I was making fun of them, simply by smiling at them. </p>

<p>On a side note, I’m noticing that obesity is becoming a major problem. The grocery store I went to has cheap products and was very busy. The produce section, where I was, was almost compeltely empty. Hordes, and I mean hordes, of people were stacked around the cookies and cakes sections. It’s like, do you guys understand? That’s likely why you are out of shape, or even why you have a debilitating condition.</p>

<p>My father is 46. He’s in the hospital right now for a condition related to diet. I’m not sure how to tell him that fast food and little Debbie’s do not makeup a sufficient diet. </p>

<p>We’re literally killing ourselves with the food we eat. I’m just not sure what it’s gonna take for the people to see that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. Obesity is only really a major issue in the West, and even then only in parts of the West- the US and UK are the worst offenders. Small(ish) towns can still have plenty of assholes, what you want to do to truly test it is to avoid the supermarket- no one <em>wants</em> to be there in the first place- instead go to a community event, where people want to be around other people, and do your same thing. I&#39;m willing to bet you get a completely different reaction from almost everyone.</p>

<p>I agree 100%. The suburbs are far less welcoming and &quot;communal&quot; than urban communities. I&#39;ve lived in Middle Class Suburbs, Upper Class suburbs, and inner city &quot;campus&quot; suburbs...and by far my favorite was the city/campus suburbs. People were always willing to talk, always out on their porches, there were community gardens...the works. There&#39;s something missing about outer-ring Suburbia imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll look into the recommendations, but I know the truth of your statement from first hand experience. My parents bought their house in 2000. They were the 5th house in the whole new build development. 2008 hit the neighborhood hard, and since about 2010 everyone who has sold/lost their house has done so to a landlord. No one is buying the houses to live in, they are renting them out. In a neighborhood of more than 100+ houses, my parents are among about 10 that are still <em>owners</em>. The rest are renters. And predominantly immigrants, which isn&#39;t really an issue in and of itself, but is more an extension of the socio-economic changes facing the neighborhood and country at large. </p>

<p>Suburbia is changing, and not for the better. 2016 was the first time <em>ever</em> where more poor lived in the suburbs than in the inner cities. The wealth is contracting and concentrating, and the tastes of the new generation of Millennials are changing as well...people want community, they want mass transit, they want compact and easy to access jobs. The suburbs just don&#39;t offer that. I shudder to imagine what the Suburban Ghetto is going to look like...it is going to be a hell. </p>

<p>I imagine it&#39;ll basically be like what small towns are like now. Drug addled shitholes that no one should live in but people do for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that suburbs largely just exist because of insane zoning laws that make it nearly impossible to build and then the large developers are the only ones who can make it through the red tape by creating the same stupid work plan, safety plan, storm water plan, etc template for every property.  At least in California if you are just a dude with $150k in the bank, property and the skills to build a house then you are probably not even going to be able to build your home or at least it will be too expensive and time consuming to be worth it.  The [Soviet] &quot;developers&quot; swing in and up comes a Walmart next to the suburb.  Oh, don&#39;t forget about tiger salamanders.  This is why modern developers are so vapid.  Also there is nothing within them worth walking to and this also means you will not be getting exercise doing casual things in your, you know, life.  To get exercise always means actively doing something that is in itself completely pointless.  So instead of &quot;fat&quot; people being just the happily pudgy ones they instead become quite obese.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, the not smiling back thing can be a cultural thing. For example, New Yorkers(city) don&#39;t really do that but they aren&#39;t necessarily bad people. Ask them for directions and they&#39;ll usually stop and tell you how to get there.</p>

<p>Regarding what you said about poor diet. One word. Addiction. Namely, sugar addiction(guilty as charged.) There&#39;s a reason why super markets have cakes near the entrance and candy near the check out isle. The people who run these businesses know that it&#39;s a drug and most people don&#39;t have the self-control to resist the urge. It is also IMO the greatest contributor to the health(obesity) epidemic we face in the US.</p>

<p>Also important to remember carbs(bread, pasta, rice) is really sugar and they are highly addictive. Next time you think you&#39;re starving, consider that it really isn&#39;t hunger but a carb/sugar withdrawal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, our diet is killing us. From an earlier post -- sorry for the length, but it&#39;s worth it if this topic interests you:</p>

<p>This is arguably the most important topic to get red-pilled on, as our bad diet is the foundation upon which the (((medical mafia))) rests. To be blunt: Humans are eating the wrong diet for our species, and it is causing a wide range of bad side-effects. This is counter to many, if not most, academic teachings. But luckily, we can reason through this pretty simply.</p>

<p>Look at your body. Very little hair. You wouldn&#39;t survive the night, let alone the winter, in most parts of the world before the advent of fire and tools. We were designed, by evolution, for the tropics. Our bodies evolved for millions of years to be suited to that environment. Humans are a tropical species, and our diet should reflect that. In a tropical environment with no fire, no tools, what would you eat? Raw chickens? Grass? The milk of a grazing species? No! We&#39;d eat fruit! It&#39;s just lying there on the ground or hanging from the trees! Just like most primates.</p>

<p>In short, modern humans should be eating primarily fresh, raw fruit and dark leafy greens. Then make some tweaks to reflect your more recent ancestry -- maybe add some (raw?) eggs, fish, a little clean meat. Avoid grains and bread, avoid dairy. And that crap in the center aisles packaged in shiny boxes with ingredients you can&#39;t pronounce... THAT&#39;S NOT FOOD. Doesn&#39;t matter if it screams &quot;HEALTHY! LO-FAT! ACTIVE LIFESTYLE!!&quot; in a 62 point serif font!</p>

<p>Yes, we can adapt to other diets. Our bodies can run on a wide variety of fuels. But there are consequences, most notably acidic buildup leading to tissue degeneration. We group symptoms of these byproducts into <strong>&quot;diseases&quot; -- an entirely invented concept</strong> (whew, there&#39;s a redpill for ya..) -- and are sold various pharmaceuticals to treat these symptoms, never the cause. (Wouldn&#39;t want to lose a customer!) We call them &quot;cancer&quot;, &quot;heart disease&quot;, etc. -- these are all the result of poor diet.</p>

<p>Here are a couple books that&#39;ll help guide you down the path to medical freedom and keep you there:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I0UM8UC/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1">The 80/10/10 Diet: Balancing Your Health, Your Weight, and Your Life, One Luscious Bite at a Time</a> -- great overview, explains the whys and hows</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Detox-Miracle-Sourcebook-Complete-Regeneration-ebook/dp/B007EFW0YS">The Detox Miracle Sourcebook: Raw Foods and Herbs for Complete Cellular Regeneration </a> -- excellent if you have a serious health problem, e.g. cancer, heart disease</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some excellent YouTube channels:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MarkJamesGordon">https://www.youtube.com/user/MarkJamesGordon</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JRawRose">https://www.youtube.com/user/JRawRose</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/robertmorsend">https://www.youtube.com/user/robertmorsend</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/canadianwargod">https://www.youtube.com/user/canadianwargod</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course it is difficult, maybe impossible, to switch your diet all at once. A common, very good first step is to eat only raw fruit until noon. Then eat your regular diet the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Note that this topic is generally shilled all to hell -- if westerners started eating right, the trillion dollar pharmaceutical industry would collapse within just a couple years. Just keep that in mind, use your own discernment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I think we are.</p>

<p>IMO Science and technology are evolving. Humans (generally in western cultures) are getting fatter, sicker and stupider. Combination of all 3 is eventually going to be your typical average human being. Solution? Be a fat useless, lifeless, lump and plug into a virtual reality, where you can be whatever you want to be. Finally be free from your own fat, stupid ass.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even blame us (us being people like you, me and the ones you bumped into in the shop). We&#39;re all addicts, some are worse than others. Addicted to sugar and consuming as much and as many products as possible. Then once we get sick from that, we get addicted to the pain pills we &quot;need&quot;, or the Ritalin that the kids have been given because their sugar diet and lack of exercise/attention has been misdiagnosed as ADHD. Or the tonnes of other psychiatry drugs that are given out like candy based on a doctor/psychiatrists OPINION that we become heavily addicted to, rather than maybe exploring diet, exercise, sleep, personal relationships, mindfulness. It&#39;s an extremely vicious cycle where nobody wins except big food and pharma.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame us because they suppress the truth about food, health and our minds. It&#39;s the medical professionals, business men and politicians that never offer anything more than quick short term fixes that benefit them and not us. The only people who will set themselves free from this poison life style are the ones willing to seek the truth and make the right decisions for themselves and their family. Whenever I see my friends buying their 3rd mcdonalds that week, I try my best to tell them how bad it really is to eat that way and how frickin amazing you feel once you stop eating that way. They never listen, but I can&#39;t do anything more than that.</p>

<p>Keep smiling at anyone and everyone :) The positive energies will make an impact, even if it&#39;s not in form of a smile back </p>
