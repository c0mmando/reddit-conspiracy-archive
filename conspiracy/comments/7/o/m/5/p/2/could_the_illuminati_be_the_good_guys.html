       Fairly ignorant, but from what I understand, the original Illuminati of Bavaria was based on ideals of enlightenment, self-rule and meritocracy which is surely at odds with tptb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could the demonization of such a society in itself be a conspiracy to smear its name and ideals? Given the fact that it's almost become a household name shrouded in malevolence, would such a propaganda campaign not be considered incredibly successful?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Luciferian, have we maybe all been raised to think Luficer is the bad guy, when in actuality those ideals are what lead to true freedom?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could a borderless NWO with one language, one currency, and in essence one united people not be a utopia rather than a totaliterian nightmare? I mean, on paper it sounds better than what we have now

       But the bad guy in a Christian sense, right? Doesn't Lucifer embody the emancipation from God, enlightenment and self-rule, which would obviously be a huge no-no to the church? Or in this case am I conflating Luciferianism with (Laveyan) Satanism?

       Luciferianism has a couple different ways of being practiced I believe. As far as I know you are correct about the group which does not actually worship Satan but instead most seem to be atheists using the luceferianism name as a way to piss off/scare christians. I'm obviously biased as a Christian but I believe their pseudo-religion can do no good if they act in the name of lucifer. That's the antithesis of anything which is good for the mind and soul.

       I’m Still gathering data and don’t want to sound like I have all the answers. A recent documentary I watched made a convincing argument that all the main secret societies were created or adopted by the Illuminati. All roads eventually lead to Lucifer worship and service.

       Though there are differences between Luciferianism and Laveyan Satanism, they are really only surface differences from what I have come to understand. Luciferianism believes in Lucifer as described in the Bible, but still choose to worship him as they believe he is worthy of worship and a "friend" of mankind. Laveyan Satanism is ostensibly "non religious" in that they claim that neither Satan nor God exists, but when you read the questionnaire that needs to be filled out for entry to the church, that doesn't seem exactly truthful.

       I rather disagree, you are entitled to your opinion, but in the bible the hebrew word that was translated as "lucifer" was really just the morning star, venus and maybe a few other things... But it was never Satan till at least 500AD or later

       But once again, Lucifer represents enlightenment and self-rule, he is the light bringer after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is completely at odds with the idea that have been drilled into all of us for thousands of years: God is good and all-powerful, obey the dogma or suffer for eternity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe demonizing (lol) Luciferian ideals is the biggest conspiracy of the age and the greatest surpression of the human spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the church was the one pushing the idea the idea that Lucifer is the embodiment of evil.

       I would also launch a smear campaign against ideals that jeopardized my immense power and control.

       I agree. However the Illuminati doesn't exist and hasn't for hundreds of years after infiltrating masonry. These days they are used as a psychological operation to bring on fear which creates a sense of helplessness amongst the public.

       I think the "Illuminati" in the modern sense of the word doesn't refer merely to the Bavarian Illuminati, but to what many people call the "cabal" or really anyone involved in the secret practices of those in positions of power.

       Actions speak louder than words. If the Bushes, Kerrys, Clintons, Windsors, Van Saxencoburg-Gotha etc. etc. etc. of this world wouldn't have been so utterly and undeniably corrupt or depraved, then nobody on earth would doubt their benevolence. It's not about how or where it started, which might have very well been a legitimate organization to counter the power grip of the catholic church, it's what this clandestine service club for the super rich and powerful has grown into.

       Absolutely, but what if they actually aren't true Illuminati and their actions being tied to the group are simply to further scapegoat the society? It just seems like a few elite controlling the world is the exact opposite of what the illuminati stands for.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flipside, I can definitely buy into the idea of infiltration and the fact that the power of a once-noble society would be manipulated to serve a few individuals.

       There isn't just one way to illuminate it's easier to go the negitive route. Lucifer is the light bringer and Is a part of every person the light is filtered through the ego and ends up being Satan in pretty much everyone it is a tempter but in doing so is a teacher. The "Illuminat1" is actually doing us a favor in a way by showing you your desires it's us that choose to feed them. The serpent tempted Eve but she choose to eat. We have to raise a serpent on a brass Pole as Moses said to free us from suffering. The symbols are right in front of us. The modern medical symbols true meaning, The caduces of hermes, Kundalini, mercury, the fire of the pentacost,these people telling you otherwise are speaking from ignorance no offense. Do yourself a favor and listen to this lecture and go from there -  ever wonder what they taught in the mystery schools?

       I had this theory once that the real Illuminati actually went into hiding because they knew the general public would never be able to overcome their beliefs/control by propaganda, and so secretly have been slowly working toward making things right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really know what to believe anymore. Secrecy is generally a shady thing to me, but if it were done knowing society at large would reject certain ideals outright maybe it's good?

       No one is public with legit plans to limit population. But yes that is one of the most critical problems earth faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the driving factor behind almost all the other problems *(climate change due to over population. Starvation. Sue to too many people. Etc war....definitely due to people. Etc etc)

       Finally a few people are beginning to see through the trick: the elite slander themselves as the Illuminati so that the masses will be tricked into fighting their own ally, thus keeping the same people in control. That is the elite's most ultimate enemy, as it always has been for thousands of years.

       What is the result of each groups actions?  What was their intent?
 Does war ennoble men or make them barbarians?  Does welfare help the poor or does it simply degenerate the gene pool?  Does civilization inspire men to be the best they can be, or does it simply make them cogs for the "greater good"?
