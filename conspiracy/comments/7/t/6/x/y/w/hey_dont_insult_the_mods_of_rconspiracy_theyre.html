<p>Do everyone a favor and explain what you mean by that. I&#39;m truly confused. I&#39;m guessing that I&#39;m fooling nobody because I&#39;m not trying to fool anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no indication at all that Joey is upset. In fact what he wrote is not emotional at all so I don&#39;t know why you guys think he&#39;s acting on feelings. </p>

<p>It just makes sense that it&#39;s not the place of a mod to make a statement like that as if it&#39;s wrong to have a different opinion. Nobody&#39;s feelings were hurt, it&#39;s just a mod should be impartial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A mod is just someone that carries out the rules of a subreddit and reddit in general. What makes you think a mod can&#39;t have opinions and must remain impartial? They aren&#39;t judges. And tbh, sounds emotional to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it is emotional. Someone made a threat complaining about being muted??? Like people get banned and muted all the time. Imagine if someone made that kind of thread anywhere else what would happen? They&#39;d get banned. That sounds to me like an emotional response to something that happened to them. They didn&#39;t like that the mod had an opinion and complained about it.</p>
