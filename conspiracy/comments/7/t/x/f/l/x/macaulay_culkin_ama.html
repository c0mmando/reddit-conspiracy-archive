        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was just reading over his Reddit AMA that was conducted today and wanted to see the conspiracy communities input on some of his responses. Two answers caught my attention. The first mentioned his favorite type of pizza, the way he words it is more than a bit strange. The second answer is in regards to Hollywood exploitation and he appears to jokingly mention pizzagate. I’m curious if it could have potentially been a silent cry for help or some kind of bread crumbs he left without explicitly stating what type of abuse he may have been subjugated to.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the AMA<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely possible. I defintely followed the Pgate revelations and found the Instagram and other symbolism compelling and disturbing. </p>

<p>However he has a famous line in Home Alone that could be a reference &quot;a lovely cheese pizza, just for me&quot; that people liked so it could also kind of be a career motif.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not calling it either way because I find him kind of suspicious but the general p-gate Revelations can be true without <em>every</em> reference being part of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too, there are also some old pics of him with his male children where it looks like he is stroking their junk. He has got his little hands all up in their business. </p>

<p>It’s insane to think pizzagate is just a issue on the left. Looks to me that all politicians are compromised in some way and pedo blackmail is a widely used method. </p>

<p>Add in Trumps relationships with Epstein and it gets even creepier. Also Acosta is in his cabinet, and he was the former AG in Miami that let Epstein go with a slap on the wrist. </p>

<p>Pizzagate folks are always bashing Hollywood, and rightfully so, but they have cognitive dissonance about daddy trump and his connections with hollywood and show business. Trump is accused of raping a 13yo girl with Epstein, but it’s all just “Soros disinfo” to the pizzagate crowd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to be fair, pizzagate had a good start and was making some waves tying together the Podesta, Clinton, Haitian child trafficking connections and some pretty good research behind it.  Unfortunately the narrative was hijacked by major alt right influencers and it turned into an investigation into alfantis and comet ping pong. This allowed the enemy to smash it almost entirely when they sent a goon to “shoot the place up” and make pizzagaters irresponsible partisan hacks whose reckless unfounded research endangered the public. </p>

<p>The researchers that were not politically motivated were led to investigate Epstein fully and that’s when I began to see all the red flags of Trump and people connected with him in all this madness. The problem was most pizzagate researchers were avid trump fans and they stayed away from looking at him and rebuked the few that did as “Soros bots”. Trump was able to slip through the cracks even though he was knee deep in the matter. </p>

<p>The enemies of trump didn’t investigate too much bc the Clintons were also knee deep or they considered pizzagate to be right wing politically motivated attacks. </p>

<p>And here we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is fake.

Other than the screenshots shared between these articles, there is no evidence the <em>Les Echos</em> article referenced ever existed.</p>

<p>Additionally, the French shown in the screenshots is extremely incorrect, and consistent with the kind of results you&#39;d get from something like Google Translate, further proving that it&#39;s a hoax. More importantly, <em>Les Echos</em> primarily focuses on economic and political stories, and would have no reason to post an article about a celebrity&#39;s comments.</p>

<p>A: It&#39;s always Joe&#39;s Pizza (in NYC), and not to be all normal about it, but I do like a proper plain. That&#39;s how you can judge a place. I&#39;ve been with lots of vegetarians so I can get with that, but I wouldnt kick a pepperoni and sausage out of bed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a prime example of the &#39;absolutely ridiculous (and easily disprovable) conspiracy theories that devalue ALL conspiracy theories&#39; I am bringing up. In reality, being intrigued by unsolved/suspicious events is human nature.
