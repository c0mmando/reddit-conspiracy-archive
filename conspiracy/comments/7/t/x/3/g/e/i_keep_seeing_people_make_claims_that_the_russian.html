<blockquote>
<p><strong>Verified: Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.</strong></p>

<p>the House Intelligence Committee released a transcript of Page’s congressional testimony revealing he had in fact met with other Rosneft officials, including Sechin&#39;s subordinate Andrey Baranov, during a trip to Moscow in 2016.</p>

<p>Rosneft officials used their meeting with Page to push for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Russia for its support of armed separatist groups in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Congress eventually passed a law limiting Trump&#39;s ability to lift sanctions, which the president reluctantly signed </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing here is illegal or proves collusion. Trump ultimately signed off on Congress&#39;s law despite the fact that he disagreed with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Verified: The Kremlin targeted educated youth and swing state voters during its cyber attacks in the 2016 campaign.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the $100k Facebook and Twitter &quot;Kremlin&quot; ad campaign. No ties to Trump or his team. No laws broken.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Verified: Trump maintains ties to rich businessmen from Azerbaijan.</strong></p>

<p>The dossier said Azeri businessman Araz Agalarov knew the details about business bribes Trump had <strong>allegedly</strong> paid in Russia, as well as Trump&#39;s <strong>alleged</strong> sexual exploits there. <strong>Evidence of the bribes and sexual activities has never surfaced.</strong></p>

<p>both men worked with Trump on the Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow in 2013.</p>

<p>Trump Jr. attended a Trump Tower meeting with the lawyer in June 2016 along with Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and Trump&#39;s son-in-law Jared Kushner. That meeting has become a major focus of the investigations into the Trump campaign. Goldstone <strong>allegedly</strong> organized the meeting at Emin Agalarov&#39;s behest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, no laws broken. He met these guys working on the Miss Universe Pageant. Nothing illegal has been proven. Notice the liberal usage of the word <strong>allegedly</strong> so even though they claim to have verified it, they did so knowing they are just allegations.</p>

<p>As for the rest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not proven: Russia had been cultivating Trump for years, or at all.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Not proven: Trump was offered real estate deals in Russia and turned them down.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Not proven: Trump&#39;s lawyer worked as an intermediary between Trump and Russia.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Not proven: Trump is open to blackmail due to illicit sexual activities in Russia.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>People aren&#39;t saying a bunch of crimes alleged in the dossier have been proven. But a lot of what the dossier asserted has been true. Absolutely none of it has been proven false so I don&#39;t know people go around calling it phony. And it sure as hell doesn&#39;t look good when Trump hired a bunch of criminals who were lobbying for Russian interests. Especially a fuckin head of national security and a campaign manager with such deep Russian ties. </p>

<p>This is like the 12th &quot;guys, there&#39;s nothing to see here&quot; post about Russia I&#39;ve seen today. It&#39;s hilarious to me that there is this giant effort every single day to get people to stop believing there is anything sketchy going on between Trump and Russia. I&#39;m sure there will be 12 more tomorrow. Just like every fuckin day since this criminal investigation started heating up. </p>

<p>Not sure what people think posting about this non stop is going to do. For the people who agree with you, it&#39;s just another circle jerk. You&#39;re not going to change anyone&#39;s mind. I just want to see this criminal investigation wrap up with out constant obstruction. Because it doesn&#39;t make anyone look any better when people whine about a criminal investigation non stop. Now that 4 criminal indictments have been handed out, the only argument left is &quot;well you jerks shouldn&#39;t have investigated us in the first place!&quot; Cool argument dude. It&#39;s not going to change anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. You keep repeating that 4 criminal indictments bullshit as though it means anything despite being corrected over and over. </p>

<p>Those indictments do not have anything to do with Trump / Russia collusion and they actually show that Mueller can’t indict anyone on the actual reason for his investigation which is “Did Trump and Putin collude to rig the election.”</p>

<p>Now he’s just looking to rack up indictments for anything at all. </p>

<p>Compare those 4 indictments for non-related “crimes” to the growing list of FBI and DOJ employees who have been fired, forced out, reassigned, and recused.</p>

<p>If the DOJ and FBI did nothing wrong, why are so many of them working directly on these two cases falling?</p>

<p>Comey, McCabe, Bruce Ohr, Peter Strozk, John Carlin, Comey’s former aide (forgot his name), the Judge who approved the FISA warrant.</p>

<p>One after another, they are losing their jobs.</p>

<p>Look at this:</p>

<p>The source added that U.S. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the adviser’s talks with senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin were being “actively monitored and investigated.”</p>

<p>Their intelligence report was the Steele dossier. </p>

<p>There are two problems with your rebuttal, the first is that the 2014 case was closed, and the second is the lie that they where talking about the sanctions. </p>

<p>Here is the conversations that the Russian intelligence was having about Page.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/t5Owxht.png">https://i.imgur.com/t5Owxht.png</a></p>

<p>And here is the FBI investigation</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/AKffJdY.png">https://i.imgur.com/AKffJdY.png</a></p>

<p>You notice that Page was practicing Russian and providing information about the energy business, not talking about sanctions. </p>

<p>Page was unmasked, in a case that closed, and his name was leaked to the press. </p>

<p>It mentions Sechin AND Divyekin, Page met with a friend from his Gazprom days, that happens to be working in investor relations for Resneft. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No two different things. I had some shit backwards and was confusing some details from the unrelated TT meeting </p>

<p>I am aware the case is closed but was offering a rebuttal that he might have still been under surveillance from things that stemmed from that. We know part of this new &#39;memo&#39; is FISA abuse and we also know it mentions that Page had his FISA surveillance extended even after the election was over. What is your determination that Steele dossier was the source? And not ongoing FISA abuse to extend the surveillance. Is it that the dossier is the only mention of Sechin?</p>

<p>You&#39;re missing the part where the head of investor relations Baranov was the one who was discussing the Rosneft sale with Page. I think that&#39;s what my head was trying to refer to with the the sanctions talk. But Page said he didn&#39;t support lifting sanctions &#39;directly&#39; whatever the hell that means</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I happen to think that Page was telling to truth in front of congress, and as I posted, read the initial report that was linked. It names both Seching and Diveykin, both only appear in the Steele dossier. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know part of this new &#39;memo&#39; is FISA abuse and we also know it mentions that Page had his FISA surveillance extended even after the election was over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My impression is that this is where the scandal really is.  I think two things were used to renew survailance on Page, the fact that he was spied on before, and the allegations in the Steele dossier. 
The thing is that both are bad, the first, because if you read the document, Page, is just attempting to make some money, and is hopeful he got some Russian connections, and the Russians are open about just using him and forgetting once they get something useful out of him... it certainly does not show some kind of quid-pro-quo relationship.   The Steele dossier is just false in its allegations. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re missing the part where the head of investor relations Baranov was the one who was discussing the Rosneft sale with Page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a fact.  Read Page&#39;s testimony, it basically boils down, we might have mentioned the Rosneft sale because it was in the news, but we did not discuss it in a quid-pro-quo manner.  The dossier is specific in its allegations, and they are not true.  Baranov is not mentioned.  </p>

<p>The rest were caught in the House, Senate DOJ and OIG investigations. Judicial Watch was also instrumental in getting all of their e-mails and supporting documents released via FOIA and lawsuits which forced the two agencies to remove them from the investigation into Russian collusion.</p>

Nope, a democrat.  ;)
My line with any outside country would be if I were shown verifiable evidence (provided by a trusted third party) that said country was able to manipulate the election in such a way to flip a seat or a state in their favor.  Now, as far as the USA goes, the FBI/CIA/RNC/DNC crossed my line a while ago.  I&#39;m waiting for the call to march on Langley.

I could say something like U/Sjwpussylibtard loves incestous golden showers and poo play, and repeat that over and over and over again and maybe another user picks it up and says it again then we have ‘multiple sources’ and run with it from there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched an old episode of In Search Of the other day about the Dogon People in Mali. They have a very simple form of government. Whenever anyone in the tribe has a dispute, they settle it in a public forum.</p>

<p>One man was upset with another because his goat knocked down his fence and ate food from his garden and he wanted the goat owner to pay for the damages. The goat owner said that it was the man with the fences fault because he should have built a better fence.</p>

<p>The result was that the man who owned the goat was not at fault nor was the goat. It was the man who built the fence.</p>

<p>The two men agreed to rebuild the fence together and replant the section of the garden that was ruined.</p>

<p>Simple solutions.</p>
