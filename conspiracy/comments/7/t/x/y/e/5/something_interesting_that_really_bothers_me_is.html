       Post anything remotely negative about Hillary &amp; watch your karma instantly be sent into the negatives, i will never understand where all of this bullshit came from. I swear to god people are being blindly manipulated by the media. All of her emails &amp; shady shit is basically swept completely under the rug for most people. Try and mention any of it &amp; you'll instantly be hit with "Muh Fake News", "Not Credible", like why the fuck is it okay to call out Trump for being a bastard but seeming considered "Taboo" to say shit against Hillary. Just look at any popular subreddit, like r/askreddit for example. Any posts about hillary will instantly downvote bombed in a heartbeat, its like some sort of mass censorship. This is legitimately the only subreddit i've seen that's somewhat safe from this. When did this ever start, i thought people where pro-bernie &amp; anti-Hillary. What caused this phenomenon
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: See, the downvote bomb proves my point. I went from 98 % upvoted to nearly 50% in a short span
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: Apparently my Account is banned now, for like no reason at all. I recieved no message warning me about this ban. This is completely unfair, freedom of speech is gone
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Was just flat out told by the mods that i have no freedom of speech &amp; was banned apparently expressing it. This is injustice

       The only reason women have rights is because men allowed them.  Women are "right" only because men allow them to speak.

       rights are granted by the powerful and strong. That is the natural law.  Dont believe me? Look at the entirety of human history friend.  The strong rule the weak. That is natures way. If you dont like it, youre probably one of the weak ones.

       interesting use of words. You are basically saying that in order to obtain rights from the strong, you will have to become strong yourself, commit violence, and take the stolen rights back.

       If one is taking what was
       <em>
        stolen
       </em>
       , as these Rights were, then they are justified. And I am not talking about violence per se- nonviolence often works better. But my main point was that these Rights were already there, they were merely obstructed. To fight to take them back is a necessity.

       Taking back what was stolen is an act of violence. You just feel its a justifiable use of violence. Violence is always the ultimate resolution to all problems. If you kill your opponent, you no longer have an opponent and you get what you want.

       Our discussion wasn't about violence, tho, it was about Natural Rights and whether they are granted or already exist. I argue that they already exist and were obstructed, therefore necessitating a fight in order to ensure they are no longer obstructed.

       Only on the surface level. In reality, violence is a cycle. Kill one person, and you have 2 more who want to see you dead, this increases at an exponential rate. The Greeks identified this in the Odyssey- Odysseus slays the suitors in righteous rage but begins anew the cycle of violence, and only the intervention of Athena can prevent it from spiraling out of control. Violence begets violence. Peace begets peace.

       I believe that these Rights already exist. I believe that they need to be fought for against those who obstruct these Natural Rights. It is not pacification.

       your argument boils down to what you believe and hope to be true. My point is that your belief is false and based on wrong thinking. If you look at human history, you will see your perspective is wrong and has never ever been right. You are on a god damn conspiracy sub reddit where we talk all the time about how the powerful conspire to maintain their power. Part of that conspiracy is getting the average person to think like you do because if the average person thought like I did, there would be lots of death, destruction and war.....not something the powerful want because it would destroy their power.

       You have no proof natural rights exist. Those are man made, made up ideas that do not work in practice.

       I think you're romanticizing a much simpler concept. Yes, nature grants everyone the natural right to live their life free from the domination of others if they happen to be free from others who are able to dominate them. However, nature is a cold bitch and also grants everything and everyone around you the natural right to do try to do anything at all to dominate or even kill you. You also have the natural right to try to defend yourself, but at the end of the day natural rights end when somebody wins. That's what makes them natural. They exist because you have the free will to try. This whole social structure that we have built may grant us additional rights, but they are artificial in the sense that the moment the social structure is not able to protect you, natural rights once again rule the day.

       my only problem with this is because of inherited wealth and position, the conception of 'strong vs weak' has been clouded in fog.
      </p>
      <p>
       some of the strong are not actually strong, and some of the weak are much stronger -- since its no longer a contest of power and intellect alone choosing dominance.
      </p>
      <p>
       some have been able to sit, fat and happy in familial wealth and power for generations and plot how to use that to continue the illusion that they are the strong so the true strong don't come and butcher them and murder their lineage and take over.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, life should be an open playfield of instability in which the strong are constantly under direct threat to be proven actually weak. This ensures only the truly strong survive.

       The problem here, is that, you are coming at this from a perspective from 2018 (a civilization in decline). You have no idea what happened in the past, and why certain things were accepted by both male and females.

       Like I said, it was a survival trade off. Men can survive without women, but, women cannot survive without men, especially in the olden days. Men built civilization for women and for their future prosperity.  As the saying goes:

       My babcia came here to the US, alone, on a ship from Poland when she was 14 with little to no money, and married a ~25 year old. She lied about her age, and did this to escape Poland (ie. survival for her and her posterity - ultimately leading to me).

       That is completely untrue. You have been propagandized in thinking this way. It's always been a trade off, and quite frankly, the women always has the most control in a relationship at the end of the day. Men fought died in wars for women, and their children's future. Women gave up certain duties, in order to "fight" for their husband's and children's future. A trade off.

       I'm not talking about the ancient era or even the early modern era. In fact, I believe that women were likely the creators of human society and consciousness as we know it. It's even attested that in most societies, the Great Mother was originally the supreme deity of the pantheon, it is only with the development of warfare, as you suggest, that the Masculine subsumed the feminine, and this was a natural development. I'm not arguing with you about that, I think we agree on a lot here.

       I'm not really disagreeing here. I think it might be helpful to highlight where exactly I think I'm arguing from- a 20th/21st century historical perspective. I'm not extrapolating back to ancient times, or even to the 19th century, I'm talking about the treatment of women concerning the Vote and concerning their control over themselves and their bodies that the 21st century granted, and required them to fight in order to obtain. Perhaps my definition of Rights in this argument was a bit too large.

       The reality is that the strong give the weak whatever the strong want the weak to have and that ultimately benefits the strong. You can pretend whatever you want, but that does not change reality. Look at fucking human history. Its a never ending history of violence and conquest.

       But how would strong people giving weak people things benefit the strong? It's always been power hungry people
       <strong>
        taking away
       </strong>
       what normal people have that make them weak and the power hungry more powerful. I get what you're getting at but it's the other way around. And you're really only focusing on the bad things or human history and human nature. What is making you think like this?

       Why do banks want people in debt?

       Yeah see those are all instances of people taking away other people's freedoms. It's not giving anything. Sure you can say slave owners gave their slaves a room and three meals a day so they wouldn't retaliate and keep working, but they took their lives. And sure the banks lend that money to the debtors, but now it'll take that debtor time and more money and don't forget interest to pay that all back -- the bank is taking away the debtor's time, money, and possibly a secure life. And yeah governments give their soldiers pensions and financial support for college and whatnot, but they took the soldiers' freedoms to live a normal life as well. The only reality is that powerful people take away what everyone already has, not that the "weak" are simply able to speak or vote because some stronger guy allows them to. And why won't you answer my question directed at you? I just want to know what is making you think this way.

       I didn't realize this sub was only 4 years old.
 Name calling, vulgar language, and lies. People such as yourself bring nothing to the table. 
The fact that a crook such as Hillary Clinton had even the slightest chance to become POTUS means that a conspiracy exists to keep criminals in the White House at any cost.
As a person who has subscribed to this sub for over eight years I can say it's people such as yourself do nothing but bring this sub down.
 Pathetic.

       HRC is a Corporate Whore who stole the Primary from Bernie with the help of the corrupt DNC then payed millions to shill the fuck out of Reddit with CTR and now Share Blue...and this is coming from a bitter Bernie bro who wrote his name in rather than vote for that pathetic excuse for a candidate. No thanks.

       While forming parallel Organizations such as Our Revolution that have taken 8 State Parties from the Corporatists, and would have had Cali if the DNC hadn't literally stuffed the ballots and cheated. They purged Bernie's picks from the Ethics and Rules Committee in the DNC and still talk shit about him. Bernie endorsed her so he couldn't get Nader'd and came out stronger because of it. Even at the time members of his inner circle said he had doubts about her ability to win.

       Is this the thing where they are trying to take over every school board, HOA and municipal position and work their way up? If so, I agree, it's an interesting strategy, but I think once people figure out it's socialism it won't go much further.

       This is a good perspective data point. I see the same disdain, but from my perspective it looks more like he tried to take on the cartel and then got smacked back into place. He might be a rebel at heart, but this is a game of results, not feels. It looks like they have him on a leash. Honestly, given the way that leverage is used in this town it would be surprising if he didn't work some sort of deal in exchange for not having his wife maliciously prosecuted. She may very well be guilty of her crimes, but there's a finite amount of resources to devote to crime investigation and there's likely been some unnatural forces involved in focusing them his direction.

       Most of the HRC defense is either Astroturf or useful idiots who have drank the Astroturf Kool-aid and believe that the Russians hacked the emails, while refusing to acknowledge the shit contained within, and the fact that the DNC and HRC rigged the Primaries against Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/politics fell after the Dem convention but the CTR shilling actually started in r/sandersforpresident, because at the height of the Primaries that sub was too powerful- twas a beautiful place full of hope and activism that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars itself for the Bernie campaign.

       Agreed, Hillary's campaign was pretty deeply flawed from the beginning. You have to get people excited for your candidate and she failed at every step. Lots of democrats had to go hold their nose to vote for her knowing that the party rigged it against their guy. Had they put bernie up instead, I think he would have had the advantage after "grab her by the pussy" and rode that to a win in the general. With hillary, the outrage seemed really fake considering what Bill had done along with all her other political baggage.

       The inconsistent is the budget of millions was in 2015 and 2016. 2017 operating budget was $30,000. So CTR cannot be used to explain HRC AstroTurf in 2017.

       This is not to say it can't be another company. A super-PAC like CTR actually did not have to disclose publically that it was using social media and coordinating with the Clinton campaign. This theoretically means any number of PACs that didn't volunteer to disclose this.

       There's an easy way to test that out--how many Hillary bumper stickers have you ever seen?  Probably not very many.  How many Bernie bumper stickers do you still see?  Probably several every day.

       excellent post.  your timeline is spot on.  I also noticed the r/sandersforpresident infiltration prior to r/politics fall as well.  I believe it was all the sharing of details about voter suppression, election fraud, and clinton bullshit that was happening.

       I remember Snopes from 1999 which is the year I first got the internet at my home.  Back then you could "Ask Jeeves", make a geocities webpage or use Alta Vista to search the internet.  Snopes was already a routine "first page" result when searching for tall stories circulated via email forwards.

       Yeah, I remember looking through snopes articles back around 98 or 99 because that was around the time that urban legends became interesting to me.  I remember snopes links being posted to slashdot and kuro5hin.  Sorry, but you're talking bullshit.  Feel free to argue about it's current bias or lack of it or whatever, but it's ridiculous to tell people who actually went to snopes back then that it simply wasn't around.

       That’s because those keywords aren’t that common and snopes has tremendous amounts of backlinks/social signals and authority(for search engine purposes not with real information). I run an SEO firm so this doesn’t surprise, but on the flipside I would not be surprised if Google manipulated this themselves. They aren’t exactly the most trustworthy company.

       Probably an OutoftheLoop question, but are Google searches still reliant on the actual content of the site? For example, a friend in highschool (2001-2002) was the top google result for "bitch drinks." He had a blog he would write rants on when he was drunk and his angst at the time was against people who drank smirnoffs and the like. Seems that search result would be unlikely to happen in the same situation today.

       Yup content plays a major role, now maybe more than ever. Google has shifted their algorithm favoring quality content over the last few years. In the old days you could spam the shit out of a site with crappy links and over-optimizing for keywords, but Google has became significantly smarter in how they rank things.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of keywords (like "bitch drinks") that may get a few searches a month that you can rank for just by writing an article about it. Simply because no one else is writing and optimizing for that specific keyword/subject.

       Can somebody give me a solid reason to distrust Snopes? They're articles are full of varied sources and the only bias I ever get is from their conclusions and Ratings. But if you read the content, its good solid stuff. Point me to the issue they got totally wrong and I will change my opinion.

       Snopes is owned by an individual. That individual is a hardcore Clinton supporter.

       Looking at some of their ratings, it was made very clear that Snopes has a hard left lean, and "rates" stories accordingly.

       Its bias by omission. Look up Hillary Clinton Galagate...nothing.  Nothing damming and proven true on that woman is on the site, they only try to disprove negative headlines on her.  Uranium One can only been called an active investigation (nobody knows the whole  truth yet), but [snopes has a False at the ready. ..come on bro](

       Sure, she claimed repeatedly from day one that the Uranium One deal, which she personally authorized/brokered after receiving millions of dollars from the man it was granted to (he since pledged 100 million more to her foundation look it up) was totally legal. Now, her close ally on the project, a fellow Democrat, has been charged with 13 felonies because the deal was NOT proper, nor was it legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rod wheeler was indeed offered to family on a pro-bono basis, they graciously accepted his offer. After the family began being shadowed by an infamous DNC spokesperson, they said they had not authorized any of his statements (the ones you hear MSM parrot about how family wants to forget about Seth Rich, they never said that) and Rod Wheeler, their representative, on undercover video, says that D.C. Forensics found evidence that Seth had contacted Wikileaks on his laptop. Obviously you will not see the DNC publicly investigated pver Seth Rich, but the case is very real and ongoing. It's not a "conspiracy" when Podesta said in an email he wanted to make an example of any leakers whether there was even actual basis or not. These are sick devils and they will be purged by the law.

       <p>
        The indictment comes after reports in late December that the Justice Department was taking a new look into the Obama-era deal that gave Russia partial control of the U.S. uranium supply.

       This is why I roll my eyes at posts like this. The standard for "defensive about Hillary" is generally that you don't think she rapes children, murdered Seth Rich, and shipped all our uranium to Russia while also trying to start WWIII with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       These same people think Trump gets unfairly maligned, but he doesn't regularly get accused of murder and raping children.

       Sorry, "ordered someone to murder Seth Rich". You got me, most people don't think she actually pulled the trigger herself, just that she was the responsible party. Don't know why that matters so much.

       No one ever said Hillary rapes children, even on this sub. That is a strawman used to discredit the fact that Hillary is friends with and politically aligned with a bunch of pedophiles and possible child traffickers.

       Mention Seth Rich anywhere, unrelated to Clinton and watch the replies: "IT WAS A ROBBERY, OKAY?!" Last time I checked, the Rich murder was completely unresolved, but on most subreddits everyone seems very eager to dismiss anything but the idea that some street thugs tried to rob him. Case closed.

       I don´t think we should take prevailing online opinion as anything approaching actual real life consensus on anything. With all of the agents/shills/bots about, we should probably consider at least 75 percent of everything we see to be "sponsored content".  Its actually a relief to know that there really aren´t that many idiots out there. They really are doing crazy stuff with bot armies these days.

       To preface this, I would consider myself a liberal, but I do not support Hillary in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the most obvious reason is just that the majority of Reddit is left-leaning, and in American politics, members of a certain party are always very pressured (often successfully) into supporting the party's candidate. I think the most probable reason that Reddit is so left-leaning is just the age demographic, most active online people are young, and most young people are liberal. In general, people get defensive about their political views, and when you "attack" a person they endorse, they view that as an attack upon them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the things that I think are unacceptable about Trump do not outweigh the things that Hillary has done. Rather, I saw them both as unfit to be president, a view which has been confirmed time and time again (In my opinion). I certainly don't wish to start any arguments about this, just presenting my point of view.

       To me, I think it's a disparity between what people view as acceptable behavior, and wether that can out weight policy. Seeing as how I do not believe him to show acceptable behavior, and I do not agree with his policy, I just don't see him as a for president. And different people just value some things over others. I wouldn't say that our country is divided, I'd say our government is. My closest friends are almost evenly split white conservatives and white/minority liberals, and we all get along fine! People just need to learn to respect opposing viewpoints.

       For fuck sakes, why can't there be a civil discussion like this everywhere else on Reddit?

       This is a political debate. Articulate, common intelligent conversation. Everywhere else it just turns to shit slinging and name-calling.

       That's what this sub used to be exclusively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there were always the people here who would believe anything too.  And those same people fall down rabbit holes that make us fight amongst ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a there are definitely a few conspiracies that are entirely fabricated so that the believers make us all more alienated overall. (I'm looking at you flat earth and reptilians)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd go as far to say that these disinfo campaigns are probably state funded initially until the believers can carry the gospel of lies themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anytime an anonymous source drops inside knowledge there's a chance it's horse shit
      </p>
      <p>
       Their web of lies is most likely to cover their own asses,  which would mean they're at least worried that the info is out there.   What that info is is the real question.  I think the idea that our history is wrong is what they are trying to hide.  They know something more about our origins as a species.

       I don't want to be a dick, but you're kind of asking for it. Seriously, use some common sense. You really can't figure this out on your own? Seriously?
      </p>
      <p>
       High rent prices - supply and demand. Supply is limited, demand is high as hell and LA for example has a very low vacancy rate and extreme competition. By the time you see something online and its been there for a day, there are already applications in. New supply is VERY VERY expensive and ONLY high end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have investors jumping in and buying houses and turning them into apartments which reduce the supply of houses and make the price of houses go up as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       High taxes - are you really going to tell me that a single dollar of taxes doesn't go to illegals? All of welfare money for their 4 kids each that were born here. We just had a big gas tax increase. They aren't even telling us all the things it goes to. You think they are really going to tell us "Hey, part of the gas tax goes to illegals!" when they've been lying and saying illegals don't cost us a penny?
      </p>
      <p>
       They have tons of kids and they all go thru the school system. It cost about 15k-20k PER CHILD PER YEAR. You do realize that right? And its for 13 years and trust me they sign up for the free breakfast, lunch, after school programs, and everything else. Also lets not forget the school bus rides everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also most aren't paying taxes. So they aren't paying their fare share of money that go to schools, police stations, fire departments, etc...  They also commit tons of crimes, many unpunished, but still tons of crimes. A bunch of them are in jail too. So next time you wonder why the taxes keep going up, they also have to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pollution &amp; Traffic - Really. Do I have to explain all the traffic we have here and how millions of them contribute to traffic in Los Angeles? More traffic, much more pollution. Much more gas being used, something liberals hate. They also almost always have huge cars and their cars smoke and cause all kinds of pollution. I see it all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freeloaders - Yes, they sign up for all the free shit. Especially for their "legal" kids that shouldn't be in this country and would have never been born here if it wasn't for corrupt liberals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crime - Are you serious dude? MS13 is a gang made up of many illegals. Most of them probably are. All commit identity theft or tax evasion. All of them that work, every single one of them. They also are huge in stealing shit and petty crimes. They steal from work often, they steal bikes often, and all kinds of other shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people from below the border (legal or not) have serious drinking problems and get DUIs. I see workers drink during the day all the time. I was near Downtown LA and went into a liquor store and the guy was buying beer. I asked the lady if this is common because who the fuck drinks at 10AM. She was mexican and she told me "if these guys don't drink, they can't work." I've seen this many times and I've talked to other people and they have confirmed it. They also often drink after work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude, you have no experience with these people. So don't make the assumption that I'm wrong because  you lack the experiences that everyone around them has. Everyone knows this shit about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also suck up our limited resources. California had a serious water shortage, it has an electricity shortage also because of the natural gas leak. Its not too serious but the  prices are fucking out of control. If they weren't here, they wouldn't be drinking our limited amounts of water and creating a bigger shortage.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people just use and abuse the country. They don't contribute for shit. We have our own people that are losing jobs due to this shit. If you see any illegals working at any business, its clear they took someone else's job.

       The issue is you have absolutely zero common sense and even though you'll claim you're educated (you're not kid), you don't understand what supply and demand is. And you haven't even been able to prove me wrong on a single point.

        High rent prices was backed up by evidence. Its called supply and demand. I went further to explain investors buy homes and make apartment buildings out of it reducing the supply of homes for home buyers. Then I explained all new developments are high end.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Not enough supply:

       Here you go kid: "Kudler said that buying a house has become “basically unattainable” except for people in the upper-middle class or above. The median cost of a house in L.A. is now nearly half a million dollars. At the same time, the housing crisis pushed a lot of people back into the rental market. Today, more than half of all Angelenos are renters. All that, combined with limited housing stock and the difficulty of building anything but the fanciest apartments, has driven rents way up."

       Here's the truth of where we've ended up in this discussion...  you may have some great facts.  You certainly have a different perspective living in L.A. that I would be interested in learning from, as I'm don't live in California.

       I know plenty of people that are treated like shit by others that go around blaming everyone else but themselves. You are one of these people and don't think you're ever responsible. Taking some responsibility in your life. Something that is lacking in people these days. If you were respectful, I would have definitely treated you differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       You earned what you got and you did a good job being a dick yourself, thats why I treated you like trash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets just look at an example of how you talked to me:
      </p>
      <p>
       "What is wrong is you throwing out a ton of "stupid shit" without a shred of evidence or references" - First of all, it was the truth, not stupid shit. You just didn't like it. Second, its common knowledge, anyone with common sense knows most of this stuff and doesn't ask for evidence. But if someone wants to ask, that's fine. But don't try to act like a smartass and act like you're right and I'm wrong because we both know that's not the case.

       Have you taken a deep breath lately?  Because it seems like you need a deep breath.  And maybe a long walk outside in nature.  Your response to this discussion has been over-the-top.  I own my part in participating and would be interested in attempting to change the game in the spirit of attempting civil discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I invite you to tell me about your personal experiences with illegal immigrants.  Not systemic issues that could easily be associated with other more complex issues than illegal immigration (traffic?  really?).

       The problem with trolls like aolsux00, is he has left a trail of evidence that demonstrates how much of a little bitch he when he is demonstrably wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, aolsux00 engaged in the use of steroids 10 years ago.  This clearly demonstrates why they lack any critical thinking skills and loves to go off the deep end with roid rage.

       I don't think that's true; it certainly doesn't explain why 22% of Republicans supported Obama bombing Syria if Assad used chemical weapons but 86% of Republicans supported Trump bombing Syria when Assad used chemical weapons.  If they were judging the behavior then it would look more like the Democratic Party demographic where the difference of opinion is lower than the polls' margin of error (38% supported Obama doing it and 37% supported Trump doing the same thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor is this an isolated data point.  Consider how Evangelicals now feel about immorality and its relationship to ethics in a public role.  Before Trump came along as the Republican candidate, just 30% of Evangelicals thought someone who indulged in an immoral act in their private life could be ethical in public office.  That number has since leaped up to more than double at 72%
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clearly not about the behavior for a sizeable chunk of the country.  It's about the the partisan affiliation of the person doing carrying out the behavior.

       Huh? It's written in the holy book. Pedophilia, mutilation of infant vaginas, masking your women and training them as slaves, Infidel aren't human, etc. I see it on Twitter all day. Muslim prophets chant about keeping women in line coupled with actual beheadings, right on Twitter. Muslim men women and teens repostibg and laughing about this all day. Look at Britain, Germany, France, and Sweden, their crime rates have increased by 5000% since adopting the EU's genocidal policies.

       Islam is even more subverted by them than Christianity. It isnt about the religion, pretending like importing thousands of the cream of the crop from other nations will benefit unemployed US workers, much less the home country they are siphoned from, is a JOKE!

       I said not wanting to import the World Bank's terror victims to the nation responsible in their mind, is not the same as Islamaphobia. Also said Islam is not compatible with Western values, since it teaches its members not to coexist but to convert or punish infidel. In Egypt, people drive around in cars demanding passerby recite specific parts of the Holy Quran or have their head blown off. In sweden, the "negligable" migrants are firebombing police stations, and have turned entire Swedish provinces into refugee warzones. It's not "racist" to suggest taming a lion before bringing it to a zoo...

       I see it. And it's unfortunate. I believe it does more harm than good. I didn't vote for Trump but have a lot of family and friends who did. After watching the bulk of media lump everyone who voted for Trump as alt right racist/bigots, I was left with a very foul taste in my mouth. I know these cats. They aren't what they've been described as. In any case if the left had a better argument they wouldn't have to say such things. But they don't. So they in turn act as the authoritarian dictators they ironically claim Trump to be, silencing anyone with dissenting opinions by casting them as vile, putrid folks who don't have the right to free speech because they deem it "hate speech". They say the worlds a mirror...

       This is astounding projection.
      </p>
      <p>
       For decades we have had a right wing propaganda industry demonizing liberals and the real news media while blathering out cult-like talk to the effect of "they're all lying to you; only we tell the truth and that's why they're all out to get us (and you)!"
      </p>
      <p>
       A significant chunk of the country has seen an entire industry grow out of demonizing them and has had to put up with it for decades.  Imagine knowing there is that kind of audience for content that is dominated by hate mongering focused on you.  That's what much of the country have been putting up with since the 1990s, so long in fact that it's normalized to the point of being invisible to you all.  That's why Ted Nugent's career was revitalized and now he gets White House invites and that's normal to a significant chunk of the country who were genuinely horrified over that red haired comedian who was promptly fired and had her career destroyed for what amounts to the same kind of conduct.  That's why a writer for SNL was fired for tweeting about Barron, but Rush Limbaugh's profile soared while he routinely called Chelsea Clinton "the White House dog".
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if one of Obama's kids went on tv and said they don't see Republicans as people?  No Democratic Party's offspring has ever literally dehumanized Republicans publicly like that in all my lifetime.  Yet it's treated as completely normal when Trump's son goes on Fox News does that to Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it such a shock that after decades of being the punching bags for the right wing propaganda industry, an industry that there is clearly a huge audience of people who thirst for content focused on demonizing much of the country, that some of the punching bags are hitting back a little?  Much of the country have been on the receiving end of much worse coming from a dedicated propaganda industry for decades now.  Imagine how they feel.

       So whenever Trump does something it was because of what Obama left him like the economy and ISIS, but whenever Obama bad a problem it was because of what Bush left him? Your bias is showing. Judge a president by what they have done. If Trump's ISIS policy is the same as Obama's then why is the result different?

       It's called time. People pretend that the country was so shitty a year ago and suddenly it's amazing now that Trump got in. Bush actually did leave Obama a crumbled economy. Obama left Trump in great shape. You can be happy with the little stuff that Trump has done. But the reality is, he hasn't changed much in the last 5 minutes since he got in office.

       Obama was elected in 2008, a year into the biggest recession since the Great Depression, which was caused by abysmal regulation of the banking sector. If you don't see how Bush, and other neoliberal ideologues, played their part in that then you're seriously not looking at the issue properly.

       Trump was elected after Obama's 2 terms when world economies were on the up. All Trump has done is turned the USA into a joke on the international stage.

       On the economy issue in particular, the big difference would be that when Obama took office the economy was shit and still on it's way down and then started recovering and continued to recover.  When Trump took office the economy was already on it's way up.  Right or wrong, the perception is that the economy turned around under Obama is just continuing the same upward trend under Trump.

       Trump has only been president for a year. The effects of his legislations won't be felt until at least next year. Obama inherited a broken economy and after he was elected it still went down for a while because Bush's policies were still in place but Obama was president for 8 years. Long enough for his policies to change the economy. It takes time to change things. Wars always take years to win especially against guerillas.

       Our country covertly

       Isis.  Our country bombed itself to let us go back to the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is if trump or anyone else in upper office wanted to help our country they could.   They're pushing us down economically- just look at foreign  healthcare.  We pay more than anyone else for healthcare on the planet.  We're being extorted slowly.  They are setting the infrastructure to stop rebellions.  &lt;militarized police&gt; + &lt;no guns&gt; + &lt;divided nation&gt; = absolutely no change at all.   The people in office aren't the people that actually think up our laws!

       How did they covertly create ISIS? All I've seen is that our country funded rebel groups that either defected to or were overtaken by ISIS.

       And if we created ISIS, why would we have been bombing them?

       Because that way you folks get to sell weapons to ISIS, Syrian Rebels, AND the American military. Talk about an economic boost (for iron monger CEOs).

       Also, you folks are much easier to rule like serfs when you're terrified of a Big Bad Other. So there always has to be one. Nazi's aren't a threat anymore. Commies are erstwhile allies and business partners now. So you now have to be afraid of

       terroristy as they come. After all, the fiery thetoric from 9/11 has long since failed to stoke the needed patriotic fury and paranoia, and focusing on Afganistan and Iraq are good ways to get people to question the party line. But if they keep inventing boogymen for you to get your collective pants over and beg the government to protect you from them, they can keep taking your money, freedom and whatever else they want. All the while saying you need to give it up because you demand protection from the boogymen.

       No, they could only keep their caucus together by keeping the cost to $1.5 trillion over 10 years with no cost past that. The way they did this is by changing the inflation formulas to constantly raise taxes on everyone while doing a very large cut to the corporate taxes. After 5 years (would have to look that up) the tax cuts across the lower income groups expire to keep the cost at $1.5 trillion. The inflation changes and some other games allowed them to keep the high income tax cuts (pass through businesses were a big part of this) and corporate tax cuts past the 10 year time frame.

       Well, let me ask you. Let's say they did get that changed and now were going to vote for it. So, a) that assumes that they could get enough Republicans to change it and b) that would mean they would have to accept and vote for the huge tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. They weren't going to be allowed to offer amendments. Would this change mean that they would have to allow for a full repeal of the estate tax? Would the new corporate tax rate be even lower? What would they be giving up by allowing this bill to pass without the reconciliation rules?

       Oh, I know both sides are working with corporate America. But, Republicans are definitely more willing to cater to them on large things. The repeal of environment protections during this White House. The removal of net neutrality rules. The huge tax cuts. Yeah, Democrats support corporate America, but they also do not allow them to run wild. Republicans definitely cater to them more, and allow them to run wild.

       We see things differently. That's the beauty of this country. I'm still on the fence about net neutrality. I get that it gives the power back to the service providers. But I'm suspicious of the push that I witnessed a few months ago that was prompted by companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Google. Net neutrality was only a thing for a couple of years. The internet existed and thrived long before the government stepped in to regulate it. And since the repeal I've yet to be personally affected by it. That being said, I haven't really looked to far into it so I'm still undecided.
      </p>
      <p>
       The regulations he has already saved hundreds of millions of dollars. Makes it easier for businesses to start up. Which in turn employs more Americans. We've already seen several companies reinvesting in the US again.
      </p>
      <p>
       If by the EPA stuff your referring to The Paris Accords, I'm glad we pulled out of that. Fishy, fishy shit right there. Doesn't make any sense whatsoever why our country would pay poorer countries to go green. It's also slightly suspect that Obama pushed through $500 million days before Trump was inaugurated. Who's responsible for overseeing where that money goes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those tax cuts, while temporary for common folks like us, are good for business. Apple recently announced that their coming back to the states and with it 20,000 jobs will be created and $38 billion in taxes paid here, rather than Ireland. It is good for business. Although I do get were your coming from on the permanence of corporate tax cuts vs ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Democrats are just as in bed with corporate sponsors and lobbyist as the Republicans are. You can look at the amount of money raised by the Clinton campaign vs Trump campaign and Obama's campaign vs McCain's campaign if your doubtful. Their just better at selling their platforms is all. I respect your views, I just happen to disagree. Hope you enjoy your Tuesday!

       Net neutrality is actually how the internet was run for many years. It is only recently that the ISPs have been changing that, which is why the rules were put in place to try to push it back towards how it used to be. Once Verizon won in court, throwing out those provisions, the FCC then declared them common carriers to put them back under them.  That is the way it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The environmental stuff is not the Paris Accords...which honestly, was weird to get upset over, since it was a voluntary agreement with no penalties, but regardless...It was stuff like these:
*Revoke rule that prohibited mining companies from dumping toxic waste in waterways near mines.
*Removed rules limiting mercury and air toxins from power plants
      </p>
      <p>
       Money being brought back to the US is good, though they are paying a very small amount of taxes on it compared to what they would. It is taxed at what, 15%? Who is going to make up the money that used to be earned through the corporate taxes that are lowered? If we want to move away from corporate taxes, some other taxes are going to have to be increased or spending will need to be decreased. The Republicans have decided to reduce spending but removing safety net programs. I mean, there are really only two ways...military or safety net. The rest of the federal budget is a pittance besides them.

       That's complete bullshit.  It was always a thing.  The only new thing is how it's achieved and only changed because one of the companies whose conduct is regulated by net neutrality went to court to have the old means declared illegal.  Now they like to pretend that net neutrality suddenly came into being with the new method, even though they must have known it existed before when they sued to try to get rid of it necessitating the new method using the FCC.

       As we are discussing this, Trump is failing to enact sanctions agaisnt Russia that were almost unanimously passed by Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't even a partisan issue. It is the executive branch refusing to carry out an action passed by a veto-proof majority of the legislature.

       Those sanctions in particular were the ones he was forced to sign last year regarding Russia's "meddling" in the election. Are you aware of the sanctions he announced last week that he's placing on Russia regarding their occupation of Crimea and ongoing violence in eastern Ukraine?

       Thought exercise. Why do your views have to be considered polarizing? Perhaps neither of you are wrong, and if you look past what appears to be a stark difference you find out that your opinions are closer than you could imagine, just that you each are focusing on different aspects of the same issue.

       Is he really anymore "racist" or "sexist" than the typical American?
      </p>
      <p>
       And do those terms mean anything anymore?  "Racist!" is the accusation made now for anyone who disagrees with the multiculturalism agenda or questions ethnic double standards.  It used to mean something more in line with active discrimination or hostility towards racial minorities.  "Sexism" is equally blurry, catch-all category which means anything from forcible rape to offending a woman's sensibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both terms are used like cudgels to silence someone questioning the agenda of many activist agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Trump, he's definitely crude in a way that seems somewhat unbecoming for public office, whether he actually has it out for women or minorities I don' t think can easily be objectively said as true.  It's hard to draw a line between his personal comments and the intense public assault on his character for political purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Policy wise, I think he's a bit of a disappointment and I think he's been too soft on Republican policies he seemed to be against while campaigning.  More party loyal and less willing to challenge status quo ideas than he seemed to be as a candidate.  I'm not sure if this is political reality in play or whether he's just an opportunist.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all of this could just be wrong, and Trump is just a chaotic person with no specific agendas or goals.

They are constantly and consistently shutting down free speech on college campuses across the country. People really need to wake the fuck up to what's going on at universities these days. Anyone with a dissenting opinion is labeled and accused of hate speech. Effectively shutting down any conversation that might have contradicted their ideology. Anyone who believes that immigration should be reformed is labeled a racist/bigot, despite the fact that black Americans overwhelmingly support the issue.

       Are you legit trying to compare those cats with Trump and Sessions? That's absolute crazy talk. What do you think might happen if some bold North Korean journalist were to question how many scoops of ice cream Kim Jong Un had at dinner? You know what would happen. The comparison is a joke and obviously your just as guilty of your own biases as the Trump supporters you've pointed out are of theirs. There is no comparison.

      <p>
       What a load of bullshit.  How many college campuses are there across the country?  How many individual incidents of this speech shutting down?  How many individual colleges are actually even effected?  And how do you consider a bunch of over excited college kids to evidence of anything particularly meaningful?  They're college kids; their brains have not finished developing, many of them are being exposed suddenly to a whole new world, to new people and experiences and they're at an excitable age where balanced judgement tends to be lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's your great free speech risk?  While the current president has literally spoken about wanting to change the Constitution to limit free speech and routinely attacks the free press, even calling it the "enemy of the people" - that phrase being the kind of talk one expects to hear out of authoritarian regimes like North Korea.

       Your either seriously uninformed or your one of those social justice warriors out there participating. I'm very aware that their young, impressionable, passionate kids. You may grossly underestimate what young, impressionable, passionate kids are capable of, but I don't. It cost UC Berkley $600,000 for security for a Ben Shapiro speech. $600,000. That's crazy money. If those young, impressionable, passionate kids were nothing but what you seem to believe they are it would cost no where near that.

       If they were only out there holding signs, peacefully practicing their free speech this wouldn't be an issue. But it is an issue. College should be a place to open your mind to different ideas and values. All sides of an issue. But today rather than listen to somebody with an opposing view the alt-left disrupts and actively tries to shut down the event. There is no open debate. If you don't have the same worldview then the alt-left will call you a racist/bigot completely shutting down any conversation that could have been had. That's not good for our future leaders. And maybe you should read up a little about Marxism. We know nazi's are bad. Commies were awful to you know.

       I was only describing the polarization.  It's not a strawman fallacy unless SportsLovesSportsLife decides to come back and denounce the "Michael Obama has a dick" activists.  I still haven't met a Trump supporter who isn't fixated on "Michelle's Obama dick" in some fashion.

       In my experience the regular in real life Trump supporters don't say anything about Michael Obama or her alleged dick.  I think you are dipping into a specific sample set of people there that don't accurately represent Trump supporters as a whole.

       Add to this, there is an impression that no matter what Hillary Clinton does she will be hated because she is a woman, culturally liberal, or both and so many on the left rush to defend her because she has been attacked for so long and nothing has been proven. This creates the impression by the left that she is the victim of a never ending witch hunt and nothing she says or does will ever be good enough for the Right.
      </p>
      <p>
       So anyone who has ever been a victim of the Rights attack or is culturally liberal will want to defend her, regardless of if they agree with her or not.

       Like what the fuck? I voted for them cause I thought they were they best choice, I had no thought about how their gender would influence their job.

       I dont think "most young people" are left leaning. More that the internet connected young people tend to be much more left leaning than people who barely use it.

       And I wonder why, are these connected young peoples minds being molded by someone? Cause it seems that people who stay away from the internet aren't this way

       I'm sorry but yr wrong. It's not real. Reddit was never 100% 
real but got very very fake when Hillary claimed the nomination. I spent 10 years on reddit frequently in the politics sub and one day it became fake. Plain and simple. All real discussion was buried. It happened overnight. There's no doubt in my mind that most of the pro-Hillary narratives are some sort of Soros psy op program. It's really easy to get Hillary bots on reddit. There's only 3 or 4 angles they take. "But her emails!" is a common sarcastic remark. There wasn't a single joke about Hillary passing out and thrown into a van. Has anyone ever been so immune to criticism? She was the deep state's only hope.

       I was there. I've been on reddit FOREVER, and politics changed overnight. It was CLEARLY Pro-Bernie and Anti-Hillary, and as soon as she claimed the nomination, not a single anti-Hillary article could be found on the front page, and suddenly the whole of politics, which used to encompass ALL politics, was nearly 98% filled with Anti-Trump articles.  This literally happened in under 24 hours. From 50% Anti-Hillary and 10% Anti-Trump, to 0% Anti-Hillary and 98% Anti-Trump.  It was fucking madness! No article about Hillary's theft of the nomination, or any of the mountains of evidence could make the front page, because anything mentioning Hillary without pre-coronating her, was downvoted into oblivion in minutes.

       She's unfuckingtouchable on reddit. No matter how much truth there is to the criticism (unnecessary destruction of Libya, Haiti Relief Fund, Clinton Foundation), you get completely obliterated by downvotes, almost always with no reply, or a reply that doesn't address anything you say.

       Most mentions of Hillary outside of this sub are made in Trump related threads, which comes across as a very desperate way to attempt to shift the conversation away from Trump criticism. No one cares about her anymore. Any comparisons between the two are pointless.

       What fucking world do you live in? The best she's ever gotten from this site is tolerance, and that's damn rare. She's basically an enemy of Reddit, and the only reason she isn't getting spit on

       Dude she's some irrelevant old lady that has the money to not get locked up just like the rest of the rich people. Fuck Hillary but bringing her up now is just so tiring. And plus most people only bring up Hillary when talking about trump. It's fine if u wanna bash hilldawg but don't use it as a reason that trumps wrong doings should also get swept under the rug.

       I experience this regularly, constantly express my general discontent with the course of actions by POTUS but am similarly disgusted by the desperate attempts to undermine him in ways that are petty and invalid by the MSM. Because of the latter, the former is completely ignored and people start pulling out the "daddy" narrative, it's almost embarrassing to watch people delude themselves into arguing with a charicature of their own perception of the type of person they think they are arguing with.

       Me too.  I don't think Trump is perfect or above error and there are things he does that I don't like and things that make me nervous.  However I'm afraid of how easily people are eating up this Russia hysteria.  We have literally gotten to the point were we can label any movement as "Russian influenced" and it will be immediately discredited regardless of merit.  Just look at how the #releasethememo hashtag was handled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to be critical of Trump for the actual things he does that I disagree with but it's 24/7 Russian hysteria.

       Because Hillary Clinton rigged the primaries and she's horrible. Most of the people who voted for Trump only did so to stop Clinton from winning. Ironically, most of the people who voted for Clinton only did so to try to stop Trump too. Almost no one actually likes either corrupt assbag.

       Yeah she is corrupt and rigged the election.  She definitely deserved to lose for being a complete asshole who acted like she was going to win.  No matter how shitty Hilary is, it does not change the fact that Donald Trump that trump is a complete moron that knows nothing about the political system.  He is obviously being manipulated globalists and I just don’t understand that people believe that he is a savior.  Or maybe people just really liked that episode of Apprentice where meatloaf and Gary Busy fought over art supplies.

       But hating Trump doesn't make me defend Clinton. Which is what op is talking about. Defending corrupt Democrats is not the same thing as hating corrupt Republicans. Personally, I think it's just simpler to hate ALL corrupt politicians regardless of party.

They did this because Hillary Clinton knew that she had no chance of winning a fair contest, so she wanted to make sure her Republican opponent would maximize her chances of pulling out a victory. And who better for her to set up to lose than her old friend?

       It's an organized effort that has been ongoing heavily since the end of the DNC convention. Just some demographic information on Reddit for some context. Reddit is made up of about 75% Millenials. This demographic is largely left leaning (progressive left, not Centrist/Neoliberals.) They also happen to be the most anti-establishment demographic as well. According to this information when combined with current polling you will discover that something is very off. Sanders has super majority support from Millenials among a site that has a super majority representation of that demographic, so the real question is how is it possible to see positive news about Bernie Sanders get downvoted to zero in an environment where there should be a constant circle jerk. The numbers do not add up folks, most people are very aware of the shilling/astroturfing that goes on. For the folks who are denying this, look at this data and please explain how it's possible for Reddit to have a centrist/neoliberal pro-establishment leaning among a demographic that is the least pro-establishment/neoliberal leaning?

       I swear the compound up/down votes makes subreddits susceptible to stealthy brigade voting... maybe by design.

       If you look at voters under 30 in the 2016 primaries, Bernie Sanders got more votes than Clinton and Trump COMBINED. That fact should tell you a lot about what millennials think of those politicians. Seriously,
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/20/more-young-people-voted-for-bernie-sanders-than-trump-and-clinton-combined-by-a-lot/?utm_term=.a2b3b4259a7b">

       . Young people don't like Clinton. Trump actually got more votes than Clinton from people under 30, but Bernie blew them both away. According to the data in that chart there, Bernie got so many votes that would have gotten a 56% in a THREE WAY contest against Clinton AND Trump if only voters under 30 counted.

       I disagree with that. I feel like he respected them enough to let them have a platform. They went on to shit themselves because they weren't expecting to actually have to convey a message. I can respect Bernie letting someone have a voice.

       I remember the politics subreddit being overwhelmingly pro Bernie. Then, almost from one day to the other,  Bernie supporters critical of Clinton were branded as misogynist "bernie bros" and it became an exclusive Hillary subreddit.

       as a first-timer to this sub... it disappoints me that you've had such bad encounters on the topic. i dont consider people on reddit to be all-knowing but with the state of the goverment in the last ~5 years, every politician should get shade thrown at them. guarding one because of who they
       <em>
        arent
       </em>
       is no different than a circlejerk.

       It's not just people named "Clinton". Others who have been involved in her scandals, others who have been exposed criminally mishandling classified material, they're also protected. It's not about name it's about political connections. Have the right connections to the right people, and even without being a Clinton,

       In other words, "the beatings will continue until morale improves." As if being more aggressive and obvious with their bullshit wouldn't make us hate them even more. Back in 2016, I saw more than a few people saying that they were voting for Trump because they couldn't stand the Democrat shills trolling. And it's only gotten worse and more stupid since then.

       We don't. We wanted Bernie Sanders and the Democrats rigged their primaries to ensure that we would be allowed to choose between Clinton and Trump. Our choice was neoliberal Democrat or neoliberal Republican.

       You claim people who shit on trump do it as support for Hillary. And you wonder why people downvote you? You’re the exact opposite side of the spectrum. You blindly follow trump and say there’s “no evidence of collusion”. You’re a sheep.

       This is correct, but there's a nuance to it that shouldn't be overlooked. Paid advertisements are required by law to be identified as such. However, the PR firms that run this shit claim that they're not paying for the ad. They pay employees to post on Reddit, but they don't pay Reddit. So according to them, they're not "paid ads". What a bunch of bullshit.

       Most people don't like the Clintons. Even most Democrats understand that the Clintons are corrupt, horrible, nearly universally hated, and only about 25% of Americans even consider themselves a Democrat today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect described in the op is due to astroturf. Paid public relations employees infiltrating social media to protect and defend their clients. Usually this means sockpuppet accounts trolling and vote manipulating, but at its worse, it can mean PR employees controlling mod teams of entire communities. This is why you can get banned from r/politics just for talking a lot about how the DNC rigged the 2016 primaries for Hillary Clinton. Hell, I got banned from r/sandersforpresident during the 2016 primaries for linking to news articles about the election fraud that was going on at the time.

       People need to understand. Left or right does not matter. These people are put into power by those behind the curtain. It goes deeper than the average person would ever even consider, it's designed that way.

       This political infighting divides the public. It literally does not matter who is President, this disturbing, sick machine will keep on chuggin.

       Reddit wasn't with her after she won the primary.  Reddit was virulently anti Clinton during that time and continued to be up until the election.  It wasn't until after the election (the very next day) that the tide stared to turn.

       Politics is all us vs them. So, the overwhelming liberal nature of reddit means people view any criticism of Hillary, no matter justified, as a defense of Trump. It's the bizarre nature of "oh, talking about Hillary? That's just whataboutism, now what about the horrible thing Trump did!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact Trump actually does still use Hillary to deflect from his problems just makes it easier.

       I wondered about the same. I'm not trying to be mean here when I say that anyone irrational enough to still support Madame Clinton is more likely to be unemployed and so has the time to sit at home and stew on Reddit. All they've got left is their downvoting capacity.

       Parallel fact:   Most Democrats view George W.  Bush Jr.  favorably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basic psychology:   Confronting the reality for Americans would be very painful and destroy a mythology of exceptionalism that has been cultivated from the beginning of the country.    Americans are in denial of reality as much as Germans were under Hitler.    US empire is an intoxicating package of evil that will go down in infamy,   with some exceptional bright spots out of a sewer of greed and fear,  exploitation and violence.    Most of the passionate promoters of American Ideology are sold out tools,  but many are psychopathic self promoters like Hillary and her husband.

       Yes,  even if you are a far left Bernie supporter you will find instant negative votes if you mention anything about the election or mention Hillary candidacy.  The Democratic party is split and there seems to be a lot of PR and Reputation Management in full affect to hide this split.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Bernie - narrative focused on wealth inequality, rigged economy, wall street reform, a leftist populism on economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Hillary - narrative is on identity politics, immigration and gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of money and effort is being spent to keep the narrative away from 1% issues and instead focus on bigotry, discrimination, Russia etc.

       Threads about her are fine but she is a scape goat for Trump at the moment.

       I spend most of my (reddit) time on this sub and have since coming here, when there were less than ~300k subscribers a couple years ago.  So, like others who've been here for awhile, I've watched this sub change considerably in that time and while I have been frustrated with the influx of nonsense at times, I never really checked out other subs, especially political ones. 
Well, the other day, I just so happened to peruse r/all and clicked on links here and there.  To be perfectly frank, I was appalled at the volume and severity of absolute horseshit, nonsense, and indoctrinated sheeple-minded thinking that exists on threads involving anything to do with partisan politics.  The Trump-haters/Hillary-lovers and vice-versa have turned this place into a bullshit soup where nourishment must be extracted.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that experience, I feel better now saying that there seem to be more level-headed people keeping each other (and the stories/narrative) in check than in other subs where similar topics are discussed.

       We are living in a bizarro world where everything seems backwards.  The left loves the FBI and idolizes Comey as some sort of martyr.  Trump, the “law and order” candidate, and his supporters are claiming corruption.  The left suddenly is the one blaming everything on a foreign power and accusing people left and right of being Russian agents or bots.  The party supposedly in power is the one accused of “conspiracy theories” all the time.  People are very smug toward anyone that doesn’t follow the dem party line.  They won’t discuss.  Constant comparisons to Nazi Germany yet somehow “the resistance” mostly controls the narrative and hating the president is “cool” in pop culture.  I could go on and on but I won’t right now.  It’s like a switch went off and everything flipped.  Actual fake news is all over the internet, and mainstream sources are almost entirely partisan and biased.  We aren’t living in a world of different opinions but a world where people believe in altogether different realities.  Something toxic is going on and it can’t be good for the idea of a free and open democratic society.

       Sometimes she is relevant, but for the most part people talking about Hillary are deflecting for the dumb shit the guy who actually won is doing. I say this knowing my last five comments were an argument about how bad of a candidate Hillary was and as a larger point about Democrats having a piss poor 2016 message to voters causing them to lose. Beyond understanding that she was a terrible candidate she isn't that relevant anymore. She has no power and has been humiliated by losing to Trump. Continuing to bring her up when she isn't the topic is annoying.

       What if... just maybe... you have it all backwards. What if trump is the crazy asshole who was installed like a fucking software update and all the sheeple and the bots that express their freedom of opinion are actually humans who are smarter than you give them credit. Why does everyone else have to be wrong? 
What makes you so sure you are part of the group who is correct?

       What has she ever done to make you think that?  She's lost two presidential elections and only won her Senate seat because it was a democratic state and she had no opponent.  And the "popular vote win" doesn't mean anything at all, especially since most Americans didn't vote for her and she didn't even break 50%.

       This sub started to go to shit town during the election. A lot of information and stuff was getting leaked about the DNC and other shady shit. With the suprise from trump, the "media" kept shut about other things and focused on trump and whatever they could sprinkle to take attention away.

       There were and probably still are tactics to keep thought control. By controlling people's universe and energy into a sport-like information hub, there is less worry of people looking at the information as irrelevant to their pursuit of happiness

       your argument boils down to what you believe and hope to be true. My point is that your belief is false and based on wrong thinking. If you look at human history, you will see your perspective is wrong and has never ever been right. You are on a god damn conspiracy sub reddit where we talk all the time about how the powerful conspire to maintain their power. Part of that conspiracy is getting the average person to think like you do because if the average person thought like I did, there would be lots of death, destruction and war.....not something the powerful want because it would destroy their power.

       The reality is that the strong give the weak whatever the strong want the weak to have and that ultimately benefits the strong. You can pretend whatever you want, but that does not change reality. Look at fucking human history. Its a never ending history of violence and conquest.  Weakness is not tolerated in nature nor in human history.

       But people that say they hate high rent prices, high taxes, pollution, traffic, freeloaders, crime, people that cheat the system but support illegals are the type of people that I hate. Pick one or the other because you can’t say I hate all that stuff and illegals are welcome because they are opposites.

       That's what this sub used to be exclusively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there were always the people here who would believe anything too.  And those same people fall down rabbit holes that make us fight amongst ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a there are definitely a few conspiracies that are entirely fabricated so that the believers make us all more alienated overall. (I'm looking at you flat earth and reptilians)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd go as far to say that these disinfo campaigns are probably state funded initially until the believers can carry the gospel of lies themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anytime an anonymous source drops inside knowledge there's a chance it's horse shit
      </p>
      <p>
       Their web of lies is most likely to cover their own asses,  which would mean they're at least worried that the info is out there.   What that info is is the real question.  I think the idea that our history is wrong is what they are trying to hide.  They know something more about our origins as a species.

       Add to this, there is an impression that no matter what Hillary Clinton does she will be hated because she is a woman, culturally liberal, or both and so many on the left rush to defend her because she has been attacked for so long and nothing has been proven. This creates the impression by the left that she is the victim of a never ending witch hunt and nothing she says or does will ever be good enough for the Right.
      </p>
      <p>
       So anyone who has ever been a victim of the Rights attack or is culturally liberal will want to defend her, regardless of if they agree with her or not.

       I'm sorry but yr wrong. It's not real. Reddit was never 100% 
real but got very very fake when Hillary claimed the nomination. I spent 10 years on reddit frequently in the politics sub and one day it became fake. Plain and simple. All real discussion was buried. It happened overnight. There's no doubt in my mind that most of the pro-Hillary narratives are some sort of Soros psy op program. It's really easy to get Hillary bots on reddit. There's only 3 or 4 angles they take. "But her emails!" is a common sarcastic remark. There wasn't a single joke about Hillary passing out and thrown into a van. Has anyone ever been so immune to criticism? She was the deep state's only hope.

       An interesting criticism, considering almost every other website from the same time period (mid 90s) was started in about the same way.

        To me, I think it's a disparity between what people view as acceptable behavior, and wether that can out weight policy.

       I don't think that's true; it certainly doesn't explain why 22% of Republicans supported Obama bombing Syria if Assad used chemical weapons but 86% of Republicans supported Trump bombing Syria when Assad used chemical weapons.  If they were judging the behavior then it would look more like the Democratic Party demographic where the difference of opinion is lower than the polls' margin of error (38% supported Obama doing it and 37% supported Trump doing the same thing).

       Nor is this an isolated data point.  Consider how Evangelicals now feel about immorality and its relationship to ethics in a public role.  Before Trump came along as the Republican candidate, just 30% of Evangelicals thought someone who indulged in an immoral act in their private life could be ethical in public office.  That number has since leaped up to more than double at 72%

       It's clearly not about the behavior for a sizeable chunk of the country.  It's about the the partisan affiliation of the person doing carrying out the behavior.
