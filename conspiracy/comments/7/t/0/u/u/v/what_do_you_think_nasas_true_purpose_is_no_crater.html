       I know why they faked the first moon landing, I understand the military power flex. But what are they doing now, what have they been doing? All the strange footage, all the contradictory things they say.

       But then you have to factor in what was being said at the time with regards to radiation and at the time not being able to shield themselves from it. They still maintain today that radiation is a problem that needs to be solved. If they didn't solve it then and haven't solved it now then how have they ever sent people to the moon?

       That's a lot of misconceptions. The technology wasn't destroyed. You can find schematics for the vast vast majority of the manned spacecraft, engines, circuitry, and really anything that wasn't protected by a contractor's patent. Plus flown hardware is still in museums.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are able to recreate the technology now. The issue is funding. Wanna go to the white house and convince Trump to give NASA 5% of our GDP? That's where we were at in the 60's money-wise.

       ? NASA has always been going to space. They build, design, and launch weather satellites, reconnaissance and GPS satellites, probes, landers, and rovers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in case it wasn't obvious, I'll state: it costs more money to send a person to space and bring them back than it does to send a satellite to space and leave it there.

       Not easy to argue with the fantasists. Apparently we have been so many times that the technology by now should have been perfected, yet we are still here trying to solve radiation exposure issue nevermind even anything else. To believe in this fatlntasy tale one has to believe that technology and innovation is going backwards. We solved all those issues in the 60 and 70s but in this decade we aren't anywhere close to getting people on the moon. How can one still believe in such bullshit?

       How about this: you go to school, get yourself an aerospace engineering degree, get a few internships, get a job in the industry and come back and tell me again it's a fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We "solved" the issues in the 60's and 70's. That is true. But we barely solved them. The Apollo astronauts came back very irradiated. That's an issue that needs to be
       <em>
        improved
       </em>
       . Safety standards have changed in the past 50 years. That needs to be
       <em>
        improved
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the technology be perfected after only 50 years? We've been building cars for 100 years. Are those perfect? We've been making buildings for 1000's. Are those perfected? We've been making computers for 70 years. Are those perfected?
      </p>
      <p>
       We haven't gone backwards by any means. Your ignorance on the aerospace industry is not equivalent to a lack of progress. Ever noticed how flights have gotten cheaper? Better GPS accuracy? More frequent rocket launches? Longer stays on the ISS? New rockets being developed? More companies launching into space than ever? You have the gall to call that going backwards hahaha.

       You couldn't shill any harder than you are doing now, yet even NASA contradicts what you are staying by saying things like they destroyed the tech and can't replicate it and they haven't solved radiation problem so too dangerous to put people into deep space. So yes you are living in your own deluded fantasy bubble. You really do believe technology has gone backwards if you believe that we went to the moon in the late 60s but can't get any way close now in 2018. Nobody was talking about radiation sickness after the so called landings,why are you filling in blanks and making stuff up? It's only when they started getting challenged about it,did they have to patch up their stories to make it believable again. As I said fairytale and fiction.

       Lol suuure, and nobody was talking about radiation sickness when we were dropping nukes 50 miles from American towns either. Oh wait... They were. We just had a rudamentary understanding of it. I guess the astronauts being in quarantine from their families doesn't count. Or the news articles about that, citing radiation doesn't count either!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's literally a money issue. If I gave you $10,000 in 1970 to buy house, you'd be set. Try to by a house in 2018 with that money. Tell me how far you get. Because according to you, that means house technology has gone backwards. Try to but a decent car for $500 in 2018. Whoops, car technology has gone backwards since 1900! Can't do the same thing with the same $ amount of money in the future? Inflation doesn't exist, world is moving backwards! They cripple NASA's budget and funnel all the money to the military so the actual tech can be developed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol can't get close, when the military is leagues ahead of NASA already. You've just been fooled to think NASA is
       <em>
        allegedly
       </em>
       the top of the line. In reality, they're being held back to hide the real tech. That fact is so obvious I can't believe people are actually here debating it!
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess when I go to work, I'm living in fantasy land! The engines my company manufacturers must get destroyed after we spend years designing, building, and testing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really unfortunate you've been caught up in the NASA opposition. The government uses it as a scapegoat to deflect and distract whenever the walls close in on them, and to hide tech. Haven't you noticed that? Mueller closes in on Trump, NASA opposition creeps up. Hillary's email scandal, NASA opposition is back in swing and flat earthers come out of the woodwork. Benghazi and Fast &amp; Furious scandals? New wave of people suddenly saying the space shuttle is fake, and suddenly the MSM is questioning NASA! 9/11 happens? Ramp up the next wave of moon landing deniers, give them time on the news, make the shows about them! Clinton impeachment looming? Shuttle is fake, GPS is fake! Reagan/Carter Iran mess? First wave of space shuttle deniers, second wave of moon landing deniers! Put them on TV! Watergate? First wave of moon deniers comes in full swing! Interviews, news articles, books about them! Kennedy killed? First wave of space deniers come on in! Flat earthers pop up in the mainstream for the first time!
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop believing everything you see on the TV and YouTube (we used to call it the idiot box and the boob tube for a reason). Open your eyes. Follow the patterns. NASA exists as a scapegoat. The tech they use is waaaaaay behind the what the US and Chinese military has and this is obvious. NASA basically gets all their old tech, and the government makes people like
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       believe NASA does impossible stuff, so it becomes literally impossible for your brain to even conceive the tech the military deals with! They keep NASA 30 years behind their tech because we can't handle the truth, and they don't want us to know the truth. Open your eyes, stop falling for controlled opposition! They're literally rubbing it in your face (giving NASA 30 year old F15s and SR71s) and you're so busy bickering about whether 12 people walked on a rock, all while the military and their contractors are laughing their way to the bank developing RAM jets and SSTO rockets and lasers and mind control and weather control and orbital nukes. So bicker away, while the military gets rich! I can't believe you trust the government so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       They make NASA so independent and transparent so we
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that they're telling us the truth. But you're following the truth they want you to believe! If you can't comprehend a satellite existing or sending a man to the moon, how could you possibly even fathom what the military is doing? That makes you that much easier to control when the shit hits the fan, because you won't be ready

       NASA is so behind yet sending unmanned craft all over the place, so they obviously have a certain amount of technology but still not the means to prevent Astronauts from radiation exposure. You talk like NASA have been doing next to nothing since the moon landings so either they have been busy advancing or have not, if not then how have been doing various missions around the solar system? Those missions aren't exactly cheap and the accumulative cost must be astronomical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is Russia and China,it appears that China are ready to try and put men on the moon but can't yet and don't have any fixed time frame when they can, why is that? They would find a program today if it meant they could boast about doing something like this. Truth is nobody knows yet how the astronauts will react yet when they are exposed to those high levels of radiation and as NASA also comment the effect on the craft itself, that's why they are still testing. Clearly they haven't solved this yet and were not sending people to the moon multiple times due to these dangers.

       They are still advancing. They're just behind where the real tech is in the military. We've been sending unmanned craft places since the 50's using tech developed in the 30's. It's not that hard, it's just expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't talk like they're doing nothing. You're being intentionally obtuse because I outright said they're advancing. They're just way behind the real tech that's been hidden. And they're not cheap. The 20+ trillion in missing money goes somewhere right? It goes right to military orbital tech. RAM jets, weather control, lasers, orbital nukes, nuclear propulsion. Look it up. Wanna know where the military was at in the 80's? Look at what NASA has now. And this is the only way NASA is able to survive on a budget of 0.4% of the GDP, compared to 4% in the 60's. Old military tech is recycled down, and targeted opposition at NASA keeps new tech under wraps because you're still skeptical of 40 year old tech developed 70 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually the military did testing in the effects of radiation on humans starting in the 30's. Using the exact same fabrics and materials NASA used on spacecraft in the 60's. Funny how the tests the military in the past show up 30 years later in NASA tech... And obviously our past knowledge of radiation was faulty at best. As I stated before, safety standards are different. Getting 150 milli-rads per day was thought to be ok in the 60's (you know, backyard nukes, 65+% of adult men smoked? Not a very health-conscious time). Now, private entities have had a chance to conduct independent research, so we know the real dangers. Thus, new standards. The past shielding was adequate for survival, but not for prolonged positive health. Still a materials science issue. You're literally ignoring the fact that it was never entirely solved in the first place, from NASA's POV. The military is fine sacrificing NASA's civilian astronauts as fodder. Note how it's always never ex-military astronauts dying.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet again, I'll state, they're still not receiving adequate funding to just shoot up to the moon in a decade like in the 60's. The test launch for SLS (made of, old shuttle shuttle engines, and old military ULAA/Air Force/Army tech. Wow look at that! NASA using 30 year old military tech again! What a coincidence!) is slotted for next year. Design, construction, fabrication. These things take time already. It doesn't help when the military siphons money and resources, and hinders tech just to kill a bunch of Africans and Middle Easterners. This applies to every country's space program, not just America's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia and China's programs are in the same spot as NASA too. The military and their contractors "innovate" the tech to the space programs decades after it's been developed and tested. Russia doesn't have as much money to throw at their military, hence why their space program has been unchanged for so long. But look at China, or India. Their space programs popped up from nothing, sending probes to the moon and Mars as soon as the world is hearing about them for the first time. Their military tech was advancing way too fast, and they  needed a civilian outlet to keep the populace at bay. And then they release their own targeted opposition to keep skepticism in the technology nice and healthy. Ever heard "how can people who shit in streets send a probe to Mars? Why don't they fix their poverty instead of sending stuff to space?" All targeted opposition from their militaries.
What's more likely: all these space programs developed billions of dollars of tech overnight? Or the tech was already perfected and it was just re-applied to federal civilian space programs?
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's be real. The radiation shielding tech is probably more than adequate at the military's level. The instant they funnel it down to NASA, suddenly every materials scientist will know how to make great radiation shielding. Then those orbital nukes are much less useful. It makes perfect sense to keep that tech under wraps and undisclosed.

       That is prohibitably expensive. The ISS is already the single most expensive object in existence, and it's been basically consistently inhabited since the mid-2000's.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a stark difference between keeping 2-3 people alive in space in LEO for a year and permanent space settlement. Doing the former is already literally one of the most expensive endeavors.

       It all gets funneled to the military, where they get the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       tech, while NASA gets their hand-me-downs 30 years down the line. It's strikingly obvious. Like how NASA got the old F15s and SR71s, or their engine tech, or why Space X is able to leap forward so quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have NASA bring the old tech to the public eye to keep you off the scent of the real tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why SpaceX gets so much push back from the old launch monopolies. They're showing that we have the ability to leap forward quickly in the space industry, and eventually they'll end up discovering some tech that the military was keeping secret. Then suddenly, there will be no more SpaceX, or suddenly they'll have a bunch of unprecedented failures. Like the govsat launch that failed earlier this month. It was the military's fault the 2nd stage didn't deploy, but they pushed the blame on the private company threatening them! SpaceX must be close to a technological breakthrough, or they're about to discover something that the military doesn't want them to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why NASA's budget is so low too, and nobody but the administrators pieces this together. The military industrial complex realized that if they have NASA acting as state-of-the-art technology front for the government, they can do whatever they want in secret.  Weather control, lasers, orbital nukes, RAM jets, SSTOs, nuclear planes and more are all being hidden in development. Haven't you ever thought it was weird that the air force and army have always used separate launch technology than NASA? It's because their tech is better. So the military is happy to let you believe that everything NASA does is fake. If you can't believe 30 year old tech is real (or 60-70 year old with the case of the moon landings), how could you even begin to comprehend the real technology the military is working on? It keeps the masses ignorant about what's really going on. They did the exact same thing with airplanes and blimps. It got out of their hands once private enterprises got in. The same thing is happening with space tech. But it's happening faster than they anticipated, so they ramp up the disinformation campaigns and scapegoat NASA's decades-old tech. And they're getting bold, going as far as sabotaging their own satellites (burning money right in our faces) on private rockets, slowly weakening faith, keeping themselves hidden. Ever noticed how the biggest SpaceX launch failures have been classified or military payloads?
      </p>
      <p>
       And ever notice how there's so many more flat earthers and posts
       <strong>
        specifically
       </strong>
       targeting NASA? That's exactly what they want. Bottom-up disinformation, starting with their scapegoat. If NASA, the oldest space program is fake, then how can SpaceX be real?? And therefore those trillions of dollars can't
       <strong>
        possibly
       </strong>
       go to orbital tech, because it's all fake! That's the thought process they want you to fall into. Can't fight against something you don't believe exists.

       That's a huge part too! After all the radiation the Apollo astronauts were contaminated with, they basically decided to start from the ground up with radiation shielding.

       And it's taken many decades with no breakthrough, yet they still somehow got to the moon and back and lived to age without showing many symptoms of radiation sickness until they started getting challenged about it. So surely they should have been pretty close then by the 70s? Yet today they still haven't solved it with all the tech we have and feel it's too dangerous to send people past low Earth's orbit.

       Tell me, between Apollo and now, which presidential administrations have given NASA the goal to return to the moon within their term?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a materials science issue. They have the technology for adequate shielding. We always have. The issue, however, is making it light enough to incorporate into a craft. In the 70's they weren't as close as you think, and the astronauts came home with significant radiation. In the nuclear age where the government was setting off nukes in the Vegas desert, it wasn't that serious. There were Americans who never left the ground who'd experienced higher radiation. But now we know that it's not ok. Most of the Apollo astronauts have a higher mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease caused by radiation. Rate of CV disease for NASA's astronauts who've never flown is 9%, those who have flown is 11%, and its
       <strong>
        45% for the Apollo astronauts
       </strong>
       . You call that solved??? Over 4x chance of dying from heart disease caused by radiation is a problem solved to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol crowd funding a mission? Are you serious? We can't even crowd funding basic necessities like education, food, and healthcare. And you expect people to crowd fund a space mission?? And a global campaign? What do you call the ISS, if not then culmination of global effort?
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize that NASA hasn't been sitting on their hands and choosing not to go to the moon for
       <em>
        no reason
       </em>
       . The focus with the space shuttle was LEO. The first administration to even put the moon on the docket was Bush Jr, who canceled the shuttle program. The Obama said Mars and asteroid capture, and cancelled the Constellation program. Then Trump said just moon, and we still have SLS.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, better companies. Hence why private enterprises are aiming for the moon now without NASA. These things weren't feasible before, they are now.

       Moon landing is a fairytale. Stuff doesn't compute, when you keep hearing how they don't have the tech or have not solved radiation problems in 2018, how the fuck did they do it in the 60s? The wackos aren't the people who doubt the moon landings, the wackos are ones who believe that technology advancement goes progressively worse over time, because that is what you have to accept if you believe the landings happened.

       Laughable to be honest. Only mentions cases of heart and cardiovascular disease, how many of them with cancer due to radiation sickness? People who don't get radiation exposure end up with rjart disease in their latter years. This isn't proof at all. It reads more like trying to sell the idea these people went to the moon though, because so much is being said about radiation making deep space travel a near impossibility

       Cardiovascular disease is closely tied to radiation exposure.

       They were all in perfect health, yet their rates of cardiovascular disease are double the national average, and 4x their LEO counterparts.

       You can't categorize me. And 'response' to what, specifically? You and your team can't prove anything. You are all about theory, photoshop, and CGI. You don't live in the real world. All I say is, your story is nonsensical and a big hoax; however, I do not promote any theory of my own. I take a full stop after stating, "NASA is full of shit and the earth is not a revolving sphere." Full stop at this point.

       So the vacum of space would completely suck all the stuff coming out? Then how do rockets work in space? If no force is visibly imparted on powder mere feet away then how is there ever thrust? Is there a simple way to explain it?

       No, it just changed how exhaust exits the nozzle. The reason why the exhaust from a rocket engine is in a straight line like
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/1qk3MR3.png">
        this
       </a>
       is because of the ambient pressure from the atmosphere pushing on the exhaust. The thinner the air gets, the wider and wider that exhaust plume gets.

       how much the exhaust plume expands and gets clearer and clearer as the rocket ascends.

       It will displace dust, as long as it's outputting enough thrust to do so. It will not, however, displace air that in turn displaces dust. I'm merely stating that air exacerbates this effect on earth

       So, here's where I'm at so far on NASA. I'm about 50/50 on the moon landings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either A. they faked them to show superiority over the Russians and build a furry of American pride, while simultaneously siphoning the money they were allegedly spending into black projects and other areas of corruption. There's plenty of supporting information to back up this theory. Just look up the "Star Wars" project, and all of the scientists from that project that all died in very suspicious circumstances for an example of NASA funneling money (there's a shit ton).
      </p>
      <p>
       Or B. What the public saw was faked to conceal the true landings, in which we either found something or realized we couldn't really broadcast live on television. And we've been going back in secret ever since, potentially have a base set up by now on the dark side of the moon (which can never be seen from earth due to the very odd rotation of the moon). The evidence for this is more shakey, but still interesting. In this instance, the theory that the moon is an intentionally placed space object, presumably as a way to terraform earth to sustain human life, ties in nicely. Combined with the evidence from NASA that the moon seemed to "ring like a bell, as if it were hollow", and the flat bottoms held by many of the largest craters, and the rarity of the moons orbit and size compared to all other observable satellites, is also plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't believe, is all the bullshit that the public was fed in the 60s.

       How would we secretly go to the moon? You can't really conceal rocket launches.

       Also, we have a satellite or two that is frequently sending back pics of the dark side of the moon.

       Pretty much every payload that gets launched gets tracked by amateur satellite trackers on the ground. You can actually look up the orbits of a lot of our top secret/spy satellites despite that being highly classified information.

       Why would there be a crater under the engine?
       <br/>
       It was a low power engine operating at below maximum thrust, it was in a vacuum so the exhaust gasses expand rapidly outward, and the engine cut when it was still a few feel off the ground.

       Im on the fence about the moon landing so don't take my comment the wrong way. Since you seem to know about physics in a vacuum I'd like to ask you a question. Why does the dust from under the wheels of the lunar rover appear to rise and dissipate like it would on earth? Seriously just looking for an answer.

       <a href="https://gfycat.com/DifferentDefiniteAustraliansilkyterrier">
        lunar grand prix
       </a>
       video. The dust does not dissapate. It does spread out (as it should) but it clearly just falls right back down. In fact, how the dust behaves
       <em>
        proves
       </em>
       that they were on the moon. You can see that is seems to fall a lot slower than it would on earth.

       Thanks for the link, but honestly I dont see much difference in the way the dust moves in that clip compared to a dune buggy on sand played in slow motion. Granted a dune buggy is usually built for speed and the "rooster tails" kicked up by its wheels are going to be larger and taller than the slow moving lunar rover, its the rate that the dust falls and the spread of the cloud that is similar to me. Wouldn't the lower gravity of the moon produce bigger clouds of dust that took longer to settle? I am in no way an expert and I dont claim to know the science behind any of this, like i said im just curious and you seem to have answers. Could you elaborate on how the behavior of the dust proves the footage was shot on the moon?

       Yes, and as you can see in the video, it does. Keep in mind, that buggy is not very quick (11.2mph was the record, it's going slower in this), yet it's still kicking up quite a bit of dust.

       It's lower gravity. Dust would fall faster if it was on earth, and it clearly does.

       Thanks again. I guess what had me so hung up is the theory that the moon footage was slowed down to make it appear the astronauts were on the moons surface. If you have ever seen footage of a dune buggy or any other vehical kicking up sand in slow motion the dust clouds appear to move similarly. After watching the gif you linked it clicked for me. Your explination makes total sense. I appreciate the info.

       Like the say they can't see stars when in space, but then others say the stars are extremely visible. They say they can't get to the moon because they lost the technology. They said most of the original footage has vanished or been destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe not a full crater but at least a hint of blast, like a faint ring at least. Even when they debunk the theories they said their would be some dust and sediment pushed/blasted from slowing the 17 ton lander, nearly 3 tons at 1/6th earths gravity.
      </p>

       I'm not crazy, I know NASA does its thing but I was wondering if it was used as a money siphon, or weapon development.

       I've never seen that photo of dirt on the lander, is that from walking, or from the original landing?

       Whether you can see stars or not really depends. Normally during the day you can't, but if you look away from the sun and let your eyes adjust you probably can. Also, if you are in LEO you can see them on the night side of the earth.

       Well, we kind of did. It's been over 40 years, and much of it is degraded away. We still have schematics and all that stuff, and we could easily go if we wished, but at the end of the day, it's expensive.

       Not accurate. What was lost was the original, higher quality version of the Apollo 11 tapes, which were wiped and overwritten during a tape shortage in the 80s. We will have the lower quality version of that same footage, and we have picture of the higher quality version.

       Probably from the landing, but I wouldn't expect much dust on them anyway. If you look at photos of the Apollo 14 landing, one of the legs actually dug into the ground a bit.

       The 80s tape storage seems a little thin of an excuse, I'm not saying you're wrong or lying, it just seems thin on their part.

       Well there's a creator, I wish I knew if it was the first landing. That's what I thought it should look like. Fanned out dust and pebbles, smooth'ish ring with a rough center?

      <p>
       Government budgets are a little screwy I thought, didn't they lose/couldn't account for a few trillion dollars? That's a whole other thing, you don't need to dig that stuff up.

       I'll have to sift through those photos overtime, thank you for the link!

       I have to pick someone up early for work tomorrow but I'll keep a look out for the photos I'm talking about. The one I'm thinking of was a press photo, it was an astronaut facing forward but slightly turned to the left I think. Someone found the original photo and it was actually a photo from a test, the astronaut was against a wall with writing or stripes. It's driving me nuts I can't find it easier. I need to go for tonight but I'll try to send you a link tomorrow if I can find it.

       I don't really know about that whole story, but I think it has a lot more to do with improper recording and records of money use, and less the money vanished. The problem has not happened at NASA from what I can tell. Their budget is probably too tight for them to be doing that anyway.

       OP, you'll find that people here love to repeat that "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."
      </p>
      <p>
       When you realize how extraordinary a claim it was to send six pairs of men to walk, drive a buggy, and play golf on the moon, mere years after air conditioning in cars was widespread, with an on-board computer with the power of a TI-83 calculator, with no loss of life, you must ask yourself, where is the extraordinary evidence for this?
      </p>
      <p>
       They say they have sent probes to the far reaches of our solar system to take pictures of Pluto, Venus, and Jupiter, and that they have a rover on Mars. But there's not even a 24/7 live stream from the moon. There isn't a camera shot from the moon that pans from earth backwards to the depths of space.
       <em>
        There isn't even a photo of the landing sites.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's fake moon rocks, some very bizarre photos, and some very nervous astronauts. That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's believing in the Easter Bunny but for adults.

       Absolutely. I don't understand the mind state of regular people, like you and I, defending these scumbag liars. NASA can't even defend themselves from this onslaught!! You hear the arguments and they are nothing but a bunch of poor excuses and outlandish expositions with ZERO evidence in the real world. WTF!! GEEZUZ, man!

       Compartmentalization of knowledge; pyramid structure with an elevated, illuminated capstone implying true knowledge is a privilege of the few, whereas the majority of the sheeple remain in the dark. Why do the sheeple decide to defend the status quo? That is the job of educations, TV and MSM, which is why I agree with you about turning off the TV. I threw out my TV set back in 2010.

       Because people are just bred to accept everything we are told as truth, without question. TV helps to manipulate by spreading untruths. Critical thinking is a lost art.

       Worse still is actually people shilling for these liars, filling in blanks which they themselves can't even fill. They have a willing and able sheep class that are more than happy to bail them out. Really does boggle the mind.

       The LRO images again? Hm. That's sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the astronauts are not nervous on the moon. There is no danger or adrenaline in their voices. They sound carefree as if they are simply in a film studio in no peril, because that's exactly what they are. It's only when the missions are over that they must live out their colossal lie that they become nervous and evasive. Anyone can go watch the A11 press conference and observe their nervous body language as they fiddle with their pens and fidget nervously as they try not to fuck up questions about stars (but do anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, the exact opposite of what would happen if the missions were real.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know that I have addressed the LRO images before, noting that they are from NASA and therefore meaningless as "proof" as well as the obvious fact that they show nothing discernible of any trace of any lunar landing other than some lines and pixels that are labeled with what we are supposed to think they represent.
      </p>
      <p>
       So knowing I already know the LRO images to exist when I make the statement that there are no photos of the landing sites, for you to say I am lying in that situation is actually a lie on your part.
      </p>

       No, it's not. You have failed to explain to me how those images are faked. We have absolutely 0 reason to think they are fake, therefor, they are real.

       The Torah has the same God.  The Quran bases it's theology on the one true God but denies Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I put those verse up is they talk about how God is a great mystery to us.  The Father Jehova and the Word of God are both part of the same one God.  Same with his Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       All together this one God is called the Godhead (not trinity):
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom_1:20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ was the Word of God made flesh and he was the bodily incarnation of he Godhead:
      </p>
      <p>
       Col 2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. 
Col 2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muslims get stuck on the idea that there is only one true God so how can there be both Jesus Christ and the Father.  In reality they are one in the same.  Jesus Christ is the human bodily form of God that we humans can understand.  His human fleshy nature is the is human and he is the son of man.  This divine nature is of God and he is also the son of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joh 10:29  My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. 
Joh 10:30  I and my Father are one.

       NASA's purpose is to maintain a technological front for the government to hide modern military tech, and to act as a scapegoat to mislead the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military develops technology decades earlier, and it ends up with NASA's civilian program. Then they make NASA
       <em>
        appear
       </em>
       suuuuper transparent. (ie "See guys! Look at all the NASA stuff we've released! Schematics, diagrams, blueprints, pictures, circuit designs, software! Budget reports tracking spending! Trust the government, because NASA is so transparent and trustworthy!")
      </p>
      <p>
       When the reality is, everything the public sees from NASA is all tech that was developed 30 years ago for military application, and everything they release has been thoroughly vetted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the military starts disinformation campaigns against NASA to keep us from discovering any real tech that they're working on. If we're still arguing about the feasibility of 40 year old tech developed 70 years ago, how could we possibly even comprehend the tech the military has now? If a bunch of people don't think space even exists in the first place, why would they worry about orbital nukes or spy satellites?

       Lol suuure, and nobody was talking about radiation sickness when we were dropping nukes 50 miles from American towns either. Oh wait... They were. We just had a rudamentary understanding of it. I guess the astronauts being in quarantine from their families doesn't count. Or the news articles about that, citing radiation doesn't count either!

       It's literally a money issue. If I gave you $10,000 in 1970 to buy house, you'd be set. Try to by a house in 2018 with that money. Tell me how far you get. Because according to you, that means house technology has gone backwards. Try to but a decent car for $500 in 2018. Whoops, car technology has gone backwards since 1900! Can't do the same thing with the same $ amount of money in the future? Inflation doesn't exist, world is moving backwards! They cripple NASA's budget and funnel all the money to the military so the actual tech can be developed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol can't get close, when the military is leagues ahead of NASA already. You've just been fooled to think NASA is
       <em>
        allegedly
       </em>
       the top of the line. In reality, they're being held back to hide the real tech. That fact is so obvious I can't believe people are actually here debating it!
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess when I go to work, I'm living in fantasy land! The engines my company manufacturers must get destroyed after we spend years designing, building, and testing them.

       It's really unfortunate you've been caught up in the NASA opposition. The government uses it as a scapegoat to deflect and distract whenever the walls close in on them, and to hide tech. Haven't you noticed that? Mueller closes in on Trump, NASA opposition creeps up. Hillary's email scandal, NASA opposition is back in swing and flat earthers come out of the woodwork. Benghazi and Fast &amp; Furious scandals? New wave of people suddenly saying the space shuttle is fake, and suddenly the MSM is questioning NASA! 9/11 happens? Ramp up the next wave of moon landing deniers, give them time on the news, make the shows about them! Clinton impeachment looming? Shuttle is fake, GPS is fake! Reagan/Carter Iran mess? First wave of space shuttle deniers, second wave of moon landing deniers! Put them on TV! Watergate? First wave of moon deniers comes in full swing! Interviews, news articles, books about them! Kennedy killed? First wave of space deniers come on in! Flat earthers pop up in the mainstream for the first time!
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop believing everything you see on the TV and YouTube (we used to call it the idiot box and the boob tube for a reason). Open your eyes. Follow the patterns. NASA exists as a scapegoat. The tech they use is waaaaaay behind the what the US and Chinese military has and this is obvious. NASA basically gets all their old tech, and the government makes people like
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       believe NASA does impossible stuff, so it becomes literally impossible for your brain to even conceive the tech the military deals with! They keep NASA 30 years behind their tech because we can't handle the truth, and they don't want us to know the truth. Open your eyes, stop falling for controlled opposition! They're literally rubbing it in your face (giving NASA 30 year old F15s and SR71s) and you're so busy bickering about whether 12 people walked on a rock, all while the military and their contractors are laughing their way to the bank developing RAM jets and SSTO rockets and lasers and mind control and weather control and orbital nukes. So bicker away, while the military gets rich! I can't believe you trust the government so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       They make NASA so independent and transparent so we
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that they're telling us the truth. But you're following the truth they want you to believe! If you can't comprehend a satellite existing or sending a man to the moon, how could you possibly even fathom what the military is doing? That makes you that much easier to control when the shit hits the fan, because you won't be ready

        You know that I have addressed the LRO images before, noting that they are from NASA and therefore meaningless as "proof" as well as the obvious fact that they show nothing discernible of any trace of any lunar landing other than some lines and pixels that are labeled with what we are supposed to think they represent.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I would like you to give me a reason why them being from NASA means they are meaningless. You have still failed to explain how NASA is untrustworthy after being given numerous opportunities. Also, they are quite clearly the Apollo landing sites. You don't need to labels to see what they are.

       No, it's not. You have failed to explain to me how those images are faked. We have absolutely 0 reason to think they are fake, therefor, they are real. We have real images of the Apollo landing sites, and you are claiming we don't. You are a liar. You do not care about the truth. You care only for your agenda, and pathetically back away whenever it's challenged.

       The people upvoting already think it's a hoax. Once again, I don't care that much if some people think it's a hoax. They are still wrong.

       I could link you to a comment thread or two where I've changed people's minds. You certainly have not changed anyone's minds. You have failed to give evidence for your idiotic claims, and have attracted quite a few downvotes on other threads with your running away.
