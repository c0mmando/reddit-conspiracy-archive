       thread linked from TMOR. They claim that User DONKEY_SCHL0NG was Banned from this sub for posting this comment.

        You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Dude it's been like a week since you said you were going to grow up as a mod and stop all these political posts. But you just can't stop. You're the one turning people against each other. You're talking about "us" as if we all agree with you. And you're posting yet another "nothing to see here" post about Trump and Russia. Jesus Christ dude. If you want to be an active Trump cheerleader on here then you really shouldn't be a mod. Edit: and I'm sure I'm about to be banned because we can't diss the holy mods. So catch you guys later.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I saw this comment be created and as I was replying to it reddit gave me an error and I refreshed and it was gone. Since the comment was there for less than a minute obviously I thought it was deleted and didn't think anything of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then seconds after the comment is deleted user TheTwilightStone comments that a user's comment was wiped for criticizing the mods and completely lying saying it was "the top comment" which is impossible as it was only up for less than a minute unless they had multiple users upvoting it... It's almost as if he was waiting for the comment to be deleted so he could come in with the fake outrage to create the obvious brigade posted above...
      </p>
      <p>
       I responded saying that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Or maybe the user deleted it I never saw it to begin with...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And obviously this completely rational comment was immediately downvoted to shit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Or maybe the user deleted it I never saw it to begin with...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Knowing he was obviously not from this sub I play dumb and say I didn't see it giving someone else to give the opportunity to confirm that they saw it and to see what he will say to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       He responds with the following
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Clearly you haven't because this comment had 7 points before you got here.
       </p>
       <p>
        You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Dude it's been like a week since you said you were going to grow up as a mod and stop all these political posts. But you just can't stop.

       <p>
        Dude named Donkey Shlong. Now his comment is completely wiped.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       fishy for so many reasons. Let's start of withe the comment itself. Who the hell comments in a forum, " I'm sure I'm about to be banned because we can't diss the holy mods. So catch you guys later." Are you kidding me with that nonsense? The fact that it was deleted
       <em>
        as I was responding to it a minute after it was posted
       </em>
       just proves that he is trying to bait people into believing bullshit about the mods and this sub based off of a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now lets get into the response response. The user claims that the comment had exactly "7" upvotes. However at the time
       <em>
        ALL OF THE UPVOTES WE'RE HIDDEN FOR ALL COMMENTS
       </em>
       and to top it off he has
       <em>
        an exact copy of the comment
       </em>
       meaning that this user either was an alt of DONKEY_SCHL0NG or there was an active brigade to create this lie and TheTwilightStone was in contact with DONKEY_SCHL0NG...
      </p>
      <p>
       TheTwilightStone then attempts to deflect and then his official response to him knowing the upvote count was that, he "mistaked it for another thread"... Yea okay because a comment directed axolotl_peyotl would be posted on any other thread... He then says that after he saw the comment
       <em>
        which as I stated before was only up for a single minute
       </em>
       he copied it for later yea okay...
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see TMOR obviously lied to try and create a brigade and are actively trying to discredit the mods and the users. Notice how NONE of the users even attempt to have discussion about the actual topic and any post even trying to talk about the topic is down-voted.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we accept that there is a sub willing to slander and make up shit to try and discredit and brigade us? How is this allowed? This is unacceptable and I vote that all threads to go contest mode until this b.s. stops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the conspiracy? There is a group of people conspiring trying to silence those questioning official narratives by coming in and lying.

       There is. And you can look at the deleted comments on ceddit. I recommend people go though the mod log, and take a look at the reason for the ban, and the comments that led to it. It is quite an eye opener and might lead to some insight.

       Exactly this. I made a self post asking for input from the mods and the community on the lack of a transparent method of calling for a mod to step down that would protect users against retaliation from mods, it was immediately deleted with no rule cited and they never responded to my message asking why it was taken down. Guess we know the answer to your question.

       I think the admin should ban TMoR for multiple violations of the rules. They stalk, harass, belittle and brigade. But I also think it is a “paid to exist” sub with either Reddit’s blessings or of their own doing.

       Even Dusty came back to contribute his own gaslighting to the LARP, the fact he even still exists is confirmation that admins condone that sub and their actions.

       I'll tell ya right now that those comments were removed by moderators. I'll also say that they're disingenuous posters attempting to sway the minds of regular conspiracy users.
      </p>
      <p>
       A large percentage of user accounts who are coming in here and complaining are users with no history, just started posting here today, or old alts coming out of the woodwork.
      </p>
      <p>
       This behavior has been going on for weeks and it's coming to a crescendo over the last few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question you need to ask is why is this happening? Why is the TOP mod (only) being targeted with all this hate and harassment?
      </p>
      <p>
       All the bans and comment removals NEVER HAPPENED until he was targeted. They're trying to silence him and his account. Someone wants him out and all the brainless heathens are working hard to make it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dude is one of the most ethical and fair moderators this sub has. He does not let his "political bias" affect his judgement. All the haters are just kicking up dirt and using harassment to attempt to make him act irrationally or at least appear irrational.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd challenge any of you out there to deal with this bullshit. You probably wouldn't last a week before jumping out a window to make it all go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's enduring though because he loves this sub and he loves you guys.

       Not any of the things you listed, been here for years on a different account (got doxxed) and now this one. No one's responded to my modmail asking why my post requesting input from the community and mods about a well-defined system for calling for a mod's removal doesnt exist was immediately deleted. Care to weigh in while you're here?

       Your post wasn't conspiracy related. That's why it was probably removed. There's subreddits available for that type of question, for instance-
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReportTheBadModerator/">

       So meta posts aren't allowed on conspiracy then? Plus if im being a bit snarky, the fact that we can't discuss our moderators on this sub feels a bit like a conspiracy.

       When there's an active brigade happening targeting a specific moderator I'd suggest not posting something that can be interpreted as concern trolling. If you have legitimate concerns take it up with the admins.

       I don't want to speak with the admins though, I want to speak with the community that I'm a part of and that is also affected by the current goings on. That's the part I'm struggling to understand, why are we as a community not allowed to have this discussion, why do we need to go "above" you guys instead of having a real conversation about it.

       I see accusations of brigades constantly on this sub. It seems to be the norm. And it would be a great thing to bring up in said discussion, maybe with a bit of background on what's going on with some evidence of it I and many others would be more inclined to give him a pass, but without ever having the discussion we can't really know that can we? I just think it's weird that the mods are fighting so hard against open discussion about the other people in power on this board.

       Yes, i know, it's their typical douche baggery, but he's practically calling for them at this point, the adage is as old as the internet, you don't feel the trolls, and stickying his own post whining about them is just going to give them more motivation to come over and mess with him

       You removed my comment for Rule 5 - no stalking or trolling.  I was doing neither, and when I messaged the mods for explanation, I received none.  I wasn't trying to sway any minds and am a regular user here.

       What's your explanation for that?
