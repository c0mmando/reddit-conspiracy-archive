       Banking as a whole is parasitic. Many financial institutions make up rules that are impossible to follow to charge fees to customers left and right. When they fail to generate enough profit from these shady practices they resort to explicitly criminal activities. David graeber makes a great point about how crucial banks are to our society when comparing the strike from bank of America workers to the time when the NY garbage workers went on strike. It took no time at all for the city of NY to fall into chaos as trash piled up everywhere and people noticed a large impact on quality of life. When bankers go on strike no body notices.
      </p>

       We could have a system that lends to those who need it for essentially nothing which would be much more efficient, instead we have a system where we have to pay money to access our own money via ATM.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Peter Joseph hits the nail on the head when talking about how unnatural these institutions are to the state of nature. There is no reason to have such a thing except for robinhood in reverse.

       Automation is slowly going to destroy bankers and traders with the rise of high frequency trading done online and setting up customer service bots that look like your talking to someone online and regular customers won't have a clue since they just want to dump there money and move along with there day.

       Yeah on the low end the oligarchs and other rich folks will still have their face to face private bankers though sadly.

       Im honestly surprised that lending officers still exist. Just scan the barcode on your I'd. Enter the information. Press send. Compare credit score to bank guidelines. Where it is discretion for the rate or approval or whatever institute a random number generator. 30% chance.

       Check out the BANKING CANCER - All American Politicians are infected - The FED vampire alone suck some $200-$300 billion per annum from folks. And they collapse the economy every other 10 years to completely drain everyone dry, American will die pathetically unless the FED is first nationalized, and Israel is cut off. Else, just wait for the doomsday - Thanks to the Fake Jews.

       You are right, it was my intention to present thing in a racist manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, I just don't know how to describe, or can find the right materials that do not use the word "Jew" on the banking cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem lies with the banking mafia who abuse the Jewish banner to carry out crimes. This I can understandable if they are small little community during the medieval time, but for them to continue to commit crimes using the "Jew" name these day is just unforgivable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other fact is ordinary Jews have been brainwashed to believe Jewish racist bigotry is commanded by God. Obviously, most of us do understand no all the Jews are like that. And to prove I am not Anti-Jew (I do not accept the term "Anti-Semitic" - this one is an abuse cos' it doesn't exist), here is one cool Jew I consider as a classy human being: -

       Who are you to say they are not Jews?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not trying to belittle you. But on what basis you can say these two "Literal Gods" aren't Jews, especially when they say they're Jews?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Edom is located in today's Palestine (or at least within the "Greater Israel"). What is stopping them from becoming "Jews"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it because these guys are basically pure Khazars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun Fact: I got an email from one "Robert Einstein" saying they are from Sodom. They are Sodomites.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottomline: Both are Fake Jews?

       Sadly this is all so interesting to me but I want to see the end to see proof and validate something that people believe and also it would be an honor to see the end as if the same as seeing the start of mankind.. Don't get me wrong I prefer we prevail but this everyday bulsht with nothing dramatically changing in the world is boring as shite from a first world standpoint watching people become more controlled and only care about themselves and not even want to hear the news cause its real and depressing, people make me sick and maybe we deserve this fate.. Although none of the sick bastards in charge deserve to live I would prefer we all die than the most selfish live on and decide mankind's fate.

       Basically, it is the prototype currency that has been proposed for the New World Order global monetary system. It ties in with the ecological problems we face in the future, such as air pollution, water pollution, etc. Each country (and individual) gets a certain amount of CC, which allows them to produce a certain amount of pollution each year . If they pass that limit, they get a hefty fine. If someone has left over CC, they can sell it for real world currency. This will make it very expensive to pollute, and its suppose to help us reduce pollution over time. Individual currencies will still exist (dollar, euro, etc) but CC will be the currency that connects us all. Carbon tax will also be a thing, but I'll let you look into that.

       Ah I see. That's interesting, thanks for the info! I'd heard theories that some crypto currency could be the currency of the NWO but hadn't thought of carbon credits before. And I have heard of carbon tax before, but I will continue to look into that further so I can get a better idea. Cheers.

       I agree with the problem, but not the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we have a system that lends to those who needs it for nothing? There would be no incentive for people to lend, and plenty of incentive for people to exploit. There would be nobody facilitating the transaction since they are not getting paid. How do we get past that without incentives?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem here is not interest rates, its how most businesses are a mutated form of pyramid schemes, especially the finance industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the lowest level, you have your relationship managers, insurance agents etc. Pushing bad products and loans to people who don't have the ability to pay. But the system is in such a way that these agents get incentivized doing so.

       There are a couple solutions; either one central bank that lends, or localized institutions or directly borrowing from the people. These would be public goods and the intensive being that it provides a much needed service. Not every intensive has to be profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think exploiting the system would be much more prevalent that what we currently see. You would still have to prove in some way your ability to repay or have someone co-sign a loan.

       You take the private profit out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Credit unions are one way to do this. They still charge interest on loans and pay interest on deposits, but the difference is that there are no private shareholders reaping the profits. Any surplus revenue the credit union makes is either returned to members as dividends, used to lower interest rates on loans, or used to increase interest rates on deposits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Credit unions also have the advantage of keeping your money closer to your community. If you put $10K in as a deposit, that will be loaned out to homebuyers or small businesses in your community.

       So why do so many people deposit their money in big banks? What do big banks do nowadays that a credit union can't? I can understand large corporations going with Bank of America, but not small businesses, homeowners, or Connie Paycheck. Is this a prestige thing? Are people just uninformed?

       I think the trick here is to realize that the power that bankers and big business owners have over our lives is partly shrouded by the frontispiece known as regulations, worker protections, collective bargaining rights, etc. Yes, those things often are beneficial to regular people. I would not deny that. And we are led to believe that those rights, etc. were won by the hard work of union organization, social movements, political protest, etc. etc. It's sort of viewed as evidence that democracy works and the people really do have power. But it's a huge deceit and part of the con. Democracy is a smokescreen. The only reason those things were and are allowed is because bankers and big business owners view them to be in their own interests as well. They can promote their own interests by announcing them to be in the interests of all. However, it does not then follow that all those regulations, etc. should be thrown out the window.

       Yeah I don't think regulation is required to keep children from working, that's called society. A society dependant on regulations will experience crisis such as 9/11 until its collapse.

       Allow me, a small part of my history as well a part of this group, to post in this forum, a place of which is owned to by said respective "group"-if it can be called such- some information that suggests the grandest of conspiracies at play.  A conspiracy that is denounced....but with unfounded logic.  I bequeath unto you this information, and request that God on high, if he exists (which I now 100% believe that he does), bless all of you who seek to know truth, and who seek that which flourishes in the light.

       As it stands, the banks own our economy. People talk about the lack of bipartisanship in our government but it is clear through the way our politicians serve, that they serve the same people with the same policies. They are sold to the banks and major organizations for the purpose of feeding money into the system that "feeds the beast" i.e. the Cabal to provide them with all the power and resources they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system is built to serve the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example in the media, as we know, there are only a handful of people who own most of the media. These conglomerates work with each other to ensure that the major media stays in their control through major mergers. Those major mergers are all brokered by the same investment bank, Allen &amp; Co. who ensures that the merger weaves out of the way of anti trust laws as well as ensuring that everyone makes a profit, especially Allen &amp; Co. who take a chunk of the merger money as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is shady enough, but where it truly gets interesting (and gets more to the point of this discussion) is in the people Allen &amp; Co employs, as well as the assets they have aquired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently Allen &amp; Co employs former senators Bob Kerrey and Bill Bradley and most notably their Managing Director is former CIA director George Tenet, manufacturer of the 'War on Terror'
      </p>
      <p>
       They maintain a place on Coca Cola's board, the own major portions of Alphabet and Twitter. It has owned Columbia Pictures. They have irons in nearly every single fire in the market. They employ everyone from former government employees to former sports stars. They essentially pull the strings in the media and yet they are only a bank, and not even a well known bank but a very secretive bank. They are terrifying and they likely have ties to every media coorporation in the world, and financial ties to hotel, beverage, social media, telecom, film, and telivision markets just to name a few. They are a household name among the elites and they lead the way in the total coorporate consolidation of the global market, which is one of the greatest proofs of a Globalist Cabal.

       Definitely worth bring up the recent confessions of banker for the elite Ronald Bernard who states that top tier members of the global elite were conducting transactions to terror groups, and involved in sex parties where children were a part. The European level of banking he is referring to is likely conducted via the BIS.

       There are two bloggers / youtubers who have been doing big multipost projects on this topic which are nearly sync'd and seem to have some similar method. In particular they have done long reviews on two of the same books:
       <em>
        Tragedy and Hope
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        A Game of Nations

       It is a lot of material and I have not seen/read it all but I like this approach. Tragedy and Hope is a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       long book but I agree it is the best place to start. Quigley was an insider and a believer and he believed the New World Order is a really swell idea. He might be the single most credible source on the topic.

       I feel like the idea of American "sovereignty" is sort of tangential to this whole topic.  The same people who cry about "sovereignty" are usually first in line to sell out to foreign banks.

       no bloated military -&gt; no stupid foreign wars -&gt; no national debt -&gt; real sovereignty

       I feel like you're making two independent points here.. 
Excuse me if I may..
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Modern citizens lack sufficient civil interest to understand how their votes, taxes and general complacency only fuels the fire that burns freedom. Yes. And people on the whole lack the conscious powers to understand true and logic fallacies - let alone their own potential  - I'm applying broad dollops of artistic Liberty to your point here but with this framing then yes I agree   .. However ...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         American sovereignty is somehow tangential to the story of banksters and their oligarchic rise to one world domination. On this point I disagree - America is the story. Maybe less as we look forward. But the Rise of bankings global class is etched into American history. Not just the rise of modern financial Titans but also the primary cultural battleground for civil takeover. You see America dared to dream. In America that underlying dream was freedom. To be a Republic free from church or state totalitarianism yes but especially to be free from the banking malaise. America grew from independent currency - Colonial Scrip and despite some funding of unrest, much foundational infrastructure was borne from independent banking, so much it caused the Civil War,  motivated generations of iconic American leaders and bonded generations of pioneers. Example is the Bank War -
         <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_War">
          https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_War
         </a>
         - a popular enough rally point, to fight off a second concerted effort of putting a Central Bank into Americas heart. Enough by the way to keep that particular beast at bay for another 80 years until the creature came back from Jekyll Island. The wider point being that American people have always fought banks. It's deeply ironic now of course that America is a weapon wielded by Wall St. Ironic yes. But tangential - absolutely not. Fuck the War on Terror. Control of Money is America's biggest battle. Always has been. And unfortunately most Americans find it hard to swallow the fact they've been on the losing side of this one for over a century now.

       I've spent years since being the man with the boots kicking doors down trying to pursue the truth of the global big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am increasingly convinced, by following the evidence, that the primary instigator against the US has been the British elite. (Not ignoring the Vatican/Jesuit, other issues though) I'm going to skip the citations which often bog down and just give the summary.
      </p>
      <p>
       [comment too long so this section will be in a reply below]
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, the monarchy, oligarchy, aristocracy, and supranational bankers never forgave the US for the revolution, and recognize that as the only country founded on the principles of indivdualism and natural rights, it is the primary threat to their desire for a centralized new world order of globalism (that will be painted as a benign savior, but they will control it from the shadows). Therefore, the United States is the primary target of the NWO now that we have successfully toppled almost every opposition country in the world. These people think and work on much longer time-frames, so delays may happen (for example, Wesley Clark's 7 nation list was supposed to happen in 5 years, but it took ~17), but rest assured, once we are over extended enough, weak enough, probably through the last few wars that "need" to happen, the real attack on the US will begin. Syria is only a precursor for Iran war. Korea is the precursor for China war. Muslim extremists in southeast asia are likely to be the warmup for both of those. Instead of being a relative cakewalk though, as Afghanistan and Iraq were, this time the design will be similar to the Brisbane line "bleed-out" strategy. Vietnam level KIA/WIA, in order to get rid of our hardest combat men, most likely while escalating the miltarism of the police and other domestic agencies in preperation.

1909 - Normad Dodd indications that Cecil Rhodesian group planned to infiltrate our education system and state department in preperation for getting us into war, which King Edward the 7th setup by creating the triple entente. This is the primary place the Rothschild Zionist banking group comes in, because Edward the 7th gave gave zionist bankers access to the court (court jews) in exchange for profits.
1910 - Edward 7 dies unexpectedly, throwing small wrench in plans. Rhodesian/Rothschild group carries on. British backed Japanese annex Korea as part of coming propup of Russia/Korean enemy.
1913 - Woodrow Wilson elected on the promise of not taking us to war. His handler, Edward House, and his handler, Sir Earl Grey (yes the tea), manipulated him into the war.
1914 - WW1 starts as planned
1916/17 - America dragged into the war, while bankers funded Nazis and Bolshevik revolution (and killed the Tsar and his family in revenge for his father Alexander III thwarting the 1860 plan) British use likely false-flag Zimmermann Telegram to bring US into WW1 on the heels of the Border war.
1939-45 - WW2 as continuation of WW1. British sought to make American losses great in the Pacific so at the end of the war there would be a balance of powers. (Brisbane line pushed by Churchil along with the island hopping strategy, which McArthur saw through and ignored, instead creating the leapfrog strategy, leading to the defeat of the Japanese at Guadalcanal.) Don't forget war plan red in which the US knew Britain might become an enemy.
1949 - British globalists used Kissinger et al to support Mao as the new communist enemy against the nationalist Chiang Kai-shek. British backed New york bankers and Harriman group funded Stalin as part of the coming cold war, intending for Stalin to push the north of China. One telling fact is that the British were one of the first nations to recognize Mao's government and started sending him supplies.
1950 - The British, looking to cut the US down since the Pacific play didn't work as well as intended, got the Korean war kicked off. The Harriman group pushed Truman into Korea, and they tried to setup McArthur by giving him inferior forces and supplies (likely in revenge for his thwarting of the pacific bleed-out strategy), but McArthur's strategic brilliance ended up winning despite him being setup to fail. Since instead of weakening the US, the "win" (hard to call it that with so many casualties), in Korea actually strengthened the US, the British started playing double and triple spy games in London to further foment the cold war. Using groups like the Cambridge 6 (everyone knows of the Cambridge 5, the 6th man was Victor Rothschild, and many more than just that), to leak information to the soviets as part of the strategy. (they were triples because, on the surface they were British agents, next layer they worked for KGB, but underneath both of those were working for the Monarchy and oligarchs, creating plausible deniability for the British.)
1951 - Through the leaks of this group to Mao, Mao knew when to commit massive forces to Korea in the third phase offensive.
1958 - Lebanon Crisis the first inklings of the coming cold war, anti-communist justification for interventionism.
1961 - Second inkling of cold war via Bay of pigs as inevitable type of offshoot of organic Cuban alliance with Soviets (no first hand British involvement as far as I can tell)
1963-75 - British setup of Vietnam (Laos/Cambodia) conflict (which they tested on the French) culminated with the assassination of president Diem, with the help of the CIA/MI6, with Henry Cabot Lodge participating. Despite this, Kennedy resisted the entanglement, but was conveniently assassinated himself exactly 20 days after Diem, which gave the pre-controlled LBJ the presidency so the globalists could push for escalation. The British officer Sir Robert Grainger Ker Thompson was one of the main strategists advocating for escalation, even before JFK was shot, and was supposedly the worlds first expert on counter-insurgency operations (COIN) due to his success in Malaya. Robert McNamara, SecDef, later wrote a book which verified that after JFK, Thompson was the single most influential person pushing LBJ into Vietnam. He advocated for an occupation style strategy (one of the first references to a "hearts and minds" strategy I've found) with many US boots on the ground in the south. The South Vietnamese defense minister recognized the real threat as the NVA and their infiltration along the Ho Chi Minh, and recommended a fortified line from the DMZ into the edge of Laos to block the Ho Chi Minh, giving the south Vietnamese army the breathing room they needed to take civic action in their own country (as opposed to foreign occupation), and if the NVA massed to attack the line, US amphibious landings could quickly counter and destroy them. Thompson condemned this plan, likely as part of the British plan to further entangle and weaken the US in pursuance of "the balance of power", because in the end, the south lost due to exactly that, a cross border invasion of the NVA. The Viet Cong was in essence, a diversion. Did I mention Thompson was a close friend of Kissinger?
1982-89 - Libya bombing, Grenada, Panama, Lebanon - all extensions of the cold war or wars to protect Israels (Rothschild Zionists) interests.
1990 - First gulf war as natural extension of setup by British of the Baathists and also the Sauds in the early 1900's, with Kuwait as the oil rich middle chess peice.
1992-94 - First main testing of British globalist NATO in military operations in the Yugoslav wars.
2001+ - British Rothschild Zionists use their plausible deniability teams (MI6, Mossad, and CIA, Pakistani ISI, Saudi GID) to attack the WTC and instigate the war in Afghanistan and later Iraq and eventually the entire, never-ending global war on terrorism. The British learned how to play the superior military power of the US and is/was repeating the playbook of getting us into a quagmire (like we and they did to the Soviets in Afghanistan), so as to weaken our military (backfired slightly in the sense that we got much better at 21st century combat), but primarily to overextend our financial and political resources globally and to lose much of our international support. All of this most likely in preperation for an internal coup of the US through subversion, infiltration, and blackmail or coercion of top positions through all three branches of government including the fourth estate of journalism and media as they merger and aquisition their way to monoplies and further centralization in preperation for the ushering in of the NWO, most likely to start through a currency collapse of the dollar and likely to be replaced with a global or North American Union/Euro type digital currency (such as bitcoin) designed to seem like a savior while it's real intention is to allow both the tracking of all transactions and persons (cash is anonymous, BTC is not!), and it is most likely they have somehow taken control of %50+ (enough to manipulate BTC) or have a backdoor already in place.

       Now, I have lightly touched upon the past, in the modern context the power of the banks primarily lies in control of the education system, the political system, and the media narrative. In order to know the enemy, I compiled a list of geopolitical outlets, since I've mostly been focusing on understanding the views of the Kissinger, Brzezinski schools,(Straussians) which dominate the positions of at least US geopolitics (eg State Dep).

       It's out in the open that a relatively small group(s) of very wealthy people in positions of power aim to dominate the world. Is it still a conspiracy if the masses are too dumb down and apathetic to understand this fact?

        "The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks, which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank...sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world."

Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared "ammunition" in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support. The UN is but a long--range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One--World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. The depression was the calculated 'shearing' of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank." - Curtis Dall

       This is my take on the entire dilemna.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many cases throughout history, we can see Tyranny taking the moral high ground and presenting itself as benevolence or justice. In ancient civilizations this wasn't always the case, as conquerors would simply assault territories and take power by force, yet as society's conscious level rose and people became less tolerant of Tyrants, taking power had to be done through propoganda and pychological warfare for it to be acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the case with World Government, which is using the military and wealth of the sovereign United States of America to progress an ancient occultic destiny of recreating the global society of Atlantis. Atlantis was apparently an ancient technologically advanced global civilization that some theorize was destroyed by the great flood or gods wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occultic secret societies that have existed throughout human civilization have used hidden knowledge/wisdom of humanities origins, the secrets of the universe, the history of this planet, and possibly ancient technology to set the foundations for an ultimate destiny of one world governance on this planet, or a new order of the ages. Subversively through influence and lineages they've created systems within systems of global monetary, political, and government beauracracies that at face value operate for the benefit of the masses however when analyzed scientifically are clearly benefitting a very small percentage of the human population and centralize power wealth and control to a ruling class. This ruling class is then itself compartmentalized, very much in the same manner that occult secret societies are compartmentalized, and only the worthy are initiated into smaller and smaller circles of power until a very small handful of people have access to the ancient wisdom that empowers them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since everything is compartmentalized in this manner, many of its procedures are thus effected by this lack of full knowledge as to what is occuring, therefore legitimately many actions and events that take place seemingly seem isolated from the entire structure and this is why many people dont believe there is a conspiracy because then everyone would have to be in on it. But everyone is not in on it, everyone is just playing a part in a larger structure which they themselves have not been initiated into and therefore are unaware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       No sitting government leader, central bank owner, or media mogul is part of the initiated few who have access to the ancient mystery teachings which have been passed on through generations, nor do they probably think these things even exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, its clear to see that the world itself is considerably more centralized and that the united states of america has been utilized since its inception as a tool for progressing globalism at the expense of its citizens. Most of america's major cities are melting pots, full of immigrants, lacking jobs, poverty, crime, dirty, failing infrastructures, etc. This doesnt make much sense, as one would be lead to believe that the success and wealth of america would lead this nation to be rich, and offer its citizenship the very best this world has to offer. Instead, americas government and military is utilized to destablize other portions of the world, creating refugees that force the merging of different cultures together, eroding sovereignty and the classical nation states in favor of unions. This is all very much in line with the agenda to create a utopian one world society that is occultic and adopts a new global culture and religion out of the ashes of the old chaotic nation state, sovereign state world.
      </p>
      <p>
       To achieve this, benevolence and moral high ground psychological attacks are used against populations. If you are against the merging of cultures you are racist, if you are for sovereignty you are a nationalist (nazi), etc. Everything that is attached to the ideaology of the old world must be destroyed and condemned for the new world to be born, which is why many of todays norms are under attack through outrage culture and what we call social justice today.
      </p>
      <p>
       From clinton to bush to obama, many will claim these actors of history were part of the larger conspiracy, but i disagree. In my opinion they all played a role in a larger story at play that they themselves are probably not completely aware of. Insiders of organizations like the cia and fbi are probably closer to the know and play larger roles in the advancement of the plot. Trump himself seems to be an actor that has thrown a wrench into plans, however this could itself be manipulated and positioned to the benefit of the whole in the long run as the progenitors of these plots play the end game and use all events of history in an occult manner to progress their esoteric beliefs and goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may sound far fetched to some readers here, but this is the conspiracy subreddit and im interested to see responses.

       This is a big topic and I'm sure at some point we're going to be hearing from people with some info about:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        US is still a British colony
       </li>
       <li>
        US is a corporation/sui juris/birth certs/sovereignty

       But I want to go to a completely different place here that I hope you will be as fascinated with as I am, and for that we are going inside the weird and wild mind of Dan Winter to get a taste of a truly different perspective about what is going on here.

       I always wonder why, can banks be above everything. Why big banks. Why can everything else fail exceot for big banks. Why did they, an business, get bailed out for screwing the American People over, and get more moneu because they would "fail".

       The excuse for the bailout was that if the banks were to go under it would crash the economy too far. Obviously the real reason is greed. According to economists like Peter Schiff, if the banks hadn't gotten bailed out, it would have depressed the economy even farther for sure and taken much longernger to recover but we would have been a stronger country in the long run and not nearly as worried about another crash. The transfer of tax dollars from the people who lost the most into a bank bail out foro the people who caused the crash and ripped everybody off...twice then...is one of the most egregious examples of a huge, greedy, corrupt, sociopathic group of people and institutions fucking the little guy outta his money and then flipping him the bird...ever.

       Here is how they are weakening American society from the inside out in order to render the U.S. unavailable to fight them once they no longer have use for it to achieve hegemony over the human race (which at that point the U.S.'s military and economic prowess will become a liability to their plans of dominance)

      <ol>
       <li>
        In a public company, the shareholders own the company. Shareholders care about one thing above all else, getting a return on their investment. This includes the average joe with a 401k or who invests savings in the stock market.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       When the owners of the company want a return on their investment, it means they employ their employees 'CEO' and other managers to pursue profit above all else. Profit is what makes a company's stock price go up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is important because it shows that 'pursuit of profit' is actually structurally built in to the system in this regard. Therefore it is incorrect to assume that those who are pursuing profits are all greedy and evil. This current structure needs to be changed, but this is outside of the discussion for the time being.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Federal Reserve has been printing money in a way that is unconstitutional. This needs to stop. It's the world's currency.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Oligarchs, politicians, lobbyists, and investors hide their agenda by using complicated webs of proxy and shell companies that can make it nearly impossible to link back to the original person or group. This is how money is often transferred and accountability is shifted avoided.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Govt. budgets are not what they seem. Often times money or resources from departments you would least expect are actually used to add money to black projects. This is in addition to the $40-$80 billion annually that goes to black projects. Other ways of raising money for black projects are stealing drugs from terrorists and selling them on US streets (CIA) and getting the federal reserve to print more money illegally.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         One World Government has one aim and that is to transform earth into a slave planet ruled by a handful of elites. There is no other way to see it. That is what it is. It would seem that movements with seemingly positive intentions like 'global warming' and 'globalization' have either been hijacked by NWO and are being used to push their evil agenda, or they were lies from the onset.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The shadow government controls the deep state and the deep state controls the media, entertainment industry, and many in government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The deep state enforces its secrecy with blackmail. This means that the morally corrupted and easy to control are selected for positions of power. They use satanic cults, pedophilia, abuse, murder and other illegal  acts performed as rituals for several important reasons, one of which being creating blackmail opportunities. Brainwashed manchurian candidates (mk ultra) are used in positions of power as well. They are the evil guys who say one message, but in reality do the exact opposite.

       its so easy, the point is that banks are set up for the soul reason to extract wealth via usury. this is why usury was unlawful illegal and immoral.

       but when you have bankers who make the laws you are fucked.  all that is really needed is the masses to get good enough at maths to realize they are being robbed blind.   but thats hardly going to happen at this rate.

       There's so much room inside of capitalism for public/socialist/local type ventures where profit isn't the primary motive. No laws even have to change. Current examples are your local grocery co-op, credit unions, some big Canadian insurance company, and some others. We really do vote with our wallets.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the key. Many people today don't understand the concept of usury so they participate willingly. A little research shows that an economy based on debt is a relatively recent phenomenon (1950s/60s). It doesn't have to be this way. We knew this a couple/few generations ago. Fortunately it seems like people are waking up.

       Well 1% is just insane and unrealistic as a business can't cover their operating cost of servicing the loan with all the tracking and accounting that's regulatory required, but for instance I have a 30 mortgage at 3.25% which is pretty darn low.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the larger point is, yes Credit Unions are registered non-profits and offer extremely favorable pricing with little fees. They do most of what you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one says you need to bank with some giant corporation and I have no idea why people do, it's the worst experience and more costly than a community bank or credit union.

       i looked into credit unions and they are a sorry affair here in the uk.   same rates as the private banks   but you don't get online banking or atms.
      </p>
      <p>
       plus there is no transparency i seriously doubt they are not for profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       think about how much a private bank makes in profit each year... if that went back to the people...........      instead of globalist pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       uk has a GDP of 3 million million   per year.   90% of the working class are going to have to work 50 years minimum just to keep a home and family.
      </p>
      <p>
       they money is going into private pockets of people who do no work.

       Russia has reduced foreign debt by 75% making them the sixth-largest economy in the world by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), with a $4-trillion GDP.

       Currently, Op is upvoted to 700+ but the "best" and "top" comment is a dude with 250+ upvotes shitting on Op by saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You do know that when you deposit your money in the bank you're letting them use it right? It's the reason you get interest. When a bank loans money they loan you're money. There's absolutely no need for a "glitch" to use your money."
      </p>
      <p>
       Like no shit, when did they ever "need" to do any of the shady ass shit they do? Never. They didn't need to launder for drug cartels or sell out the American public before the 2008 crash or forge all those fake customer accounts a few years ago to drum up business but they did it anyway. Why all of a sudden are they above suspicion for creating this very suspicious "glitch" ?

       I hope someday to throw a Halloween party where everyone dresses up as out of work bankers:

       As far as banking goes
      </p>
      <p>
       The world has more debt than we have materials to satisfy those debts. As soon as the concept of interest was instituted, we began dealing in goddamn Monopoly money. It's all imaginary. It's a nicely developed system for keeping us spinning our wheels in a grind that takes us to an early grave.

       Of course it's not likely to happen, your bloated military and militarised police are propping up the failed US economy
      </p>
      <p>
       As for national debt, well, that's never going away, if you decide to not to pay it, well the US will tank overnight, piss off china or Saudi Arabia so they withdraw their wealth from the US and call in debts and the same will happen

       these roundtables are such a great resource. as a seasoned tinfoil hat rabbit hole spelunker myself, i'm familiar with a lot of this stuff but each roundtable i've discovered new sources, new theories, new puzzle pieces.

       i wish these would have been around a few years back when i was just starting out researching these topics. these are perfect for people who are still on the fence. kudos to the mod team and everyone who has contributed to the series thus far

       I know, it's a fair system. I just would have assumed that anyone coming to this subreddit would be quite aware of this subject. I prefer the more 'out there' discussions. I do love these Round Table discussions and I have thoroughly enjoyed most editions so thank you for organising them. Can't have it my own way every time!
