<p>Obstruction of justice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did not matter for Clinton.</p>

<p>Does not seem to matter in the regard to spoliation of evidence [the entire DNC].</p>

<p>Evidence of the spoliation of evidence [the entire DNC power structure]</p>

<p>Or, the fact, the FBI conspired via textual evidence to secure their own future jobs and going light on HRC, and &#39;letter her off easy&#39; with a felonious crime. </p>

<p>IT can be said, she ran to not get caught.</p>

<p>No one is saying it though. She lost and is still let off the hook. </p>

<p>When describing intent, you look at what they say in light of the history of events. It can be made that the FBI is complicit in harboring Clinton, whose intent was to run so she would not face adequate justice. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how a court would see &#39;intent&#39; regardless of what an actor might say was their intent. That&#39;s how they are talking about going after Trump. </p>

<p>So, when spelled out as a case:</p>

<p>The case seems to promote the entire governmental apparatus supporting DNC power-players and attacking the president even before he entered office - at the cost of calling crimes &#39;not crimes&#39;, and allowing the mass-destruction of evidence to just be a &#39;fact of life&#39;; where RICO could be invoked here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asked why?</p>

<p>why is a relationship between variables chosen and not chosen.</p>

<p>So, no - Clinton and their crimes, and the FBI complacent to allow those crimes time and time again, is a variable.</p>

<p>Can you not shill for Clinton in this clear attempt to shill against POTUS?</p>

<p>I mean, if you were serious about the question, me mentioning the largest factor in the recent contemporary political time, as the primary opponent against trump in and a primary player in the investigations there in - and you want me to not mention her?!?!?!</p>

<p>That makes no sense, shill.</p>

<p>Why dont I just not mention the DNC at all, in relation to the republican president who is directly involved in political conflict with the DNC.</p>

<p>you exposed yourself; via intent exposed through consequences of action, in immediately attacking me over Clinton, over asking a political question necessitating her (as she is doing this above the law, and you actually asking me how much I care about that law - and not Trump). </p>

<p>You missed the entire part where I show that there is no legitimacy in the FBI or law that stands, as it is selectively enforced based on political bias. </p>

<p>Your next move. </p>

<p>yet, this has nothing to do with the argument, does it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The two cases are directly tied together and are being investigated by the same people.</p>

<p>Mueller’s case is based in part on a document paid for by Clinton and the DNC. Yes, I know what you’re going to say, Republicans paid for some of it in the beginning. That was before Steele was brought on board and it was essentially dead until Clinton pumped another $12 million into it.</p>

<p>Mueller’s Investigation has already abandoned the Russia angle and now they are just looking to get anyone on anything as evidenced by the indictments handed down so far.</p>

<p>So what happens if Mueller closes his Investigation with no indictments for collusion? </p>

<p>Don’t you think that would make it obvious that there was no collusion and it was just a witch hunt all along?</p>

<p>What did they do? and why? what could be wrong with FBI?</p>

<p>Did FBI do their job to defense Justice? Who did they catch? Who are supposed to go to jail but end up didnt? tell me what FBI has done for all these years when people least trust their most corrupted congress? by the way, what did DOJ do all the years? we have to understand so many years in different angles first before you jump into the conclusion in anything. from 2001 to now, what investigation they have done and how did they go? many govt department are overdue for an audit. they are so corrupted. both dems and republicans are so so corrupted for all these years but DOJ and FBI failed to do anything.

    <div class="md"><p>You have understand something first before asking this question, this is most corrupted govt in the US history, and alot of govt department are not on the side of the sitting president - NSA, FBI, DOJ... even the scandles nowdays are unprecedented. Tell me what can he do to put the country on the right track? To answer your question, it depends what he does, and what the consequence, I&#39;m with law, with Rand Paul, I bet he will help Trump to do it right and lawfully. Rand Paul is so far the best politician in the DC, he just proposal to senate to do it in the regular order when they can do it with nuclear option. Whether you are left or right, you wouldnt have any reason to hate Rand Paul or Ron Paul, they both are the most honest people in the DC. by the way, for years, congress have done so many things that doesnt even make sense, tell me why they want to impeach a sitting president does what the voters want exactly? he didnt do all the things right, but he did try to fulfil his promises.</p>

<p>We all saw him admit to OOJ, but again, they think he&#39;s above the law, or they argue that since Trump failed he shouldn&#39;t be charged as if a crime has to be successful for someone to be charged. </p>

<p>No doubt some are going to completely ignore the question and talk about Hillary. </p>

Legal terms are changed to prevent further investigation or prosecution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do, this is what I don&#39;t like. Comparison and using it has a place, and precedent had much value. For someone to say oh, you can&#39;t use that it is not a valid argument is ridiculous. If it is not germane to the discussion then move the fuck on after calling it out. The left had a set of rules for one side, and they are with 24/7 attacks, many times from anonymous sources, against Trump. If you can&#39;t see that then t truly we have a large gap that Jay not allow civil discussion.</p>

<p>As well, loaded questions with the definitions that change (like what constitutes breaking the law or not, or what obstruction in this context actually implies).</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t care if a foreign person doesn&#39;t understand when they attack one side, but at the same time admit they don&#39;t understaneed and your not a Democrat? (You mean left? Or do you really sign up for the foundations here in the US?) So how does being a foreign Democrat to the us work, &#39;cause your implying something that I don&#39;t think you are...   Lately, I just sick of condescending foreign better-than-thou brow beating by people armchair politicking. Good day.</p>

And while I&#39;m sure a lot of folks think the contrary, Trump&#39;s not stupid. Even Rosenstein believed Comey should be fired for his handling of the Clinton email investigation. And if your Trump and you know your innocent of collusion with Russia, then any statement he made regarding that investigation and his firing of Comey makes reasonable sense. It is interesting how the goal posts keep moving on this though.</p>
