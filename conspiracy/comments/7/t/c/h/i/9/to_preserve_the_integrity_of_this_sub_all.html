       In what was one of the largest coordinated attacks against
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       yesterday, the hours long attack and brigade against this subreddit needs to be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you unaware,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7t139p/trump_ordered_mueller_fired_but_backed_off_when/">
        this thread
       </a>
       showed up yesterday around 1:20PM. What followed was astonishing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thread appeared and almost
       <em>
        immediately
       </em>
       gained attention. For those of you who are regulars and frequent users of this subreddit, you know it is not uncommon to see some political conspiracy posts lean one way or the other. By that I mean, some threads lean pro Trump while others lean pro Hillary. It's quite common here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thread I previously linked however, was one of the worst threads I had seen in a long time. Furthermore, this subreddit yesterday was a wall to wall battleground for the entire day. Almost immediately, anti-presidential comments flooded the thread with instantaneous upvotes garnering 10 to 20 upvotes within minutes. Soon, within 20 minutes, they had 50 to 60. Very suspicious and obviously a coordinated upvote attack. On the other hand, as you can see by clicking the thread, any comment which was pro trump, calling out that the thread was brigaded, mentioning it was inundated with shills and exposing what was obviously an attack on the subreddit, were immediately downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thread, which had 500 upvotes, enough to secure the top spot on the sub, had OVER
       <strong>
        800
       </strong>
       comments. No thread in the history of
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       had over 800 comments in mere hours with so little upvotes. Even posts submitted here,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7snddb/nsa_deletes_honesty_and_openness_from_core_values/">
        example 1
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7oj9xp/in_1967_the_cia_created_the_label_conspiracy/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">
        example 2
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7s9b44/this_mysterious_conspiracy_theory_about/">
        example 3
       </a>
       , that have over 2,500 votes don't often get that many comments. By searching through /top, you can see, generally the only posts with such a high amount of comments like that have 8,000 to 20,000 votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Top mod of
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7t139p/trump_ordered_mueller_fired_but_backed_off_when/dtarudd/">
        explains here
       </a>
       why the thread was put in contest mode. Myself and MANY others agreed with their decision but were immediately downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the thread was put into contest mode for what was probably the most obvious brigade and misinformation campaign on the sub,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7t556x/muted_for_asking/">
        this post popped up
       </a>
       and once again, immediately shot to the top of the sub. The thread, not surprisingly at all, was also brigaded and targeted. Any comment which was critical of the top mod, who might I add has been the subject of countless attacks by subreddits which will remain unnamed, were immediately upvoted to the top. Any comments responding to said comments in a way which was critical of
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       , were downvoted. Additionally, any comment which was showed someone was on the side of the moderator was downvoted into oblivion. See the thread sorted by
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7t556x/muted_for_asking/?sort=controversial">
        controversial here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       "Those" people, people who were apart of the brigadiers, attackers and spammers knew what they were doing and knew it was a coordinated attack. After clearly only being here to cause drama, problems, spread lies and misinformation, they were rightfully banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what? They then screamed "WE WERE BANNED WE WERE BANNED!!" playing the victim card as if they did nothing wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ENTIRE day yesterday was a coordinated effort to attack one of the main moderators in an attempt to have then removed as a mod. That being said, not only are they the longest serving active mod, but they are the most seasoned. I don't know much about the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was seen yesterday was an all day attack on this subreddit, its' organic and regular users and anyone defending the top moderator. It was disgusting. From this point onward, to preserve the integrity of this subreddit, all threads should be put into contest mode.

       SS: Yesterday was the most obvious attack on this subreddit, it's users and a moderator. The entire day was an attack and attempt to gain control and the narrative of this subreddit. All threads should be put into contest mode to prevent such brigading again in the future, protect the organic users of this subreddit and protect one of the only mods on the team who give a shit about their users.

       I'd like to stick with only putting threads subject to a brigade into contest mode; however, if it becomes clear that there is an organized attempt to manipulate this subreddit in a way that is not public or discernible by the mod team then yes, I would second your proposal.

       The reason I like the idea of all threads being put in contest mode is no one can complain, and say we did it for this or that reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorite option is still to use a keyword list that will put anything that might be political into contest mode. I know we will likely never do either, but that is my 2c.

       Are you serious?  Every single top thread in every post that's even a
       <em>
        little
       </em>
       political is brigaded, and it's been obvious since the election.  There's also the ~700 user SB botnet that came online a few months back (remember when the average population jumped 1000 in a day?).

       I think social media( including reddit now)  is a left wing, socialist, America hating tool.  These people are literally trying to destroy us and our way of life.  They control the media. They dump aluminum on us in the skies. They kill people all over the world in or name. They steal from us. They dismantle what it means to be a part of America. They are winning.

       This, but the trend is anti-West, not just anti-America. Europe is under threat too, and Europeans don't have a voice because we have no constitution that protects freedom of speech, not here in the UK anyway. As a European you can express genuine concerns about the future of Europe, but progressives won't address your concerns to put your mind at rest, they will just label you a racist, bigot, sexist, homophobic etc. Say anything about Merkel or refugees that don't want to assimilate into our culture and you're suddenly Hitler. If I go to another country I embrace their culture, I don't force my own on them. I would never make my host feel guilty for just being born or being a male.

       It makes no sense. I don't feel like we are attacking anyone. We are just concerned, but we still get downvoted to hell. It's weird that a conspiracy subreddit actually supports the globalists, unless we got downvoted by shills. I think all people should be able to protect their cultures. I'm not some hypocrite like Tommy Robinson that points fingers at Islam, but supports Israeli agression against Palestine.

       They can actually control the votes really easily. They just say the want 3/10/15 upvotes in the software and it will auto log in 10 accounts or whatever to go upvote said comment. Been here for a couple years and it was amazing to see the transformation happen. The reason I stayed in the sub in the first place was how organic all the discussions and posts were, but now it just seems like bots and shills.

       I just don't understand how you can attack an accounts age when you yourself just said you've been here longer than the account your using has been. What makes you think that guy hasn't either? Hypocritical.

       When you've got people who go through your post history for saying things on here that you don't like, it's smart to make a different account. I am active in a personal issue  subreddit on my main and I'd get called out about it on here which would totally derail any conversation bc it was an easy target. I'd posted pics of myself on that account too and would get unwanted dick pics, rape threats, creepy messages from people all the time.

       No, it isn't by any means. There's plenty of newer accounts here that seem to be genuine contributors here that don't spend their time discrediting and deflecting on nearly every thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you combine a history of interaction with someone with account age, then it's a little more reliable.

       You still don't get the point. I know next to nothing about TMOR. Anti-Trump comments and posts are always met with the shill and brigade nonsense because people refuse to believe that others don't like Trump.

       In my experience it's the Blue brigades that are the problem, every thread is full of shills trying to make Trump out as a monster.  Trump is an awful president, but he's certainly no worse than the 5 before him.

       Reagan introduced trickle-down economics, the policy which destroyed the American middle class. He also supported the CIA in a lot of illegal black ops, coups, and assassinations which ruined America's reputagion around the globe. Cocaine trafficking by the CIA began under Reagan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush was literally CIA, and aided the CIA in performing all sorts of illegal acts including drug trafficking, arms trafficking, training terrorists, assassinations, coups, and election interference. He continued Reagan's economic policies, and further undermined the middle class. Also, corporate involvement in American government really started to blossom under Bush. Also started a half dozen wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton continued the same policies economically, militarily, and socially. Also a serial sexual predator. Was governor of Arkansas and assisted the CIA in moving drugs through Mena airport. Racist who thought blacks were "super predators", and his economic and criminal policies targeting blacks caused much of the racial tension in America today. Also lets not forget "Don't ask, Don't tell". Involvement in illegal wars, coups and assasinations. Probably heavily involved in planning 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush 2, more of the same. Was really just a figurehead for a bunch of IC players (Rumsfeld, Cheney, Kissinger, Rove,etc.) Continued economic policies that further enriched the rich and weakened the middle class. Covered up 9/11, and was likely involved in planning it. Lied about WMDs to start invasion of Iraq, resulting in the destruction of Iraqi infrastructure and the deaths of 1M Iraqi civilians. Was completely unqualified for position, and based on public speaking was quite unintelligent. Patriot Act, and unprecedented erosion of civil liberties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama. The biggest liar in the history of American politics. Candidate Obama ran on a platform of change and reform. President Obama doubled down on the policies of the 4 presidents before him, and further eroded civil liberties and the middle class while enriching corporations. First president to be at war for the entirety of 2 terms. Started 5 wars and continued 2, as well as conducting illegal military operations against many other countries. Authorized thousands of illegal drone strikes, resulting in thousands of civilian deaths. Accelerated domestic surveillance. Allowed Citibank corporation to chose his cabinet, and the Obama government was corporatist to the core.

       In presidential actions, he's just as bad as Obama or Bush. But in terms of the distraction and division he provides for the elite and establishment to be able to run their agenda, he's pretty much unmatched. His reality TV acting chops are perfect for the role.

       I honestly thing that is the agenda of pushing politics to the forefront and the whole trend of politicizing everything. Since 9/11, we have seen a general increase in that trend... forcing it down peoples throats. The idea, I think, is to make it so one cannot escape being inundated with political information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is so emotionally charged and often built on twisted logical fallacies and such. I think the idea is to cause confusion and general cognitive dissonance. Not just in those who actively seek out political information, but even the regular Joe, who otherwise doesn't go out of his way to get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its here to stay. It's a new form of propaganda that is much harder to spot than the old timey obvious posters. It's there to "do your head in" - irregardless of what your actual political stance is or what your political beliefs are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get everyone stuck in a state of chaos and confusion. Keep creating more and more fragmented groups with increased infighting with one another, so they may not come to any common solutions or conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know for the most part the whole occupy movement fizzled out - but I think it was a wake up call for those in power - that groups
       <em>
        could potentially
       </em>
       self organize. I think the idea is to make sure it never happens again.

       This sub has been under attack for a couple years now. Whenever a subreddit has other subreddits dedicated to attacking it you know that there's something rotten in reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       other major subreddits that have other subreddits dedicated to attacking it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know of any off the top of my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support putting
       <strong>
        everything
       </strong>
       into contest mode, at least for a period of time until brigaders, spammers and manipulators simply lose interest and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that from now on, whenever there are mod selections and or voting being done to select moderators that the discussion and the voting be done at Voat and not on reddit. Most of the longer  time regular users have a Voat account. I do not think reddit voting is valid anymore. I would also not mind if a serious review of the current mod team be done. The only mod that I feel are untouchable and beyond reproach are
       <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">
        /u/axolotl_peyotl
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/u/mr_dong">
        /u/mr_dong
       </a>
       , not that I have anything against the rest of the moderators, but those are the 2 mods who I absolutely
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       have been here forever and who don't operate from an agenda other than to operate in the best interest of the subreddit. (Even though mr_dong is semi-retired)

       Problem. Reaction. Solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contest mode hides the true top comments. A thread being manipulated by not showing its true top comments by using contest mode is a form of censorship. This should be used sparingly for brigaded posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting everything in contest mode muddies the waters,  and when a thread is indeed changed to contest mode, there should be a tag or a post explaining why. We need transparency. Contest mode on every thread does not achieve this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I go back to my first line of this post, maybe I'm a little paranoid but contest mode seems like something a brigading effort would hope to achieve by lowering the rank of posts that are deemed damming. Is this all a set up? Coordinate a massive brigade, then suggest contest mode for all? I don't know. Something is fishy though.

       Contest mode reorders top level comments and make vote brigading ineffective.  Nothing is censored. Contest mode does not "lower the rank of posts that are deemed damming."  The brigaders do that themselves by mass downvoting everything that does not conform to their narrative.  Go on any political thread and you will see that non-conforming post are downvoted below the threshold.

       I appreciate the mods trying to find a way to deal with the shilling from both sides going on around here these days. Restores my faith a little bit in this subs purpose. If contest mode is deemed to be the solution then I support that. It's really not that difficult to scroll down to read everyone's comments.

       Besides yungkyoon spam and anti-trumpers posting the same "bombshell" breaking story 5 times (though they are clearly prompted that the article has already been submitted), I don't think it was ever a real problem. I really never understood where people are coming from when they are complaining about all this spam. I've never found it to be too much to parse through. On top of that I find all material has some piece of information that can be gleaned from it. I suggest they let us act freely. This isn't a private club. The preponderance of Reddit doesn't have this rule.

       I'm in favor even though I think Contest Mode is unpleasant to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now there's a certain type of thread that is likely to be put in CM. The people who like those threads disapprove of them being put in CM and those who dislike those threads approve (generalizing here). I don't think anyone can form an objective opinion about the matter until CM is applied across the board. Currently it just feels like a punishment that is administered at moderator discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see people in this thread saying it should only be for brigaded threads, but that's just going to cause drama when people disagree about whether a thread is brigaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently I don't really trust anyone's opinions on Contest Mode. In particular, the people celebrating its use seem like they would be just as happy to see the threads in question nuked. I imagine they would develop a more nuanced view if it were applied across the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I would bet that the mods will not take this approach. CM has the potential to kill off the sub. My opinion is that CM posts suck to read and discourage back-and-forth conversation in favor of spamming top level comments. Bots like the ones we see copy pasting comments from other subs would be more effective and popular. High effort and well written comments would be buried amongst a bunch of crap. And I think many people would be annoyed at their voting influence being taken away once it isn't only applied to threads that have already gone the other way.

       What if it was just threads that hit the front page that have more than a certain amount of comments?

       I don't know what the solution is, but something has to be done so what happened yesterday doesn't become a daily occurrence.

       Besides yungkyoon spam and anti-trumpers posting the same "bombshell" breaking story 5 times (though they are clearly prompted that the article has already been submitted), I don't think it was ever a real problem. I really never understood where people are coming from when they are complaining about all this spam. I've never found it to be too much to parse through. On top of that I find all material has some piece of information that can be gleaned from it. I suggest they let us act freely. This isn't a private club. The preponderance of Reddit doesn't have this rule.

       You see now you are turning this into a Trump thing. This isn't a Trump thing. This is our conspiracy board is being taken over by partison politics. You can see where the original guy stopped gaming the votes because me and the guy above me didn't get downvoted to negative.
