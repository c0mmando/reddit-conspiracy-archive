    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just gonna be the way it is for a while. We are at peak  sexual-harassment awareness. The victims are finally feeling empowered enough to say something. </p>

<p>It would make sense that when an offender, like McMahon (or anyone of power or notoriety)  makes front page news again for a movie, a business deal, ETC,  better than powered victim may even feel vengeful enough to say &quot;nope, not this time, it&#39;s time to take your power down a notch, while your name is in the news, and tell the truth about you&#39; - </p>

<p>it&#39;s opportunistic, perhaps a tad vengeful,  but warranted timing on the behalf of any victim that wants to bring maximum exposure to the actions of the accused. </p>

<p>The fake news part is that i saw it with todays date when in fact, as the other poster said, this news is old and already published.</p>

<p>Does is applicable when talking about a third party. Do when addressing someone directly.</p>

<p>“Do you run daily?”
“Does she run daily?”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, actually you’re wrong.</p>

<p>The user wasn’t saying to use “do” because of who you’re addressing, but because your sentence doesn’t have subject-verb agreement. The subject of your sentence—“comments”—is plural, which means your verb should be, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How <strong>does</strong> his <strong>comments</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>should be</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How <strong>do</strong> his comments</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe the lesson here is that attacking grammar is a petty and condescending way to dismiss someone’s argument, especially when your other point is a good one that could stand on its own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has had sexual allegations before. He&#39;s even degenerate enough to approve storylines involving incest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Source: Wrestling Observer Newsletter</p>

<p>Vince McMahon has given his approval for a storyline involving incest. The angle would involve Ohio Valley Wrestling wrestlers Katie Lea and Paul Burchill. The angle would likely take place on either ECW or Raw, because there is some concern that it would get the wrong kind of heat if it were to take place on SmackDown — which is on network television.</p>

<p>McMahon has wanted to do an incest angle for years. He once suggested that he be the father of his daughter Stephanie’s baby. As revealed on the McMahon DVD, Stephanie turned down the angle. According to her, Vince was to reveal himself as the father of her baby; when she said no, he pushed for Shane to be the father, but she turned that idea down as well.</p>

<p>The incest idea was first batted around in 1999 where Ken Shamrock and Ryan Shamrock (his storyline sister) would end up as lovers. Ken nixed the idea and that was the beginning of the end of his push at the time. There is some irony in the angle as Ken and Ryan ended up as a real-life couple at around the same time frame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has attempted much, much worse  than that. Stephanie McMahon got pregnant in real-life and wanted to incorporate a &#39;who&#39;s the father?&#39; WWE story arc with a surprise reveal as himself father. Stephanie said that was too weird, so he suggested her real-life brother Shane McMahon to be the surprise reveal father, she and Shane both said it was still weird and he eventually dropped the whole idea. He&#39;s a maniac.</p>
