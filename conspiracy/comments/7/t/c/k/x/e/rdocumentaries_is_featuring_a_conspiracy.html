<li><p>The Pedophile Director Embraced by Hollywood-  Filmmaker Victor Salva was convicted of raping a 12-year-old boy. But his new film, ‘Jeepers Creepers 3,’ is now playing in theaters. Why has Hollywood given this monster a pass? <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-pedophile-director-embraced-by-hollywood">https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-pedophile-director-embraced-by-hollywood</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, this is so common in Hollywood that it&#39;s considered &quot;an open secret.&quot; </p>

<p>I highly recommend this documentary <em>An Open Secret</em> (on Pedos in Hollywood with testimony from stars, court cases, etc, 1:40:00): <a href="https://vimeo.com/142444429">https://vimeo.com/142444429</a></p>

<p>Several people are named, but more importantly, it explains why most stars don&#39;t name abusers for years, if ever, because it ruins their chances at a successful career. The documentary calls for people who have been abused to rise up and try to put an end to this. </p>

<p>Also see - &quot;Who Took Johnny&quot; on Netflix. It&#39;s a documentary on pedo rings in the government, child abductions, and the mechanics of coverup. It also goes through the history of child abductions and how the laws have changed over the years since Johnny Gosch was abducted. This is a follow-up doc on Conspiracy of Silence. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t people speak up about this more often? There are a lot of reasons. Probably the biggest reason was revealed in an article on Harvey Weinstein (not a pedo, but still relevant to this). He used some really shady tactics to silence his accusers. </p>

<ul>
<li>Harvey Weinstein’s Army of Spies. The film executive hired private investigators, including ex-Mossad agents, to track actresses and journalists. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies">https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also fears of being sued and spending too much money defending yourself in court if the man accused decides to take it to court. </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Unfortunately California conveniently enough has a statute of limitations that prevents that from happening. Because if I were to go and mention anybody’s name, I would be the one that would be in legal problems and I’m the one that would be sued.&quot; <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywoods-other-open-secret-besides-harvey-weinstein-preying-on-young-boys">https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywoods-other-open-secret-besides-harvey-weinstein-preying-on-young-boys</a></li>

<p>Interestingly enough I recommended it to a new friends roommate who is from D.C. She told me it reminded her of the stories going on about one of her favorite bars. I asked if it was Comet Ping Pong she said yes, then told me how everyone is wrong and she has been to the basement and there&#39;s definitely not any little kids down there. 
I dropped the topic but the take-away was interesting, yes there is a basement underneath Bucks. Also she said her parents knew the &quot;owners&quot; I thought there was only one?</p>
