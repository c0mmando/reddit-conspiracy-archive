       his argument is basically that high speed photography wasn't around in the 1960's, so therefore men must have walked on the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       its also interesting to note that the "high speed photography" claim and/or debunking seems to exist nowhere but in this video. however the man in this video would have you believe that it is the centerpiece for all "conspiracy theories"
      </p>
      <p>
       its a red herring, a straw man. an argument that he made up, just so that he could tear it down
      </p>
      <p>
       this video is so bad that it smells like low budget satire, but people continue to cite this video as if its proof that men went to the moon
      </p>

       Well this latest season they have sort of made it like the original episodes... stand alone. The latest one involved the Mandela effect and people from the other timeline call it the Mengle Effect. Because many people remember Joseph Mengle dying in Nebraska. (or something like that)
      </p>

       It was good because they injected this other actor back into all old episodes. It was quite funny.

       It's not a shaggy dog story. They would need a high speed camera to fake the different gravity on the moon.

       Ultimate proof though, is that the USSR never called out the US. If it was fake they eoukd have called out the US, just like with the U-2 incident

       You need to look at the history of the cold war. The US and USSR were in a space race and trying to control the world. The USSR was actually winning the space race when the US managed to surpass them and get to the moon first. The USSR had every incentive to prove that the US lied, just like they did with the U-2 incident.

       thats the beauty of true science. unless you can replicate it per the scientific method, it can be dismissed as pseudo scientific nonsense

       have you personally replicated/confirmed the placement of these reflectors? no?

       so, according to NASA, we have the technology to use a highly focused beam of light, to hit a small moving target at 200,000 miles away
      </p>
      <p>
       and yet we do not have the technology to use a telescope to find that exact same small moving target on the moon, supposedly because its too far away or moving too fast?
      </p>
      <p>
       if we actually had the technology to make a laser track the movement of the moon, so that the laser could hit the reflector, then would a reflector even be necessary? 1962

       The angular resolution of a telescope is roughly equal to wavelength / aperture diameter. You'd need an enormous telescope to be able to even see the lunar landing site.
      </p>
      <p>
       A laser is something totally different because it's
       <em>
        coherent
       </em>
       light.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes we can hit something hundreds of thousands of miles away without being able to see it. It's simple math.

       I've been debating the facts of the moon landing for decades, and almost without fail, people will claim that "muh Russians would have told me"
      </p>
      <p>
       this argument has caught my attention for several reasons
      </p>
      <p>
       1) its so popular that it has to be an idea that comes from the top-down, as opposed to lots of random people simultaneously coming up with the same argument. so I'm curious where this argument originated, and why it seems plausible enough to regurgitate
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I'm always curious how the person making the argument "knows" that the Russians
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       call bullshit. was that person monitoring Russian media in the 1960-1970's?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I'm always curious how the person making the argument would expect the Russians to alert them to the fact that the moon landing was a hoax. Would the Russians hack into our Emergency Alert System and play a recording of Russians calling bullshit? Would the Russians take out a full page ad in the NYT? Would the Russians send a singing telegram to your house?
      </p>
      <p>
       oh i know! you would expect the same TV station that just got done putting all of that effort into fooling you into believing men walked on the moon, to drop the facade at the first hint of Russian skepticism, and admit on national prime time TV that the moon landing was indeed a hoax and gosh darn it they would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for those meddling Russians
      </p>

       may i ask if you remember when you first heard this "muh Russians" argument?

       i suspect there was a moon landing hoax debunking video on the History Channel on TV and it included this argument
      </p>
      <p>
       the cold war narrative further crumbles when you realize that in the 45+ years its been since anyone has even claimed to have walked on the moon,
      </p>
      <p>
       that the quest to put men on the moon still consists of just 2 parties
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the Americans, who have been there, and done that. and felt so confident about doing it that they copied over the landing data, deleted footage, and basically "lost" the technology to go to the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       2) the Russians, who were at one point supposedly more advanced with their manned programs, yet inexplicably still unable to put men on the moon in spite of 45+ years of Moore's Law
      </p>
      <p>
       this silly mock-up of Russians vs Americans, completely ignores the fact that no other nation has been able to go to the moon, in spite of there being many technologically advanced nations who would presumably go if they they thought that they could

       Your questions just make no sense. To land on the moon you simply need enough delta-V to get there. You need about 16 km/s of dV to reach the moon's surface from Earth. The Saturn V rocket had more than enough dV to accomplish that.

       Just one example: 4 is totally incorrect. You do not need to continuously burn fuel to reach the Lagrange point. You simply exchange kinetic energy for potential energy. It's like pedaling your bike really fast and then coasting up a hill.

       You don't have to burn it the whole time. You generate a thrust impulse and then coast.

       I would say you haven't, because there's no evidence of you having walked on the moon.

       On the other hand, there is video of astronauts on the moon. There is evidence that the Soviets agreed we had gone to the moon (or at least not disputed it). There is evidence that the astronauts left retroreflectors on the moon. There are photos of the landing site from satellites - not just the US, but also Japan, China, and India. So it's a very silly comparison.

      <p>
       do you seriously believe that rockets can "escape gravity" if they go fast enough?

       this is science fiction.

       if it was was easy, why haven't the Russians done it?
