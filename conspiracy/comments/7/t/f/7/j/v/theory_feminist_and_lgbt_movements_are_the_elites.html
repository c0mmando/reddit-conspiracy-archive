        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I can&#39;t help but notice this growing trend in both Western as well as East-Asian societies of drawing a line in the sand between genders as well as the destabilization of the traditional man-woman-child family idea.</p>

<p>Through media manipulation (social media, movies, TV shows, news etc), the young girls and women of today and the future generation of women are being encouraged to hate the opposite sex. They are being taught that they need no men in their lives, that men are abusive, sexist and evil. Many are becoming radical feminists and don&#39;t want anything to do with men. Likewise, more and more men are becoming disgusted and offended by this trend and end up not wanting anything to do with women, spawning the MGTOW movement.</p>

<p>This, coupled with the constant pro-LGBT encouragement (which isn&#39;t necessarily bad, you can&#39;t help who you love after all and shouldn&#39;t be judged for it) will influence the future generations to stop coexisting with the opposite sex and will cause birth rates to plummit dramatically as a result, effectively reducing the world population by hundreds of millions, even billions, within 50-100 years, which may actually be a good thing, as fewer humans means less pollution and a more sustainable Earth. Maybe this is why no world leaders take any real action against global warming, because they know the planet will start healing itself in 50 years once there will be fewer humans around to pollute it.</p>

<p>Edit: LMAO looks like I stirred up the feminist hive, personal attacks being the most upvoted replies. Real smooth, people, stay classy. I thought <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of all places would be a place of free thinking and open mindedness. Oh, the irony. Enjoy your little echo chamber. You&#39;ll see I&#39;m right in 50 years time if you&#39;ll get to live that long.</p>

<p>This is only happening in select cultures though and not others.  Why is it this is only happening in Western nations?  Why is this NOT happening the parts of the world where over population is a real problem like China, India, Indonesia, Africa, S. America?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>China has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy">one-child policy</a> with forces its already poor families to pay significant taxes if they have more than one child. Another part of the policy allows these families to have a second child for free if the first child is a girl, which has lead to a big surplus of males in China.</p>

<p>In Japan, women are turning away from men as a result of men&#39;s addiction to anime and hentai, which has caused them to display gross behavior around women.</p>

<p>I&#39;d argue that countries in South America, Africa and Oceania aren&#39;t affected by this yet because they are still undeveloped regions and media manipulation hasn&#39;t taken hold there yet, but it will eventually. I know for a fact that African countries are ravaged by civil wars and general poverty, which also inhibits birth rates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out the Jaffe memo. It confirms this. </p>

<p>&quot;In recent years a 1969 memo written by Frederick S. Jaffe has been a source of controversy. The memo, written to Berelson while he was head of the Population Council, included a table that summarized many proposals from various sources regarding population control. This table contained proposals such as compulsory abortions and sterilizations, encouraging homosexuality, forcing women to work, and other notions that no one would imagine an organization like Planned Parenthood would be associated with. In point of fact, however, Jaffe&#39;s table was included in a report by a Planned Parenthood official that worked for Jaffe, that said &quot;The report was prepared in behalf of Planned Parenthood&#39;s Population Education Staff Committee as a basis for discussion of and action on the U.S. population problem by the Planned Parenthood national organization.&quot;[7]</p>

<p>Furthermore, just two years later, Berelson and Jaffe would work together on the 1972 Rockefeller Commission Report.[8] Many of the ideas discussed in the memorandum were incorporated into the Rockefeller Report. So, while it is true that Jaffe&#39;s memorandum was primarily for purposes of laying out options for discussion, it is not true that Jaffe, Berelson, or Planned Parenthood, had no intention of acting on those proposals. Critics contend that the value of the memo is in revealing the lengths that population control advocates, including Berelson and Jaffe, were willing to go.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Statistically, countries which have afforded equal gender educational opportunities have seen a sharp reduction in population growth. It&#39;s not fertility as such, it&#39;s choice.</p>

<p>However, throw some other theories on top, such as frogs turning gay (which is true, simply articulated poorly), and there does seem to be factors at play which are reducing population. This is exacerbated in western countries because we have had women getting education for generation and we were the leaders in the industrial revolution. </p>

<p>Did you read it? </p>

<p>I understand your anger, and accept it. You are suffering from the Back Fire effect because your core beliefs and values are being questioned. The same part of your brain that responds to a physical threat, also response to an intellectual one as well. Thus you act out in anger. Give your self time to be angry, let it scream until it runs out of steam, then take a deep breath and just listen. I am not here to tell you what to believe. </p>

<p>If you need someone to direct that anger at, feel free to respond to me with the most angriest, post you can imagine, and I will listen to you. I will listen because regardless of what I believe, we are in this stupid beautiful world, together all of us as humans, and I will be damned if I am accomplice to hatred. So, I love you and I will listen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree slightly with your argument if it wasn&#39;t so biased. However, I believe men have a role in this depopulation agenda too. Is it not interesting that men are easily taking a back seat to women in relationships and gladly letting them lead the house so they can not have the responsibility? They are becoming more feminine or worse Mr. Red pills. The family is being destroyed in many ways. Thankfully like the feminist agenda and LBQT its not effecting everyone. I am sure though that our future generations will feel the fall out.</p>
