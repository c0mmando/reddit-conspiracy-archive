        The Manipulation of Women: Empowerment, Work, Group Think, and More
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Torches of Freedom” propaganda encouraged women to smoke cigarettes by tying the act with women’s liberation. From the Wikipedia article, "Torches of Freedom" was a phrase used to encourage women's smoking by exploiting women's aspirations for a better life during the women's liberation movement[when?] in the United States. Cigarettes were described as symbols of emancipation and equality with men. The term was first used by psychoanalyst A. A. Brill when describing the natural desire for women to smoke and was used by Edward Bernays to encourage women to smoke in public despite social taboos. Bernays hired women to march while smoking their “torches of freedom” in the Easter Sunday Parade of 1929 which was a significant moment for fighting social barriers for women smokers.”
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can do your own research on this, but Bernay’s uncle was Sigmund Freud, and whatever your thoughts on Freudian psychology, it is an interesting link:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.oxfordpresents.com/ms/kelleher/edward-bernayss-torches-of-freedom/">
        http://www.oxfordpresents.com/ms/kelleher/edward-bernayss-torches-of-freedom/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Women themselves did not “initiate” this “Torches of Freedom” movement, so one must ask themselves this: were these men really concerned with the liberation of women, or was there something deeper there?
      </p>
      <p>
       In this post, I want to examine the sociological, psychological, political, and even conspiratorial aspects of why women are the way they are – this is not a typical “I hate SJWs” post. This is more about examining whether or not there are more sinister elements related to the problems of modern feminism. What is wrong with women today?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Divide and Conquer
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all heard the argument – women should be able to work just like any other man, and I agree with that! The problem is that this argument has been used to manipulate both men and women (the classic argument of 'equality'). Here is my argument – one income should be enough to support an entire family, and it is used to be. ‘They’ made this all a sex/gender issue, but really, it is about money and class. I liked this comment from this Harvard blog:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The corporate conspiracy theory of feminism is that feminism was encouraged and proliferated when our corporate masters decided that with women working, they could harvest the labor off the back of men and women, not just men. And indeed, coincidental with two income families were home prices, cars, vacations, that demanded two incomes to pay them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly the Last Psychiatrist has a conspiracy theory to explain Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In., which is that she is being heavily promoted now as our corporate masters want women to work even harder, for longer hours, but the same pay.
       <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/03/dont_hate_her_because_shes_suc.html.%E2%80%9D">
        http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/03/dont_hate_her_because_shes_suc.html.”
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/philg/2013/05/15/how-did-a-single-income-family-in-the-1960s-have-a-full-time-housekeeper/">
        https://blogs.harvard.edu/philg/2013/05/15/how-did-a-single-income-family-in-the-1960s-have-a-full-time-housekeeper/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you do not want to trust that comment, the truth is that one person used to be able to support an entire household. In fact, minimum wage used to be enough to keep people out of poverty:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2013/12/minimum-wage-was-once-enough-keep-family-3-out-poverty/7773/">
        https://www.citylab.com/life/2013/12/minimum-wage-was-once-enough-keep-family-3-out-poverty/7773/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/jun/15/jack-reed/jack-reed-says-minimum-wage-1950s-and-1960s-would-/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again, I am not against women working. Rather, ‘they’ tied women’s liberation to work (oxymoron – arbeit is frei?), and then ultimately both mom and dad are out of the house working. Today, people are barely even able to survive on two incomes:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-todays-economy-even-two-income-families-struggle-to-make-ends-meet">
        https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-todays-economy-even-two-income-families-struggle-to-make-ends-meet
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see the deception? By the way, feminist figures like Gloria Steinem are directly tied to these “women liberation” movements, but did you know she had direct ties to the CIA?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-gloria-steinem-cia-20151025-story.html">
        http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-gloria-steinem-cia-20151025-story.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is not about me not wanting “equality” for women. Instead, I do not feel that working 50 hours a week and smoking a pack of cigarettes a day is what I ultimately view as true liberation. By the way, I do not smoke, but you get the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Working Women
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite all of the gender controversy today, there are qualities that are innate to the sexes (in this case, I’m talking male and female), and men and women really do have different brains, at least according to Stanford:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2017spring/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different.html">
        https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2017spring/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am not saying that women cannot work, cannot be engineers, and cannot do things that men can do. What I am saying is that women have natural tendencies that they cannot always avoid. It is no surprise that women are more likely to be teachers, nurses, and caregivers in general:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11043452/Caregivers-are-more-likely-to-be-women-says-American-study-as-daughters-take-responsibility-over-sons.html">
        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11043452/Caregivers-are-more-likely-to-be-women-says-American-study-as-daughters-take-responsibility-over-sons.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, women likely strive for caregiving careers because it is in our nature to take care. Women are meant to be nurturers, and isn’t it crazy that, today, the statement I am making is controversial? Here is where the problem lies:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Women should be able to have a job like a man.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Women now must have jobs to support their families; two incomes are barely enough to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see the difference there? Women's liberation should be about choice. Do women really have a choice to work anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Sidenote:
       </em>
       I am aware of the argument that women do not take on "male-oriented" jobs because of societal sexism or some shit, but I simply do not buy it. I think women simply are not geared toward jobs like that, and that is why they do not do them!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, here is the other problem. Women are now working in extremely stressful situations, 50 hours a week, and quite simply, women do not handle stress like men do. Science says that women are absolutely more anxious than men:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womenslife/11043452/Caregivers-are-more-likely-to-be-women-says-American-study-as-daughters-take-responsibility-over-sons.html">
        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womenslife/11043452/Caregivers-are-more-likely-to-be-women-says-American-study-as-daughters-take-responsibility-over-sons.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       More women than ever are experiencing anxiety-related issues:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/blog/why-rise-anxiety-among-young-women">
        https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/blog/why-rise-anxiety-among-young-women
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       More women than ever are in emergency rooms with alcohol related issues and drinking more than ever before:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://time.com/4893108/alcohol-use-disorder-drinking/">
        http://time.com/4893108/alcohol-use-disorder-drinking/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And these gains in “women’s rights” have quite frankly not made women happier:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/18/womens-rights-happiness-wellbeing-gender-gap">
        https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/18/womens-rights-happiness-wellbeing-gender-gap
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure you can start forming the connections. Women, who are naturally more nurturing and who are also more naturally prone to anxiety (likely due to this nurturing personality), are now taking on stressful working positions – not voluntarily, but really, forcefully, to support their families. They are more stressed than ever, drinking more, and generally just unhappier. Is this really women’s liberation? I guess we can always smoke a pack of cigarettes to calm down 😊
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Breakdown of Families
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is talked about a lot on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , so I do not want to overdo it, but traditional families are a thing of the past:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/24/traditional-families-pew-report_n_6377136.html">
        https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/24/traditional-families-pew-report_n_6377136.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This article claims that there is a “mysterious” rise in single-parent (women) families, too:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-mysterious-and-alarming-rise-of-single-parenthood-in-america/279203/">
        https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-mysterious-and-alarming-rise-of-single-parenthood-in-america/279203/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really that mysterious? Raising children is one of the hardest jobs in the world, and when you have two parents working all day, from 8-5 (or longer), relationships simply are not the priority. 
There is obviously more to this, but the point is that with the rise of the “working women”, women might simply feel that they do not need a man – that they can do it on their own. And they are, but that does not mean it is working out so well. Kids raised by single moms are generally not as successful:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/07/single_motherhood_worse_for_children_.html">
        http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/07/single_motherhood_worse_for_children_.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, I am not trying to place all the fault on women (and we will talk about men later, of course). Finally, I am not saying that non-traditional families cannot work. Perhaps it is better to say “stable” families are better for children:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://theconversation.com/stable-families-not-traditional-ones-key-to-childrens-education-success-36158">
        https://theconversation.com/stable-families-not-traditional-ones-key-to-childrens-education-success-36158
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, children need stability, and if a mom (or dad) is not even home to raise their children because they are working, is that really stable?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Abortion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was growing up, it was force-fed to me that abortion was empowerment. I went into my early twenties with this belief. I am not here to argue whether abortion is morally right or wrong. In the end, every individual gets to decide that. In fact, I would say I am legally for abortion but morally against it. What I am here to do is ask you why abortion is painted so positively and associated with women’s liberation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped browsing
       <a href="/r/twoxchromosomes">
        /r/twoxchromosomes
       </a>
       after post after post painted abortion as some amazing fete, an accomplishment even.  I would never a judge a woman who gets an abortion, so that is not what I am here to do either. Still, there are literally studies that equate abortion with empowerment:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5688482/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5688482/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Something about that disturbs me. My friend had an abortion, which was a very difficult choice. She is haunted by her decision, and the negative psychological effects of abortions are simply not advertised. She texted me the other day that she would have given birth to her baby this month. Let us just not say she was handling it well, but I am there for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, as always, people simply are not looking at the larger picture. Why do women want to get abortions in the first place? Sure, there may be some women who use abortions as a form of birth control, but I do not see that as a majority. Society is making having children a more difficult choice than ever, and abortion is seemingly a more appealing choice:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  Raising a child is more expensive than ever, at least in the US:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/01/10/its-more-expensive-than-ever-to-raise-a-child-in-the-u-s/?utm_term=.1cdc74f83d6f">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even giving birth to a child is extremely expensive. This is a conspiracy in itself:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-real-cost-of-giving-birth-in-the-us_us_5a144a83e4b05ec0ae8445d3">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  Even if a woman decides to go through with birth, they are likely working, and short maternity leave is a huge problem in the US:
      </p>

       3)  Suddenly, having children is becoming demonized in our society. People are told that they should have less children to “decrease global warming.” Want to fight climate change? Have fewer children:

      </p>
      <p>
       This disgusts me. They are taking away the blame from huge corporations and placing it on families.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)  In fact, there is even an increase of people disliking the very essence of children:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have come to a point in society where having children is not a natural experience anymore. It is a difficult choice, and some women simply choose that the struggle is not worth it. I am not saying I agree with that decision due to my own moral system, but I completely understand where these women are coming from. On top of that, when abortion is viewed as empowerment, it is simply easier to justify the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Are Women Stupid?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I do not think women are stupid. I think they are different then man, and I think the powers that be are completely aware of how women are manipulated. Men are manipulated differently than women, and we will talk about that later. Also, it is really important to note that men and women are both just as susceptible to group think and conformity, just in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The results suggest that same-sex groups conform significantly more than mixed-sex groups due to higher levels of normative social influence.”
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also important to note that this can be extremely complex, and I am not claiming I can dive into every component of group think, conformity, and sex here. What I can say is that women are more likely more susceptible for group think and conformity when it comes to social situations, like social media:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.socialmedialink.com/insights/social-media-habits-men-vs-women/">
        https://www.socialmedialink.com/insights/social-media-habits-men-vs-women/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Women are biologically more social than men, so manipulation will come in social forms, and proof of this is that women dominate every social media network:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231970">
        https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231970
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what is the best way to influence women then? Perhaps create a movement on social media on how abortion is equated with empowerment, or something like that. The point is, women respond well to manipulation through social means, whether that means social media, marches, or maybe even talk show hosts like Oprah, whose entire audience is women.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women work and think in groups, and they even prefer working together:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/08/why-women-prefer-working-together-and-why-men-prefer-working-alone/278888/">
        https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/08/why-women-prefer-working-together-and-why-men-prefer-working-alone/278888/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if they want women to believe something, they better make sure that it appears as though every other woman also believes that same thing, whether it be smoking cigarettes, getting an abortion, or sex positivity.

        Manipulation of Men
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This post was oriented toward women, but it is important we discuss men, too. Yes, modern feminism is exhausting, and movements like Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW) are on the rise:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7bdwyx/inside-the-global-collective-of-straight-male-separatists">
        https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7bdwyx/inside-the-global-collective-of-straight-male-separatists
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I do not think either women or men are to blame. Really, I think both men and women are victims, but they are painted as enemies. You will see in some of these groups that there is a pure hatred of women, but I think if these men were willing to examine the psychological and sociological reasons behind modern feminism, they simply would not hate women. They likely would still not be happy, but they would not hate women for being manipulated by larger forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men, of course, are being manipulated, too. However, I absolutely believe there is a villainization of men happening, and women, in groups, are responding to that. So, I feel for men, and that is why I am writing this post, ultimately.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, I think men should examine some strange things happening, and one of those is porn. Look, I know criticizing porn will likely get me some enemies on Reddit, but there really are some issues with porn that I will discuss in another post (it will take another 7 pages). I remember when I was a new Reddit user, I went to
       <a href="/r/sex">
        /r/sex
       </a>
       , wanting to discuss the pros and cons of porn. I was shocked to see that my post was downvoted and attacked, and that I was told quite simply, as a woman, I was just jealous and insecure for thinking there could ever be anything possibly wrong with porn usage, especially in men. Porn really does affect your brain though:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/02/16/is-watching-porn-harmful-to-your-health/">
        https://nypost.com/2017/02/16/is-watching-porn-harmful-to-your-health/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And my conspiracy on porn post is coming up next…so let me know if you are interested!
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, the point is that I think that both men and women have been purposely divided in different ways, and it is working really, really well.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way I can get to everything I want to in this post, as it is already very long. I have also written about these topics in varying degrees over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a woman, I honestly cannot relate to modern women, and I am not saying that “to get attention” as “redpillmen” would claim. Rather, I am saying I believe that women are not aware of that they are products of manipulation. I have known this for years, and really, there are very few women who will listen to me about it (but I know you are out there!)
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I would even argue that women have pitted against women intentionally, and this has divided women even further. There are actual studies on this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-is-2020/201309/women-who-hate-other-women-the-psychological-root-snarky">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-is-2020/201309/women-who-hate-other-women-the-psychological-root-snarky
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is to keep everybody divided and nobody questioning who is really doing all this division. As long as people have somebody to hate, they do not have time to think. Men and women will continue to hate each other, while denying their natural biological selves, and arguably even their  divine nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I must end this post now, and think about all of the work I have to do tomorrow.

       Very well laid out. I feel like there is definitely a push for women to take on male roles, in return making males generally useless. It is a breakdown of not only marriage but also the mother-and-child bond, resulting in children being taken care of the state nurseries and schools. With the future plans of introducing an

       Lets just say women have been, and still are, seen as inferior to men, so are expected to always adjust around man's law. After feminism drove the need for equal rights, women were simply given a pass to exist in the world designed by men through centuries. The law doesn't aknowledge that men/women have different qualities, it either banishes women entirely or forces them to fit in with the male narrative.

       Unfortunately we might witness a genderless society before one that accepts men and women for who they are.

       I enjoyed reading your post and found myself agreeing with much of what you typed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thought that modern feminism has manipulated women in an attempt to destroy the nuclear family, halt birth rates and harvest more labor is anathema to those who have created an identity based upon feminist theory.

       Don't take the downvotes personally, if anything it means you are doing something right.

       True! I could care less if it is at 0. It is more that a I just spent a lot of time and at least people would argue if the disagree.

       Maybe they disagree with you because you're throwing women's rights under the bus, including second wave feminist things like abortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's because you use the New York Post, a magazine that slut shamed women who accused Harvey Weinstein of assault, as a source about porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's because you think Paul Joseph Watson and his assault on millennials are worthy of attention.

       She does not hate the younger generation...  She is a teacher who loves her students.  She worries about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe she has said in this thread that she is all for women having choices available to them.  She feels the bigger problem is how we being practically forced into certain choices when it comes to key parts of our lives.

       Sad thing is that because it is against God's intended nature, it doesn't work very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying families with working moms and stay-at-home dads are bad, or even don't work or are not following God. But there are certain disadvantages such a setup has. For example - I can't provide my kids with breastmilk, and if they want comforting, they will always choose my wife first. There's a reason for that...

       I noticed around 2004 the word 'housewife' was being used a lot, and not ironically. As someone old enough to remember 2nd wave feminism(though I was a kid), I had thought the word and concept were dead and buried. It started with 'Desperate Housewives', 'Real Housewives of X', and spread into common usage, where before you would hear the gender-neutral 'homemaker'. At the time I wondered if there was some conspiracy behind it.

       I don't know if you've seen Jordan Peterson's recent interview with Cathy Newman, but he opened my eyes to a bit about the pay gap between women and men. There are many variables into that equation that are rarely mentioned by the MSM.

       Women are shamed for choosing to stay home too. Told they're wasting their lives, wasting their potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is so much of someone's identity based on their "career?"
      </p>
      <p>
       This goes for men as well as women.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't want my kids to be raised by anyone but my wife. I wouldn't want them in a daycare all day, and I'd work as much as I had to to make that possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that makes me a "sexist" today's standards.

       Yeah, women are told that they should have Choices! Choice, choice, choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really, only certain choices are acceptable. A woman who stays home is "anti woman." A pro life woman is "anti woman." A woman who wants 5 kids is "anti woman."
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's women who are judging other women this harshly too. It's rarely men from what I've seen.

       Practically everyone. I'd say at least one in three women we encounter have this mindset. It really bothers my wife and infuriates me. i wouldn't be where I was at if my mom didn't stay at home and raise me, and with the state of the 'educational' and babysitting services I am very glad my wife stays at home to raise my kiddos. If she worked I'd stay at home in a heartbeat.

       I'm not trying to be argumentative, but practically everyone wouldn't be one in three people. Do one in three legitimately come off as hostile to the idea of a stay at home wife? I'm about as liberal as they come and totally support that lifestyle. I don't know anyone that would judge a stay at home wife. One of the most feminist women I know stays at home with her daughter.

       I've lived in the deep South my entire life and I don't know anyone that thinks this way. And basically everyone in my circle of friends would describe themselves as feminists. There's way more judgment going the other direction - women not staying home to take care of their kids. Our experiences are all different, but I'm surprised to hear that some people view feminism as that big of a problem in the deep South.

       Being feminist is about being able to make that decision to stay home for herself rather than only staying home because it's what's expected of her.

       I think that may depend on your age and where you live. I'm 50 in the rural south. A ton of people have made remarks about my not having kids, or 'having' to work even though I'm married.

       Stay at home moms are practically revered. Maybe you should consider moving to a smaller, more conservative town.

       Amen friend. That's our thoughts exactly. Very blessed that we can live comfortably without my wife working - nowadays it is harder and harder to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, my coworker's wife got a job, so they'll have to move to find a midpoint (hour's drive for both of them) and they'll have to have their 1.5 yr old son in day care the entirety of the week. The wife wanted to work....makes me sad for their son.

       Yep. It is tough. My wife has a couple friends that would love to stay home, but think they can't afford it. This is actually true for a lot of people nowadays. But there are also people that could afford it if they stopped buying so much stuff, stopped eating out as much, drove older cars, didn't feel the need to keep upgrading to a "bigger house," so on and so forth. I'm sure you know the type.
      </p>
      <p>
       And 1.5 years old? That's rough. That age is where they really get separation anxiety.

       The buying power of the dollar has tanked over the last few decades. Generally, it is much harder to afford the equivalent lifestyle (at the same age) as our parents maintained. Now it takes two working parents in a lot of cases to make the American Dream happen, as opposed to just one in the case of our parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely know what you mean tho. I was shocked to find the US average monthly values for Shopping and Dining out according to Mint were equal to my truck payment (I drive an expensive truck). People don't understand how I can afford it...but we don't waste our money on crap.

       It sounds like there's some blame being placed on feminism for the state of the economy. Is that the case, or am I misunderstanding these comments? I can't imagine being a single-income household today, but I'm not sure feminism is to blame for that feeling. Especially considering how stagnant wages have been for the past forty years or so.

       You do realize not all women have had the choice right? Poor women married or single have always worked outside the home, and women considered too unattractive to marry have had to support themselves or be dependent on their parents for life.

       I think about this stuff a lot as a young male who is very attracted to women but not well received.. I made a post about artificial fragrance yesterday that I believe also ties into this manipulation of the sexes. Pheromones being covered up and unable to trigger hormones and all that.

       I went down the rabbit hole on this subject. I found it all on Wikipedia. The Suffragettes were funded by elitists Have you ever heard of the Social Register? American Blue Bloods ran everything in the US.Hollywood glamorized every movement. Many actors considered Hollywood Royalty came from blue blood families, Bogart, Betty Davis, Gable, etc. It all ties back to Psychiatry, Operation Paperclip, The 45 Stated Goals of Communism, The Tavistock Institute etc. Albert Kinsey's sex surveys gave birth to 60's ideas of Free Love, Feminism et al. The link, an all day read, is about the founders of the Hippie culture. Way too many of them came from blue blood families in Virginia, had fathers who were high ranking military/government members, and were magically drawn to Laurel Canyon in San Fransisco.

       I've noticed every female coworker who bought into the "go to college, get a job, be equal" thing really doesn't find satisfaction in it. Some have outright admitted they don't like it, others you can tell by their demeanor and offhand comments, etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Men and women will continue to hate each other, while denying their natural biological selves, and arguably even their divine nature
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       On a related note, something the feminists miss is that while it is true men can be horribly abusive to women (and I'm not justifying it) women are just as abusive back, albeit in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men are stronger, both physically and emotionally, and they have and should use that strength to uplift and protect women against other men or even women. However, these good traits of course can be corrupted, and evil men will use their strength to abuse women who can't fight back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women, in contrast, are weaker physically and emotional (tho much more resistant to pain, physical or otherwise). But, they are obviously much more beautiful and sensitive, and more refined in many aspects. Therefore, their abuse is less straightforward than male abuse, and is less aggressive big acts of violence and more prolonged, venomous leeching of their target, or physical/emotional manipulation to gain and retain control over their victim. It is much less noticeable than male-pattern abuse, but just as damaging and I think nearly as cruel.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that to say, both sides swing punches at each other with equal vigor, and will continue to do so as long as both sexes exist.

       Indeed. Some situations require it; still, the best women in physical strength will still be inferior to an above average male. Meanwhile, we'll never be able to do quite a number of things all women routinely do

       I enjoyed this post and agree on a lot of points, but I feel that as a woman who honestly enjoys her work and prefers her partner to stay home, some points seem a little forced. I've personally experienced the "boys club" of academia, and I can honestly say that your sidenote saying that women aren't turned off "male dominated" careers by casual sexism isn't my experience. I definitely became a lab technologist partly because it was a career that seemed to be analytical and science based and yet dominated by women. It's been a dream come true. I also love having a partner who genuinely loves our children and would rather spend more time with them. Just my two cents. "Liberated women" (god i hate that term) who don't hate sahm's and those who make different choices and consider themselves feminists do exist. I also have absolutely no problem with criticism of feminism. No movement or set of ideas is perfect! Critical thought is necessary for improvement.

       I do not think there is anything wrong with a woman working and a man staying home. I think what is wrong is most today need both individuals working and supportung a family.

       I just do not think that is true liberation or freedom for men or women.

       I totally agree. Big businesses saw women in the workplace who enjoyed working as an excuse to freeze wage inflation instead of trying to find a solution for society that didn't involve breaking down families. Some people blame women for wages being so low now as compared to before women were in the workplace, but I feel that telling anybody, man or woman, that they're supposed to live their life one way and one way only (men work, women at home) is just tyranny, plain and simple. We must all be free to make our own choices.

       Having you ever seen the movie Mr. Mom?  A comedy, but very 80s and pretty good.  The problem for guys is that you can't "market" yourself as a stay at home dad type, and growing up that's never presented as an option within the realm of possibility.  I mean, if you are responsible enough to be a good father, then you should certainly be able to handle it like a job anyhow, which it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, a kinda big factor is work time, which you mentioned, but I think vacation time in the US is silly...especially considering that people would probably prefer to have kids when they are younger, and you don't get a lot of time early on in a lot of professions.  I dunno, hopefully self-driving cars and automation will help with that...ya know, if society doesn't collapse and all.

       I've become more and more skeptical that technological innovations (like self-driving cars and automation) will help our work life.
      </p>
      <p>
       One always imagines that with advances in efficiencies, work burdens will reduce.  But invariably, the higher-ups decide that rather than allowing the new technology to lighten the existing staff's workload, they will cut the number of staff.  Therefore, after the technology is implemented, those who still have jobs are usually left doing even more work.

       Excellent post! I agree and it’s interesting to me that the overwhelming majority of women with whom I’ve discussed these topics (including many co workers) long for a more “traditional” type of life. Most are dealing with full time jobs, daycare, etc. due to necessity more than preference.

       "Me, me, me, I want!" Wanting to work is fine and being selfish in every other way. except  wanting kids is fine too. You know why? Because other humans that can't consent to life and you being their mother. Are you the best person you can ever be to teach your kid right from wrong? Are you capable of raising your children and not traumatizing them? Are you capable of providing for your children in eery way? No. Nobody is capable of that.

       My thoughts exactly! I want to be a mom so bad and just raise my kids and tend to a family farm and maybe sell some baked goods on the side as my life,  but this system doesn't allow for it being in the lower class, even with advanced degrees,  so much for those, lol.  I want to badly to live simply and within nature,  but it's getting increasingly difficult.  I'm tired of feeling guilty for not wanting to work and just be a home maker,  just because life is inproportionately inflating higher than wage earnings,  so everyone in the family MUST work.

       I'm a software developer &amp; conspiracy theorist that did just that.  I bought a ranch 4 years ago.  I made the move up here full time in November and have never been happier. I own a place in town i use as office, 30mbs, not great but adequate to still make great money.  I loved your post, btw.

       To stop covering up personal bias with pseudo theories. Some women are dumb. That is fine. Some women like to polish genitals and pop kids out - that is fine too. But as soon as those females start coming out and pushing their agenda onto others, there's a problem. Shamed for wanting children? GTFO sure doesn't stop you from abusing the shit out of your vagina. Women who strive to work, on the other hand, face real challenges. Wage gaps are real, sexism is real. Shaming is in your head.

       No, it wouldn't. Just like trying to sound composed to appear condescending on the dumbest threat, doesn't actually mean that you are in fact composed/intelligent. Not sure what you were going for there, bud. 
  Penis polishers don't set anyone back. They do their own thing and nobody gives a shit about them. They are on the background. That bothers them. Why should women that strive get all the attention? If kid sucking on your titty is not an accomplishment, I don't know what is. So where's their medal for going with their basic instincts? Isn't getting a PHD not the same as guy jazzing in your vag? They feel shamed. It isn't right. Must be a conspiracy. Working women must be brainwashed. They are just lying to themselves. How could a female not want to fuck and pop kids out? That's insanity. They have lower intelligence and they have god given vaginas. They are made to serve men and have children."I took care of horses once, best thing ever. I don't get women that don't want kids. So peaceful".

       To be honest your all over the place and I was trying to make sense of what you were saying. Your projecting your views and biases onto others. I've seen NO ONE here say that they "didn't get women that don't want kids". Some women want to rise to the top of their chosen profession. And that's fucking awesome. Some women would rather stay home and raise their children. That doesn't make them less intelligent. Show me one study, one statistic were stay at home mothers are less intelligent that working women. I fucking dare you. I chose not to have children. Being a stay at home mother sounds like fucking hell to me. But with that said I respect the hell out of a woman who does do this. It's a goddamn grind. If they find being present in their child's life fulfilling, why do you have such a problem with it?  Why wouldn't we support a woman's choice?

       You want to be a mom why? If the answer starts with "I just WANT", you shouldn't have kids. Any rational woman that actually loves kids would never procreate. Exposing your own children to this world is the epitome of selfishness. You are basically forcing your children to face suffering, illness and death, because of your own wants.

       And obviously who would want our species to die out? We're fucking great. We have overblown egos, we're ignorant, violent. We destroy everything. We have no idea what this world is, where we came from, but one thing we know for sure - we must reproduce to keep this madness going. Love your logic. It's awesome. Hope you have 10 kids.

       It's funny because you use the word "just" to characterize doing so much:
       <br/>
       * "raise my kids"
       <br/>
       * "tend to a family farm"
       <br/>
       * "sell some baked goods"
       <br/>
       That's a lot of work!  And it sounds like an honorable life.  If that's what you really want, you should try to do exactly that.

       Ong yes,  time is going by extremely fast.  I'm early thirties and feel like months are weeks and unless you actively or your mind to doing something,  it's just not getting done.  I'm not a great self-starter either,  but need others around me to set the tone,  I've noticed.  But I'm realizing I need to come or of my comfort zone to get what I want out of life.

I don't comment much, but I want you to know your words get out there. Your posts makes people think. You are down-voted because of that. Be proud of that. Looking forward to your next post.

       What you're describing seems like more of an issue with capitalism than with feminism. Men and women should be able to do whatever they want with their lives. If women want to work, great. If men want to stay home, great. As long as they can work out relationships that support their needs, then I don't see a problem with any combination of work/home.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the influx of potential employees that come with any civil rights movement. The same thing happened when black people were finally given paying jobs in the US. Before then, white people were only competing among themselves. Any additions to the workforce just drive down the price of labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       So before, we had only 50% of the adult population as potential workers. That number is now closer to 100%. So, companies can pay far less than they otherwise would. It's not feminism's fault that, if given the chance, companies will take every chance they get to screw their employees. The solution is government intervention, but our country has a real distaste for that sort of thing. Meanwhile, socialist countries are enjoying ample amounts of vacation time, massive amounts of paternity/maternity leave and a host of other societal benefits. That's how you properly adapt to an increased workforce.

       I agree that men and women should be able to do whatever they want. However, I think that gender roles reflected a person's  sex, which is why they were "established" for lack of a better word. Today we live in a world that seems to villainize these roles which is making both men and women more miserable.

       There's certainly some basis of truth to gender roles being the way they are. That said, men have legitimately kept women out of the workforce as well. They were given zero choice in how they lived their lives. The options were "become a homemaker" or "be a spinster."
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't experienced the type of villainization you're talking about, but I'm not living a traditional lifestyle. I have a nice job and my wife has a PhD and is working in the field of her dreams. Plus, we don't want kids. I have no interest in kids, so a stay at home wife isn't something I was looking for. Personally, I'm glad women are becoming more educated and are pursuing careers. I do wish our capitalist culture didn't immediately take advantage of that fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       We still see a lot of the opposite type of pressure. My wife is constantly asked about having kids, and I know many professional women that feel judged for not being home with their kids more. I just want everyone to have options. No one should feel judged for exercising them.

       We've pretty well proven that's not enough. Otherwise, corporations would dump all of their chemicals in our rivers and would use kids for industrial work, because of their small hands. Corporations aren't people and the people that run them are barely people. They're not going to change out of the goodness of their hearts.

       At one point, maybe it was possible for people who got into government to regulate the excesses of corporations.
       <br/>
       Now it's a sad joke.  The U.S. political system is such that only those who are willing to act as puppets for corporations can win elections.  That is across the board - not just the presidency, and it is both Repubs and Dems.
       <br/>
       Sure there are outliers, but what can they do?  Those with integrity, those who will not "go along to get along", cannot effect change in our entirely corrupt system.
       <br/>
       Note:  This isn't just elected officials either ---it applies to high level government administrative management (e.g. EPA, BLM, FDA, DEA, DoJ...)  They're also bought &amp; paid-for either through bribes or through enticements such as promised high salary positions for companies they are tasked with regulating.

       Women empowerment is very real, in the sense that it is something natural, we are (since 2012) in the era of Aquarius, which is an era that is known to be fill with the healing female energy (nurturing), manipulators of reality as usurpers, as distorters; are manipulating this power into being destructive and towards their agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is natural to see females taking front page nowadays in society, because they are by nature and spirituality impulsed to work towards the healing of our civilization in this era, like a caring mother, to help to get out of the shackles of enslavement. But not in the way that is being done today, that is just a manipulation of the Ego, the false sense of empowerment of the Ego. that is all it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men also experience this energy and have a more difficult time into processing and handle this, because it is an energy that is deeply connected with emocion/sentiments/feelings (that is why you might see more men cry than you used to, and it is not something wrong), not so much with logic and masculinity as a whole, manipulators know this and distort it in their own ways, as gay pride parades, beta males, feminization of males, i'm not saying that being homosexual is bad,just that there is a subjacent manipulations and distortion to it.
as long as we keep referring towards males and females as a dichotomy we will forever be divided.

       Some say that in higher realms the sexes aren't divided into two bodies, and as above so below.

       It is interesting to see a brainwashed person not realizing he/she has a bias. 
WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS WORKED HARD PHYSICAL LABOR DOING SHIT LIKE FARMING!!! THEY DO TO THIS DAY IN EVERY PART OF THE GOD DAMN WORLD. THE WORLD DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND 1930S AMERICA. Now add having to cook, take it in all holes, pop babies out and take care of both your kids and a dude that just wants to stick his dick in something and act like he's superior. Women in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Asia have to both work and do everything around the house, while dudes do absolutely nothing. It has been the way of living for them for over 300 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all women want to pair up, not all women want children. In fact, most women that have children shouldn't have them, because they end up abusing and neglecting them. Look up statistics for child abuse. Ask any married woman if she's happy. The only reason women do procreate and they do get married is social brainwashing, financial need or simple laziness. For generations the only reason women would get married was inability to survive on their own, because society did not see them as human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the perfect world women do have a nurturing, intuitive side but this is not the perfect world. Just like men are supposed to be intelligent and rational, but they are not. Show me a man that doesn't act like an infantile hysterical bitch that can't even take care of herself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a bias based on the brainwashing that started in the 1930s in the US. Women were supposed to get married, suck dick, not work, pop kids out, etc. Then they'd end up psychotic, popping happy pills and their kids grew up to be sociopaths with an exceptional hatred towards women.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why now, when they're changing the programming (to a faulty one as well, no doubt), you are rebelling, because it goes against what you believe to be the fundamental truth. 
 I have 2 college degrees, I speak 4 languages and have numerous other skills, I don't want to suck dick for a living period. 
Nobody brainwashed me into not wanting to suck dick, I just don't want to spend the rest of my life trapped. I like living, I like working, I like learning, I like independence. I like to answer to nobody. I'm not a little kid to live with a daddy that fucks me and makes me live by his rules. 
 I also realize romantic relationships are a part of social brainwashing. Romantic love does not exist and marriage is unnatural for an animal like a human. It's an artificial social construct.

       Basically women have a choice: embrace their nature and choose to raise children, or choose to become like a man and duke it out in the corporate world. But you can't have it both ways, which is unfortunately what most women want (or what they are told they should want).

       Thank you for this post. I have always found your posts very insightful but this one really strikes a chord at things I have felt but haven't been able to articulate before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't judge anyone's choices but when it came to our children, both my SO and I agreed that we didn't want them to be raised by childminders and nursery workers. I earned more money so it made absolute sense of me to continue working while my SO dropped out of work to raise our children.
      </p>
      <p>
       After our second child was born my SO went to work in a grocery store part time. It is hard to make ends meet. I work Monday to Friday and she works Saturday and Sunday. She takes what overtime she can midweek in the evening. We are often ships in the night but our kids always have one of us there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel there is quite a bit of stigma around this, at least where I live. I felt judged when talking to people and they learned that my SO left her job after the first was born. I feel judged when I tell people my SO works part time in a grocery store. Nobody has said anything outright but it's definitely there, like I'm some sort of prehistoric man that has forced his partner to sacrifice her life for the kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's weird also because childcare is so expensive. I know women going back to work and they basically break even after childcare is taken out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of it does make me sad. And to express this in day to day life would be sacreligius. But where I used to work, out of sample size of three, all three women came back to work full time after having a child. Both mum and dad worked a full time job 9 months after birth. This just seems crazy to me, to have a child and then hand that child over to someone else to raise for a significant chunk of its life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not judging anyone's decision, it's more the fact that any opinion to the contrary is automatically rejected as being outdated and misogynistic.

       I think that while the women's movement is gaining momentum we have an opportunity to look at this and attempt make a giant shift in American values towards looking at gender roles and that whoever performs the various gender roles should be equally respected.   The   traditional feminine roles of making the money spread further and raising happy confident emotionally adaptable children have been neglected very much at the behest of media that encourages capitalism because of its advertisers.
This of course has worked in the favor of other countries as well.

       It is interesting that there is at the same time a movement towards more transgenders especially men transforming into women.   In a conversation earlier with someone in the middle of their shift, they said that part one thing one helpful thing is that these women will be more inclined to speak out for themselves.
It's often not the actual bodies that both women and transsexuals are uncomfortable in it is often more our interpretation of these genders their roles and how they are shown respect.   It is fascinating to look at what people from other areas of the world are saying about American women to begin with and the princess type, about whether or not their women are happy with the respect they get in their countries in their roles.

       I agree that men and women should be able to do whatever they want. However, I think that gender roles reflected a person's  sex, which is why they were "established" for lack of a better word. Today we live in a world that seems to villainize these roles which is making both men and women more miserable.
