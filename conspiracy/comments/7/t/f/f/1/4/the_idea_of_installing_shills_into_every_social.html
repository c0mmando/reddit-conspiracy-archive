       I fear a future where nearly 50% or more of all "users" online and all online content and comments are posted by paid shills and bots. I suspect AI is utilized in this mass large scale shilling operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of what you could accomplish with this. They know the Internet is the "new media", and it's how the different factions within the truth movement spread ideas and awaken the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they flooded these outlets with fake accounts that looked real, you could take over the narrative, and steer all the real users in a certain direction. I'm starting to think this is their ultimate goal. I remember getting a PM from a shill a few months back, something to the effect of;
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Every second, of every day, for the rest of your life, we gain more of the technology needed to reach every living human on earth. There is no great awakening, there is only "Us".
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Facebook seems to be loaded with them, using their same divisive tactics and narrative control. How many people would ever suspect that there are millions of fake accounts on Facebook masquerading as real people? They're everywhere in the comments sections of videos like police brutality, geoengineering, banking, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everytime a police brutality video is posted, the top comment is always some shit like,
      </p>
      <p>
       "If he was black he'd be dead!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, every fucking time. They don't even try to be transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the worst part is, how the fuck would anybody know that post could potentially be a bot or a shill? They are essentially creating a fucking "Truman show" style takeover of the free internet by deploying a massive army of shills and bots, in hopes of slowing down and delaying, or completely sabotaging our awakening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please try to keep an open mind regarding this idea, and don't immediately shoot it down because it seems unlikely or impossible to you. This is exactly the kind of lengths this crime syndicate would go to, to prevent a massive global awakening. They have all the money and time in the world to put a grid of control like this into place.

       Do you believe a captcha would adequately identify - not your identity, which I don't want - but rather that your post was written by a human - which I would like to verify to a reasonable degree?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, this would be a good excuse for us to discuss what that means - identifying humans as opposed to bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       btw, I immediately got seriously downvoted for insisting right away that we make this a test case of your proposition. Were those votes from bots?

       finally, you look like a new user (they must have stopped doing red-labels for New Users). Am I wrong on that?

       Most bots from what I understand aren't how I had pictured them, computers turning out responses with no human interaction, but actually people sitting at a computer with 20 or more accounts.
       <br/>
       They may have quick keys for generic responses, and they definitely have programs running looking for content to respond to, but actual responses are typed out by people.  Most of whom probably live in a third world getting paid pennies for their efforts.

       Yes, I see the same issue, and I think most people greatly underestimate the scope and scale of these operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       For communities like this that should know what is going on, we could take extreme action to mitigate the problem, such as restricting voting and commenting to accounts who have subscribed for at least 2 or 3 years, but even that would just be a short-term band-aid.
      </p>

       I sincerely believe this problem is an existential threat to our social structure and it will take criminal investigation and prosecution to fully deal with the issue.

       It's weird because I'm not sure what law they would be breaking by doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there would be a massive public backlash if it ever came to the public's attention. And if what we suspected is true, that certain human users were purposefully stifling and discrediting online citizen investigations into human trafficking, there would almost have to be a charge for that.

       Seditious conspiracy against the United States or conspiracy to foment rebellion if it can be shown that these groups knowingly worked towards unraveling the fabric of society. These activities could even be viewed as an act of war. Forget laws, this is getting existential. This could become a matter of stopping them by force under emergency military powers. This is a legitimate national security risk, and in fact it goes even beyond that to a global security risk.

       The issue I see with that sentiment is the  dismissal legitimate criticism of your argument as shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or only applying scrutiny to people on "the other side".
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I've seen there are shills for both sides and most can't hold a legitimate argument. Most resort to goal post moving, trolling, whatsboutism or even calling you a shill and ending the conversation due to that.

       It really shouldn't even matter if there are "shills." If they make good points, that seems good. And if they make bad points, argue against them using logic and evidence.

       Yeah but if we can paint the opposition as shills or bots, then we can attribute their points as bad by default and it helps to avoid questioning our own inherent biases.

       I'll give you several reasons why we should be worried about shilling and 1 solution to all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person is paid to shill and they have 20 accounts, they can downvote or upvote anything, which means they can censor or artificially increase the number of views a post or comment receives. Remember Reddit's favorite scientist?
       <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8qx57x/reddits-favorite-scientist-just-got-banned-for-cheating-the-site">
        Redditor Unidan was caught using six separate accounts to destroy competing posts.
       </a>
       Now imagine the resources behind large corporations, presidential campaigns, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person is paid to shill and they have 20 accounts, they can create a false consensus on specific threads, fooling the users into thinking that something is settled or that there is nothing to a claim. They can harass or keep specific users busy with a flood of replies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution to all of this is simply
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=jcs6movv&amp;amp;sh=1a7eaccb">
        spreading information about shills
       </a>
       . If users are knowledgeable about how widespread and effective the practice is, they might spend a little more time looking at the comments at the bottom of a controversial thread. They might look further into a claim and fact check if they sense that a thread could be manipulated. They might stop caring that a comment has 1,000 upvotes and gold, and instead evaluate the comment based on the sources and argument presented.

       What I am taking away from your post is that you don't know for a fact that shills on both sides exist. Is that accurate?
      </p>
      <p>
       We know for a fact that numerous countries, corporations, presidential campaigns, and even small businesses engage in the practice of shilling online. This has all been written about in the mainstream media, although they have never spent enough time on the topic or have given their readers enough information.

       A lot of real users push fake news and have toxic agendas too. Fake News can be countered with evidence and logic. And if someone is just being a bully or spouting nonsense, downvote and move on.

       I think most people who get dismissed as shills are just poorly educated Americans (some with college degrees) who don't really know or understand how to make an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like 1984, but instead of simplifying language, they have simplified modes of rhetoric and analysis. Which is why, I think memes are so popular even though the mass of them are pretty idiotic.
      </p>
      <p>
       What people really find suspicious is when you can hold two countervailing and contradictory opinions simultaneously like America is a great country and America is the most evil country in the history of the world. These are two things I believe and argue about. Sometimes within the same argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see this shit all the time when the most cliche, most straightforward kind of propagandistic truism underlies a news story or a heavily gilded reddit comment. People want to believe and are primed to believe that reality is simple, when the truth is very much the opposite. And I'm not even talking in a conspiratorial sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's that ever pervasive sense of certitude, whether it be science or politics or economics or medicine, when reality is still a big fucking mystery and contemplating that mystery is a worthwhile endeavor, instead of pretending like we have anything close to being figured out.

       I think with your america is a great country but also evil. It might help to think of it like this; America is great for a country, as great as a country has been so far, but even so it is still greater at destruction, subterfuge, counterfeit, manipulation, etc. Etc. Because our world does not have a history of great countries who also acted great. It has a history of dark wars. So when weighing something on a scale it is important to note that we havent reached what a pinnacle society can be. A d may never. But at this point and time it is one of the great ones to live in.

       It's absolutely going on for both sides. I think the main thing to remember is that it can be difficult to work out the origin. Straight up would not be surprised to find out that Russia has bots screwing with both sides of politics in the US, just in different ways.

       I got a pm from what I imagine is a shill, telling me how I'm ruining the subreddit or something of that nature. The shills are everywhere and this subreddit is one of the few places on reddit left where people can truly speak their mind. But people are constantly harassing the one mod we have left and no one is sticking up for him the way they should.

       I'm always wary of any cult of personality types like Jordan Peterson. Though I do specifically agree with his point that freedom of speech should never be legally restricted by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, regarding your point about discrimination, I think it is worth pointing out and challenging all forms of oppression; especially its main purveyor, the state, which uses bigotry and hate to consolidate its own power through divide and conquer. Many in academia get caught up into a specific form of oppression, pigeonhole themselves as victims, etc. that they end up becoming pawns of the state and elite that they claim to be against - or perhaps they're more so controlled opposition. This is kind of where I see Jordan Peterson as well, but I could be wrong since as I said I purposely avoid cultish personalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think it's obvious that there is no money or power truly pushing toward marxist ideology; the only goal is to increase and secure the power of the already powerful elite and state actors. The true goal is totalitarianism.

       I agree with this, and we get stuck in the trenches too often trying to simplify our arguments that we use easy terms, Marxist ideology is being used to collect dumb people however.

       I feel you would appreciate the living ads episode in south park, or community. Definitely though, scarier to think that someone co uld possibly exist like that in real life. A paid opinion. A walking, breathing ad.

       The hole explanation of what is occurring sums up very nicely what has been bothering me to the point I have been non stop commenting long drawn out diatribes trying to explain to my ability how glaringly obvious the narrative is fed to those who will swallow it.. On both sides. I can get wrapped up in shooting down the easy target of lunatic liberal comments and the very obvious commenter who seems obsessed with hating trump. These easy targets are what probably help create and fuel the second growing hive mind of right wing crazy people who swallow there narrative from there news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody who falls into this and is spending vast amounts of time shilling their teams narrative,and the ppl who use dehumanizing generalizing terms for the opposing side of brainwashed political obsessed people, the people who do this regularly no matter which side of the fence are a very dangerous and possible sought after random group of individuals. I'm sure bots account for a portion of what i have been rambling about...but the actual people who are going deep into this to the obviously intended point of it which is blind hatred towards the other party. Its fucking crazy obvious that's the purpose of how our news is layed out for us. Those who fall into it all the way could be a valuable commodity to ill intentions

       Excuse my poor use of language if that is the bullshit you refer to.. Unless you take issue with me calling out the number of ridiculous posts on political reddit made by SOMETHING. An alarming amount of people seem to really be overly enthusiastic about there party's upcoming vindication. Are these people for real? Why so many emotionally driven ridicule generalize "all democrats" or "all trump supporters".  Are these people as fucking brainwashed in real life as they appear when in the echo chambers of there own subreddit or media platforms or newsoursce

       There is a big misunderstood that for awakining "internet" is necessary, as it is true that as a tool to get information it is very powerful and useful, it is not neccesary for people to awake, it is not some big "movement" in an internet forum, is something beyond the digital world, that will not and frankly cannot be stopped, because it is something natural and as consequence it will happen no matter what, the difference relies on who "tunes"  into this new reality, that is all this is, all you need is the desire to live in a better world and take action towards that, even if it is as simple as a change of attitude

       This just is what it is. I think it's incredibly important to not only know that this is a propaganda war, but that the same tactic is being used by groups right here in the US. It's not just Russia. It's being employed EVERYONE. Do not allow them to censor messages, ideas, and movements regardless of where some may claim they are coming from.
