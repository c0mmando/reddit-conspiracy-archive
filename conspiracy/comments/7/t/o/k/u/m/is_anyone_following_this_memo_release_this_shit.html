<p>Really, you got a source on the Times editorial policy with anon sources, because <a href="https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/new-york-times-anoymous-sources-policy-public-editor/">this article</a> shows that you are making shit up as fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It requires one of three top editors to review and sign off on articles that depend primarily on information from unnamed sources – particularly those that “hinge on a central fact” from such a source, Mr. Purdy told me last week in an interview. The editors are Mr. Baquet, Mr. Purdy, and Susan Chira, another deputy executive editor.</p>

<p>Those stories, Mr. Purdy said, are potential “journalistic I.E.D.s.” In other words, they may be bombs that explode unexpectedly and damage The Times and its credibility. Given that, they require special oversight, and a process that may result in slowing down before publishing.</p>

<p>The policy also requires any other use of anonymous sources to be approved by a desk head – for example, the ranking culture, metro or international editor – or that person’s immediate deputy. It also “underscores what has been our policy”: that an editor must know the identity of an unnamed source.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the NY Times just requires a main editor or a desk head to sign off on the use of anon sources. There&#39;s no explicit or public procedure on how they verify what an anon source says is true.</p>

<p>So please tell me some other fevered fantasy bullshit and make more disingenuous arguments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i reckon it&#39;ll show what&#39;s being advertised.  that there was a concerted effort within the establishment to get dirt on Trump.  whether this was part of a larger psyop to set Trump up as &quot;an official (wink wink) outsider&quot; to enable a scarier agenda, who knows.  seems like that to me given the incompetence of the opposition.  one would hope the ethos enshrined in the constitution and amendments was one fully understood by americans, but given the slide into tolerance of the abuse of nonconformists one wonders if it&#39;s mostly forgotten.  let&#39;s hope not.  a place that respects individual non-conformity is a noble goal to achieve for humanity.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>During an interview on Fox News Sunday, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) discussed a classified memo prepared by the Republicans on the House Oversight Committee. Gowdy is pushing for the memo to be released so the public can see what role the Steele Dossier played in the FBI&#39;s investigation into the Trump campaign. Democrats on the committee oppose releasing the memo.</p>

<p>Wallace asked about the memo: &quot;The House Intelligence Committee is expected to vote this week on whether to release this four-page memo that you had a big hand in writing, that alleges abuse and bias inside the FBI and Justice Dept. As I discussed with Marc Short, the Washington Post is reporting this morning that the president wants to have the memo released. Do you agree with that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do, I&#39;m sorry we&#39;re at this point,&quot; Gowdy replied. &quot;This memo is nothing but a distilling, reducing of thousands of pages of documents provided to us by the [DOJ and FBI]. So there is nothing in this memo that the Bureau is not already aware of.&quot;</p>

<p>Grassley, Graham Send Batch of Letters Related to Potential Political Influence on FBI</p>

<p>Jan 26, 2018</p>

<p>WASHINGTON – As part of their ongoing oversight efforts to ensure that the FBI’s law enforcement activities are free of improper political influence, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) yesterday sent six letters seeking information and documents regarding Christopher Steele’s work on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary for America. The letters seek information and documents relating to those political organizations’ knowledge of and involvement in Mr. Steele’s work and his reported interactions with the FBI while he was working on behalf of these political organizations.  The letters were sent to:</p>
