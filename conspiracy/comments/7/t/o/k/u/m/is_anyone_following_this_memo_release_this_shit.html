       here's the link to the first time he shows the memo and releases it. I don't watch info Wars, but I assume you can find the updates in a repeated video from this one.

       Like that they straight up wiretapped Trump Towers with the FISA courts. There's a pretty good video I just saw that has literally every single talk show host giving him so much shit when he tweeted that out, and it turns out he was most likely 100% right.
      </p>

       Idk, I'm still trying to remain partial about it all. It's certainly an exciting time, but I'm not trying to get swept up with the info Wars hysteria.

       Mueller has nothing on "Russian collusion". His report will fully exonerate Trump, much to the disappointment of those hoping for a Deep State coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are parallel investigations currently ongoing that the media is largely ignoring. The Nunez memo and the OIG report will be damning and the political fallout is going to be a joy to watch, due to the complete delusion some people are under.

       I hope you realize this was an investigation into foreign interference into the election. Not into Donald Trump specifically. The only few people were arrested were for lying or in manafort's case wasn't even during the election. You think if they had something they'd be in a rush to remove him?

       It's my conclusion from researching this like crazy. You can read the dossier and the testimony online.  There are plenty of reddit, voat, and YouTube users who post
       <em>
        primary
       </em>
       sources and analyze fairly objectively, but you should always do so on your own as well.

       There are a ton of primary sources you can read and corroberate yourself. The "Dossier" ,the DNI report, Glenn Simpson tesitmony, Senator Grassley's letters to Podesta, Debbie Schultz, etc. Theres even a report detailing the fact that the Obama admin had been repeatedly denied a FiSA warrant and proceeded to obtain one using fraudulent information. It's all out there, it's just being ignored.

       Nothing in the dossier was proven false, which I imagine is why they're trying to ignore the content and just focusing on its origins and attacking the FBI.

       It is being speculated that the memo lists specific people involved in a scandal to exonerate Hillary Clinton. Extreme favoritism towards the person being interviewed and tried. Admittance to guilt of using external email servers to discuss a case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paying for a Dossier that they used as evidence to plant mics in Trump tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a lot of speculation right now. We will see when the memo is released. The texts between the FBI agents are really not great.

       If you can't see the difference between the NY Times, for instance, publishing a story that's anonymous confirmed by 4 sources close to the story and someone posting a graphic online, anonymously, claiming with absolutely no proof that X happened......

       Really, you got a source on the Times editorial policy with anon sources, because
       <a href="https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/new-york-times-anoymous-sources-policy-public-editor/">
        this article
       </a>
       shows that you are making shit up as fact.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It requires one of three top editors to review and sign off on articles that depend primarily on information from unnamed sources – particularly those that “hinge on a central fact” from such a source, Mr. Purdy told me last week in an interview. The editors are Mr. Baquet, Mr. Purdy, and Susan Chira, another deputy executive editor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those stories, Mr. Purdy said, are potential “journalistic I.E.D.s.” In other words, they may be bombs that explode unexpectedly and damage The Times and its credibility. Given that, they require special oversight, and a process that may result in slowing down before publishing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The policy also requires any other use of anonymous sources to be approved by a desk head – for example, the ranking culture, metro or international editor – or that person’s immediate deputy. It also “underscores what has been our policy”: that an editor must know the identity of an unnamed source.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So the NY Times just requires a main editor or a desk head to sign off on the use of anon sources. There's no explicit or public procedure on how they verify what an anon source says is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please tell me some other fevered fantasy bullshit and make more disingenuous arguments.

       Yes the NBC associate would be the "primary" source. I believe this went around during the election big time. It was alleged to be an insider NBC e-mail between colleagues and got leaked. That's as far as we've gotten to verifying the source. So yeah, still iffy.

       i reckon it'll show what's being advertised.  that there was a concerted effort within the establishment to get dirt on Trump.  whether this was part of a larger psyop to set Trump up as "an official (wink wink) outsider" to enable a scarier agenda, who knows.  seems like that to me given the incompetence of the opposition.  one would hope the ethos enshrined in the constitution and amendments was one fully understood by americans, but given the slide into tolerance of the abuse of nonconformists one wonders if it's mostly forgotten.  let's hope not.  a place that respects individual non-conformity is a noble goal to achieve for humanity.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During an interview on Fox News Sunday, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) discussed a classified memo prepared by the Republicans on the House Oversight Committee. Gowdy is pushing for the memo to be released so the public can see what role the Steele Dossier played in the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign. Democrats on the committee oppose releasing the memo.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wallace asked about the memo: "The House Intelligence Committee is expected to vote this week on whether to release this four-page memo that you had a big hand in writing, that alleges abuse and bias inside the FBI and Justice Dept. As I discussed with Marc Short, the Washington Post is reporting this morning that the president wants to have the memo released. Do you agree with that?"
       </p>
       <p>
        "I do, I'm sorry we're at this point," Gowdy replied. "This memo is nothing but a distilling, reducing of thousands of pages of documents provided to us by the [DOJ and FBI]. So there is nothing in this memo that the Bureau is not already aware of."

        WASHINGTON – As part of their ongoing oversight efforts to ensure that the FBI’s law enforcement activities are free of improper political influence, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) yesterday sent six letters seeking information and documents regarding Christopher Steele’s work on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary for America. The letters seek information and documents relating to those political organizations’ knowledge of and involvement in Mr. Steele’s work and his reported interactions with the FBI while he was working on behalf of these political organizations.  The letters were sent to:

       Do you have a point in repeating what Trump's lackeys have to say?
      </p>
      <p>
       They're so desperately trying to get people to care about their memo. The Democrats want to see the memo but also what it's based on. Otherwise they could just write anything they wanted to.

       No, you're making shit up. I can't really blame you because you may have seen a headline that claimed Schiff said people wouldn't understand the memo. I remember the article because it said Schiff was desperate and there was a cheesy picture with a graphic that said "panic mode" despite no panic at all, just wanting to give people the full story and not just the Republican story.

       So, they should
       <em>
        release everything
       </em>
       . No one should be against seeing the memo, and for them to release as much info about the sources as possible. I have a feeling a lot of what is contained in there has already been leaked out, the memo is merely a summary.

       How long did it take for an unsubstantiated rumor about Trump maybe or maybe not asking about firing Mueller and his counsel maybe or maybe not threatening to quit to make the news? Don't hold your breath. This is gonna be fun.

       It's not unsubstantiated. Even Fox confirmed it after denying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, based on Trump's history, it wouldn't be out of character for him to threaten to fire Mueller because hey, it didn't work with Comey but maybe this time would be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Trump feels innocent and that's why he wanted to fire him.

       The 99 page memo is a precursor for the 4 page Nunes Summary. If you read it (which I have), it shows that NSA data was Willy nilly  being shared by FBI and CIA which was in clear violation. Then goes on to discuss the changes that are being made from that point going forward. The Nunes memo will show.they violated the NSA yet again.

       It's my conclusion from researching this like crazy. You can read the dossier and the testimony online.  There are plenty of reddit, voat, and YouTube users who post
       <em>
        primary
       </em>
       sources and analyze fairly objectively, but you should always do so on your own as well.

       So, they should
       <em>
        release everything
       </em>
       . No one should be against seeing the memo, and for them to release as much info about the sources as possible. I have a feeling a lot of what is contained in there has already been leaked out, the memo is merely a summary.
