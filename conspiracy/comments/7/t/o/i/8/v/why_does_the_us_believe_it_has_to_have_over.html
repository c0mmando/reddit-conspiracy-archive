        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At one point (post World War 2) the US having military bases all over Europe and the Pacific made sense. But now that technology and war has evolved having over 600 military bases world wide seems like a massive waste of money. Not to mention the fact the US has the largest Navy in the world. How does the US government justify so many foreign bases? Aside from maybe the DMZ, where in the world would a true war breakout? The excuse of &quot;Soviets might invade Europe at anytime!!&quot; Ended in the early 90s. </p>

<p>Please someone with more knowledge on this stuff, explain to me why the US has any need for bases outside the US? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good number of these bases had been turned over to the US by Britain when Britain could no longer afford to maintain them.    New bases were placed in strategic countries at the end of WWII.</p>

<p>Russia and China also have strategically located bases.    Its part of geopolitics.    In the case of the US,   the dollar,  up till now the worlds reserve currency,  has helped the US maintain economic dominance.    In effect,  the US military presence and use of force against those unwilling to trade and use the US dollar has helped prop up the value of the dollar,   which otherwise could be worthless and cause domestic problems at home for the US.    So essentially,   these bases are a way of &quot;mining&quot; dollars and supporting predatory US corporations overseas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>99% of these sites were procured long ago, basically for pennies on the dollar. With exchange rates/trading capital- they still mostly pay for themselves. Despite many major setbacks from bad publicity, stupid mistakes, seemingly evil plots - most people know we WILL save them from certain death following a major disaster, and not expect anything in return. I have seen it firsthand,  and can never stop loving this country. Our good guys outnumber the bad, 10 million to 1- and they are relentless. Had to be said.</p>
