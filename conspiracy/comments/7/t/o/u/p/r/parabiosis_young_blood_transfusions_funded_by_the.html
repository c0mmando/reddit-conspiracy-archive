        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was trying to do some light reading about gawker.com and how Peter Theil secretly funded third party lawsuits against Gawker.</p>

<p>When wouldn’t you know it, I was lead down another rabbit hole about “Parabiosis”. 
It was alleged that Theil went through $40K a quarter on these “young blood transfusions” on Gawker.  </p>

<p>Upon further research, I came across an article by INC about Peter Theil and this company in Monterey California called “Ambrosia” <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/peter-thiel-young-blood.html">https://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/peter-thiel-young-blood.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com">https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com</a>  </p>

<p>The “Young Blood Treatment” website gives me the creeps. Check out the picture with their “locations” it’s weird. Right? 
I also came across this article: 
<a href="https://gizadeathstar.com/2017/01/parabiosis-and-the-elite/">https://gizadeathstar.com/2017/01/parabiosis-and-the-elite/</a> </p>

<p>In 1957,the “parabiosis study” was done with grants from the Office of Naval Research in conjunction with none other than the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>

<p>I would be very interested if anyone has gone down this rabbit hole and has more research or insight on Parabiosis. </p>

<p>Very interesting the connection between the military and the Rockefellers.  As well as </p>

<p>“the Department of Energy at the Oakridge National Laboratories in Tennessee was sponsoring research into the genetic basis of a list - and a very odd list it is, too! - of traits, from genetic predispositions to alcoholism, perfect musical pitch, tongue curling, ear wiggling, and homosexuality! One wonders indeed what any of these things have to do with energy, and why one would be researching them at a nuclear energy laboratory.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. 🙏🏼🤘🏼</p>

<p>People have been scoffing long enough at such issues like Pedogate, Dyncorp Clinton Foundation/Haiti as “crazy conspiracy theories”, without blinking an eye. </p>

<p>I understand that the “adrenochrome”, “Luciferian” and mass of powerful pedophiles is too much for some. </p>

<p>I’m hoping that this information-about “parabiosis”, in MSM and the Ambrosia website will show “non-believers” that if this has been going on since the late fifties, what else is possible? </p>

<p>Stay safe, awake &amp; aligned🙏🏼🤘🏼</p>

<p>So, clearly this shit has been around since the mid to late 1500’s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Public info is scarce.  It appears that the blood, see link at bottom of post, must come from a VERY young person.  In fact, that person would have to be so young, and therefore small in body size, that both factors would prohibit voluntary donation.</p>

<p>So the virile young man on the bike on Ambrosia&#39;s web site wouldn&#39;t be a suitable donor.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com">https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com</a></p>

<p>I am troubled by the fact that the young man with the bike is meant to give you an image of the average donor.  In fact, his blood wouldn&#39;t be suitable.  Think of how it would play if they had a toddler or two on the website?</p>

<p>So where did he blood from the US Naval Study come from?  Where does Ambrosia&#39;s blood come from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve read countless site on this and they either say 16-25 for the “plasma” donors or they are vague about age (young) .  MIT, Harvard Stem Cell, etc </p>

<p>I agree with you completely about the misleading photo. </p>

<p>It would make sense the younger the “donor”, the “purer the blood”.  I.E. no Smoking, drinking, no drugs, bad nutrition. </p>

<p>Where IS the blood coming from?<br/>
For starters, the “third world” countries such as Haiti. 
After a natural disaster? Like an Earthquake?</p>

<p>Red Cross &amp; Clinton Foundation swooped in under the guise of assistance and rebuilding, </p>

<p>Who better to collect plasma/ young blood than the Red Cross???(formerly run by Elizabeth Dole, Elite)</p>

<p>Clinton assisted and helped pay for Laura Silsby’s lawyer for her child trafficking charges,</p>

<p>(Digressing: Laura Silsby Gayler who now works with Alert Sense who works with AMBER ALERT).</p>

<p>What if the children were for blood and NOT just pedo shit?  I recently came across an article about HRC having blood transfusions. Which is plausible considering she was sick and well, what we are discussing right now (parabiosis).</p>

<p>Also, there’s the “Adrenochrome” theory as well.</p>

<p>adrenochrome? In scientific terms, it is a chemical that is produced in the human body when adrenaline (epinephrine) oxidizes. How is the chemical extracted? A potential victim is terrorized, thus increasing the amount of adrenaline that is flowing through their body. They are then killed and the adrenochrome is collected with a needle and syringe from the base of the back of their neck and spinalcolumn. Once collected, the chemical can be sold on the black market at exorbitant prices.</p>

<p>Besides Ambrosia, my friend found another company in San Carlos(?) CA,
Alkahest </p>

<p>Alkahest’s investors? 
Barcelona, Spain-based Grifol 
Grifols, established in 1940, operates in more than 100 countries worldwide</p>

<p>She also came across this article: </p>

<p><a href="https://blog.bulletproof.com/parabiosis-the-really-weird-biohack-for-a-younger-brain-and-body/">https://blog.bulletproof.com/parabiosis-the-really-weird-biohack-for-a-younger-brain-and-body/</a> </p>

<p>“Based on these speculations, some people are actually stockpiling the blood of twenty-somethings because it might make old people younger.[6] 
(Watch out, millennials) </p>

<p>So it looks like parabiosis really may be able to reverse aging and sharpen cognitive function. 
That’s why I borrow my children’s blood while they sleep.
Joking again. In reality, it’s possible to get the good stuff in young blood without actually harvesting it from young people. Here’s what the beneficial compounds do for you, and where you can find them.”</p>

<p>I like to joke, but the “Watch Out Millenials” and “I borrow my children’s blood” gave me the creeps. </p>
