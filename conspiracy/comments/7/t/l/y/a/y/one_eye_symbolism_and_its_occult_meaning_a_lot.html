        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So there have been lot&#39;s of links/posts about one eye symbolism. The usual associations are Illuminati, Occult, Antichrist etc. </p>

<p>The Vigilant Citizen website is almost completely devoted to this topic. I like their site and symbolic pics of the months does a good job of collecting all the imagery and putting it on display.</p>

<p>But what does it really mean?</p>

<p>To understand this, all you have to do is think about what one eye would have meant to the people that came up with the symbol in the first place. As usual, it&#39;s not literally about some guy with one eye. </p>

<p>Having one eye means a couple of things. First, you have a narrower field of vision. But more importantly, it means you have <strong>no depth perception</strong>. </p>

<p>Think about what that would have meant to a hunter or a shepherd. You can still see, but can&#39;t really tell how far away something is. A person with two eyes has depth perception, so they can see better.</p>

<p>Now take that concept and apply it to the abstract world of ideas, opinions and knowledge. Someone who always has to choose a side or disagree with a new idea has the mental equivalent of one eye.</p>

<p>Someone who can &quot;see things&quot; from different angles or even just see things from the &quot;other side&#39;s&quot; point of view has both eyes open (mentally speaking).</p>

<p>This is the real reason why you see such a big effort to get people to take sides and fight each other. Cancellation of opposing efforts and nobody can see the whole picture. </p>

<p>The same principle lies behind every/any group that tries to convince you they&#39;re right and any other point of view is wrong. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s political, social or religious. If this is how they roll, they&#39;re part of the 
&quot;one eye system&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a great read. It makes sense. My opinion is that the one eye is multi-faceted symbolism and this is very likely to be one of the aspects. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve studied readings arguing it mocks the third-eye , /all seeing eye, /and/or the pineal gland .</p>

<p>The enlightened/elite utilize it but most of the world population does not use it, or it has been blocked. Therefore their critical thinking has been eroded and are easier to control. </p>

<p>Al-Masih ad-Dajjal (Arabic: المسيح الدجّال‎ Al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl, &quot;the false messiah, liar, the deceiver&quot;) is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology.[1] He is to appear, pretending to be al-Masih (i.e. the Messiah), before Yawm al-Qiyamah (the Day of Resurrection). He is to be an anti-messianic figure, comparable to the Antichrist in Christian eschatology and to Armilus in medieval Jewish eschatology.</p>

<p>Dajjāl (Arabic: دجال) is an adjective of Syriac origin.[2] It is also a common Arabic superlative form of the root word dajl meaning &quot;lie&quot; or &quot;deception&quot;.[3] Al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl, with the definite article al- (&quot;the&quot;), refers to &quot;the deceiving Messiah&quot;, a specific end-of times deceiver. The Dajjāl is an evil being who will seek to impersonate the true Messiah.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my two cents worth. The dajjal is said to be one-eyed because the one eye that is open is the materialistic eye- his spiritual eye is blind. This symbolises the dajjal&#39;s main agenda which is to deceive humankind into forgetting/disbelieving that the spiritual life or the afterlife does exist and to solely focus on materialism. Look around us, it is happening. Humankind used to be spiritual, but nowadays, everything is off balance. In my humble opinion- I do not think dajjal is human, he is most likely from the djinn-kind/ fire-creature/ aliens/ demons/ reptilians and posseses some otherworldly abilities that will gain him many followers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan has one eye because of his revolt he was damaged by God. He&#39;s back on Earth for a time. He&#39;s trying to cure his brain damage, rewire, in an attempt to become an equal to God. </p>

<p>His hope is AI can level the odds for the final battle in Israel&#39;s Meggido valley, Armageddon. His plans include the use of military resources, technology, the internet and dupes who follow the &quot;illuminati&quot; path.
Still, he&#39;s going to be put down like a mad dog along with the hocus pocus believers of claptrap like the above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note these facts: God is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. Your grasp of &quot;time&quot; is not the same as the heavenly realm. In fact his statement on the mountain: &quot;I am that I <em>will be</em>&quot; is more accurate. Also Satan is at its root Shatan, Aramaic for &quot;I resist&quot;. Appropriate, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p>

<p>To be accurate it was Eve who stomped on his head after the fall while he was in his serpent form. As we&#39;ve been informed, there is nothing new under the sun: <strong>It has all happened before!</strong> Thus, realize you are at the very end of the saga, the dawn of Revelations. As a result, you&#39;d better figure out which team you are on.</p>

<p>To be is to be perceived. Berkeley believed that nothing exterior to the mind was real unless it was perceived by something. So if we were to blink everything in reality was no longer real.</p>

<p>He used the Eye of Providence as an explanation of how things seemed to stay consistent even after we weren&#39;t perceiving them directly.</p>
