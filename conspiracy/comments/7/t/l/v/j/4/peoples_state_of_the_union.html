       This is outrageous to me. What do these rich celebrities know about the daily struggles of the middle class and the poor?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They live in world where money isn’t an issue. They can have whatever they want whenever they want it. 99% of the population doesn’t have anywhere near as much money as them. Everything they know or think they know about the lower classes comes from the dishonest media.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the same celebrities who advocate women’s rights yet sat back while Weinstein sexually assaulted women for years and said nothing because they are afraid of losing their fortunes and status. And god knows what other horrible Hollywood secrets they know and would never dare to make public.
      </p>
      <p>
       And these cowards are gonna lecture me on the state of our union?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sure someone will point this out... I know trump is rich celebrity too, but actions speak louder than words.

       "The people's" is an old communist revolutionary term that described laborers.  They proved for us that these ideas lead to hundreds of millions of deaths and universal equality in infinite suffering.

       And thank god he doesn’t have the same liberal policies that most of them would enact were they elected. Like I said in the post, actions speak louder than words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s see here...
      </p>
      <p>
       he’s already created over 2 million jobs in the first year as president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Huge tax cuts (which no democrat would ever do) which has already resulted in 250 major companies giving their employees higher wages and bonuses.

       There are plenty more examples too

       250 major companies buying good PR for relative chump change. Also, the economy doesn't start and stop whenever a new POTUS is inaugurated. It kind of just keeps rolling along. There isn't any Trump-specific major legislation you can attribute those jobs to. But thanks for letting us all know you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.

       Are you telling me that if you were given a $2 raise and a bonus you’d reject it because it’s chump change? Don’t be ridiculous, this helps people a lot. It’s far better than the $0 extra dollars people would get if there weren’t any tax cuts. Not to mention this extra money these companies have to give to their employees comes straight out of taxes that would have otherwise gone to the government.

       There doesn’t have to be legislation to create jobs. Trump has negotiated with multiple companies to keep factories and production in the United States and not overseas. MSM would never tell you that though. Also Now there is legislation to attribute to any future jobs.

       We gotta keep watching him. Signing FISA was a mistake. Perhaps he did it as part of his 64 dimensional chess, idunno.

       Most "rich celebrities" grew up as poor or middle class. Just cause they worked their way up doesn't mean they aren't allowed to have a voice. If you don't like rich out of touch people I hope that you wouldn't want to be lectured by any of the politicians currently running DC.

       I thought about that before I posted but I really don’t think it’s relevant. They’re rich now, so they are gonna do everything in their power to keep their riches. Nobody wants to be poor. Especially not when you’re used to having whatever you want.

       The whole reason this is even happening isn’t because they care about you and me, it’s because they hate trump, and want him out of office. Not because they’re legitimately concerned about us.  And it just so happens that publicly hating on trump brings you into the spotlight and makes you look good to liberal Hollywood. If they publicly came out in support of trump it would be a disaster for their careers. It’s just another pathetic attempt to rally Americans against trump.

       And no I would not want to be lectured by any DC politicians either.

       what you're talking about as the "People's State of the Union? No sign that there are any rich celebrities involved.  Even if that's not what you're going off of, concentrating only on a few celebrities just plays into the elite's game.  The media only shows the voice of the rich, so you're getting a very distorted image of that side of the argument.  Its long been a practice of the corporate media to try to discredit movements and philosophies by characterizing them only through the voices of the infinitesimal fraction of their supporters who are obnoxious elites, rather than the vast majority who are unacknowledged normal people.
