<p>Nothing. </p>

<p>They live in world where money isn’t an issue. They can have whatever they want whenever they want it. 99% of the population doesn’t have anywhere near as much money as them. Everything they know or think they know about the lower classes comes from the dishonest media. </p>

<p>These are the same celebrities who advocate women’s rights yet sat back while Weinstein sexually assaulted women for years and said nothing because they are afraid of losing their fortunes and status. And god knows what other horrible Hollywood secrets they know and would never dare to make public.</p>

<p>And these cowards are gonna lecture me on the state of our union? </p>

<p>Fuck off. </p>

<p>I’m sure someone will point this out... I know trump is rich celebrity too, but actions speak louder than words. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Are you telling me that if you were given a $2 raise and a bonus you’d reject it because it’s chump change? Don’t be ridiculous, this helps people a lot. It’s far better than the $0 extra dollars people would get if there weren’t any tax cuts. Not to mention this extra money these companies have to give to their employees comes straight out of taxes that would have otherwise gone to the government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There isn&#39;t any Trump-specific major legislation you can attribute those jobs to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There doesn’t have to be legislation to create jobs. Trump has negotiated with multiple companies to keep factories and production in the United States and not overseas. MSM would never tell you that though. Also Now there is legislation to attribute to any future jobs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But thanks for letting us all know you have no idea what the fuck you&#39;re talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about that before I posted but I really don’t think it’s relevant. They’re rich now, so they are gonna do everything in their power to keep their riches. Nobody wants to be poor. Especially not when you’re used to having whatever you want. </p>

<p>The whole reason this is even happening isn’t because they care about you and me, it’s because they hate trump, and want him out of office. Not because they’re legitimately concerned about us.  And it just so happens that publicly hating on trump brings you into the spotlight and makes you look good to liberal Hollywood. If they publicly came out in support of trump it would be a disaster for their careers. It’s just another pathetic attempt to rally Americans against trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is <a href="https://usdac.us/psotu/">this</a> what you&#39;re talking about as the &quot;People&#39;s State of the Union? No sign that there are any rich celebrities involved.  Even if that&#39;s not what you&#39;re going off of, concentrating only on a few celebrities just plays into the elite&#39;s game.  The media only shows the voice of the rich, so you&#39;re getting a very distorted image of that side of the argument.  Its long been a practice of the corporate media to try to discredit movements and philosophies by characterizing them only through the voices of the infinitesimal fraction of their supporters who are obnoxious elites, rather than the vast majority who are unacknowledged normal people.</p>
