        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know the Earth is flat.</p>

<p>What do you know, and what do you believe?</p>

<p>There is no scientific evidence that proves the Earth is a ball.</p>

<p>There are no experiments to show any curvature or movement, and gravity is a theory that has never been proven.</p>

<p>There is no ISS. It is a puppet show just like the moon landings.</p>

<p>It is and was a Hollywood production.</p>

<p>NASA photos and videos are all computer generated propaganda.</p>

<p>&quot;Space might be the final frontier but its made in a Hollywood basement&quot; - Red Hot Chili Peppers <em>Californication</em></p>

<p>You probably think that there are men and women walking upside down underneath you on the other curvy side of Earth, due to gravity of course.</p>

<p>So tell me, is that a belief or knowledge?</p>

<p>Have you seen people walking upside down and right side up from your viewpoint on the globe of Earth? </p>

<p>My guess is no, because you would need to be in space to see that.</p>

<p>And very few people go to space...</p>

<p>You probably think that water can stick to a ball.</p>

<p>Is that a belief or knowledge?</p>

<p>Have you ever witnessed water clinging to a spherical object?</p>

<p>I would guess no.</p>

<p>You probably think that gravity holds us to the ground because of the size of the Earth.</p>

<p>Is that a belief or knowledge?</p>

<p>Can you prove that mass attracts mass?</p>

<p>It is <em>still</em> unproven, so I will guess no.</p>

<p>Have you ever witnessed something falling?</p>

<p>My guess is yes, you have. That happens often.</p>

<p>That would be knowledge, not a belief, correct?</p>

<p>Because it is first hand evidence.</p>

<p>Now, what is causing that?</p>

<p>Is it gravity?</p>

<p>You may believe that, but you have no proof of that.</p>

<p>Yet, again and again, I see people claiming that because an apple falls from a tree, the Earth must be a globe.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Mix vinegar and baking soda.</p>

<p>You will get a repeatable, testable, and measurable reaction.</p>

<p>Thats knowledge. Thats real science. Thats fact.</p>

<p>Now go take a photo of the globe you probably believe in, or even just the curve.</p>

<p>You will yield no results from such an endeavor, so you must trust secondhand information.</p>

<p>Thats a belief. Thats faith science.</p>

<p>Most science about the globe, are theories we are expected to be believed, with no evidence.</p>

<p>Beliefs and theories.... Hmmm...</p>

<p>Whatever happened to knowledge and truth?</p>

<p>I know the Earth is flat.</p>

<p>Nope.  </p>

<p>I would really love for you to provide some evidence that the earth is actually flat.  </p>

<p>In the meantime, please explain to me how the sun sets on a flat earth yet remains in the sky on other parts of the planet. Explain to me why ships and distant objects sink down below the horizon. Explain to be how solar and lunar eclipses happen on a flat earth. Explain to me how I can take a flight from Johannesburg to Sydney on a flat earth.</p>

<p>&quot;Land tourism does exist, and a permit is required. The vast majority of visitors will arrive by commercial ship or helicopter, and the tour operator is responsible for obtaining the necessary permits. You may, of course, need a visa for the country where your tour is departing from...Due to Antartica&#39;s extreme physical conditions and remoteness, only a few dozen yachts make the trip each year, and there are special yachting guidelines for Antarctic cruises.&quot;</p>

<p>Except it&#39;s not near its vanishing point. Does that ship look like its about to suddenly disappear? Why would a vanishing point make only the bottom of the ship disappear?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This finite distance to the vanishing point  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is not a finite distance to a vanishing point. As you explained, a vanishing point is based on perspective. If you have really shitty eyes, the vanishing point of a distant object will be a lot closer. If you have super zoom vision, it&#39;s going to be a lot farther away.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the boat recedes into the distance its hull is gradually and perceptively appearing closer and closer to the surface of the sea.  </p>

<p>No! As you can clearly see in the pictures and videos I have provided, the bottom of the boat completely disappears over the horizon.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At a far off point the hull of the ship is so close to the sea&#39;s surface that it is impossible for the observer to tell ocean from hull.  </p>

<p>No! Same reason. That&#39;s a load of shit.    </p>

<p>Please explain to me why something being farther away would magically make the bottom of it vanish.</p>

<p>Huh? What the human eye can see here is irrelevant. We&#39;re talking about the camera. The ship is clearly not near the vanishing point of the camera, as you can see the ship quite clearly. If the ship was floating a bit in the air, you could see the entire ship in detail. The only limiting factor at this range appears to be atmospheric disturbances.  </p>

<p>If the ship took up a singe pixel in the picture and you could not make out any detail, then it would be near the vanishing point of the camera. It isn&#39;t, so it&#39;s not.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many times I need to explain this to you. You were the one that gave me the definition of vanishing point.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did read it. It isn&#39;t a valid explanation, as I have explained to you over and over again.  </p>

<p>You have <em>still</em> failed to explain to me why a distant object would only disappear from the bottom up, and why the rest of the object would still remain perfectly clear and visible. You say &quot;vanishing points&quot;, but by your own definition, that does not explain it.  You say that it&#39;s because of geometry, but it&#39;s not, as that would mean the entire object would disappear all at once.  </p>

<p>There is no explanation for this other than the earth being round.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is any point in arguing with you at this point. In all my life I have never seen someone in a state of patent denial like you are.

<p>Once again, explain to me why the sea level at one spot would be dozens of feet different than the sea level at a different spot a few miles away.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he masts of the boat had not yet reached vanising point where the ship merges with the horizon line.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, the vanishing point is not some magically defined location. All parts of that boat are (basically) the same distance from the camera. For one part to be disappearing while the other parts stay clearly visible, it would have to be significantly farther away.  </p>

<p>Also, vanishing points to not require a horizon. If you are in a blank, empty void with only one other object, that object will still vanish once it gets far enough away. If you got a good enough camera, it would become visible again. It would be impossible for it to ever be so far away that you can&#39;t just keep zooming in.  </p>

<p>In the case of this boat, it does not matter how much you keep zooming in, as I demonstrated. The bottom of the boat will <em>still</em> be gone.  </p>

<p>As for sea level, that changes due to numerous factors, waves/tides being one of them.</p>

<p>Precise determination of a &quot;mean sea level&quot; is difficult to achieve because of the many factors that affect sea level.[3] Sea level varies quite a lot on several scales of time and space. This is because the sea is in constant motion, affected by the tides, wind, atmospheric pressure, local gravitational differences, temperature, salinity and so forth. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level</a></p>

<p>To sum up, even though the ocean is on a flat plane, it is not a level surface and fluctuates/changes regularly making the ships rise and fall depending on perspective. In one of the vids I provided, you can clearly see this as tge boat bobs up and down with the waves changing it&#39;s height and what is visible given the camera&#39;s zoom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched the videos.    </p>

<p>In the first video, zooming in on the boat does not make it come back, and the movements of the boat as well as other visible waves clearly show that the bottom going away and coming back is mostly due to waves. Thanks for providing more evidence of my point.   </p>

<p>The second one literally just proves my point, so thanks. Also, zooming in on it did not make the bottom suddenly come back.  </p>

<p>On the third video, it&#39;s the same thing. Zooming in did not make the bottom of the lighthouse magically rise back up. The whole thing comes back into frame all at once, which is exactly what you would expect. That&#39;s how vanishing points work.  </p>

<p>Thank you for providing direct evidence against your own point, lmao.</p>

<p>You can hardly complain about me not watching all your stuff. You literally ignore every comment that I make and invent obviously bullshit excuses to explain them.  </p>

<p>The simple truth is that you don&#39;t actually care what the truth is. You only care about what supports your agenda and your view. You completely ignore the overwhelming evidence that the earth is round, pretend that the evidence that the earth is not flat does not exist, and even when you prove your own points wrong multiple times, you still cannot acknowledge error.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t argue with you. Not because you have good arguments, but because you are not someone that it&#39;s possible to argue with. You ignore any and all evidence that goes against what you say.   </p>

<p>You do not care for the truth, and you are a liar.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strange, because I have repeatedly disproven your claims, provided evidence against you, and you ignored it. Your evidence was not logical at all. Your own comments disproved it.  </p>

<p>Think about this. You are claiming that when an object gets far away, the bottom of it will magically vanish. You also claimed that increasing the resolution and zoom of the image with make the bottom magically come back. I gave you images, and you provided images that that was not true.  </p>

<p>Except I did explain. Here you go, lying again. It&#39;s called looming, and it explains it perfectly. The zoom on the lens does not change how much of the buildings would be visible, as you showed yourself.   </p>

<p>There is no curvature and ships/city that &quot;disappear&quot; only do so due to perspective/vanishing point  </p>

<p>I already linked you to a video clearing showing curvature, and as you already demonstrated multiple times, vanishing points do not explain why the bottom of a ship would magically start disappearing while the rest of it remained perfectly visible and not anywhere near vanishing.  </p>

<p>not because of curvature which has been proven over and over again.  </p>

<p>Where was it proven? So far, your videos have only disproved this.  </p>

<p>Explain to me why the buildings at that distance are visible sporadically.<br/>
Explain to me why there is a visible curve to the earth that becomes extremely apparent at around 40,000ft.<br/>
Explain to me why I can take a flight from Johannesburg to Sydney.<br/>
Explain to me why you can see satellites from earth, track them yourself, and even take images that they are taking.<br/>
Explain to me why everything stays on the ground on a flat earth.<br/>
Explain to me how the sun sets on a flat earth, yet remains clearly in the sky elsewhere.<br/>
Explain to me how lunar and solar eclipses happen on a flat earth.<br/>
Explain to me how a flat earth can exist when gravity exists?<br/>
Explain to me why all of the other planets are spherical, and earth is somehow not.<br/>
Explain to me what is holding the flat earth together.<br/>
Explain to me why there are no photos of the edge of the earth.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>The ship disappears due to the vanishing point, which is a matter of perspective. The Flat Earth wiki clearly explains this for anyone willing to listen:</p>

<p>&quot;This finite distance to the vanishing point is what allows ships to shrink into horizon and disappear as their hulls intersect with the vanishing point from the bottom up. As the boat recedes into the distance its hull is gradually and perceptively appearing closer and closer to the surface of the sea. At a far off point the hull of the ship is so close to the sea&#39;s surface that it is impossible for the observer to tell ocean from hull.&quot; - <a href="http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/...ppear">http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/...ppear</a> to sink as they recede past the horizon​ki</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/evidence-for-the-flat-earth-ships-do-not-disappear-over-the-horizon.454885852/">http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/evidence-for-the-flat-earth-ships-do-not-disappear-over-the-horizon.454885852/</a></p>

<p>On the sinking ship, Rowbotham describes a mechanism by which the hull is hidden by the angular limits of perception - the ship will appear to intersect with the vanishing point and become lost to human perception as the hull&#39;s increasingly shallow path creates a tangent on which the hull is so close to the surface of the ocean that the two are indistinguishable. The ship&#39;s hull gets so close to the surface of the water as it recedes that they appear to merge together. Where bodies get so close together that they appear to merge is called the Vanishing Point. The Vanishing Point is created when the perspective lines are angled less than one minute of a degree. Hence, this effectively places the vanishing point a finite distance away from the observer.</p>

<p>Usually it is taught in art schools that the vanishing point is an infinite distance away from the observer, as so:</p>

<p>However, since man cannot perceive infinity due to human limitations, the perspective lines are modified and placed a finite distance away from the observer as so:</p>

<p>This finite distance to the vanishing point is what allows ships to shrink into horizon and disappear as their hulls intersect with the vanishing point from the bottom up. As the boat recedes into the distance its hull is gradually and perceptively appearing closer and closer to the surface of the sea. At a far off point the hull of the ship is so close to the sea&#39;s surface that it is impossible for the observer to tell ocean from hull.</p>

<p>While the sails of the ship may still be visible while the hull is perceptively merged, it&#39;s only a matter of time before it too shrinks into the vanishing point which rests on the surface of the sea and becomes indiscernible from the surface.</p>

<p>We know that this explanation is true because there are reports of half sunken ships restored by looking at them through telescopes.</p>

<p>It has been found that the sinking ship effect effect is purely perceptual, that a good telescope with sufficient zoom will change the observer&#39;s perspective and bring the ship&#39;s hull back in full view. This is not possible if the ship were really behind a &amp;quot;hill of water.&amp;quot; Hence, the effect which is usually thought to prove the earth as a globe really proves it to be a plane.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the first and primary proofs of a Flat Earth. The fact that a telescope can restore a half-sunken ship demonstrates that the ship is not traveling behind a convex earth.</p>

<p>There is their first fatal mistake. There is no &quot;finite distance&quot; to the vanishing point. It depends on the resolution of the camera/eye that is making the observation.</p>

<p>You can see further when you are on top of a tower than when you are at the base because you can see over the horizon. If the &quot;vanishing point&quot; was the cause of your limited range of vision, you would <em>not</em> be able to see further, as distances to objects would be even greater. (I assume you understand how triangles work)</p>

<p>If you believe that there is no finite vanishing point with human eyes, you must have some super human vision. I&#39;m gonna go out on a lim and assume you have a finite ability to see great distances and guess that your ability to see further the higher up you are will improve with a little thing called perspective.</p>

<p>Nope. Doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p><a href="http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width380/img/news_impact/photo/20713457-large.jpg">Here is a photo of a sailing ship passing over the horizon</a></p>

<p>As you can see, the resolution of that photo is more than good enough to see the rigging of the sails (ropes), yet not one part of the hull is visible.</p>

<p>No amount of zooming will bring that hull back into view because the camera&#39;s view of the hull is being blocked by the curvature of the water.</p>

<p>What the flat earth idiots do is find a ship that has <em>not</em> gone over the horizon, then zoom in and out to make it <em>appear</em> to become invisible. The reality is they are simply reducing the resolution of the image so that a ship that is perfectly visible &quot;disappears&quot; and &quot;reappears&quot;.</p>

<p>But if you look closely, you will always see the ship simply becomes more visible... it doesn&#39;t <em>rise</em> above the horizon perfectly visible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget that often used &quot;all the planets are round therefore the earth is round.&quot; A partial truth in that the earth is a circle but there is a difference between a ball and a circle. But back to the &quot;all the planets are round therefore the earth is a round&quot;, using a pool table as an example, all the balls are round, does that mean the pool table is round too? It&#39;s really a simple matter when you get down to it, just because the &quot;planets&quot; are round does not necessarily everything else is round. We know this because it says it is in the Bible. If everything revolved around the sun, how can that be possible if the earth was created first, and the sun and moon were created on the 4th day (Genesis 1.14-19)? Of course this argument is moot for those who don&#39;t believe the Bible.
Cue mocking, laughter, insults, and name-calling for thinking something different than the norm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, God said &quot;let there be light&quot; after he created Earth (Genesis 1.1 &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&quot; Genesis 1.3 &quot;And God said let there be light and there was light.&quot; Genesis 1.5 &quot;God called the light day and the darkness He called night and the evening and the morning were the first day&quot;  then you get to Genesis 1.16 &quot; And God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, He made the stars also And God set them in the firmament of the Heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.&quot;</p>

<p>So according to Genesis 1.1, God created the heaven and the earth, then He said &quot;let there be light&quot; but the two &quot;great lights &quot; , the sun and the moon on the fourth day. 
Earth was created before God said &quot;let there be light&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you can ignore the Bible wholly, that&#39;s your right and your choice. I never said the Bible is science of any kind. And I&#39;m not trying to convince anyone of anything, I gave my own opinion. I also never said I believe the earth is flat, I just have an open mind and don&#39;t like to discard ideas without doing research, which may take years to get all sides to all issues. 
I do know that I have zero faith in NASA, but as its your right to believe the Bible is comparable to Greek mythology,  it&#39;s my right to believe NASA is full of shit. It&#39;s also my right to believe the Bible if I want. ✌</p>

<p>There is no scientific evidence that proves the Earth is a ball. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pure, unadulterated, <em>ignorant</em>, bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are no experiments to show any curvature or movement, and gravity is a theory that has never been proven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go jump off a building and show us how you can fly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are no experiments to show any curvature or movement, and gravity is a theory that has never been proven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there are, and yes it has been.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Space might be the final frontier but its made in a Hollywood basement&quot; - Red Hot Chili Peppers Californication</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You get your science from music lyrics?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So tell me, is that a belief or knowledge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you seen people walking upside down and right side up from your viewpoint on the globe of Earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not... there is a fucking planet in the way. Have you ever seen your great-great grandfather? Does that mean he didn&#39;t exist?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you prove that mass attracts mass?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You probably think that water can stick to a ball.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. And it doesn&#39;t even require gravity. Ever heard the term &quot;surface tension&quot;? Have you ever seen a ball that is dipped in water but remains completely dry when you take it out?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever witnessed something falling?</p>

<p>My guess is yes, you have. That happens often.</p>

<p>That would be knowledge, not a belief, correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. That would be an observation. Knowledge comes from being able to explain the observation. In this case objects fall because of the gravitational attraction of earth. It <em>could</em> have been because the object was stationary but the earth was rising. That hypothesis has been disproved, however.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to understand what &quot;knowledge&quot; is. Maybe that&#39;s why you do so much guessing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet, again and again, I see people claiming that because an apple falls from a tree, the Earth must be a globe.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it does. Gravity is a real phenomena, whether you agree with the cause or not. We observe masses to move toward their combined &#39;center of gravity&#39;. This is an undeniable observation of the universe around us. Given this fact, it is <em>inevitable</em> that any large mass over a certain threshold will be formed into a ball, because every part of the surface will try to move as close to the center of gravity as possible, and the only shape where every part of a surface can be as close to the center of gravity as possible is a sphere.</p>

<p>Regardless of what causes gravity, the fact that it even exists is evidence that the earth is spherical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You will get a repeatable, testable, and measurable reaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jump off a building over and over again. Tell us how many times you fly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now go take a photo of the globe you probably believe in, or even just the curve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s been done. It&#39;s just that idiots like you refuse to believe it and call such photos &quot;fake&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever happened to knowledge and truth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t know either of them if they were right in front of you... because they are, every time the sun rises and sets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know the Earth is flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I know you&#39;re an idiot. I guess we&#39;re even.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would be the purpose of centuries of lies saying it is round?
What is the hidden benefit or horror of a flat earth “they” dont want us to know?
How would history be changed if we had been taught the earth is flat?
You say “prove it” yet provide no proof for your own theories while there is <em>MUCH</em> more evidence showing it is round.</p>

<p>So I wont bother with “facts” and simply ask “why”?</p>

<p>ˈvaniSHiNG ˌpoint/</p>

<p>noun</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the point at which receding parallel lines viewed in perspective appear to converge.</p></li>
<li><p>the point at which something that has been growing smaller or increasingly faint disappears altogether.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The boat has clearly travelled further than the camera can zoom out to capture. Grab a stronger camera, zoom further out, ship comes back into full view.</p>

<p>It matters it is not the same ship as they are potentially different sized ships, different weather/water conditions and time of day/tide, video vs still photograph, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If you sit on the beach and watch a ship until it disappears, then zoom in on it with a pair of binoculars, the ship will pop back into view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p><a href="http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width380/img/news_impact/photo/20713457-large.jpg">Here is a photo of a sailing ship passing over the horizon</a></p>

<p>As you can see, the resolution of that photo is more than good enough to see the rigging of the sails (ropes), yet not one part of the hull is visible.</p>

<p>No amount of zooming will bring that hull back into view because the camera&#39;s view of the hull is being blocked by the curvature of the water.</p>

<p>What the flat earth idiots do is find a ship that has <em>not</em> gone over the horizon, then zoom in and out to make it <em>appear</em> to become invisible. The reality is they are simply reducing the resolution of the image so that a ship that is perfectly visible &quot;disappears&quot; and &quot;reappears&quot;.</p>

<p>But if you look closely, you will always see the ship simply becomes more visible... it doesn&#39;t <em>rise</em> above the horizon perfectly visible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read what I provided, it is clearly explained that the hull is hidden by the angular limits of perception - the ship will appear to intersect with the vanishing point and become lost to human perception as the hull&#39;s increasingly shallow path creates a tangent on which the hull is so close to the surface of the ocean that the two are indistinguishable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also this.</p>

<p>&quot;Land tourism does exist, and a permit is required. The vast majority of visitors will arrive by commercial ship or helicopter, and the tour operator is responsible for obtaining the necessary permits. You may, of course, need a visa for the country where your tour is departing from...Due to Antartica&#39;s extreme physical conditions and remoteness, only a few dozen yachts make the trip each year, and there are special yachting guidelines for Antarctic cruises.&quot;</p>

<p>A one man expedition mighht be tricky but its been done before. A british guy died like 2 years ago trying to recreate a famous expedition. </p>

<p>So what happens when you applied? What was the process like? I of course assume you did to at the very least understand this process. </p>

<p>Can you or can you not show me the 10 mill? Its frustrating that someone would lie about that and not even mention it again when its pointed out to be a lie. </p>
