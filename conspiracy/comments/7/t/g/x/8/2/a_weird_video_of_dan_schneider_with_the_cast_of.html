<p><a href="http://www.danschneider.com/videos/victorious/victorious-video-some-audio-deleted">Dan Schneider’s Behind-the-Scenes | “Victorious” | Cast Audio | Schneider’s Bakery | NickTV on his website </a></p>

<p>I need to point this out before we get started. The title and description on youtube and his website are different. </p>

<p>The title of the video on Danwarp (HIS WEBSITE) is - &quot;Victorious Video! Some Audio Deleted ;)&quot; </p>

<p>The description of the video on Danwarp (HIS WEBSITE) -  &quot;Can you tell what they said when the audio drops out?&quot;</p>

<p>You mean to tell me he&#39;s motivating kids to find out what she said?! For a quick answer she said and I quote - &quot;Lots of sex.&quot; </p>

<p><em>For more about this, read second note below</em></p>

<p>Reading up on all the accusations surrounding Dan Schneider that has been heavily coming to light these last few weeks (well years technically, but everything is really coming to light now), I decided to do some digging on his YouTube channel, DanWarp after seeing someone else post a video from his channel in this thread, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2360675">Here.</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;First note&quot; - out of all the videos I&#39;v watched coming from the channel, there has never been an instance of an audio track being synced to the video (it&#39;s always played externally, either for a run through of the set or of some part of the casts singing). I think this is to take the attention away from the fact that without the music, there would be no sound whatsoever and the casual viewers of Victorious would actually notice the wierd bits of the video. Instead what you see is commenters below the video going crazy over the fact that it&#39;s  a pentatonix-psy mashup.</p>

<p>&quot;Second note&quot; - And right away the first cut audio cut that&#39;s made is when Liz Gillies (Jade on the show) is talking about what happens when Dan puts the video he&#39;s making on the tube (youtube in this case). First she says that every viewer is going to get a personal thumbs up from her. And right after that the video remains but the audio is cut for a few seconds and she mouths &quot;and lots of sex.&quot; She looks down right after saying this.</p>

<p>Then, everything gets kind of awkward and all the cast members look for a way to distract the viewer. They all find a scapegoat in the shape of an extra a few feet away and point to him. Before that though, Avan Jogia (Beck on the show) seems to continue in saying something after he says &quot;All across America, kids -&quot; before Dan cuts out the audio and pans off of him.</p>

<p>&quot;Third Note&quot; - At 1:28, Ariana Grande (I think we all know who she is) explains how when Dan films, she gets very nervous. The 24 year old actress and singer has been filmed a LOT up to that point. Little odd, no?</p>

<p>&quot;Fourth Note&quot; - The video ends with a still photo of Ariana&#39;s smile captured from the video. For all the videos I&#39;ve seen on the Danwarp channel, he&#39;s never ended a video like this. Little creepy.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe that with everything coming out about him, nobody&#39;s thought about checking his website or the videos on his channel on youtube. Just more evidence to put in the smoking gun, people.</p>
