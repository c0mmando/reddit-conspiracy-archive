       Big Money bought the media early in the early 20th century and still controls all its forms today. Media pillars such as The New York Times and NBC were chosen, financed and directed by J.P. Morgan and Rockefeller allies at the CFR.

       So what you're saying is that capitalists utilized their wealth to purchase further capital (the media) which they then leveraged to further their schemes for power?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do these theories always sound so familiar? Oh, probably because socialists talk about this all this time.

      <p>
       Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.

       Since comments like this inevitably draw comments from people obsessed with State Socialism, you don't have to be a Marxist or Stalin to criticize capitalism or offer alternatives. Not all alternatives are state socialism (despite this belief seemingly being engraved in some people's DNA...).

       I guarantee the majority of users here will appreciate what Tucker says of the individualist anarchists. In my opinion, their views are what libertarianism would be were its modern incarnation not twisted to serve the Kochs.

       The Rockefellers are/were not Capitalist, nor is the US. The US has been Marxist/Socialist since 1913, with the establishment of central economic planning, via the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason(s) that Rockefeller (and other tycoons) got away with what they did, was because the government allowed it, via cronyism. Big money got the government to favor them over the competition via regulations.

       They would have little chance in hell accomplishing what they did in an actual Free Market.

       Furthermore, Einstein was a twat and a fraud, who wasn't really even behind his nonsensical theories and discoveries. He was the epitome of a shill and gatekeeper, which would make sense why he would shill for Marxism/Socialism.

        It was at this point - the necessity of striking down monopoly - that came the parting of their ways. Here the road forked. They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, - follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism.
