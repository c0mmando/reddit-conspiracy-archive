<li>The entire media being owned by five+/- large corporations.</li>

<li>Acidification of the oceans.</li>
<li>The slave markets in Libya still haven&#39;t been acknowledged by the media, as far as I know.</li>
<li>well, there were leaked some audios from the brazil&#39;s president being openly corrupt. it was some months ago and he still in the presidency</li>
<li>Super gonorrhea! It’s a mutant strain that is spread via oral sex and is thus far not able to be cured except with extremely powerful, still-being-developed antibiotics.</li>
<li>On July 23rd 2012 a coronal mass ejection crossed Earth&#39;s orbit. It missed us by 9 days.
It would have taken out most of our electronics worldwide and taken us up to 10 years to recover. Bear in mind, electronics means everything from Reddit and TV to our power and water supplies.
I have bought some extra tins of beans just in case.</li>
<li>Soil losing nutrients like phosphorus and magnesium.
Edit* to many grab more attention, the stuff in soil that crops and plants need to grow, is going bye bye.</li>
<li>Penicillin and many anti bacterial treatments are losing much of their effectiveness and will eventually be completely ineffectual.</li>
<li>The potential for honey bee and other pollinator species going extinct. This has catastrophic implications for life as we know it. The warning signs have been there for decades. Human activity is suspected to be the main cause.</li>
<li>Why most college kids are going through insane levels of depression...more than half of the classmates I talk to are on some form of antidepressant</li>
<li>Paracetamol is the number one reason for active liver failure.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1403265/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1403265/</a></li>
<li>Madagascar is currently experiencing a plague. A proper &#39;black death&#39; plague.</li>
<li>Something that I personally think no one is really talking about is how in the states, the education system is woefully outdated. The modern education system doesn&#39;t do much to promote critical thinking skills. Standardized tests that decide funding are the norm, and teachers just teach to those tests, so students just memorize some things here and there. There needs to be a complete revamp of the system; the current one was designed in the 20th century, for the 20th century. But it needs to be designed in the 21st century, for the 21st century. Focus needs to be put on interpreting and processing massive amounts of information, understanding concepts and not formulas, basic logic classes to point out inherent flaws in arguments, basic programming should be a class offered in all high schools nowadays, and god dammit, a fucking basic journalism course to combat propaganda coming at us from all sides.
Navigating the wealth of information out there without these skills being taught is like trying find your way around the pacific ocean on a canoe without an oar. The way we think about education needs to change or society will begin to stagnate.
ETA: To the people blaming the problems with the education system on the side that you don&#39;t agree with: thanks for proving my point.</li>
<li>Farm murders in South Africa</li>
<li>It&#39;s the 1% who cause dissension in our ranks. While we are all calling each other names and protesting each other, they&#39;re laughing all the way to the bank, paying people to do their bidding, passing legislation that hurts all of us but fattens their pockets. And people like you and me, Republican &amp; Democrat, Black &amp; White, Conservative &amp; Liberal, Gay &amp; Straight, are getting fucked over repeatedly.
We need to stop fighting with each other and focus our frustrations where they can benefit all of us. This division is exactly what &quot;they&quot; want. There are 325 million angry people in this country and that terrifies the establishment, but our anger is misplaced. We are distracted.
The truth is - most Republicans aren&#39;t white supremacists, and most Democrats aren&#39;t ultra liberals who are so wrapped up in political correctness, that they say nothing of value for fear of insulting somebody. They&#39;re the outliers. Most of us just want to live and let live.
Can you imagine the change we could enact if 325 MILLION people said enough?
I&#39;m not talking armed revolution. I&#39;m talking about things like $12,000 insurance policies with $7,500 deductibles that still don&#39;t cover jack. If we all said fuck it, and refused to purchase health insurance, the system would collapse on itself and would force change. If we all ordered our medications from Canada for a fraction of what we pay here, the system would collapse. If we all refused Perdue drugs in protest of them flooding the market with oxycodone and decimating our population, Perdue would collapse.
I use health care as an example but it applies everywhere.
There are bigger things at play here than our personal feelings.
Edit: I had the phrase &quot;Wake up sheeple&quot; in here. People with sensitive proclivities took it VERY personal so I took it out so as not to distract the feeble minded from my overall sentiment.</li>
<li>Education and healthcare costs are spiraling out of reach of the common man.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t know if anyone else has mentioned it yet, but Elsagate. There&#39;s a subreddit dedicated to it, r/elsagate.
You know how really young kinds like those mindless videos? Think something in the style of Teletubbies: no plot, no dialogue really, just bright colours and characters bopping around.
There&#39;s a whole wealth of these kinds of videos on YouTube. Parents can use YouTube Kids, an app, to make sure their children are watching appropriate content. They load it up and let them go.
But someone, or some people, or something, is making these mysterious videos in the style of mindless children&#39;s entertainment, except the content is super dark. They usually feature popular kids characters (Spiderman, the Minions, Mickey Mouse, or Elsa - hence the &quot;Elsagate&quot; moniker). The cartoons will feature these characters doing all sorts of bizarre things, like getting drunk and cutting their heads open, or peeing in the bathtub. Other examples include having teeth pulled, having needles, being kidnapped.
Besides the cartoons, there are also really disturbing live action videos, including this one where a kid is subjected to needles in her bum. Warning, it&#39;s pretty disturbing. She clearly doesn&#39;t want this, and her parents are exploiting her for YouTube views.
So, what&#39;s it all about?
No one knows for sure. Could be a way to exploit algorithms, rack up views, and make money. Some people think it&#39;s some kind of coded child pornography catalogue, where the videos are some kind of preview for the actual content you&#39;ll see in the real video. Some people think it&#39;s some kind of way to groom children. Others think it&#39;s a 4chan-initiated prank.
Anyway, it&#39;s really disturbing and I&#39;m fascinated and confused.
TL;DR: read about Elsagate.</li>
<li>the US is actively aiding Saudi bombings of Yemen, and they target pretty indiscriminately, no one in the media wants to mention that.</li>
<li>Internet privacy. As in privacy in general.</li>
<li>The Australian government is seriously considering letting oil companies drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight.
This is a huge huge issue.
85% of the species found in the Bight are literally only found there. They exist no where else in the world
36 different types of whales and dolphins live in the bight, with their breeding grounds in the bight as well.
Its the heart of the Australian fishing industry, so byebye quite a bit of fish if there is an oil spill.
The Oil spill in Mexico which was the biggest in the world, happened in calm waters. The Bight is known for having some of the roughest waters in the world. If a spill occurs in the Bight, it will be almost impossible to contain, and will utterly fuck up the entire southern coast of Australia. From Western Australia to Tasmania.
So not only is Australia killing the Great Barrier Reef, but we are also very close (as in 2018 close) in letting huge oil companies come and try their luck in the Bight.</li>
<li>The economy is doing well, the job market is solid, we&#39;re statistically very safe, we continue to make good progress in medicine, we&#39;re making great progress towards renewable energy and electric vehicles, technology continues to make telecommuting easier, and benefiting the disabled, we continue to make progress on human rights, I could go on and on...
...and yet we don&#39;t feel safe, we&#39;re worried about jobs, we don&#39;t eat well, we don&#39;t get enough exercise, we worry about having the latest iPhone or console or car or house, we think the country that has been plodding along improving since inception is going to hell, and are killing ourselves directly or with drugs, medicine, food, alcohol, cigarettes, sedentary lifestyles, etc... and we can stop, but many of us don&#39;t.</li>
<li>The dumbing down of society and the hijacking of all media by the corporations.</li>
<li>The people of Flint, Michigan haven&#39;t had clean drinking water since April 24th, 2014</li>
<li>The student loan debt crisis
Jesus Christ this stuff needs to be taught in high school before children make decisions that could potentially ruin their lives just because they think going to college is the only option they have.
And, currently, the government is doing all it can to fuck students in the ass over student loan debt. For instance: even if you get your debt forgiven, it&#39;s treated as taxable income so it&#39;s not actually &quot;forgiven&quot; just reduced at best. Also, filing for bankruptcy does jack shit for student loan debt. It&#39;s true a lot of people successfully pay off their debt, but there are a lot more people than you&#39;d think that are absolutely drowning in it with no hopes of ever paying it off because of interest rates.
I get angry just thinking about it.....
Edit: “but if they take out loans why don’t they expect to pay them back???? Hurrrrdurrrrr” no shit. The issue is deeper than that.</li>
<li>The Great Barrier Reef has reached the point-of-no-return and will die off within the next 25 years. This cannot be undone.
27.The Troubled Teen Industry and the fact that as an American you can legally pay for the right to have your child kidnapped, taken away and abused until they&#39;re compliant.</li>
<li>New technology and innovations will continue reduce the amount of workers needed to produce goods, and thus jobs will start to dry up. Even new AI are beginning to replace intellectual jobs (AI Lawyer).
Job market is gonna go through a serious makeover in the next 30 years.</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia is planning to go to war with Iran soon. In most of the media coverage I see, the saudi crown prince is shown as a bold but good guy, and everyone is watching and waiting how his bets will pay off. Well, I have a guess: a lot of people will die.</li>
<li>Alcoholism can be easily treated with Naltrexone but because the patent is expired the drug companies make nearly no money from the drug, so there is no reason to tell people. It&#39;s $1 a pill. It also works on opioids. Also the war on drugs is a massive failure and the US desperately needs to fix it&#39;s prison system. Seems like what&#39;s most important is whether or not to give tax breaks to the rich currently :(.</li>
<li>The US retirement crisis.
If we think it&#39;s bad that baby boomers won&#39;t leave their jobs, imagine how bad it&#39;ll be when Gen-Xers won&#39;t either. It&#39;s not reasonable to expect every American adult to save hundreds of thousands for an undetermined later date. 1.) People have financial crises, such as medical bills or being unemployed, that must be addressed before any long-term saving, and 2.) It&#39;s totally against human nature for every single person to think and plan that far in advance. Like all other developed countries, we need a system that ensures retired persons can at least meet their basic food/shelter needs. Social security was intended to help with this, but we always hear that we can&#39;t count on SS to be around. And w desperately need people to retire so the younger generations can join the workforce. Our system of 401Ks, no pensions, and meager Social Security support is a failure.</li>
<li>Gay conversion therapy is still legal and happening in 41 U.S. states and is currently covered by Medicaid. AKA tax dollars you pay go to this. Source Trevor Project Still Trying to Stop This</li>
<li>All the plastic in the water supply seems like it&#39;s going to cause a lot of problems.</li>
<li>Some countries will not grow. Even if they do grow it will be far less than what is needed to achieve meaningful, sustainable development. The whole idea behind economic growth is that eventually poor countries will be rich and richer countries will be richer. This will not be the case for many, many countries. How do you deal with the reality that some places will be very poor indefinitely?</li>
<li>China&#39;s currency manipulation, at some point it will become a problem but they may fall under the to big to fail.</li>
<li>Overpopulation. There needs to be a stigma over having a gaggle of children. Our schools are underfunded and overstuffed, our ocean is a husk of its former cornucopia-like self, and drinkable water, as a commodity, is going to ascend several tiers in terms of scarcity in the coming decades.</li>
<li>Farmer Suicide.
In India over 100,000 farmers have committed suicide in the last decade due to corporate exploitation leading to a perpetual system of debt and neo-feudalism
Read:
The Patenting of Life, Limiting Liberty, and the Corporate Pursuit of Seeds for more info</li>
<li>With all this talk of mass shootings, I&#39;d like to say this: We need to realize that the vast majority of gun deaths are caused by handguns. The handgun deaths are mainly due to gang activity. Gangs generally have power because they sell illegal drugs. If we legalize the drugs they sell, we will be taking the power away from the gang, thus minimizing gun deaths.
Edit: I was wrong, the leading cause of gun deaths is suicide. That means we need to work to make our society more meaningful to the individual, rather than ban guns and expect everyone to stop killing themselves. My overall point is that we have to look at the cause of a problem in order to fix it.
Also, I was originally way off on the amount of gun deaths per day, sorry! However, there are still about 100 gun deaths per day. That&#39;s the equivalent of a major mass shooting every single day caused primarily by handguns.</li>
<li>The slow death of europe and it&#39;s culture. I&#39;m not one of those &#39;white genoicde&#39; people, but I do think we&#39;ll lose certain cultures and our way of life, it&#39;ll happen slowly over the next hundred years, the climate change refugee crisis will be the final nail in the coffin for europe.
People here aren&#39;t having enough children.
Mass migration from mainly muslim lands will mean they will replace us in several decades.
A lot of people are like &#39;ah good no more white power bla bla bla&#39;
I doubt they&#39;ll be happy when half of europe is under sharia law.
I guess we can kiss goodbye to LGBT rights, equality for women and a slow erosion in certain rights and freedoms that we take for granted.
I try to let people know it might be a risk to let people from MENA countries in, but nobody gives a sht. They say it&#39;s racist.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s racist to say the majority of MENA countries have backwards views. That come from backwards cultures, where gay people are exectuted, there are regular forced marriages and stonings for things like adultery.
Why aren&#39;t more people worried, if this is what&#39;s replacing us ?
Muslims aren&#39;t shy about wanting a caliphate or sharia.
A lot of muslims hate our way of life, so once their the majority here, things will start to change unfortunately.
And our governments are determined to make that happen for them.
It&#39;s just sad. I love Europe. One of my favourite places. I hope I&#39;m dead by the time it becomes totally islamic.
There&#39;s a book called &#39;Submission&#39; set in France, read it, it&#39;ll inform people of what our future will be like.</li>
<li>Nestle drying up ground wells for their bottled water empire.</li>
<li>Fat isn&#39;t causing the obesity epidemic. Sugar is. I&#39;m at work, can&#39;t post my sources, but there is a lot of evidence showing fat is actually good for you (80% of your brain is fat and your cells need cholesterol to function) and sugar is killing us.
The food pyramid is complete backwards and doctors are pushing a high carb diet that is causing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and so much more. Most doctors don&#39;t study nutrition more than a semester or 2! At the same time, the pharmacutical industry makes a lot more money pushing their medications and treatments than actually curing the disease with diet and exercise (which is possible and sustainable!)
Just browse r/keto for numerous success stories. Cutting carbs and increasing fat not only leads to weight loss but also increased mood, greater energy, decreased brain fog, and so much more.</li>
<li>Refugee crises around the world, Rohingya Muslims, Syrians, Afghanistan, Somalia, etc. These human beings are being treated worse than dogs and in some cases systemically murdered for their religion, skin color, etc. It is a huge problem that the US only fights about...meanwhile, (and I am sorry for being graphic and distasteful, but this is a horrific situation) babies are being gang-raped and thrown into bonfires in front of their mothers.</li>
<li>Species are dying off at a rate 10000 times background levels. We are in the middle of the 6th major extinction on this planet.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait you&#39;re saying that Milo and Shapiro are academic / scholarly sources?</p>

<p>I meant more of like first-hand, empirical data type of research... Not someone&#39;s commentary and/or.<br/>
Scientific studies.  Controlled socio and anthropological studies. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not devaluing Shapiro or Milo&#39;s beliefs.  Lived experience should be weighed equally with scientific study and fact. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just asking for empirical, scientific, data-backed research on the negative consequences of the feminist movement, over time.  How have the lives of men and women gotten worse since the creation of feminism?  Like, historically speaking, how have the lives of men and women been harmed by feminism?  Specific data, historical facts, first hand sources, etc.  Or are you just basing your opinion on what you read, your own personal experiences or what Shapiro and Milos tell you?  From what I understand, Shapiro and Milos are not social scientists they just take readings and opinions of others and then put it into their own. </p>

<p>Again, I promise I&#39;m not trying to be condescending.  Listening to things that &quot;sound true&quot; or we assume to be true because of what we see and hear.... &quot;well they tell us the FBI/nsa are the good guys and I don&#39;t see or really hear of them doing anything bad other than catching child porn traffickers and pimps so... Obviously they can&#39;t be THAT bad!&quot; is how the real truth gets distorted.  Using the FBI as the metaphor again, if you actually look at the empirical data (how many fucked up things they have done over time, how many times they have intentionally lied and manipulated the American people, how their actions have led to the murder and assassinations and ruined lives of hundreds of thousands and arguably millions of people) you know they can&#39;t be trusted. </p>

Just don&#39;t be so defeated, that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to, we can still fight this war, and even if you don&#39;t have your own kids to fight for, do it for mine, or for your neighbor&#39;s, or just because that&#39;s what you believe is right.

<p>Nor we would be having this conversation </p>

<p>How exactly having kids is a massive increase in my contribution to climate change? </p>

<p>Since my son was born I stopped eating red meat, stopped buying useless material stuff, started recycling, started a research in plant community ecology...</p>

<p>So, I guess I could say my son helped the environment? </p>

<p>But, yes, my son is a person, in the system we live every person has a carbon footprint and a huge impact on the climate, but what&#39;s your solution then? Human extinction? That would definitely work, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s the only solution available, or the most positive one.</p>

<p>Having kids is a natural part of life (ok, not necessarily part of everyone&#39;s life, but you know what I mean), and there are many unnatural parts we could change, maybe fight for clean sources of energy? A sustainable way of life? Plant a tree or something? There&#39;s lot of things we can do. Climate change is not parent&#39;s fault, it is our system&#39;s fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surely you&#39;d agree, though, that good chunk of the problems listed by OP are due to the way that we make decisions about production. Decisions about what gets produced, how much get produced, where production takes place, how to utilize profits, etc are generally made by private individuals who run enterprises for profit. &quot;Capitalism&quot; is the word we use to describe a whole range of systems that share this defining characteristic. </p>

<p>For example, the reason that our food is killing us is because it is produced for profit. The only people who control production decisions are private citizens looking for profit and naturally they make decisions with respect to profitability rather than public utility. </p>

<p>Coupled with a free market, private ownership of the enterprise for profit was a GREAT system for colonizing the world, settling frontiers, and driving the innovation needed to drive the industrial revolution. In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, these systems overwhelmed legacy feudal systems by unleashing raw expansive power motivated by profit. Free markets and private enterprise run themselves without much top-down coordination, which would have been impossible given limitations of the era such as hand-computation and slow communication.</p>

<p>But we today we have instant communication and massive computational power at our disposal. Furthermore, we have no more frontier left to expand into, and our global population is coming up against the limits of our ecosystem. We need a new game to play to decide what gets produced and how those goods are divided up. Our current situation calls for efficiency rather than rapacious expansion. We should be coordinating production to minimize waste and DECREASE GDP to the lowest possible levels that will still support the quality of life that we want for ourselves. In short, we need to expand the power of decision-making over production to those affected by production. This concept is known as democracy in governance, and socialism in economics.  This way, there is a mechanism by which public good can be prioritized over profit motive. This gets at the heart of all the problems documented by OP above. </p>

There is cheap land out there but not the kind of land you may want to build a house on. There are endless acres of land all over the world that can be planted and harvested for food but because of laws, regulations, money, power, willful ignorance and lack of unity, we have put ourselves in a position where the facade of overpopulation is prevalent. There was a good
mini-doc on vimeo explaining it all and I may be able to find it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question, in my mind, is whether we&#39;re not living sustainably because it&#39;s impossible for 7-9 billion people to do so, or because the old way is just too profitable?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s perfectly possible to have 9 billion or more live and thrive on this planet, provided that we&#39;re bold in our vision, responsible in our actions and sufficiently unified that we&#39;re collectively moving in the direction of eternal life (not as individuals but as a species), as opposed to self-destruction.</p>

<p>In todays dichotomy, we either see ourselves as victims of our own flawed nature (and hence ultimately victims of nature at large), or as the self-evident rulers of the Earth, destined to transcend nature all together.</p>

<p>I think both viewpoints are delusions. The best analogue for our collective role on this planet is that of the gardener. The more we life we sow, the more we&#39;ll reap. A gardener cannot exploit his garden without thinking about next year, and the year after that. A gardener defends his garden but doesn&#39;t destroy the garden of his neighbour. He doesn&#39;t eradicate all snails because a few of them have chewed on his lettuce.</p>

<p>I might be overextending the metaphor, but I think it&#39;s a pretty good place to start contemplating where we really fit into this picture, and perhaps we can start to conceive of a way of living that is truly, and easily sustainable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post smells a lot of <a href="/r/im14andthisisdeep">/r/im14andthisisdeep</a> </p>

<p>The reason why lots of these points are not being discussed is because a lot of this is old news or common knowledge, 
Also packing 50ish points into a single post is a great way to encourage only the most superficial discussion on any of those topics since anything scratching on any depth will simply be covered by noise.</p>

<p>1-6 : extremely common knowledge, know for years if not decades. Discussed in depth when the news was current. </p>

<p>8-12 : see note above</p>

<p>14: OMFG, we knew when Nixon was president that the American educational system was in trouble, around 1992 and 1997 we saw a tiny pivot towards teaching students how to use technology appropriately, although apart from those brief sparks in time that concept is only given lip service, as for the political polarisation about the future of education, well that&#39;s a result of what started to happen in the 70s, and at the moment it&#39;s barreling towards collapse because in America you have one party who wants to teach that Jesus wrote the consititution and another party who wants the country to avoid bankruptcy, neither is willing to spend the money on training teachers or upgrading schools, let alone getting rid of the archaic district system </p>

<p>21: australlia has been drilling oil off the cost of SA for decades now, this isn&#39;t news. And SA is one of the lesser states anyway, you mention Tasmania in this point and that&#39;s sortof incorrect there is very little oil around there and the waters are calm ( Tasmania is off port Phillip bay and not the bight) source: australlian for 30 years before moving to America </p>

<p>23: see responses to points 1 and 14, this particular downward spiral started when the FCC loosened up rules to what could be called news, and Rupert Murdoch jumped in and said, wow I can make a lot of money exploiting the mentally handicapped. </p>

<p>26: we knew that this was going to happen in the 90s but nobody cared, this is serious and extremely sad. If we are lucky we can reign in the temperatures and start to reseed the coral although it would take well over 200 years for the reef to grow back to its former glory. </p>

<p>27: this started in the 80s, and has been accelerating, although this is actually progress, why pay 50,000 people to build cars when you can pay 5,000 people, and a further 500 to design and maintain the systems.  &quot;intellectual&quot; jobs will still be around for atleast 100 years, the current state of automation requires human control for any tasks which require any real decision making and AI is still in its extreme infancy ( at the level that we have no idea if it will ever be able to actually comprehend a book, let alone a set of laws ) </p>

<p>29: this requires medication compliance, addiction doesn&#39;t work that way, addicts are usually searching for greater meaning and are trying to fill a void which regular people don&#39;t have </p>

<p>I want to continue but I must sleep, I may continue tommorrow</p>

<p>well, there were leaked some audios from the brazil&#39;s president being openly corrupt. it was some months ago and he still in the presidency</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a brazilian I can confirm this and it&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. Our ex-president is walking around freely with huge charges on his back, just like many other politicians here...</p>

<p>Take a quick look at this: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42810464">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42810464</a>
Specially this part: &quot;They increased his original sentence from nine-and-a-half years to 12 years and one month in jail. Even though the 72-year-old was sentenced in July 2017 and that conviction has now been upheld, he could remain out of prison for many months if he takes his appeal all the way to the Supreme Court.&quot;</p>

<p>He is free for almost two years after being considered guilty in one of the biggest corruption schemas of the country. And he is just one of the many politicians in this exact situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While 5 corps own US Media, the Rothschilds own Reuters, Reuters own The Associated Press (AP). and ALL US news gets their news from those sources. </p>

<p>When added the the ongoing Project Mockingbird, placing CIA operitives into key positions in media, editorial, anchor positions, the news it not only missleading, its uneducational.</p>

<p>ALSO why is no one talking about </p>

<p>The US Army Manual FM 3-39.40</p>

<p>Internment and Resettlement Operations</p>

<p>and how it states FEMA, DHS,  and other INTERNAL+external agencies will be involved.</p>

<p>intake proceduries include the prisoners social security #.</p>

<p>and its only downhill from there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surely you&#39;d agree, though, that good chunk of the problems listed by OP are due to the way that we make decisions about production. Decisions about what gets produced, how much get produced, where production takes place, how to utilize profits, etc are generally made by private individuals who run enterprises for profit. &quot;Capitalism&quot; is the word we use to describe a whole range of systems that share this defining characteristic. </p>

<p>For example, the reason that our food is killing us is because it is produced for profit. The only people who control production decisions are private citizens looking for profit and naturally they make decisions with respect to profitability rather than public utility. </p>

<p>Coupled with a free market, private ownership of the enterprise for profit was a GREAT system for colonizing the world, settling frontiers, and driving the innovation needed to drive the industrial revolution. In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, these systems overwhelmed legacy feudal systems by unleashing raw expansive power motivated by profit. Free markets and private enterprise run themselves without much top-down coordination, which would have been impossible given limitations of the era such as hand-computation and slow communication.</p>

<p>But we today we have instant communication and massive computational power at our disposal. Furthermore, we have no more frontier left to expand into, and our global population is coming up against the limits of our ecosystem. We need a new game to play to decide what gets produced and how those goods are divided up. Our current situation calls for efficiency rather than rapacious expansion. We should be coordinating production to minimize waste and DECREASE GDP to the lowest possible levels that will still support the quality of life that we want for ourselves. In short, we need to expand the power of decision-making over production to those affected by production. This concept is known as democracy in governance, and socialism in economics.  This way, there is a mechanism by which public good can be prioritized over profit motive. This gets at the heart of all the problems documented by OP above. </p>

<p>This is true as long as you realize those in charge are the .0001% and the corporations they control and the politicians they have bought and paid for.</p>

But I would like to inform you that if you were to take all the different variants of other boys names in to account as one entry, then Muhammad is still not number 1. It is only number one if you do that only for Muhammad, which is strangely what that article chooses to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back to the caves then? </p>

<p>Hmmm no, I don&#39;t buy it. We can use technology instead, like blockchain and what will come after/on-top of that. This will largely elliminate banks and if everything incl. real-estate is done via this then it can eliminate governmental burocracy and make a system somehow that contains the burocracy within it, it will be inherent in the system and thus uncorruptible. (just a vague idea of the direction we&#39;re headed I think)</p>
