       If Trump was truly antiestablishment, there would have been a media blackout on him from day 1. Instead, however, networks such as CNN have been pushing the narrative that they and Trump are at odds. This was a narrative designed by the same media they claim is untrustworthy... In true ironic fashion, all while claiming that the MSM is pushing false narratives, Trump supporters fell for the MSM narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has shown himself to be a valuable asset to the establishment. The perfect corporate puppet and "weapon of mass distraction".

       I really hope that everybody behind what's going down right now is all about ending all the child-raping. As I've said many times before, I'll cut the NWO a lot of slack if they just get rid of all the psycho child-rapers.

       Everyone hates him except his supporters. He is constantly ridiculed and disparaged. No one in the eatablishment wants him. I don't consume MSM. This is just fucking obvious. People that try to claim he is "the establishment" just because he is president are the most disingenuous, if not dishonest, people running around screaming on the internet right now.

       I don't even think his supporters

       Clinton wanted Trump to win the primaries
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to an email from Marissa Astor, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook’s assistant, to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, the campaign knew Trump was going to run, and pushed his legitimacy as a candidate. WikiLeaks’ release shows that it was seen as in Clinton’s best interest to run against Trump in the general election. The memo, sent to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) also reveals the DNC and Clinton campaign were strategizing on behalf of their candidate at the very beginning of the primaries. “We think our goals mirror those of the DNC,” stated the memo, attached to the email under the title “muddying the waters.”

       What I'm saying here is that the Clinton campaign and the MSM intentionally gave Trump coverage early on. That resulted in their required continuing coverage of Trump.

       How shady would that have been if they just stopped talking about the loudmouth after he won the GOP nomination?

       My opinion is that Trump has been shackled and is just playing the role he's told to play. He's the catalyst for the coming civil war. I also think he started out as a legitimate threat to those in control.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also think the same thing happened to Obama. Hence the drone war escalating, the rise of BLM, and Libya's destruction. I just thought Obama might have tried a "hail mary" during his lame duck term.

       No, he's the president. That's just like libs always talking about how divisive he is; he isn't, they are, he's the duly elected president, they're the ones that are being divisive because they can't abide losing an election. In the same respect, any coming civil war will be the democrats' fault. Again.

       They pushed Trump thinking he would be easily defeated. It backfired. Watch Trump's videos from decades ago and notice the consistency.
      </p>
      <p>
       White hats inside the Gov't realized that HRC was the final push of the globalists towards the Guidestones, and recruited Trump to run. So in a way, it was staged. Not because all of these guys are "good" or perfect, but out of self-preservation.

       They pushed trump as an anti-establishment candidate and it riled up sheep who actually believe MSM nonsense.

       Years ago, Trump was very cozy with the establishment. This is well documented considering he's a business man and billionaire.

       The jury is still out on Trump.  You can’t drain the swamp in a day.  I think he gradually realized that the forces arrayed against him are too widespread and entrenched for a frontal assault and that he will have to make a lot of concessions while slowly consolidating his power.    If he started full scale draining from the get go he would have been dead a long time ago.     Anyway,  that’s one theory.  Only time will tell.

       There's a reason that true threats to the establishment get the media blackout treatment from their candidacy onwards. there's a reason the saying goes that bad press is better than no press.
      </p>

       Moreover, the media very specifically pushed the anti establishment, outsider narrative when Trump was anything but.

       That wouldn't have worked with Trump.  All he had to do was get on twitter and talk shit.

      <p>
       Really?  Then why did the GOP establishment fight Trump harder than they ever fought Obama?  Why did Kasich and Cruz stay in the race long after they had been mathematically eliminated?  Why was the GOP establishment trying to get a brokered convention?  Why did some GOP establishment members go so far as to push for faithless electors to vote for Hillary?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that I find interesting about comments like yours is that pushing the "he's not an anti establishment outsider" narrative is exactly what Hillary's campaign planned to do to Rand Paul if he had become nominee.  They talk about it in either the DNC emails or Podesta's email, I can't remember which.

       Trump was receiving media coverage for every tweet and they were all being published in media articles. Look for example, how the media has treated Terry Crews since he came out against the establishment in hollywood - much more muted and hush regarding his tweets. Ron Paul's campaign is also a good example where he had a massive following and majority support, yet was blacked out. Whereas with Trump, every tweet was played up. The media was, in attacking trump, playing into the image that he is an outsider and anti-establishment.

        That's obviously not true, otherwise crisis PR firms would not exist.

      <p>
       The existence of crisis PR firms doesn't discount the fact that press, whether good or bad, legitimizes and validates someone as worthy of being talked about.

        Really? Then why did the GOP establishment fight Trump harder than they ever fought Obama? Why did Kasich and Cruz stay in the race long after they had been mathematically eliminated? Why was the GOP establishment trying to get a brokered convention? Why did some GOP establishment members go so far as to push for faithless electors to vote for Hillary?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If the GOP was really fighting Trump, they would have done what they did to Bernie. Which is rig the primary. It's apparently legal and simple to do so since Hillary did it. I think this was all a show to give Trump the outsider image when the reality is that he is just one of their erratic puppets, as he has shown himself to be.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Another thing that I find interesting about comments like yours is that pushing the "he's not an anti establishment outsider" narrative is exactly what Hillary's campaign planned to do to Rand Paul if he had become nominee. They talk about it in either the DNC emails or Podesta's email, I can't remember which.
       </p>

       Rand Paul is establishment, and has shown himself to be a sellout. He's just riding the coattails of his father imo.

       Rupert Murdoch is in the process of being taken down. He's selling his entertainment division and nobody's seen him in public for over a month now. Allegedly hurt badly on his kid's yacht. Wouldn't surprise me if he's dead.

       Media blackout on a US president....that's such a ridiculous idea that it doesn't deserve comment. When the media saw the ratings when they switched to TMZ style hit gossip on Trump, they were hooked. Remember that CNN and MSNBC were tanking in the ratings before Trump. Maddow was averaging less than 300k a year night.

       When does the news say he's anti-establishment?
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM is constantly pushing false narratives and fake bullshit, them  reporting negatively on Trump rather than not reporting on him literally means less than nothing, they still have the perception of being trustworthy to keep up with the normies, do you actually think any "news" organization could get away with not running stories involving the POTUS?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're grasping at straws, if you really think "the news attacks him and they're dirty so that's proof he's dirty" is a valid argument you're dumber than I assume most liberals are.
