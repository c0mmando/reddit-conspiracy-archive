       I'm sure a lot of you have seen the infographics regarding the existence of "black cube worship" amongst the world elite. For those who don't know,
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?biw=1133&amp;amp;bih=593&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=1&amp;amp;ei=xrtqWrOPOc3vzgL6lqDwBA&amp;amp;q=black+cube+of+saturn&amp;amp;oq=black+cube+of+saturn&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...0.0.0.62934.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.iCijtop2gEQ">
        here's the Google Image Search for "black cube of Saturn
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       To start with:
      </p>
      <p>
       The God of the Old Testament is Saturn. The Saturn Square adds up to 45 (sum of 1-9). The Tetragrammaton, when you spell out the Hebrew pronunciation, has a gematria value of 45.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second: the Jews fear this god, who is Saturn, because they are marked for destruction. In the Old Testament, Yehovah repeatedly says that if He becomes sufficiently displeased with their behavior, Israel will be destroyed. Thus for the Jews, preventing Saturn's return is a matter of survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third: The golden age that is brought about by Saturn's return is one in which there is universal plenitude, which is a very bad thing for the rulers of this world, whose power is underpinned by the ability to control access to resources. Thus their interests will, on an occult level, be congruent to those of the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the Jews always have privileged access to the elites, who are all part of a cult dedicated to preventing Saturn's return. The Jews fear Saturn's return more than anyone, and in any group that is brought together by a common sentiment, those who feel this sentiment most dearly will have disproportionate influence. They're the ones with the longest experience hiding from Saturn's vigilance, and they're the ones who teach the world elites the rituals necessary.

       If the exoplanets with the orthogonal orbits to our solar system interfere with the planets in some way?

       It's not the planet itself, it's the effect on the psyche of humans, just as how the moon influences people in varied ways.  There may also be outside assistance...
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the Jews being "destroyed" may be metaphorical...as in loss of status and power.  But I never made that claim...sooooo...yeah.  Take that up with OP.

       How i understand it, the planet isn't god.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's position relative to earth effects human consciousness and behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kinda like during a full moon crime and psychotic episodes have been proven to rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting theory OP.  I do agree this all has to do with ancient Saturn worship.

       This guy is named santos bonacci.  He teaches a subject called astrotheology. There is a lot of information and he has a ton of videos that explain it very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Jordan Maxwell has a lot of lectures that explain secret societies and ancient saturnalia cults.
      </p>
      <p>
       Warning though, he is now a flat earther.  I think they brought back the flat earth theory to specifically ensnare and discredit this man because he was touching way too close to the truth.  Watch his videos until he starts talking about flat earth, a lot of knowledge in his work.

       It is written in Babylonian times that the solar system was in a different order.
      </p>
      <p>
       They ascribed orbits, like that of mars, to being the cause of the eclipse. They also assumed, Venus to be in a certain position.
      </p>
      <p>
       IN this time, Saturn was said to be a second sun. At this same time, Babylon was said to be great.
      </p>
      <p>
       These exists a possibility that a meteor hit Saturn with enough fiery force to cause it to 'burn', possibly glowing as a sun for a while - since it's the speed of excited molecules that produce light.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible, with more radiation plants grew larger, and even people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the planet is not god, it describes the age of humanity acting as gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, The age which offers some plenty, offers others little, and vice versa. The heroes and villeins are of the same coin, where one side is up, the other must be down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, In an age where things are expressed as they are, is opposite of a time where things are understood in reverse.

       The Hajj is a gigantic ritual designed to banish Saturn's influence. They have 3 rituals that encode 7 inversions each. They circle the black cube 7 times clockwise, they run between 2 hills 7 times, and they pelt "Satan" with stones 7 times, meaning they simulate Abraham's rejection of the angel's plea not to kill his son, inverting the story of Abraham and Isaac. Islam is a giant religion designed to protect the Jews from Yehovah's wrath, they are golems without realizing it.

       Not true at all. We don't worship the black cube. It's a point of reference. The cube could be destroyed and we would still have to face that particular direction.

       I have been trying to find what I read about tetrgrammaton, but the piece I had read essentially said he / it is a cube that created life, similar to the allspark in transformers ( I can't stand those movies but that's what it is, a black cube that creates life throughout the universe essentially)

       How would you accomodate these ideas with the theory that the jews will bring about the return of their messiah within the next 2 centuries? Talmudic prophecy requires for the messiah to return before the jewish calendar hits 6000 years. That is 2240 common era. Who is the jewish messiah in relation to saturn? And who is Jesus in relation to saturn? Very interesting and stimulating post OP. Not many like this on here lately.

       its a neat theory, but then,  preventing the return of the vengeful god should be as simple as making sure the jews are living according to gods commandments.  instead of letting them mingle with filthy mystery babylon elites.  or did i miss something?

       It's not the planet itself, it's the effect on the psyche of humans, just as how the moon influences people in varied ways.  There may also be outside assistance...

       That being said, the Jews being "destroyed" may be metaphorical...as in loss of status and power.  But I never made that claim...sooooo...yeah.  Take that up with OP.

       This guy is named santos bonacci.  He teaches a subject called astrotheology. There is a lot of information and he has a ton of videos that explain it very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Jordan Maxwell has a lot of lectures that explain secret societies and ancient saturnalia cults.
      </p>
      <p>
       Warning though, he is now a flat earther.  I think they brought back the flat earth theory to specifically ensnare and discredit this man because he was touching way too close to the truth.  Watch his videos until he starts talking about flat earth, a lot of knowledge in his work.
