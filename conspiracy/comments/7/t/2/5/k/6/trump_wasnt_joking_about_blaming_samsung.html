        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Back in 2016, the leader of South Korea and her entire cabinet was imprisoned on conspiratorial charged. Park Geun-hye was accused of having a handler, being apart of a cult, consulting with said cult, and coopting large corporations to funnel cash into dummy charity organizations. Last year&#39;s &quot;trial of the century&quot; in South Korea was the prosecution of the crown prince of Samsung. At the time, there was a vague conspiracy concerning &quot;the cult of the seven goddesses&quot; in which female leaders around the world were being coopted into the same vague spiderweb of a cabal-network.</p>

<p>If we drop most of the bullshit surrounding this story, it looks like a cult with unknown affiliations coopted the South Korean government since at least 2013. The MO of this cult is mysterious, but operates similarly to how the Clinton Foundation operates. Backdoor deals are made, and then the payouts are made indirectly through the charity and affiliated speaking events run by those charities.</p>

<p>The thing that really bothers me is Samsung&#39;s involvement.</p>

<p>What if Samsung wasn&#39;t just trying to get better coverage and lower rates? What if they were colluding with a cult that&#39;s been running in South Korea since 2013? This wouldn&#39;t be a spying operation, as metadata is readily available, but what about a counter-spy operation? What if they were using Samsung to bypass American and South Korean spy networks?</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s why Trump blames Samsung.</p>

<p>Maybe that cult was the deep state.</p>

<p>The phones, in collusion with certain carriers, were intercepting messages between deep state agents before they could get to the NSA. They were being monitored and controlled by an outside source. Kind of like China&#39;s leading small groups. Very unamerican.</p>

<p>Leading small groups in China monitor every facet of their government from the outside, including the people, in order to ensure that the adgenda of the party is maintained on all fronts. The deep state initiated a coup the likes of which the world has never seen. Whoever started this was rich, took over media and telecommunications wherever they went, and implemented Mao-style Communist Party rule behind the curtains of every government agency they could get their hands on. They used this clout to cover their trail and extend their influence ad infinitum. </p>

<p>Then members of the US government realized what was going on, and took action to stop it. Trump is their Lance.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Trump blames Samsung because they were working with the deep state to cover Lisa Page and Peter Strzok&#39;s trails. They potentially do it a lot.</p>

<p>It was the Eight Goddesses, though, not the Seven Goddesses, and I believe that might have been a mistranslation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Immortals">the Eight Faeries/Immortals</a> from Chinese mythology. </p>

<p>It almost seems like every major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol">Chaebol</a>, the Korean equivalent of the Japanese Zaibatsu, has a cult leader either controlling it or embedded within its supply chain. Together, this could make up the Eight Faeries.</p>

<p>This matches up with some other lines of thought I&#39;ve had.</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if the Sun Myung Moon ever had relations with the Michael Aquino...</p>

<p>Something something PSYOP something something Holy War?</p>
