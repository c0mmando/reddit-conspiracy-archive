<p>The term conspiracy theory induces a certain &quot;slide&quot; reaction within people, where they immediately denounce your theory as hogwash. </p>

<p>If we shifted to a more rational explanation, studying and researching organized crime of the highest levels (which is exactly what the New World Order is), then we can really polish up our image and reach tons of more people. </p>

<p>Ultimately things are moving in the right direction, but a shift to some more common and respected terminology could really help us reach the public on a broader scale and take this to the next level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you suggesting that the theorists be more transparent in the models of &quot;organized crime&quot; they&#39;re using?  like for instance parsing out symbology and seeing if places/groups/orgs match these symbols?  for example..a masonic G, the colours red, black, and white, the use of spirally icons, references to the devil and souls, use of the fibonacci sequence 1123 or variants where perhaps there&#39;s a digit transposition..stuff like that.  would being clearer about the model and then the matches against the model add credence to the theories?  maybe i guess.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not disagree. Just a little sarcastic with the idea of &quot;education&quot;.</p>

<p>Most people who go down the path of researching large conspiracies are attempting to educate themselves in an otherwise hostile world where real knowledge is frowned upon if it in any way doesn&#39;t come from an institution.</p>

<p>Book smart vs street smart. Being taught vs learning. I&#39;ve grown more comfortable in that I consider a large portion of our society beyond reproach. We are naturally defensive towards things that we cannot understand, and even more hesitant to learn about what we don&#39;t understand. Mob mentality in that is hard to over come, but it doesn&#39;t mean anyone should stop being a &quot;researcher of organized crime&quot;. If and when topics are discussed in the inevitable putting to that mob, the entire outline of the 5 W&#39;s are already provided. I consider what we do a public service.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s the difference though. A true researcher or scientist may have a hypothesis at the outset, but that is always subject to change, is fluid, and where the evidence goes, so goes the conclusion. </p>

<p>A CT on the other hand begins with the end strongly fixed in his mind, and this end/conclusion is always strongly arrived at by his own biases and how they think the world is/should be. The ‘evidence’ is then twisted to all logical possibilities to support the conclusion. You will never hear a CT say, ‘you know, I was wrong.’ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what if ultimately there isn’t actually any New World Order? What if you’re just wrong about it and have been misinterpreting a great many things due to lack of real/full information and a combination of personal bias? </p>

<p>Now....that feeling you have right now to call me a shill and an apologist or whatever, the anger. Why do you think you feel that? It’s because you’ve already got the conclusion fixed in your mind, and anything other than that conclusion you’ve reached. That’s not research. </p>

<p>The problem with your post is that true research is objective and uncaring. If the original hypothesis is wrong, it is abandoned in light of the evidence. Readily. </p>

<p>If you’re honest with yourself, you’ll never abandon the theory that there’s a NWO, a global cabal of Jews/lizards/molesters/whatever it is, even if confronted with concrete evidence to the contrary. </p>

<p>A CT will twist the evidence to fit the theory instead of allowing the evidence to discover the conclusion. The majority of people see through this, and it comes off as jumping to conclusions then clinging to them tenaciously. </p>

<p>Anyway, I’m on this sub for a reason, and am not just bashing you. I just think the bigger hurdle to mainstream acceptance would be a willingness to concede that you’re wrong if the evidence supports it instead of trying to simply change terminology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The irony here is that you are making assumptions about the people reading based off of the stereotypical image you have of a conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>There are a few types of theorists and the two most popular are bandwagon theorists and then just open minded people who enjoy looking for their information. The first is the type to completely deny that they could be wrong, and the latter just sees heavy strangeness in the world and many convenient coincidences. They admit they cant or dont know anything for sure, but damn if it doesnt seriously look like the mafiosos never really went away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great that’s exactly how to approach it. I myself never believed any alien stories. However I stumbled upon some evidence researching some old military bases. And One thing lead to another. A weakness of your approach however is that you dismiss others hypothesis. The scientific method first starts with a hypothesis. Nothing wrong with having a theory. I could care less whether airlines are real are not. I suspect they exist because some government agencies work very hard to hide evidence. Going so far as hiring shills to create doubt on well meaning people researching. I find that malicious and criminal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The general consensus on the flat earth theory is it might be a psyop perpetuated by intelligence to discredit. So that is a crime to mislead the public and in fact fits the RICO definition. Misleading the public on a mass scale is a huge crime. I think it especially applies to ailiens and technology since hoarding technology to ensure a monopoly would also be a RICO crime. 
As to the pyramids I also would label that misleading and withholding vital information from the public with malicious intent but that might be stretching it a bit. I admit that :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth is very controversial but under the surface I suspect it is a psy op. If evidence could be found that there are governtmtn employees spreading lies to distract divide and mislead that would be actual organized crime. When I researched rico I discovered it is very hard to defend against. The burden of proof is mostly on the defense. Anyways I find all conspiracies tied to a crime. But the pyramids are the least malicious I think. 
I keep an open mind about conspiracies if you consider the level of misinformation and the opioid crisis that will give you an idea of how dangerous and egregious misleading the public is. </p>
