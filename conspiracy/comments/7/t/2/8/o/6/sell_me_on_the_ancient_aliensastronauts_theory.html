       As the title says, any interesting ‘evidence’ and ideas that I might not have seen or heard about would be great. I love the idea that another species may have visited this planet, studied what was here (perhaps when life was in it’s very beginnings or even before) and moved on. Or even interfered in the spark of sentient life. Thanks

       Everything we know about the "universe" is straight up science fiction, brought to you by Holly Wood... We supposedly know more about "space", than we do about our own planet. Think about that, for a second...

       As far as the science fiction goes, a lot of it isn’t actually all that far removed from projects our species is currently working on. I mean we’ve actually touched down on another rock floating in space already... and only a thousand years ago we invented gunpowder! Think about that one too.

       Multiple times. If you don’t believe in the first moon landing then fine, I’m not going to argue. But since then we’ve had a few more manned landings and many unmanned. We even have vehicles on Mars taking incredible images of the terrain.

       Apparently a radiation barrier. Could be anything, really, but... there is a barrier. Hence why I said: "We are quarantined, somewhat". Methinks, it has do to with what the pre-Deluge civilization did or didn't do.

        Regardless of the differences of the flux levels in the Inner and Outer Van Allen belts, the beta radiation levels would be dangerous to humans if they were exposed for an extended period of time. The Apollo missions minimised hazards for astronauts by sending spacecraft at high speeds through the thinner areas of the upper belts, bypassing inner belts completely.

       The advantage to lying about the first mission would have been to win the ‘space race’ at that time, and show the world that the US is the dominant force in the world of science, progress and power (vs the Russians). I’m just playing devils advocate by the way, there is no way Apollo 11 didn’t succeed.

       The advantage to lying about the first mission would have been to win the ‘space race’ at that time, and show the world that the US is the dominant force in the world of science, progress and power (vs the Russians). I’m just playing devils advocate by the way, there is no way Apollo 11 didn’t succeed.

       I specifically said your question was very broad and picked 1 topic. Like, yes extremely deep caves, rain forests, and a giant frozen fucking continent pose their own challenges and risk to explore.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're extremely remote and difficult to get to. Seems logical to me, but I'm not the one sitting here going "how do you know" in response to a question that pressure is very high at extreme depths and denying space exists or what ever shit you subscribe to.

       ?? You didn't state you were comparing religion to space travel and exploration you simply made an analogy between space and religion. Might want to be more clear while you're busy moving those goal posts around.

       Are you seriously about to sit there and fucking argue against physics....
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, let’s see if we can work this one out. First, we have to understand how pressure is measured. If we were to take a one inch column of air all the way up through the atmosphere, it would weigh 14.7 pounds. For this reason, we like to say that the standard air pressure (at sea level) is 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). Water weighs more than this, though. Each one inch column that’s one foot deep will weigh 0.445 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you’re right at sea level, the pressure will be 14.7 psi. And for every foot you go underwater, you add another 0.445 psi. So at one foot deep, the pressure would be 14.7 psi + 0.445 psi = 15.145 psi. And at two feet deep it would be 14.7 psi + 2
       <em>
        (0.445 psi) = 15.59 psi, etc. In order to get to 2 atmospheres worth of air pressure, you would need to get to the point where there’s 29.4 psi (2 times 14.7 psi). To get to 29.4 psi, it turns out that you would need to be 33 feet deep. (Since 14.7 psi + 33
       </em>
       0.445 psi = 29.4 psi.)

       You really think I should provide evidence when you’re the one making ridiculous statements and think that every manned lunar mission has ben an elaborate hoax? The risks of the Van Allen Belts can be minimised through navigation, and have been, but obviouslt will always pose a danger. The later missions were more able to predict the danger than the Apollo mission, which in my opinion got very lucky.

       That's absolutely not true. We know more about the surface of the moon than the depths of our sea, but that's not surprising. It's a lot easier to send something up into space than to develop an extensive way to map and study the ocean floor. But we absolutely do not know more about space. Not even a bit. Normal matter makes up about 5% of space. 68% is dark energy. 27% is dark matter. And we have absolutely no fucking idea what that 95% composition is. Add in the fact that there's literally TRILLIONS of galaxies that may have independent properties than ours, it's naive to say we know ANYTHING about the cosmos.

       I can, but, you just spew back the same bullshit that I've heard a thousand times. They've taught you well, and I hope you seek deeper. If you don't want to talk deeper, than... not sure what the point is. Cheers!

       If you haven't gone to a night sky that's devoid of light pollution and looked up and seen the hundreds of thousands of stars in the sky, then I'm sorry. I'm not the one who needs to get deeper. Cause I've seen that beauty and it's sure as fuck real.

       I actually live in Alaska and have seen plenty starry nights, and also the Northern Lights, among many other things. That said, looking up and seeing stars, does not equal space travel. How are you not understanding this?

       Cydonia is very interesting, and if certain formations are in fact a marker left there for when we became advanced enough to view them, then excavating that site (which shouldn’t take too long) would be incredibly exciting. Unfortunately it is probably just an amazing rock formation. Tithonia I’m not familiar with and google throws up a species of plant?!

       The bible is the perfect answer to your question. Only, instead of coming to a vast distant planet, what we would term as an alien, created our planet and visits regularly.

       Should be enough to get you started. Once youve seen this, I have some books if you're interested...but these are well-cited primers that have some pretty robust evidence, without getting too outlandish

       I would add the magical Egypt series with the amazing John Anthony west. All based on the work of De lubicz. It's clear that what we are taught about Egypt is a load of cobblers.. it's becoming ever more appararant that sophisticated life has been on earth for vastly more time than our pithy though much vaunted  5000+ years... yugas - great cycles of time... Indian/vedic cosmology is a key to understanding this.

       Thanks. Obviously no one could state this theory as a fact, I just like to think about the idea of it. ‘Debunking’ seems a very easy and pointless thing to do when there is obviously no hard evidence.

       I think you still might like it. It's kind of a great way to have your cake and eat it too. Watch some wild speculation on aliens in ancient times and it's also funny to see how easily the omission of an obvious solution can allow for run away spin and narrative. Boosts your BS decorator and also helps you sift down to the truly bizarre historical objects and events that are not yet locked down into a mainstream conclusion.
      </p>

       Plenty of mystery to uncover out their, but it's good to pull the weeds too.

       I have seen this video and although they do a good job at debunking one or two items they fail on most others as their debunk jobs are mostly nothing more than speculative alternatives as opposed to actual debunking.

       for some odd reason, Joe Rogan has all these interesting guests and they discuss all this cool shit including conspiracies but since Joe is not a Sandy Hook guy, he is a shill and I swear like 70% of this sub is sold on that. It's completely ridiculous.

       Also he probably couldn't take that negative of a stance if he wants to continue getting such experts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watch his conspiracy guests anyway, I don't consider him a shill or a "gatekeeper", but I can see how even if he was iffy on something like Sandy Hook, he'd want to keep that quiet.

       The entire ancient astronaut/alien premise is based on modern humans being the smartest and most technologically advanced as we ever were, and that some marvelous technological evidence from a time when humans were (supposedly) knuckle-dragging cave men
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       have been alien, not human.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think for a minute that maybe the whole historical timeline given to us is bullshit, then you allow for the possibility that ancient humans were much more advanced and had technologies we can't even fathom but are lost or suppressed now. Add to that the possibility that outer space may not be what you've been led to believe it is, and it's not difficult at all to imagine an earth that has never been, or could ever be, visited by ET's.

       I suspect anything transportable found at digs gets taken away never to see the light of day again. Museums are filled with whatever fits the narratives. Archaeologists and the institutions/governments who fund them hardly feel like they owe the public the truth, especially if whatever uncovered goes against the official narratives.

       I've occasionally wondered if there was an advanced ancient civilization (technology moderately more sophisticated than ours) and they experienced an extinction event that shattered their civilization, is it possible that it could have taken long enough to regain civilization that it would explain the loss of archaeological evidence for their advanced civilization?  Like would 50,000 years be enough?

       If you think about it, if we ourselves were wiped out, how long would it take before everything we have, all evidence of our existence turns to dust? It wouldn't even take that long before the metals rust away, and all the wood and other soft materials turn to dirt, the concrete and rocks broken down to dust. It would be a blink of a cosmic eye before most evidence of us would be gone forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet there may be ample evidence of such a long lost civilization right under our noses: the Grand Canyon could have been a giant quarry, the butte rocks sawed off giant trees, the sands of the Sahara and other deserts the piles of waste deposited by some long lost people with unimaginably large machines, the imprints of machines, buildings, and vehicles in rocks, rocks themselves seemingly manufactured/formed by some unimaginable technology (the theories of channels such as
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqLPTe6eEeBP10Zhu5p-0cQ">
        newearth
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thc682132">
        Wiseup

       , and others). These and many more examples need not be alien or natural, but could conceivably be from a very, very ancient civilization. Their metal long rusted away, their bones and buildings to dust. Everything in this reality is cyclic. I don't see why civilizations and life itself wouldn't be.

       I think it's also possible that archaeological evidence could just be overlooked or disregarded, not even as part of a conspiracy but simply out of bias to existing theories and assumptions.  I'd imagine small things turn up which contradict the accepted narrative but are disregarded as just expected anomalies or just disregarded because they conflict too much with the accepted narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       My larger problem is that I think that advanced cities/cultures would be using advanced materials science for their building materials and that these would be less prone to leave absolutely no trace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what exactly would happen to the foundation structures of modern cities, for example, even after thousands of years, especially with some kind of protective layer of ash on top from some kind of extinction event.  Would they be completely unrecognizable after 50,000 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess a better way of phrasing it is how long does it take for nature to literally dissolve a city like NYC so that not even archaeological evidence remains? 50,000 years? 100,000 years?  What about finding relics created out of advanced materials designed to inhibit environmental decay?   Does this happening also require actual geological processes (flooded with magma or something)?

       If they were MORE advanced than current humans don’t you think they’d have some type of housing or buildings? Do what you want, but to think anyone with an modicum of power is naturally going to lie about everything has to be a shitty way to view the world. I’m not naive that secrets are kept but holy fuck are you reaching on this one.

       For the love of intellect and open minded inquiry, realize that a rock cannot be a box or a cabinet or a pipe. Nor do rectangular cave entrances occur naturally.  Fight against cognitive dissonance by asking yourself questions, such as, is there a single example of such things anywhere on earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you can't be bothered with more than a few moments of focus, try browsing through the top 100 folder and  then come up with some terrestrial examples matching them. Shouldn't be too hard, right? I'll wait.

       The annunaki, who were known/revered as deities in Mesopotamia, were (are) actually extra-terrestrial human like aliens. They came to the earth and cross bred/hybridized their species with our recent neanderthal ancestors to create the modern evolved human, resulting in the modern era of civilization with writing, law, and religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly believe this is true. Its pre-history, so its not like there's a concrete way to say "no thats not possible". I also tend to think "the nephilim" referred to in the bible are the same thing as the annunaki extra terrestrials.

       The fallen angels were jealous of God's creation and plotted to fall to earth and take human wives for themselves. They transfigured themselves to appear as the women's husbands and impregnated them. The offspring were the nephilim giants. The book of Enoch covers this in detail.

       By this logic shouldn't there then be at least 1 or more races that lack these genes? The aliens inhabited all of the planet?
 Sub-Saharan Africans,among others like the Australian Aborigines, don't have Neanderthal/Denisovan DNA? So are they a different species?

       Even the Ancient Greeks were once mystified by what we now view as much less difficult to accomplish than the Pyramids. Lack of the ability to comprehend often leads to wild speculations. Like the Witch-trials, etc..

       makes a pretty compelling arguement based off of measurements. I'm no math whiz though, so who knows. I do tend to lend credence to it as the author was apparently one of the NASA engineers who worked on the communications systems for the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions.

       I kind of regret posting that. I took a cursory look around the web to check on the authors credentials, and he may not have played as big a role as he claims in the book. Also, the book has a few typos, and spots where a number is omitted or clearly a digit was dropped, etc... so who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still a pretty cool read though for anyone into this stuff. Brought a fresh perspective that I don't normally find in the "marketplace of ideas" around the ancient astronaut theory.

       Im sure this wont go over well here, but i think that show on history is awesome.AAT.  U just need to not listen to them or their opinions and only listen to the facts they present. There is an incredible amount in them to be researched.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the show is ridiculous on purpose anyway. Its makes it easily dismiss-able because "crazy hair guy said what! haha everything must be bullshit"  . if it was actually taken seriously, do u guys think it would of been allowed to air? its the same tactic used everywhere. censoring is way to risky and brings up more questions . going along with it and over acting it makes it laughable

       Too many possibilities and I think
       <em>
        they might all be factual

       in one way or the other.

       For example, the government probably can time travel by now. That could go back in time and change stuff. Also, steel itself decomposes very quickly, within a century; so if there were buildings built of steel back in the past we would never know.
      </p>

       I think there’s too much evidence to discount the fact that humanity was as/more advanced than we are now in the past. I’m not sure about aliens though. Consider all those gods and myths for that..

       Stone Henge and the Pyramids could be recreated today. Look at the Luxor in Las Vegas. Seriously, there's nothing in the known ancient world that we aren't able to create today. We might not know how they did it with our understanding of their understanding of the world, but that doesn't mean we aren't capable to recreate it.

      <p>
       Much more than just depicting them, we have all of these technologies today. So they were not more advanced than us. Just because they were able to imagine these inventions doesn't mean they had them. Look at any Sci-Fi movie to see all the things we depict that very well might exist in the future.

       El Dorado supposedly had gold. Lemuria supposedly existed, no advanced technology. Atlantis supposedly had technology that while not more advanced than today was certainly much more advanced than other cultures. Donno about the others. Regardless, even if Atlantis existed it doesn't prove your thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've provided no evidence that previous generations were more advanced than we are today. The evidence you've proved would be more fitting for the argument "Previous generations, while no more advanced than we are today, were more advanced than we thought they were."

       Just want to throw this into the mix! I am a huge fan of this theory, but we must accept real solutions to some of these mysteries. In particular the crazy heiroglyphs. I'm at work and can't find the link quickly but it was on reddit in the last few days... that temple with the helicopter heiroglyph is actually two different Pharaoh's names superimposed on each other. I think Rameses' dad built it originally and had his name there, but then Rameses wrote his on top and that gave us the helicopter shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still plenty of mystery left to go around though! Like wtf is up with all the cave paintings of alien like beings, or the Nazca lines?

       I always liked the theory that explains how humans just out of nowhere had a HUGE increase in brain power. Scientists cannot explain why this happened and cannot attribute it to anything. The ancient alien theory suggests that our dna was tampered with by the annunaki, to make us more competent slaves to mine for the resources they were looking for like gold or whatnot.

       Late to this post but you should definitely check out the work of „Erich van Däniken(Daeniken)“. It is the most scientific work on this subject imho and he never says it is like this or this he poses questions and you have to answer for yourself given the evidence (that is overwhelming).

       I think you still might like it. It's kind of a great way to have your cake and eat it too. Watch some wild speculation on aliens in ancient times and it's also funny to see how easily the omission of an obvious solution can allow for run away spin and narrative. Boosts your BS decorator and also helps you sift down to the truly bizarre historical objects and events that are not yet locked down into a mainstream conclusion.

       Plenty of mystery to uncover out their, but it's good to pull the weeds too.

       I specifically said your question was very broad and picked 1 topic. Like, yes extremely deep caves, rain forests, and a giant frozen fucking continent pose their own challenges and risk to explore.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're extremely remote and difficult to get to. Seems logical to me, but I'm not the one sitting here going "how do you know" in response to a question that pressure is very high at extreme depths and denying space exists or what ever shit you subscribe to.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cool? That's not "space travel", now is it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ?? You didn't state you were comparing religion to space travel and exploration you simply made an analogy between space and religion. Might want to be more clear while you're busy moving those goal posts around.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If we specifically talk about our Oceans for example, well they're extremely deep and its much easier to deal with the vacuum of space than it is to deal with the pressure that exists at extreme depths.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How do you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you seriously about to sit there and fucking argue against physics....

      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, let’s see if we can work this one out. First, we have to understand how pressure is measured. If we were to take a one inch column of air all the way up through the atmosphere, it would weigh 14.7 pounds. For this reason, we like to say that the standard air pressure (at sea level) is 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). Water weighs more than this, though. Each one inch column that’s one foot deep will weigh 0.445 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you’re right at sea level, the pressure will be 14.7 psi. And for every foot you go underwater, you add another 0.445 psi. So at one foot deep, the pressure would be 14.7 psi + 0.445 psi = 15.145 psi. And at two feet deep it would be 14.7 psi + 2
       <em>
        (0.445 psi) = 15.59 psi, etc. In order to get to 2 atmospheres worth of air pressure, you would need to get to the point where there’s 29.4 psi (2 times 14.7 psi). To get to 29.4 psi, it turns out that you would need to be 33 feet deep. (Since 14.7 psi + 33
       </em>
       0.445 psi = 29.4 psi.)

       Also keep in mind that "radiation" isn't exactly some solid wall, as long as you mitigate and deal with potential risks you can actually travel through quite concentrated sources of radiation.

       For the love of intellect and open minded inquiry, realize that a rock cannot be a box or a cabinet or a pipe. Nor do rectangular cave entrances occur naturally.  Fight against cognitive dissonance by asking yourself questions, such as, is there a single example of such things anywhere on earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you can't be bothered with more than a few moments of focus, try browsing through the top 100 folder and  then come up with some terrestrial examples matching them. Shouldn't be too hard, right? I'll wait.
