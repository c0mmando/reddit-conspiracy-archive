        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been a long time lurker of this sub and I feel I must point out what seems to me to be an obvious and absolute hypocrisy.</p>

<p>This sub is anti-globalization and anti-Nationalism.</p>

<p>This sub is more populated by individualized, atomized bugmen than even r/politics. You may THINK you&#39;ve got some big brained solution to all the problems in the world, but the level of political analysis of this sub never extends beyond &quot;we all bleed the same colour, man&quot;. Multiculturalism is synonymous with globalization, the opposite of atomization is ethnocentrism. The (European) nationalists in the Trump movement at least understand that if they don&#39;t look out for each other, nobody else will. It doesn&#39;t matter how much you preach love and acceptance, the differences in this world are too great. Diversity will no longer be a strength when England and France are Islamic Caliphates, when California is Mexican, when Italy is North African, when Australia is Chinese (already over 50% Asian) etc.</p>

<p>There is no country or community that has ever proved that multiracialism and multiculturalism are net benefits of any kind. What future can a European and a Chinaman build towards? Only one that is essentially meaningless and denies any real aspects of identity. One group must succumb to the other or they must join together and annihilate their own race. These types of communities destroy the social fabric, decrease trust in institutions, contribute to feelings of loneliness and alienation, and exacerbate the conflicts between people over scarce resources. A far-leftist professor by the name of Robert Putnam did a comprehensive investigation into the effects of diversity on communities, believing his study would reinforce his bugman worldview, and was so dismayed when it didn&#39;t that he hid his research for a decade. This is the reality of the world we live in, all peoples self-identify and organize as groups against the majority that holds democratic power. It doesn&#39;t matter much you preach individualism.</p>

<p>The general belief of this sub is that if we just all smoked weed everything would be great and we&#39;d all get along.</p>

<p>That&#39;s fucking sad, man.</p>

<p>I think people of different &quot;races&quot; can co exist in the same space. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Happened in Brazil. </p>

<p>His biggest city, Sao Paulo, has everything: Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, Italians, Arabs, Jews, Spaniards, Bolivians, etc..</p>

<p>All they during the course of History found a way to both adapt to  common, shared space, yet keeping their cultural roots without imposing them to anyone. This is what multiculturalism should be about.</p>

<p>Of course there are districts that tend to attract people from the same ethnicity and culture, like the district of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberdade_(district_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo">Liberdade</a> ) that amasses the biggest Japanese community outside of Japan. Even tho, those places are not impenetrable ghettos/no-go zones forbidden for outsiders. In fact is just the contrary, they usually tend to be touristic points.</p>

<p>It is very, very different to what is happening in Europe..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree, but most immigrants want nothing more than to assimilate with the culture they are joining. </p>

<p>Problem with recent migration is that is is not organic. Countries are being decimated and populations are being forced to leave for survival, and migration is being forced on sovereign nations.  Very odd. And many countries are not expected to take in any migrants at all. Contrived. </p>
