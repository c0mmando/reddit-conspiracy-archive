        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">121</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-29 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/axolotl_peyotl.html">axolotl_peyotl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s been about a month, and the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team has been feeling increasingly confident about the Submission Statement system.</p>

<p>For legitimate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users, the hassle appears to be negligible, and not only has it <em>significantly</em> reduced the amount of shitposting on the sub, but it also appears to be fostering more interesting and in depth discussions.</p>

<p>Now that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has reduced some of this incessant clutter, the trolls, spammers and other ne&#39;er-do-wells have now focused their attention on other tactics, namely forum sliding, brigading and abuse of the downvote/report button.</p>

<p>The abuse of the report button has increased dramatically, and it&#39;s now a regular occurrence that <em>every single</em> <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> post is being reported.</p>

<p>They&#39;re hoping to flood the report queue to make the jobs of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods unmanageable (it won&#39;t work).</p>

<p>As for the brigading, threads that go against certain narratives have been very consistent in that there&#39;s approximately a +30/-30 voting discrepancy among comments. Essentially, users that politely and rationally express their opinion are being downvoted to around -30 and users that parrot certain talking points receive the opposite treatment.</p>

<p>That&#39;s <em>not</em> to disparage anyone here who agrees with any MSM or &quot;front page&quot; narrative, as well-meaning people are being caught up on both sides of this manipulative behavior. </p>

<p>The mod team is currently discussing how to combat this type of subterfuge (no pun intended).</p>

<p>With respect to the spam, although there&#39;s been a sharp decline in spammy content, in the immortal words of Jeff Goldblum: <em>Spammers will find a way</em>.</p>

<p>Some of the spammers have learned to write a submission statement, but now there are <em>other</em> ways to spot a spammer.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7tsis3/nestle_bottles_millions_of_litres_of_canadian/">I just removed this post</a>. On the surface, it seems innocent enough: Nestle is pulling their usual bullshit.</p>

<p>However, there are certain obvious patterns that almost always surround these posts.</p>

<p>The first is the topic: spammers opt for the accessible and <em>easy</em> conspiracies. They avoid politics and head straight for the stuff that&#39;s generally embraced by most conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>In my experience, the top three go-to topics for spammers in recent history are anti-Nestle posts, anti-Scientology posts, and anti-US government financial waste (ie the Chinese billionaire calling out US debt story).</p>

<p>The next indicator of spam is the domain: without exception, they use virtually unknown websites with minimal history on reddit that are entirely devoted to lifting their material, and usually without providing the original source.</p>

<p>In today&#39;s example, the offending url pushing the Nestle story was &quot;weforum.ga&quot;. </p>

<p>When you click on these domains, you&#39;ll notice that they have next to no history being used on reddit, and often only in the last few days.</p>

<p>In this example, &quot;weforum.ga&quot; has only been used three times ever on reddit, and all three posts were submitted by OP in the last hour.</p>

<p>The next way to tell if you&#39;re dealing with a spammer is by investigating OP.
Almost without exception, the quintessential spammer&#39;s account is 2 or 3 months old, and they often have little or no account history in their first month or two.</p>

<p>Although not the case for this particular OP, the spammer&#39;s first comments are fairly consistently submitted to generic subs such as <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> or <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a>, and they usually receive <em>very</em> high numbers of upvotes (a spammer&#39;s initiation rites?).</p>

<p>Then, often, the spammer will go silent for a bit before revisiting the account and posting from one of these &quot;unknown&quot; domains.</p>

<p>The final indicator of this nefarious behavior is the vote count. In the case of today&#39;s Nestle post, it had received about a dozen or so upvotes in the first ten minutes.</p>

<p>While this may not seem <em>that</em> significant, it&#39;s important to consider that <em>all</em> the other posts surrounding it were sitting at 0 or 1 (the result of <a href="/r/conspiracy/new">/r/conspiracy/new</a> constantly being brigaded). </p>

<p>If the Nestle post wasn&#39;t removed, it already was displaying enough momentum to not only make it to the front page, but potentially the top 3 (or the #1 spot, the ultimate goal).</p>

<p>This manipulative behavior is attempting to accomplish several things: bringing in revenue for spam sites, homogenizing the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with accessible but ultimately toothless &quot;conspiracy&quot; fodder, and preventing decent material from legitimate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users from populating the front page (and hitting #1).</p>

<p>After all, since a significant portion of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers only browse <em>their</em> front page of reddit, they only are exposed to the top 1 or 2 posts on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Therefore, these top spots are under attack and are aggressively targeted if they go against certain &quot;narratives.&quot;</p>

<p>If you&#39;ll notice, when the &quot;easy&quot; conspiracies like the Nestle story are spammed to the front page, the comment sections are fairly banal and uniform, with little to no evidence of the -30/+30 comment voting discrepancy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s in the interest of certain bad actors to keep this type of spam at the top of the sub.</p>

<p>However, when topics hit the top that are deemed &quot;unsavory&quot; to certain factions, the comment section is ruthlessly attacked.</p>

<p>I caught this Nestle spammer early, but if I didn&#39;t that post would&#39;ve rocketed to the top of the sub, and its momentum would&#39;ve been largely artificial. </p>

<p>This behavior will only increase, and it&#39;s important that the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community is aware of these tactics so they can help the mod team crack down on this behavior.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or suggestions would be very much appreciated as we attempt to navigate this brave new world!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes....because the indigenous Palestinians are actually a Semitic people, unlike the white European Ashkenazi colonists who have forcibly evicted millions of Palestinians from their homes since 1948.

    <div class="md"><p>Now that the SJW and other identity issues are kinda hot,   talk of triggers,   clamping down on free speech,  now that the radical Islamist hate deal has lost some steam,  revisiting the Palestinian problem is interesting.    I mean 9/11/2001 had shifted the focus,   and the Palestinians have taken some major hits in the last decades.</p>

<p>We all know that the &quot;antisemitism&quot; thing has been misused,  and might even be wearing thin enough that the conversation gets pushed deeper into the real issues.    Antisemitism was never really the issue for most people.    </p>

<p>I think the Apartheid issue is also relevant.    Unfortunately Israeli policies benefit from continued unrest in the area,   and the US seems willing,  with Saudi help,   to make sure Israel can claim to live in a hostile area.    And leverage that hostility to silence any who question Israeli policy.</p>

<p>By the way,   Israelis of European descent are also not Semitic :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those seem to flare up alot over the weekends, for some reason.  During the week they seem to taper down.  Mods can correct me if it&#39;s a mistaken perception.</p>

<p>Just like any other topic, some are good, some are bad, and some come from bad actors trying to either stir up hate or paint the sub in the light they want. TMOR, for example, loves making bait posts just to stir up extra drama around here.  They&#39;ve been hanging out here even more than usual, the past week or two.</p>

<p>Fortunately, they&#39;re too busy with stirring up faux-rage about moderation here, during the week.  It seems that the jew-bait posts are just a weekend hobby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proof of people writing anti-semitic bait posts, including at least one guy who pretended to be a member of Stormfront. If two of them were caught, there must be many others who got away with it:</p>

<p>Joshua Ryne Goldberg is an interesting character. He was a Jewish American who wrote neo-nazi articles, posted anti-semitic stuff to Reddit, and a whole bunch of other things. He wrote an article for the Daily Stormer, a neo nazi website, that claimed &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for recruitment.&quot; His alias was Michael Slay. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On online forums Reddit and 4chan, under the name European88, he uploaded thousands of anti-semitic and racist posts as a neo-Nazi, and on the specialty neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer, he his alter-ego Michael Slay did the same.</p>

<p>This is the article he wrote for Daily Stormer, which was used by so many people as &quot;proof&quot; this sub is targeted by white supremacists and nazis for recruitment:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/5EBcB">https://archive.is/5EBcB</a></p>

<p>There is another example I am aware of. See <a href="/u/interrogatorybunny">/u/interrogatorybunny</a>. He posted a bunch of obviously racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. But his second post had proof he was actually a former <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> mod &quot;Bipolarbear0.&quot; This is one of his submissions: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/</a></p>

<p>If you see the image he posted, it says right on there &quot;bipolarbear0.&quot; Under his moderator account, he was very anti-conspiracy, but then he posts racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>Also see this post by <a href="/u/Amos_Quito">/u/Amos_Quito</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3klzcr/racist_stormfront_article_declaring_rconspiracy/">&quot;Racist&quot; Stormfront article declaring /r/Conspiracy as a &quot;Fertile Ground for Recruitment&quot; for white supremacists was actually written by Joshua Ryne Goldberg - the Florida Jew recently arrested by the FBI under terrorism-related charges</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who only browses New the submission statements have been a great addition.  It&#39;s pretty easy to tell which posts are going to get taken down due to OP not making an SS. Also it feels like there are less posts being made in general which I think is a good thing. It makes it easier to find higher quality posts. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have time to research how bots and spammers function.  I do think it&#39;s important for the real users of this sub to support each other. The best way to do that is by making useful comments to threads that add to the conversation.  </p>

<p>Also, we need to rationally and compassionately respond to others who disagree with our posts.  Sure some of the naysayers might be forum sliders, but some of them could be actual people who are just trying to figure shit out.  I believe one of the shills/spammers/bots goals is to wear down our humanity so we act surly to anyone who questions what we post. If we will fall for this trap we will end up turning away good people who are just starting to question. So practice patience and if you feel like you&#39;re getting pissed off every time you visit r/conspiracy take a break. </p>

<p>I know sometimes it feels like we&#39;re in an information war, but anger isn&#39;t going to help us win. </p>

<p>How having to read through some vague titles and Youtube links makes it harder to find quality content I&#39;m not quite sure. Quality content always stands out, (see polkadotgirl.) The suppression of such content has more to do with insta downvotes IMO.</p>

<p>Posts that get removed for not putting up a statement are told why they&#39;re being removed. I don&#39;t see how requiring a two sentence explanation on a link would dissuade any legitimate user. I&#39;ve even seen mods give friendly reminders to put up a statement.   </p>

<p>If you&#39;re only browsing new the chances of you seeing a polkadotgirl post are pretty slim, unless you&#39;re online all day. I&#39;m able to catch her posts in her sub as well as cst. She deserves the reputation she has as a quality poster but her work is not limited to this sub.   </p>

<p>From my understanding there are a lot of spam bots that post links here.  I&#39;m not to interested in spam bot links. Agree to disagree I guess. </p>

a sociology major might get some good grades for a paper detailling the connection graphs:  </p>

<p>identify all commenters/posters for this month,<br/>
classify them according to the mods decisions (not public),<br/>
see who interacts with whom positively/negatively...<br/>
too bad most users have their upvote/downvote history set to private...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Anti-Trump&quot; would be way more accurate. Things like Nunes&#39; memo, Strzok&#39;s texts, and general accusations that the FBI is biased against Trump are all heavily discussed by the MSM (Fox in particular, but plenty of other MSM outlets as well), but I&#39;m confident OP isn&#39;t referring to those when he says &quot;MSM narratives&quot;. I certainly haven&#39;t seen OP claiming that the onslaught of #releasethememo posts the other day was &quot;MSM narrative&quot; brigading, despite MSM coverage of the subject.</p>

<p>His point would be more clear if he said &quot;anti-Trump narratives&quot;, because the claimed brigading is very consistently people either attacking Trump or dismissing accusations against Trump&#39;s enemies. He used &quot;MSM narratives&quot; instead because he doesn&#39;t want to look partisan and because he knows that &quot;MSM&quot; is a loaded term around here. It&#39;s a joke to pretend that he&#39;s positive or even neutral towards people that buy the &quot;MSM narrative&quot;. It&#39;s clearly meant to dismiss those people as (at best) well-meaning idiots that have fallen victim to MSM brainwashing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a thought; Perhaps you yourself will stop spamming political threads? And possibly stop banning and muting legit users? Perhaps stop giving toxic users (u/FlyTape) power here? I&#39;ve seen him call people &quot;faggots&quot; and tell users to &quot;go fuck themselves&quot; multiple times. Yet, he&#39;s never warned or banned. Sometimes his comments just magically disappear.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not proper discourse.</p>

<p>Also, perhaps stop tagging and trying to subvert any post negative of Trump?  </p>

<p>You do realize that your mod team has banned nearly every long time (I mean years-long) users that used to participate here, right?</p>

<p>No wonder the lack of discourse, new accounts, and bots roam this wasteland. If the mods would actually let people speak instead of just banning and muting them, then maybe this sub would have a shot.</p>

<p>Just some thoughts. I hope they are taken into consideration and I&#39;m not banned, but I will go ahead and screencap this in case I am.</p>

<p>People actually want to talk about this. It&#39;s way more credible than 4chan screen caps, BUT HILLARY, DEEP STATE, SETH RICH. </p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t this sub want to discuss the biggest political conspiracy of the century so far? It&#39;s an American president, who is either a useful idiot, or being blackmailed by a foreign enemy. This is not a minor thing. We have a wannabe dictator in office, and if you don&#39;t see that, you&#39;ve clearly been indoctrinated by right-wing propaganda.</p>

<p>The are a few main reason for this. The Russiagate conspiracy is literally everywhere. It&#39;s plastered across every TV screen, periodical, and Reddit sub. Many here seek the information that is not so overtly reported from every mountain top. This conspiracy is being parroted constantly by various current and former government officials. I&#39;m not arguing against the possibility of it being true, just that when such information is so ubiquitous, it comes off more as propaganda being shoved down our throats. </p>

<p>The &quot;right-wing&quot; propaganda, as you call it, is a push back against the potential soft coup against a sitting U.S. president. Have you entertained the idea that those behind this campaign might actually be guilty of some serious crimes, and should be brought to justice for them. This doesn&#39;t absolve the right from their own misdeeds. </p>

<p>I see the dictator label get thrown around more than a football on Sunday. It falls on deaf ears when every accusation and insult that can be thrown at someone, is. It doesn&#39;t ring true with my experience, but more power to you. Resist!</p>

<p>Oh please. One of the best things about Reddit is you can read an extremely well thought out and nuanced, intelligent comment or read written by someone who named themselves YourMomsInfectedPussy or something equally horrible.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m hostile to anyone. I can admit to a disproportionate interest in Trump-related conspiracies (not necessarily impeach Trump) at the moment, though that&#39;s not at all the only thing I&#39;m interested in (the Trump conspiracy is, at the heart, but a minor part of the much larger, worldwide crony capitalism conspiracy, for instance). The Trump thing is exploding right now, so of course I&#39;m interested, but you don&#39;t have to look far into my comment history to see me engage about other ones.</p>

<p>The fact that you are trying to gatekeep like this, however, is part of your problem. And if you truly think what you wrote above is owning up (as opposed to saying you do those things because other meanies force you to), you need to go back to grade school and learn what that actually means.</p>

<p>Everyone can see it for what it is.   Talk badly about vaccines or globalism and you get harassed and buried.  Talk badly about global warming science and your harassed and buried.  Step outside of the MSM &quot;Trump is bad&quot; narrative and you&#39;re harassed and buried.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so fucking obvious that some Democrat activism organization is taking over conspiracy that everyone can see it.  Why conspiracy?  Well because they already control everything else on Reddit.</p>

<p>Well, gee, neither am I, so we have that in common. Except I don&#39;t regularly try to shut people down by suggesting they are. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And never before have I seen such an open invasion of mainstreamers who shit all over anything that doesn&#39;t align with Democrats talking points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not a Democrat and most people who talk about politics or conspiracies with me would literally lol at the idea of me holding mainstream opinions. Posters like you need to makeup your mind - one minute I get called mainstream because so many people hate Trump, then the next minute that same poster is claiming that the vast majority of people love and support Trump and I&#39;m a minority who doesn&#39;t like him. I&#39;m not sure those go together.</p>

<p>What you really need to understand is that this is not black and white. There is not a black space of Mainstream Opinions and a totally contrary and opposite white space of Flytape&#39;s Opinions. There is endless gray. My opinions usually don&#39;t fit with yours, but they don&#39;t fit with the mainstream, by and large, either. </p>

<p>At the moment, sure, some of my interests and opinions align with a larger group of people than usual (i.e. my feelings on Trump), but everyone agrees with the majority (or at least a huge amount of people) at some time. When someone says they hate murder or idk even the idea of eating toothpaste and orange juice together, do you immediately disregard their opinions on all things because they have a &#39;mainstream&#39; opinion in that regard? </p>

<p>Just because Trump is incredibly unpopular with all sorts of people doesn&#39;t make not licking Trump&#39;s asshole the same as loving and agreeing with the mainstream opinion 100% of the time. </p>

<p>As for your final point, about wanting this to be the one site that doesn&#39;t fit with your idea of the mainstream/MSM? Cry me a river. If everyone felt this way this sub wouldn&#39;t exist because everyone would have a different definition. I don&#39;t post on the other subs you mentioned because I don&#39;t like them - ironically, my opinions on there are largely unpopular and there isn&#39;t much discussion that I can relate to. Shockingly, I&#39;ve come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to talk about conspiracies, political and not. Sorry that doesn&#39;t work for you, but crying that this should be a more conservative space because you don&#39;t think other subs are conservative enough makes no sense. </p>

<p>13 - Submission Statements are required for link posts (including images).
A submission statement is a top level reply to a post that meets the following criteria:</p>

<p>Is 2+ sentences
Is written in OP&#39;s own words (i.e. not copied from the article or description)
Should explain or elaborate on why the link is being posted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and why the userbase should care about it.
Link posts without a Statement will be removed after 20 minutes and repeat offenders are subject to a ban.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t been the biggest fan of Axolotl but this is a really good post. The content on weforum.ga, though not necessarily being fake news, is following all of the rules you see on other fake news sites like shareblue or dailymail (the biggest one being that links never go outside the domain).</p>

<p>The OP is posting links to weforum in an attempt to monetize that traffic. This is very promising progress if we&#39;re identifying these kinds of posts.</p>

<p>Now on to the elephant in the room: partisanship. The biggest problem I see in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is that it&#39;s getting harder and harder to reconcile the worldview of &quot;fake news trumpers&quot; with everyone else. Even when dealing with outside views (MSM front pagers) we see the fake news trumpers getting defensive and complaining that we&#39;re getting brigaded (lol) while older users understand the spin on MSM news and we go to the source materials. Older users aren&#39;t threatened by these kinds of things. We use knowledge and are secure in our beliefs.</p>

<p>Fake news trumpers aren&#39;t like that. They have no interest in primary sources and from what I&#39;m seeing on reddit and in everyday life I&#39;m 100% sure that they have no idea what the liberal side even believes. They never hear what a liberal says, they just hear what a talking head SAYS a liberal said (which is almost always wrong when you go to the primary source). When you go to breitbart / dailymail / AM radio, it&#39;s exactly the same thing as shareblue in the sense that they&#39;re demonizing the other side and will consistently go out of their way to mis-represent the news if that helps in the demonizing.</p>

<p>What terrifies me is that we, as a group, allow links from trash conservative sites but downvote trash liberal sites. It&#39;s clear we have an information and communication breakdown going on here and I&#39;m not sure what the answer is when people refuse to look at primary sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I was discussing the interactions of 3 groups: &quot;fake news trumpers&quot; &quot;older conspiracy users&quot; and &quot;MSM front pagers&quot;</p>

<p>Also I think you&#39;re mis-referencing Hegelian Dialectic. How does that apply exactly?</p>

<p>Also also, of course we&#39;re all individuals but if you&#39;re going to deny individuals to be put into groups then there&#39;s no way we can analyze the group. Grouping people is how we make progress, even if it&#39;s uncomfortable. (For example: gay men couldn&#39;t donate blood for the longest time because of aids. Individuals have aids, but we applied the rule to the group because it helped us move forward.)</p>

<p>And lastly, yes I understand how people think that I&#39;m a shill. I disagree with the MSM narrative and the Trump narrative. I grew up in a very conservative family where I was hated for being &quot;the liberal&quot; and went to a very liberal college where I was hated for being &quot;the conservative.&quot; I&#39;ve been called a shill my whole life for not playing along. People like their echo chambers on both sides and until those echo chambers are broken we will not be able to communicate across the aisle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real big textbook &quot;official&quot; conspiracies which are so flimsy and simply can not be true, should never get downvoted on a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sub because they are fascinating which ever way you look at them.</p>

<p>That is how you know they are being manipulated by non genuine users of this sub, paid or otherwise, I actually hope they are paid or these defenders of &quot;official&quot; narratives are proper sad losers.</p>

<p>For some instances of &quot;official&quot; conspiracies that simply can not be true include the &quot;official&quot; account of the JFK murder, the &quot;official&quot; account of the Apollo program, the &quot;official&quot; account of 9/11, various &quot;official&quot; accounts of mass shootings etc etc</p>

<p>I disagree with this. There have always been plenty of interesting and in depth conversations. Maybe they just weren&#39;t about the things you find important or interesting. </p>

<p>The effort to control the discourse on this sub by you guys is disconcerting. I understand you guys as mods probably deal with more shit than most, but that shouldn&#39;t mean you crack down like a police force. If you need help, add more mods. </p>

<p>You cry about a couple of shitposters (yeah I&#39;ve made a shitpost or two in my day.) Instead of letting people be themselves, you would rather control the narrative like every other censorship happy idiot out there. I know a lot of users are going to disagree with me on this.

<p>Decreasing the amount of information available on this sub not only makes it vacant and boring, it makes the job of the &quot;damage controllers&quot; easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the submission statement is overly controlling.  Before the rule, it was quite common for people to post a link to a youtube video - and I would scratch my head after watching a few moments still unable to figure out what the conspiracy was.

<p>Here with the SS, the OP can get the discussion ball rolling with a few sentences.  So, a little more effort than just posting a link, but not that much.  And if the OP&#39;s purpose of posting is to educate and start discussion, the effort taken to create the SS should be a reasonable cost for entry.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree the non-descriptive links were baffling at times, but I never thought their number was such that it made the sub unbrowsable. Isn&#39;t part of the fun investigating these links and trying to discern what the possible conspiracy could be, or what information can be taken from it in general. Maybe I don&#39;t want to follow that link, but what about others? I think the sub statement may narrow the available content by forcing users who may not be well versed in conspiracy culture to make a statement. Unless it&#39;s acceptable to just write a sub statement like - </p>

<p>Sub statement - Hey guys, just found this weird link about such and such. Is there a conspiracy here?</p>

<p>again, upvoted your clear opinion that I disagree with but can appreciate your perspective.</p>

<p>The only thing I truly found irritating was when an article would be posted several times (both sides of the political spectrum have been guilty of this.) </p>

<p>If people want a conspiracy perspective on something, they come here. Conspiracy culture encompasses a huge array of topics. I&#39;m not one to go through and click on all the links, but I see how it would be frustrating to be constantly mislead about the quality of the content being posted.</p>

<p>Decreasing the amount of information available on this sub not only makes it vacant and boring,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In information theory, entropy is defined as the average amount of information produced by a stochastic source of data. More bits of data does not necessarily mean more entropy, which is what is actually desirable. If there are 20 posts in a given hour, 18 saying the same thing, and all the comments saying the essentially the same thing, that&#39;s less actual information than 5 posts in the hour about different topics.</p>

<p>You may be one of the few people here who has time to read the whole sub, especially as it was before rule 13 was implemented, but most people don&#39;t. They read what they can from /new, or they read what they can from /hot. If these queues are filled up with repeated content, or content from posters who didn&#39;t even bother to explain why it should be here, these users are going to see less information. Signal to noise ration is another concept in information theory and signal processing, and I do think rule 13 has dramatically increased our signal to noise ratio. </p>

<p>And the other thing is, we aren&#39;t preventing any information from coming out, we&#39;re just putting the onus on the posters to explain why it should be here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for addressing one of my issues. I&#39;ve seen some good comments by you lately and I&#39;m appreciative of it.</p>

<p>I think your example is a bit of an exaggeration.</p>

<p>Other subs remove an article if it has already been posted. Should there be a limit per day of a specific article? Would this help to cut down on the issue of breaking news being spammed? Again, I never noticed anything even close to what you described, no matter the &quot;bombshell revelation.&quot;</p>

<p>While I appreciate your interest in ensuring that the most important messages aren&#39;t drowned out by nonsense, I&#39;m skeptical that the problem was as bad as you think it was, even with your being a mod. In all honesty, I have spent entirely too much time on this sub and have not experienced anything resembling your example. </p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is your theory would be correct if it were applied to the U.S. bulk collection of data on U.S. citizens. Not so much when applied to a small sub on Reddit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested to know what information you feel was drowned out the most amidst all the noise.</p>

<p>The attack for the subconscious is always underway. By neutering sites such as this the narrative of &#39;wrongthink&#39; is heavily enforced. </p>

<p>Getting real conspiracies to the top shows how prevalent they are. It reduces the perceived stigmatism of being the only one to call things out. </p>

<p>Just look at the vote brigading. Heavily up-vote those who are conforming, down-vote and ridicule anyone who pushes against the narrative. Isolate them through social shaming. Might as well be at Harvard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My suggestion? Let the bought and paid for pieces of shit have it. Create a new sub, hire diligent mods to actually pay attention to the comment section of posts and not just the posts themselves, start banning obvious shills. </p>

<p>This place is r/politics2.0 and that really fuckin sucks. It used to be so fun to be here, interesting things about alternate history, aliens, hidden technology, time travel, you know, real Fortean shit. I lurked for <strong>years</strong> before I  made a an account and this sub is one of the 3 that made me register to this shitty compromised site in the first place. Theres <strong>maybe</strong>* 5-10 legit conspiracy posts here a day now. Everything else is regurgitated MSM drivel shat forth by cocksuckers with no life and somebody writing checks to them for being sub disruptors. </p>

<p>Do we need 730 posts about Russia every single goddamned day? I mean we haven&#39;t gotten much in the way of any new information but there it is, Every. Single. Day. </p>

<p>It&#39;s over. This sub is dead and lives in name only. Let the shitsucking shills talk amongst themselves.</p>

<p>I know it sucks to lose something you care about, considered somewhat of an escape and maybe even a home, but <strong>sometimes you have to concede a battle to win the war.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude seriously? 1 mention of anything positive about Trump and you can expect to end up -25 at least. I&#39;m not denying that&#39;s theres Trump shills here too, but fact of the matter is that they&#39;re <strong>vastly</strong> outnumbered.</p>

<p>Any mention of the Nunes memo, any mention of the Strzok texts, any mention of the FISA bullshit and investigation, any mention of the Clinton Foundation, any mention of there being a conflict of interest with certain people involved in the collusion investigation, any mention of Seth Rich, any mention of anything whatsoever suggests a railroad attempt and a couple of the elected president is fucking <strong>Bombarded</strong> and ends up with more downvotes than the number of minutes the post&#39;s age is.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there&#39;s 33,000 posts a day about Russia. What more do we know now about the collusion evidence than we did 6 months ago? Yet they&#39;re all upvoted astronomically. The same people who upvoted those repetitive informationless posts are the same people who downvote anything pertaining to the fusion gps dossier and FISA memos and the subsequent investigation which conveniently are shrugged off as shilling, comment sections derailed,  no matter how topical, threads about anything casting doubt on the integrity of the Trump investigation are brigaded by posters pulling out their best whatasboutisms and abusing the downvote button against anyone who dare not swallow the hook on the line that the MSM constantly cast into our water.</p>

<p>Posts calling for release of the memos, posts questioning the integrity of the email server investigation, posts that dare not drink the establishment Flavor-Aid on any Trump post are decimated, while asking where this level of scrutiny was when obstruction of justice/coordinated cover up are are decimated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty fuckin one-sided here now. The one place on Reddit that is supposed to be nonpartisan is definitely divided and yeah there maybe be a handful of T_D faithful upvoting any pro Trump post exist, but while they may get a post or comment up to +12 or so early on, it quickly swimgz back to the extreme end of the opposite side.  But anything making Trump out to be guilty of selling our country&#39;s sovereignty to Russia may hit a snag early on, they always end up way in the positives. </p>

<p>I voted for Donald Trump. I support him as my county&#39;s president.</p>

<p>If he did something illegal(i.e. collude with the Russian government etc) then not only should he be impeached, he should led to the gallows. No sympathy if he indeed sold this countrys sovereignty. Swiftly, publicly, and without the rest of his family deported.</p>

<p>Thing is, nobody has seen anything that would lead us to believe that this collusion investigation is anything but partisanship and an attempt to subvert  the presidential election.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we have what may be a huge scandal in Nunes FISA memo, the Uranium 1 scandal, the refusal to allow anyone except the company the DNC paid to analyze the alleged Russiam hack of their server, yet if you bring any skepticism to anything regarding those events as explained by MSM then you&#39;re targeted and harassed. It&#39;s proven that the Democrats literally colluded with the Russian government to produce the Steelers dossier but mention that and you&#39;re downvoted into Oblivion to hide the comment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one sided discrimination and attempted censorship,/discreditation and it&#39;s prevalent in this sub.</p>

It&#39;s not some Internet Stranger I think is a dick because I had too many beers or a shitty day (<em>I&#39;ve been guilty of maybe being a bit too sarcastic myself</em>) but people who just seem shady. </p>

<p>People who use the tactics you have outlined. I created a RAG system (<em>Red, Amber, Green</em>) where if I see something that is very questionable you get tagged like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>1x Possible Shill (Colored Red)</li>
<li>1x Keep Watch (Colored Yellow)</li>
<li>1x Friend of the Community (Colored Green)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any violation, which is admittedly in my own eyes, changes your number to something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>3x Possible Shill (Colored Red)</li>
<li>-1x Keep Watch (Colored Yellow)</li>
<li>2x Friend of the Community (Colored Green)</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea behind it is for me to recognize those I&#39;ve come across in the past. </p>

<p>Getting to the point... it has been working really well for me. I&#39;ve noticed some real patterns after I started tagging people. I want to share this list but I don&#39;t also want to be part of a witch hunt because like anyone I make mistakes. </p>

<p>My question to you and the rest of the mods. Do you think there is a safe way to share this info if I and others continue to do something like this? Or would you prefer we keep using the report button?</p>

It works (at least until 6+ month old accounts become more of a commodity, in which case it is at least costing these ne&#39;er-do-wells and their puppet masters increasingly more as time progresses).

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has browsed New for many years, I don&#39;t like the decrease in information. I&#39;ll take the bad with the good any day. There&#39;s no telling what some random post may bring to this sub. It could also be posted at the perfect time to go viral. Alas, if the user is unfamiliar with a rule that is not enforced on most of Reddit, it gets removed. This could also dissuade new users from continuing to participate.</p>

<p>How having to read through some vague titles and Youtube links makes it harder to find quality content I&#39;m not quite sure. Quality content always stands out, (see polkadotgirl.) The suppression of such content has more to do with insta downvotes IMO.</p>

<p>This place is supposed to be critical of all sides. There are dozens of users here with names like Kilary, and Hillary eats babies, etc. Doesn&#39;t bother me one bit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much expected in conspiracy circles. Unfortunately, it seems like those old circles have all turned into trump supporters. </p>

<p>As far as using this to get you banned goes, I am not. I&#39;m simply using you as an example. There Re plenty of accounts doing the same thing... gaslighting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to gatekeep anything.  I&#39;m not a part of any organized resistance that downvotes all the wrong think and takes over communities which aren&#39;t in alignment with the goals.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been posting on conspiracy for years 6 or 7 I quit counting.  And never before have I seen such an open invasion of mainstreamers who shit all over anything that doesn&#39;t align with Democrats talking points.</p>

<p>Everyone can see it for what it is.   Talk badly about vaccines or globalism and you get harassed and buried.  Talk badly about global warming science and your harassed and buried.  Step outside of the MSM &quot;Trump is bad&quot; narrative and you&#39;re harassed and buried.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so fucking obvious that some Democrat activism organization is taking over conspiracy that everyone can see it.  Why conspiracy?  Well because they already control everything else on Reddit.</p>

<p>Is it too much to ask that one subreddit on this site isn&#39;t repeating the same MSM nonsense narrative?  Tell me you can&#39;t go to /news, /world news, /politics or any number of other subs to discuss the Russian collusion narrative.  </p>
