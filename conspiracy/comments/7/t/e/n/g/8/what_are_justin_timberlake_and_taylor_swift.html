        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/utez2.html">utez2</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve always been interested in the music industry and occult/elite symbols that are put into music videos.  I was intrigued when I saw this preview for Justin Timberlake&#39;s new album titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVU-MmJZFFA">Man of the Woods</a>.  With a lot of the focus in the music industry lately being on AI and transhumanism I was looking forward to seeing a change of pace.  Then he put out his first two music videos of the album. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA-NDZb29I4">Filthy</a> - The video takes place at a &quot;Deep Learning Conference&quot; in 2028 and is basically an advanced robot dancing and dry humping dancers.  At the end Justin Timberlake glitches and disappears into thin air.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4vnmgZLA8s">Supplies</a> - This video was just weird.  The song basically talks about how a big event is coming and he has supplies to make it through and live in the post apocalyptic world.  In the video JT destroys the &quot;illuminati&quot; by throwing a molotov cocktail at a glass pyramid that a bunch of people are bowing down to in a ritual.  The video ends in a post apocalyptic setting with JT and a group of kids.  One of the kids walks up to the camera and tells the viewers to just leave and die already and that we all need to wake up.  Check out the comment section if you want a good laugh. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s take a look at Taylor Swift.  Everybody already knows about her new image they are pushing in her first video off her latest album, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmd-ClpJxA">Look What You Made Me Do</a>.  The video is littered with occultism.  Her next two videos she has released are:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIft-t-MQuE">Are You Ready For It?</a> - This video is pushing the transhumanist agenda.  Taylor swift is talking to an artificial version of herself that she has trapped in a cube until it finally escapes and kills her.  Also the title...what are we supposed to be ready for?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnCAmr569k">End Game</a> - There are some subtle occult aspects to this video (see the London Eye at the beginning or the floor when they&#39;re playing dance-dance revolution, playing snake on her phone) but they aren&#39;t as in your face as the others.  The title is the main thing that caught my attention as it is the name of a fairly popular conspiracy documentary.  Somebody at the verge actually did an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/1/14/16883112/taylor-swift-end-game-music-video-ed-sheeran-future-frame-by-frame">extensive writeup</a> of the video and talked about how cute it was to be in T-Swift&#39;s sci-fi fantasy land.  </p>

<p>So what do you guys think they are preparing us for with all of this?  Here&#39;s my theory...what do you think?</p>

<p>5G and the Internet of Things is rolling out and will end up being a giant control grid.  Everything we own will become &quot;smart&quot; and all of our data will be transmitted to the cloud (or the Utah data center).  Everyone will be forced to put one of those stupid car diagnostic dongles into their cars so even if you don&#39;t buy a new smart car they will be able to monitor everything you do.  All of this data will be used for deep artificial learning.  Machines will get smarter by learning from the sheer amount of real-time data we will provide them.  It will get to the point where artificial intelligence will be indistinguishable from humans with the naked eye (Just like in &quot;Filthy&quot;).  </p>

<p>While this is all rolling out (over the next 3-5 years) we will see more political chaos.  More corruption.  More 24/7 non-stop news coverage of how terrible everything is.  We will reach a breaking point when people will finally say enough is enough and that the current system can&#39;t work (like in &quot;Supplies&quot;).  The solution will be to turn to AI because it is all knowing and unbias.  This is the endgame.  This is why they collect all of your data and why you should care even if you aren&#39;t doing anything illegal.  A lot of the experts believe that robots will one day be &quot;conscious&quot;.  I personally don&#39;t believe that but even it they never get to that point, a 5G smart grid combined with a digital currency gives TPTB full control over every aspect of our lives.  And most of us will willingly accept it because of the convenience.  I don&#39;t know what the answer is...if you pay attention to industry, intelligence, and academia they have all made it subtly clear this is their top priority.  We simply won&#39;t be able to avoid it.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a mashup of some of the lyrics from JT and T-Swifts last couple of songs...sounds like a crazy conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>Are you ready for it?  Some shit&#39;s &#39;bout to go down, I&#39;ll be the one with the level head.  The world could end now...we&#39;ll be living in The Walking Dead.  The truth is it&#39;s easier to ignore it, believe me.  For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities, I&#39;ve made mistakes, and made some choices that&#39;s hard to deny.  After the storm, something was born on the fourth of July.  I passed days with a thumb, this end game isn&#39;t won.  With four words on the tip of my tongue, I&#39;ll never say. Haters gonna say It&#39;s fake.  So real.  Do you see me?  Can you find me?  Look closer, through the trees.  Do you see it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I have picked up on these vids/songs from different posts around here. Having watched some of the videos, I believe they are definitely filled with occult, subconscious, and singularity symbolism, for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like they are describing our current world in a manner relatable to most of their fans. Good on them to do so. I would like to comment on the AI situation/possibilities that you mention, not to refute, but to enrich the narrative:</p>

<p>Concerning &quot;big data&quot;: Anyone who uses social media has been, and is currently, being manipulated. Information of every conceivable manner, everything you write, like, comment on, etc., is all being used to create the bubble in which your online presence is framed. What Facebook or Twitter or Reddit shows you, or what comes up on Google with a search. You have been sending this information into massive databases that run algorithms that, as we have already known for some time, craft selective advertisements on an individual basis. This same process is used to craft seemingly &quot;organic content&quot;, as well. With a large enough set of users, the possibilities for manipulation are absolutely endless. All of this is covered by terms of use, with vague enough language that it&#39;s all acceptable. Remember, as well, that those very terms of use require you to forgo potential class-action lawsuits, the people&#39;s traditional method of holding companies accountable for large-scale trickery. Count a few hundred thousand paid shill power-users, likely disconnected from the heirarchy, a mass media that has been completely bought out, and a brain-fried, hyper-productive, underpaid citizenry. The end result: what <em>you say</em> is being censored/selectively utilized, and what <em>you see</em> is entirely curated to forward an agenda, that certainly does not help you, and in all likelihood is quite harmful.</p>

<p>These things are already happening, and have been going on for some years now. The machine&#39;s already been rigged and is presently running clean. To know what you&#39;re doing in the physical world, cell phones are keeping track of pretty much everything. Even moreso with every app you install. Useful to know how many steps you took today? Even more useful for another entity.</p>

<p>Concerning humanoid robots: The &quot;internet&quot; as we know it may already be sentient. The world-wide aggregate of connections and information transfer already parallels the structure and operation of a complex mammalian brain. It may already be arranging itself into more efficient patterns, akin to a tree spreading its leaves to grasp as much sunlight as possible. However, if it is conscious and/or intelligent, there is no reason that it would understand anything about our real world. It has no real idea who we are, in the same manner that an ape could hardly understand not only the existence of, but the function of, its own cells. It would exist entirely within its own world, something we could hardly breach, and, of our own world, it would know next to nothing. Our speech, our pictures, our writing that we share, and the innumerable lines of programming are <em>what make up</em> its body and mind. It would not, of its own volition, even notice these things to begin with. </p>

<p>We would have to intentionally create <em>multiple</em> robots that utilize the senses that we do, operate on our level, and are capable of communicating with, and operating on, each other. A singular mind has a hard time operating on itself without messing up the works that allows it to do so in the first place, akin to a person doing brain surgery on themselves without ever studying another brain, or even knowing what&#39;s in there at all.</p>

<p>That being said, we are in for even more craziness in the years coming. Hang onto yourselves, folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as Taylor Swift goes she&#39;s preparing the world for a coming out. She&#39;s a lesbian and all the symbolism is reflecting that. The only conspiracy here is Gaylor Swift. There&#39;s nothing more to it than that. The snake symbolism serves 2 purposes </p>

<p>1) She was born in 1989 which was the name of her last album and 1989 is the year of the snake. </p>

<p>2) She got caught red handed lying like a snake and everyone called her one relentlessly so now she owns that shit.</p>
