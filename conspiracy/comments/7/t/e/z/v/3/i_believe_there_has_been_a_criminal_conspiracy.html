       Interesting to hear a Congressman use "criminal conspiracy".  You can be punished for both the conspiracy and the actual crime itself if, it were completed.

       This is the conspiracy sub and Trump happens to be at the center of many consider to be an extremely large conspiracy. So why do you find it odd that people here talk about it? You can head over to The_Donald if you don't want to see negative things about your god emperor.

       Donald Trump dominates American politics, why would he not be the main topic of discussion? There are posts about other people there, but the president makes headlines so often it's why he's there all the time. He's a very loud president.

       We don't. This topic is just brigaded and hit with vote manipulation. There are actually plenty of people here who like Trump, and even the people like me who hate him still generally understand that the corporate media is lying about him. None of the legitimate members of this community buy the corporate media's bullshit. They ignore legitimate criticism of his horrible policies while praising him for bombing innocents. As another commenter pointed out, Trump is human garbage, but he's not a Russian spy and the media will never tell you the ways that he really is awful. Because they actually like when the US military does illegal acts of war.

       Whoa you seem to have drank of the mainstream koolaid. You know nothing about Trump unless you know him personally.

       Anything else is conjecture or media spin.

       Obama won the peace prize while he was droning innocent people in the Middle East. Did the media report on that? Nope! It didn't fit the narrative.

       Fox News confirmed it really? Because if you look at the original new York times article it said 4 anonymous sources. The same bullshit they have been spewing for the last year. If they had shit on him it would have came out by now. It's a giant farce. Remember Obama saying it is impossible to hack the election like a month before Hillary lost?

       I want you to know that those 4 anonymous sources are all people who have the same lawyer and are involved in the Mueller Probe. Sources stay anonymous all the time, that‚Äôs the standard in any news organization especially when there is an ongoing investigation. I‚Äôm not a full on russiagater but to think that Trump is innocent is being willfully ignorant.

      </p>
      <p>
       1) That Trump Colluded with the Russians in various ways to tip the election in his favor
2) That the "Deep State" is engineering a Coup d'√©tat through manufacturing the Russian Collusion story with an eye towards eventually getting Trump on Obstruction of the investigation

I mean he barely has a grasp on the English language, sometimes I feel like we are living in post soviet Russia. I mean Yeltsin was literally drooling out of his mouth giving speeches by the end of his presidency, won‚Äôt be surprised if its the same with trump. I mean all those amphetamines he‚Äôs popping.

       He represents my area. I am ashamed to admit that. Here locally he has championed every single cause that is popular but has accomplished nothing. In some places he's made the issues worse by trying to get things done in a half-assed way. 
He wants to be a Trump but comes across like a hyper active 5 year old that's been forced to sit in a chair.

       Matt Gaetz is probably one of the loudest voices trying to discredit and undermine an investigation into said president.

       </a>
       several times, even on the House floor

       Any yet, nothing in your comment does anything to disprove what he is saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       You start with an assumption that everything he is saying is only to discredit an active investigation. Which you don't know to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of simply trying to impugn his character, how about attempting to argue against what the Congressman is saying? Why should anyone read what you are writing and believe it over the word of this person? You have opinions. Gaetz has read the information.

       That's the problem. These people think they don't need to prove or disprove anything, because they've been conditioned to think there is no chance that they're wrong.

       Gaetz has the same access to the Simpson transcripts we all do, plus more intel than I‚Äôll ever be able to have. In the testimony, Simpson talks about how Steele stopped sharing into with the FBI, and now the NYT article on Halloween where FBI insiders said there was nothing to the Trump/Russia stuff made him believe there was a pro-Trump bias at the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basis for his claims have been the Strzok texts and what he‚Äôs been told is in the memo, according to him. I personally don‚Äôt think Strzok and Page‚Äôs texts are proof of a criminal conspiracy, I don‚Äôt think a singular reference to a secret society in 50,000 texts is proof that there was a secret society out to get Trump
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is alleged to have ordered aides to do the exact sort of attacks Gaetz is making to discredit them as witnesses
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaetz starts going on this crusade the week after he rides to Florida with Trump

       So what is contained within the memo is important, and you haven't read it. In fact, you don't even address the memo. Or what is contained within the memo. Or what the memo is based on.

       You don't have to think anything. Nobody is concerned with what you think. What the concern is, at the point, is finding the rest of the text messages (they have) and understanding the full context of their actions, and whether the
       <em>
        totality
       </em>
       of the texts (you are assuming there is only one for some reason) show a larger narrative at play.

      <p>
       I'm not sure why any of us are supposed to buy in to these anonymous reports. If you want to take them as gospel, you can. But you still have to actually prove that this is
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       distraction. You are essentially saying these people are lying, in order to distract. But you can't prove that they are lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially you have no argument against Gaetz that the
       <strong>
        memo is a huge deal that details a larger criminal conspiracy
       </strong>
       . You just don't feel like it is true, and therefore conclude it is only distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll excuse me if I don't find that too compelling.

       The press undermine themselves on the daily. If they'd get their shit together Trump's claims of fake news wouldn't hold water. But they do. And that's their own fault. Onus is on them.

       If the Dems were half as left wing as you say they were than I would have voted for clinton. But yeah dude the Dems are pro capitalism, don‚Äôt know where you got the idea they aren‚Äôt. I mean the Clintons literally spearheaded neoliberalism here in the US.

       Idk you need open borders to fund the slave wage capitalism requires. You also need that to keep countries destabilized which feed into the military industrial complex through the need of weapons etc.

       Not sure where you're getting communism from---no nations exist that are true communist or socialist.
