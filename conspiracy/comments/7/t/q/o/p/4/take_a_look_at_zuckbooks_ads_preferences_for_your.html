    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, Facebook has the potential to do something nefarious with  the information some of you willingly give them? Is anyone the least bit surprised about this? I&#39;m glad l never lost that early &#39;00 internet mindset, if you had an overview of my online activity I&#39;d appear to be a couple dozen different people. You people that use Facebook make it so easy, just open your doors, open all your closets, fling open your drawers, lay your documents out, your agenda, your email, all your communications, line everything up nice and pretty for them so they can take a good look through your things, run all that information, constantly, though an algorithm. I&#39;m willing to bet that Facebook knows more about you than you know about you.</p>

<p>There&#39;s probably no way this could end badly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe in the past, but a friend recounted a recent encounter that made me straight up delete my Facebook account.  </p>

<p>My friend set his Facebook privacy settings as high as  you can.  You can find him in the search, but all you get is the thumbnail profile picture and his name.  No further details.  No access to seeing who&#39;s on his friends list, etc.  His friends list is pretty small, under a hundred people mostly from high school and some co workers and family.</p>

<p>He was visited by police detectives from another county(not local PD) looking for An acquaintance of his they wanted to interview.  A lot of this interview was about how the acquaintance might know something about what they&#39;re investigating and may be out of fear for their life they&#39;ve gone quiet, haven&#39;t been home in weeks, no one is co operating, etc.</p>

<p>My friend didn&#39;t know the acquaintance well, had met through work and hung out a couple of times but weren&#39;t close.  The detectives were pushy about finding the acquaintance saying people aren&#39;t being truthful and no one&#39;s giving leads.  Eventually they got onto the topic of his Facebook, telling him they&#39;d been reading up on his page, talking about who hes friends with on there, liked some of the pictures he puts up(Trump memes) and commented about the dash cam video he&#39;d put up a few days ago(he didn&#39;t put it up on YouTube or any other social media, you had to be a friend on Facebook to see it).  Yup, they saw it.  They saw his whole account.</p>

<p>And he asked them point blank and they said they needed to figure out who he was before they came to ask questions.  Or as he figured, it was a passive intimidation to get him to tell them where the acquaintance is.  He asked about a warrant and they said they didn&#39;t need one.  They just contacted Facebook and after verifying they&#39;re really police detectives Facebook gave them access.  Sounds like bullshit right?</p>

<p>Well there&#39;s a feature in Facebook where you can check where recent logins have happened(what area and IP address).  Sure enough, a recent login was from an IP in that county.  They didn&#39;t even try to hide behind a VPN.</p>

<p>Sure enough if you look in Facebook&#39;s policy on Law Enforcement they state they openly cooperate with Law Enforcement requests.</p>

<p>And that was the week I quit Facebook after hearing that and seeing my friends recent logins and looking into Facebook&#39;s policy.  </p>

<p>It was the same kind of policy we had when I worked at a video store chain.  If police came asking about someone&#39;s account we would just give them the account info, not ask for a warrant.  The only thing we didn&#39;t give without warrant was security camera footage, but account info we didn&#39;t care.  I think most managers figured less of a problem to just give it up rather than deal with the legal department.</p>

<p>So take that tale however you will, but it made me delete my Facebook and not look back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. Couple of thoughts. First, Facebook&#39;s policy on cooperating with Law Enforcement means that they will not resist lawful warrants; not that they will give over information sans a warrant. Did the cops have a warrant for your friend&#39;s Facebook info?  </p>

<p>Second, did your friend have his profile set so that only Friends could see his page? Or was it set to &quot;friends of friends?&quot; If it was the latter, all the cops have to do is become friends with one of your friends and they can see your page. If it&#39;s the former, all the cops have to do is pretend to be someone you know, or even just add you as a friend because a lot of people accept all friend requests.  </p>

<p>But if none of those things happened, then what you said it super shady! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He asked and they told him they didn&#39;t need one.  They just contacted Facebook and were given access.  Maybe they were just lying to him as a passive intimidation but they really didn&#39;t need to since they determined he couldn&#39;t help them and he hasn&#39;t heard from them since that one encounter.  There was no good cop bad cop routine they were just asking questions about recent hangouts and if he knows places the acquaintance frequents.  He said it was very casual aside from when they started to talk about his Facebook profile.</p>

<p>He set his profile to Friends only.  So if I were to log out, make a new account, and look him up I would just see the thumbnail and his name.  Wasn&#39;t able to see or access anything else.  I don&#39;t think you can see someone&#39;s account by being friends of their friends in that setting.  They would have had to friend request him directly. </p>

<p>The recent login was the give away they weren&#39;t  kidding.  It was right there.  A single login earlier in the week that stated the city and county they were from.</p>

<p>As for policy, who knows maybe they did have a warrant, but then again, maybe Facebook approaches it the same way my store did.  Be as helpful to law enforcement with simple requests and avoid problems by just giving them what they ask for instead of demanding a warrant.</p>

<p>Shady, but there&#39;s nothing stopping that from happening.</p>

<p>some cops/detectives are dirty and would hack an account to get information, then reverse engineer an evidence trail that can be used in court. they do this with intercepting text messages using fake towers as well.</p>

<p>also its very common that they get an informant to give them information from their facebook, and cops will create fake facebook accounts as well using other peoples pictures and info. </p>

But they got most of my details wrong, which makes me feel far better about my place in the data machine. For others that are on Facebook, Iâ€™m curious as to whether your categories were accurate!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Russia the Bolshevik Jews made lists of people they didn&#39;t like for petty reasons that instructed to shoot on sight, gulag etc. and they went around and murdered people a decade before the Nazis. Then they started murdering themselves until they murdered themselves out of the Soviet Innner Party and the Communism they created. Reduced to a minor role on the oppression of the Russian people they turned into spies for America and started to sabotage Russia in every conceivable way until Russia had no choice but to release them all to Israel, UK, Cananda and the USA. You&#39;re a fool if you think they aren&#39;t still Communists murders. </p>
