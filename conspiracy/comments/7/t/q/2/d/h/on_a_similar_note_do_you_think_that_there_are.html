    <div class="md"><p>I’ve seen some UFOs/UAPs but I’ve never been visited by any physical beings. I have seen some unexplained phenomena such as what I guess was an angry poltergeist pick up a garbage can and smash it into the porch in my backyard. As a kid I saw some strange shadow dwarf looking creature performing some kind of odd dance in the deep woods. Through meditation and sacred plants I’ve experienced contact with higher dimensional energies that completely changed my perspective about this realm we live in. I’ve seen the shadow people and at times I can see a persons aura or light signature. </p>

<p>I’ve experienced the wisdom and grace of Jesus Christ, but unfortunately not many people want to hear about that stuff. It truly miraculous FWIW. </p>

<p>I guess the main reason I doubt the existence of physical space aliens is because I’ve never personally had any encounters, thus I’d love to hear about yours.</p>

<p>So you’ve had more than one? If you don’t mind I would really like to hear about this is detail. Feel free to DM me if you would feel more comfortable. I have always just felt physical extra terrestrials were a man made invention, but I could be wrong about that. Please do share. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>This is pretty close to what I experienced only it was being projected through back lighting that was coming though the back porch sliding glass door. And from that point on I catch glancing looks at figures that feel like they are watching me. But it could all just be some kind of schizophrenic tick. </p>

<p>And in 2012 I had what I guess you would call a &quot;vision&quot;, &quot;incite&quot; or a random conceptual visualization on the interaction of 4D objects passing or interacting with our 3D experience. I became transfixed for weeks trying to get the idea out of my head and on paper in some way. I doubt there is any real truth to it, but I had to get it out of my head so I could focus on literally anything else in my life. The process itself was also filled with a lot of increasingly intense synchronicities that abruptly stopped once I was done. But I just let it ride out because it was likely due to over priming my cognitive correlation and pattern searching. I also lost about 30lbs over those weeks, slept maybe 2-3 hours a night and would walk for miles at a time every day.</p>

<p>But <strong>if</strong> it was a genuine experience and not just my brain flipping out, I would doubt they are physical extra terrestrials from our observable universe because of the size, distances and speed required for interstellar travel. So if it turned out to be true, then my money would be on inter dimensional entities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not <em>everyone</em> is &#39;in on it&#39;. Think about who decides what movies actually end up getting made. If <em>you</em> are involved, then someone is writing checks to <em>you</em> right? It&#39;s very easy to work for a propaganda organisation without even knowing it, this is how propaganda is made.  </p>

<p>Think about the fact that if you make anything needing the military help (like showing an aircraft carrier, fighter jets etc), then the military basically gets control over the script and will edit out anything showing them in a negative light or differing too much from the official narrative. </p>

<p>Think about all those patriotic movies, the american hero saving the world etc etc. The Russians are the bad guys, and so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah that shit is just straight jingoistic shit. Stuff like Zero Dark Thirty is pretty pathetic, but &quot;if you make anything needing the military help (like showing an aircraft carrier, fighter jets etc), then the military basically gets control over the script and will edit out anything showing them in a negative light or differing too much from the official narrative.&quot; is just not true. Obvious propaganda is obvious, plenty of movies show the military in a negative light.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve just bought into fear driven conspiracy propaganda if you truly think &quot;almost nothing they do is &#39;just entertainment&#39;.&quot; Flip that ratio and you are more on target. &quot;almost everything they do is &#39;just entertainment&#39;.&quot; Alien movies would fall into that entertainment zone.</p>

<p>Because when movies do come out that do, &quot;differing too much from the official narrative&quot;, the conspiracy rational is that it is only allowed to happen as a disinfo credibility campaign. It&#39;s pretty weaselly logic</p>

<p>Props, sets, miniatures, CG, decommissioned craft and private collectors. That&#39;s how you do it. You don&#39;t need the military&#39;s approval to do any of that stuff. The military it technically a brand, so yes, if you are going to work with them, then they get to negotiate the use of their image just like any other. But there are plenty of ways to do what you want to do without them.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/89th_Academy_Awards#Awards">Here are last years winners.</a> They are all pretty standard crowd pleasing popcorn fluff. And the Oscars are more public PR bs anyway. There are much more respected theatrical film awards that have a broader range of nominations, categories and winners. </p>

<p>You want to know what main stream movies should be winning this year over that shitty three billboard movie? Lady Bird and Get Out. But sometimes bullshit hype drives the industry boner</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no problem! It&#39;s kind of a more obscure and emerging story narrative, so they are kind of hard to find. Studios also hate supporting or taking the risk on unproven story narratives at times, so it can be difficult to get big budgets behind new ideas. But over time, things start to crack though that wall. </p>

<p>An inter-dimensional explanation for your story can also easily become, &quot;it was all a dream&quot; hacky for the audience if you can&#39;t wright or execute the concept properly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Corey Goode, from cosmic disclosure, he says that there are portals that can be manufactured on command with advanced technology and there are natural ones that appear. And then there&#39;s also higher density beings that can appear anytime anywhere. Corey also says that he was in a &quot;20 and back&quot; program where he worked aboard ships and projects throughout the solar system and outside it. He also said that after being in this &quot;20 and back program&quot; he went back in time and was age reversed and blank slated and was portaled to his room right before the moment he was told to walk out originally at the start of the program. He also said that he had a fake memory of walking into his house. He also said that on a very small percentage of the people who get blank slated, the technology just doesn&#39;t work at all. And that&#39;s how he&#39;s telling all this shiz on his show </p>
