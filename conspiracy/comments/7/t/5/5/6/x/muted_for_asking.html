<p>The mods didn&#39;t reply they just muted me, not even a courtesy reply. Basically telling me to shut up and fuck off I guess?</p>

<p>As for the contest mode in the other thread, polite and constructive comments were receiving many dozens of downvotes, which regular users of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will recognize as indicative of manipulation.</p>

<p>If certain bad actors from other subs continue to abuse the downvote button, threads will continue to be placed into contest mode so that <em>every</em> user is given a fair shot at participating.</p>

<p>If this behavior continues, we will consider disabling downvoting universally on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

I can say I have a mountain of evidence that apples are really oranges, but without actual proof shown, it&#39;s just words. And that&#39;s what I keep seeing, just words being thrown about with no evidence to support the claims.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t see censorship here. I see people allowed to voice their complains a little TOO MUCH. I see people as you demonstrated, allowed to even say things that would typically get them banned in another subreddit. So really, HOW is this subreddit being censored now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is still the least censored sub on all of Reddit IMO.  And that is also why these people are here to ruin it. It&#39;s really frustrating that they are actually guilty of what they accuse their &quot;opponents&quot; of doing.  Nobody wants an echo chamber, but that is what the place becomes when the brigades arrive.  Nobody wants censorship but the upvotes/downvotes effectively sensor when the brigades arrive.  Also people that want to legitimately discuss the conspiracy can&#39;t because they will get downvoted.  Only people being upvoted are comments ridiculing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s obvious when top voted comments are talking shit on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users as a whole.  Then rational comments just asking questions or even insinuating part of the story may not be true they get downvoted to oblivion.  This isn&#39;t <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or T_D.  We encourage logical discussion as well as people disagreeing.  When silly ad hominem attacks are being highly upvoted and people in doubt that are asking questions are heavily downvoted it is a pretty obvious and blatant shift.</p>

<p>because it makes discussion difficult.</p>

<p>Tell that to the rational and constructive comments that were downvoted dozens of times for their troubles.</p>

<p>For example, these comments are sitting at <em>below</em> 2 dozen votes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seriously, what stops these propaganda outlets from just making this shit up? They&#39;ve been caught lying multiple times.</p>

<p>The NYT Is partly owned by Carlos Slim, the worlds second richest person and a personal enemy of Trump. Anything the NYT reports I take with a grain of salt because the influence is too easy to pass up. In this case it doesn&#39;t matter, Trump did a no-no. But in editorials and similar articles, I pass them off as fluff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only that, but the comments replying to them are concerned about why they received dozens of downvotes for politely engaging with the conversation.</p>

<p>If legitimate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users are going to receive dozens of downvotes for their trouble, then they will continue to flee from this sub in droves.</p>

When a thread is in contest mode, I just read everything. It makes me work harder at understanding the thread. How can this be bad in any way whatsoever? It can&#39;t, and that is why you know the vast majority of the people that complain are shills. We always got a couple that will even complain about the color of the rope they get hung with, that isn&#39;t the same.</p>

<p>Complain away guys =) I look forward to the day you force our hands hard enough that we put every...single...thread... in contest mode. None of your bullshit will work. Your fake consensus will be <em>gone</em>. And we will be able to talk about whatever we want. And the only people that will be able to participate will be the ones willing to put in the work to understand their fellows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s controlled garbage in the sense that they carefully package their narrative into pretty much all of their publishing. Yes, they print plenty of true information, but they distort the truth as much as they can get away with at all times. This distortion has become so severe that I believe it is a threat to our society.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t consider any source to be a valid news source for anything remotely political or controversial. I sample the whole spectrum from MSM garbage to conspiracy forum garbage. Occasionally I spot an example of decent journalism somewhere in between, but I don&#39;t really take any of it at face value. I pay more attention to the actual words and actions of people which I can confirm for myself and largely ignore whatever knee-jerk reactions are being pushed in the various narrative streams. I have my gut instincts about how all of this fits in with the real story, but I don&#39;t accept any if the popular narratives with certainty.  </p>

<p>But MSM sources have proven themselves to be essentially propaganda outlets, that much I feel quite strongly about. It very much appears to me that they have been weaponized against the current president. Their bias is so severe that I consider it most likely that they are fabricating this entire story about trying to fire Mueller.</p>

<p>You&#39;re point would actually have merit unless you have actually gone into one of those threads and see that the only discussion going on is how dumb <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users are or how they be obsessed with Trump/Russia because it is the biggest conspiracy ever.  Or preemptive strikes against anyone who might argue the legitimacy of the claims being presented in the Anti-Trump article.  Very little discussion goes on about the actual topic.  People are more concerned with how <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regulars are reacting to the topic more than the topic itself.  Which makes you wonder why there is such a concentrated effort to guide the conversation here.  We&#39;re just a bunch of tin-foil hat wearing fools remember?  Why the fuck do you care what we are talking about or what we do or do not deem the most important topic of the day?</p>

<p>All that’s here are people complaining that they can’t talk about it or anti Muslim shit.  It’s pathetic. They just signed a bill that says the CIA doesn’t have to report its budget to Congress allowing the President to create a secret Army and the front page post is people celebrating that they were right about that stupid hijab cutting thing that no one actually gave a shit about.</p>

<p>There’s a REAL conspiracy happening and for once there’s proof and it’s being investigated by the FBI and they are being pretty open about it but no one here seems interested.  It’s so weird.  These guys are acting so obviously guilty!  You don’t have to read a ‘biased’ article to watch Miller stuttering and stammering and spouting BS but no one here seems to wanna talk about it.

    <div class="md"><p>That story about the girl lying about getting her hijab cut off was stickied to the top and had a really silly title like “why we were RIGHT!”.  The fact that something that wasn’t even a conspiracy (someone lied for fame and was caught) was stickied to the top and this story about an actual conspiracy is labeled controversial says a lot.  I’m the thread the top comments are about the secret agenda of Islam and how this whole thing was planned by them.   It was someone lying for fame, I’m all for discussing how larger powers use fame to control people but this wasn’t some evil Muslim master plan.</p>

<p>Also have seen a lot of people blaming the Las Vegas massacre on ISIS instead of the American citizen that committed it.  No specific link, but look in any thread.  It’s there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ bud.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s insecurities or what but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not racist.  They pointed out a false flag attack, which is one of many, that have been carried out against muslims to indicate there is more racism/violence against them than there is.  You want someone who treats muslims unfairly look at the US fucking government.  We created terrorists.  Also that other sub you linked not ractist.  Simply talking about race or comparing how a nation state treats one race vs. the other IS NOT RACIST.  Racism is the belief that one&#39;s race is superior to all others.  That&#39;s not what&#39;s going on there bud.  I can&#39;t help you though as you must just see racism everywhere you look because it&#39;s obvious you look for it where it isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only see racism in threads that link to neo nazi websites, threads that talk about evil cabals out to shut down ‘white culture’ , threads that say Jews want to destroy the earth, threads that blame an Islamist extremist group for something a crazy American did.  I guess you might be right that this isn’t racism, I guess you could call it bigotry or just being an uninformed xenophobe.  Why was that hijab story stickied and have so many upvotes?  It’s not even a conspiracy!  If you can’t see the bigotry and dog whistles in a the title and content of the final link, then scroll the comments where you will find links to neo nazi websites, anti Semitic books and speeches, and more ‘white rights’ garbage.  On a whole I don’t think this is a sub for bigots but there is clearly a group of people who post here that have a proclivity for that kind of trash.</p>

<p>The president has attempted to fire the guy investigating him for ties to a foreign government, this is a huge conspiracy and I want to talk about it and not have it devolve into “FAKE NEWS!” or it gets locked and a post about people complaining how white people are treated (how is this a conspiracy?)  gets 950 upvotes.</p>

<p>I agree the US government treats Muslims unfairly, go ahead and make a post on here all about that and see how much traction you get. </p>

<p>I am not attacking you, I’m just pointing out that this sub has a proclivity for bigoted behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Nail on the head there bud.  All contest mode does is make it so the conversation can&#39;t be directed by upvotes/downvotes and that is it.  The ONLY people that would be mad about this is people trying to steer the conversation.  It treats all comments equal.  I love it because it obviously strikes deep against those that do come in here trying to control the conversation.  So it works exactly like it is supposed to.  I wouldn&#39;t care if ALL the posts in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> were put in contest mode.  I think it would be a drastic strike against all shilling efforts which try and tell us how we should be thinking and how we shouldn&#39;t be thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah fuck em.  They lose the whole &quot;Only anti-Trump articles are put in contest mode, waaah waaah&quot; if we just put them all that way.  They try to act like this is some sort of censorship but is really just an annoying hindrance to their operation.  Contest mode weights all comments equal.  THAT IS IT.  It doesn&#39;t make sense that would piss anyone off that doesn&#39;t have stake in the comments being weighted. It does not hinder discussion it just prevents the ability to weight certain comments as &quot;better&quot; than the others.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users would want to avoid any system deciding for them what comments are good and what comments are bad, I would think.  You know free-thinking, not vote manipulated thinking?</p>

<p>I didnt know what contest mode did, but now that your heavily downvoted comments explained it, it makes so much sense that they&#39;re triggered to hell by it. I would love to see this sub go contest only for like a week trial or something. im already filtering by controversial most of the time but this would actually hurt their work.</p>

<p>Because that thread was so obviously shilled to the fucking ground, it was embarrassing to even click and read that thread. It was cringe worthy brigading that wasn&#39;t even masked to seem innocuous. </p>

<p>Also, who TF are <em>you</em> saying you&#39;re a real conspiracy member? <em>IF YOU WERE A REAL CONSPIRACY MEMBER YOU&#39;D UNDERSTAND THEIR POSITION</em>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s perfectly fine to disagree with the mods, but that whole thread is a trap and set up. The mods knew it was brigaded and shilled, didn&#39;t remove it and put it in contest mode instead. </p>

<p>How TF are you going to REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE out about the mods when they didn&#39;t even remove a post which was obviously inorganic in everyway? They still left it up. </p>

<p>Im on the mods side with this 110%. </p>

<p>Not true, but your account is just over a month old</p>

<p>Many here want him out because he&#39;s clearly very partial to the red side of the partisan divide</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t noticed any bias, while I can tell some mods prefer Dems and others prefer Rep, I&#39;ve actually never noticed a different with AP.  He/she seems fair</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This has nothing to do with TMOR</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a lie and most likely a sign you are from there and part of this agenda, especially with such a new account.  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/">TMOR</a> have been regularly starting posts linking to AP and sending in brigades, it&#39;s at the point where AP could win a legal battle against the people/organizations involved, clear harassment.  The plan is almost certainly to see if they can crack AP and make AP resign, ShareBlue want one of their people as head mod.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And since we&#39;re on the subject of TMOR. Why are they the target when post after post after post is brigaded by t_d users but none of those threads EVER go into contest</p>
</blockquote>

<p>t_d themselves have been the victims of TMOR and other negative forces, and even if t_d did do something wrong it wouldn&#39;t mean that it gets TMOR off their harassment and brigading.</p>

<p>And this explains why we can&#39;t have discussions about Trump. The vitriol towards Trump on Reddit is far beyond reason. The, let&#39;s say &quot;passionate&quot;, anti trumpets quickly turn to name calling and personal attacks.</p>

<p>This is the 4th time now that Trump was getting impeached &quot;For real for real&quot;. And once again the trolls are demanding it gets plastered everywhere. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t claim that your message is being stifled when it is on every other sub. Go back to r/pol.</p>

<p>So are you just going to play dumb and act like brigading isn&#39;t a problem on reddit? Especially controversial subreddits?</p>

<p>Why have public discussions if the mods are going to freak out when the public gets involved. If a sub is meant for members only it should be made Private.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not playing dumb. But I watched the first few hours of that post, and the overwhelming response <em>from regulars who usually post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></em> were the kind that, quite frankly, don&#39;t fit the mod&#39;s opinions or, increasingly, their overt agendas. I think that is what put it in contest mode, ie real users disagreeing and saying things the mods don&#39;t like, much more than any sort of organized brigade. Quite frankly I think organized brigades happen much more infrequently than people think here. Unless you&#39;re claiming simply making it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> means a post is brigaded, which goes against the very idea of Reddit.</p>

It was immediately deleted with no rule cited. I messaged the mods asking about it and got no response. In a later thread i asked balthanos about it and you can follow that convo in my recent post history, but i was basivally told it wasnt conspiracy related and that due to &quot;active brigading&quot; anything related to this topic is being erased. Doesnt sound like a great system to me, but i had multiple users basically telling me to kill myself and stop concern trolling, and balthanos would only tell me to go to the admins if i had an issue which seems very against the mindset of how i thought this sub was run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to turn this around to a bit more of an optimistic tone. The best way forward is to keep our heads up and look at what we are doing right so we can continue to do that and get better at it. The good news is the mods can&#39;t remove this post without causing even more backlash, including within the mod team. This post is on my front page right now. I know a lot of people in this sub are pessimistic about being able to influence Trump supporters, but it shouldn&#39;t be that way because I have seen so many great posts in here exposing Trump just like I have seen so many great posts exposing other politicians. </p>

<p>I know at least 3 of the mods are anti-Trump, especially <a href="/u/alllie">/u/alllie</a>, so we have that going for us. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/72k3fe/a_handful_of_ultrarich_dynastic_families_are/">Example of anti-Trump post by Alllie</a>. I know this because I used to think all of the mods were pro-Trumpers until I found evidence to the contrary. That should be good enough for a balance of powers check to make sure we at least have a voice in here. </p>

<p>Half or more of this community is receptive to anti Trump information (proof below). All we need to do is keep showing everyone the dirty truth about both parties. It goes both ways.</p>

<p>&quot;Donald Trump supposedly told House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) he supports cutting Social Security but will not admit it publicly because it would hurt his election chances.

<p>If Reddit were smart, they would just come out and be open about their bias and control of the site, and how the advertising works. Instead of this weird, takeover every sub by complaining a lot and frankly making the content suck, but then people move to new subs, and then it happens all over again. But the thing is, really you&#39;re just antagonizing all your users in the worst way possible, such that they&#39;ll never return to this site once they leave it.</p>

<p>Looks like FB/YT are also heading down this self-destructive path.</p>

<p><a href="/u/SouthernJeb">/u/SouthernJeb</a> - <a href="https://i.snag.gy/K9tc1s.jpg">Here&#39;s</a> what got him banned, despite being a long-term member of the sub (more than 2 years, with an account name that&#39;s 5+ years old)</p>

<p><a href="/u/pinko_zinko">/u/pinko_zinko</a>: &quot;I pointed out that a mod could shitpost non-conspiratorial content.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="/u/LordDongler">/u/LordDongler</a>: &quot;I got banned for poking fun at Trump supporters being such special snowflakes.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="/u/stupidfuckingtroll">/u/stupidfuckingtroll</a>: &quot;i was also banned after i posted a graphic that was critical of Fox news. i suspect my ban was for that along with my previous posts and comments which have been critical of trump.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="/u/montrev">/u/montrev</a>: &quot;i&#39;m banned from conspiracy for stating facts too.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="/u/peekitup">/u/peekitup</a>: &quot;I was banned a while back after posting series of articles critical of the new administration. The claim was that I insulted certain members of the sub but no clarification for what the insult was exactly was ever given.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="/u/ufuz42">/u/ufuz42</a>: &quot;I got banned yesterday for disagreeing with AP. I asked him why and he quoted something back to me that I said to him, and I followed it up with basically saying well nice to that it’s a ban because you don’t like me and what I have to say and he didn’t respond.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="/u/U_CAN_TRUST_HILLARY">/u/U_CAN_TRUST_HILLARY</a>: AP &quot;Called out one of his divisive shit posts he called me a shill and banned me on the spot&quot; - after this user had been posting on conspiracy for 3 years</p>

<p><a href="/u/osm0sis">/u/osm0sis</a>: &quot;Probably for commenting on a thread where people were discussing an account less than a month old that was spamming the same pro Trump repeatedly, and then tried to insult other users in a top level comment.... Really don&#39;t think I made any ban worthy comments and tried my best to add to the level of discussion&quot;</p>

<p><a href="/u/greenie7680">/u/greenie7680</a>: &quot;I was another person banned by Axolotl simply for asking why a mod was showing such open bias and cussing at commenters. Got perma-banned after having no action taken against me before.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="/u/AmadeusK482">/u/AmadeusK482</a>: I was responding to a belligerent pizzagate believer and I believe I was banned for expressing my doubts</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;ll post the whole message I received from /u/ CHARLESBRINK:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>mark me down too as someone else who was banned for questioning the mods partisanship and bias.</p>

<p>4 days ago <a href="/u/JoeyBulgaria">/u/JoeyBulgaria</a> posted this story: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7s6azy/mueller_team_has_interviewed_bannon_associate_who/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7s6azy/mueller_team_has_interviewed_bannon_associate_who/</a></p>

<p>Mod <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> [-12] commented:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Joey what are you going to post about once this bullshit political theater is revealed to be all smoke, mirrors and propaganda?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that comment was downvoted to -71</p>

<p>Completely brazen partisanship. No shame about it either.</p>

<p>My comment was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how are you a still a mod? you clearly have an agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was banned on the spot.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a sample of other comments by users that <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> banned in that thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&#39;t you make some big, grandstanding announcement recently about how you were going to knock it off with the political arguments and be a more responsible mod? (+78)</p>

<p>Why do we have a mod that actively trys to shut down discussion of a bonafide investigation into the Whitehouse? This is insane jesus (+53)</p>

<p>Indictments for manafort/gates, guilty pleas by Flynn and Papadapolous who are now actively working with the investigation= smoke, mirrors, and propaganda? We&#39;ve gone from &quot;no one in my campaign ever met with russians&quot; to &quot;well almost everyone in my campaign met with russians multiple times including my own son and son-in-law but don&#39;t worry that was about adoptions..&quot; Why the lies from the very beginning if this was all political theatre?  It&#39;s weird that your a mod of this sub yet you feel the need to constantly defend the acting US administration from a conspiracy with mounting evidence all the time..... very strange (+46)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>all 3 of those users along with 19 others in a were banned by that mod in a 48 hour period for absolutely nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are just some of the posters who messaged me (others were unclear and though I think they were banned, I wasn&#39;t sure). I&#39;m just the messenger and haven&#39;t looked further into their claims, so please don&#39;t ban me for this.</p>

<p>If anyone would like their name removed (or added!), or wants me to add additional details, please message me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea of a sub wide thing like this. I&#39;m usually not interested in the meta posts and drama shit of this sub.  Maybe it happens but what I&#39;m seeing in new is pro trump posts being heavily brigaded like 100 up votes but 250 comments. Then the opposite for the left leaning commentaries. It got to the point now I have to go to the Donald sub to get actual discussion from the &quot;other side&quot; without threads being completely derailed. This sub isn&#39;t about sharing ideas when people get downvoted for their opinions on things we can&#39;t prove on one side or the other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I prefer it. I know it&#39;s not a popular opinion, and I definitely don&#39;t think it should be a site-wide thing, but I hated how our karma system worked for a long time. Contest mode is more chaotic, but everyone has a chance to have their voice heard. It allows discussion to last longer if you get invested, and makes it more likely that people will read past the first comment thread. I do feel it works better for smaller subreddits, though. I don&#39;t expect many people to agree, but that&#39;s my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I saw when the sub took a complete 180 and modern political articles(its not a conspiracy when its an active world politics issue being fully covered by mainstream media) get upvotes past 1K while classical, well researched conspiracy posts barely crack 200(and the ones that do get slammed as pointless and unworthy of discussion).</p>

<p>And if users point something out, or counter argue the articles, they get instantly downvoted, into the -50s and beyond, even if they are contributing to the conversation meaningfully.  Don&#39;t follow the narrative? You get downvoted.</p>

<p>I really would like to see the mods shut down the political nonsense.  There&#39;s subreddits for it(politics and t_d offering both sides).  If i want my politics fix I know where to go.  This sub should exclusively be for conspiracies.</p>

<p>Deep state cover ups, media manipulation and propaganda, world financial power and control, assassinations of truth seekers and politicians and the cover ups that happen, secret societies, and occult/paranormal/alien cover ups.</p>

<p>A post about CIA agents working in the various media outlets? That&#39;s a conspiracy.  A sitting president being actively investigated with reports from mainstream and alternative sources is not a conspiracy, it is an active political topic. </p>

Contest mode serves a very specific purpose, one the mods have spoken about numerous times before.

<p>As for pro-Clinton mods, if you don&#39;t know who they are then it&#39;s very clear either you&#39;re new here or you&#39;re letting YOUR personal biases get in the way. They didn&#39;t exactly hide during the election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re just going to ignore that contest mode isn&#39;t covering something up?</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re asking me to back up a claim that I never made. I never said pro-Hillary mods abused their powers. That you believe I did shows you lack basic reading comprehension. </p>

<p>I said that there are mods that users feel abused their powers to help Hillary Clinton. That&#39;s a vastly different claim from the one you&#39;re asking me to back up. </p>

<p>I will not name mods because I wish to avoid a Rule 10, but again it&#39;s clear you&#39;re new here. Some mods pushed very hard against PizzaGate, even removing threads, during the election. Many users took that as proof of pro-Clinton biases. You are not asking for those mods to be removed, and I find that interesting. </p>

<p>I should also note that removing a thread during the peak of something is a much bolder move than putting a thread in contest mode. Where&#39;s your calls to have those mods removed?  </p>

<p>Just like you, I&#39;ll wait. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I can shed some light on this using data. <a href="https://trevor.shinyapps.io/subalgebra/">Here</a> is a tool that takes billions of comments on reddit and correlates subreddits with the same users. For instance, if you erase the nba and cleveland and just put conspiracy in the first field, you see what other subs share similar users. If you change the number of entries it shows, you will see that the_donald heavily correlates with this sub (so does uncensorednews, but that&#39;s another story). That easily explains the defense of Trump that you see so much of in this sub.</p>

<p>But here is where it gets interesting. If you leave conspiracy in the first field and change the next sign from plus to minus and then put the_donald in the next field, you get very interesting results. What that does is take the conspiracy users and subtract out users that also post on the_donald. Here is what you see:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1  collapse<br/>
2  environment 
3  skeptic 
4  Bad_Cop_No_Donut<br/>
5  Psychonaut<br/>
6  worldpolitics<br/>
7  Marijuana<br/>
8  C_S_T<br/>
9  TrueReddit<br/>
10 Foodforthought</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds more like conspiracy theorists, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<h1>Rules for Radicals.</h1>

<p>&quot;Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never go outside the expertise of your people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whenever possible go outside the expertise of the enemy.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Ridicule is man&#39;s most potent weapon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A good tactic is one your people enjoy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Keep the pressure on,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you push a negative hard and deep enough it will break through into its counterside&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.&quot;</p>

<p>None of this shit belongs here, it&#39;s literally buzzfeed quality posts brought to you by NY times.  What happened to evidence and actual connections?  I&#39;m not trying to defend Trump here, but the amount of &quot;left&quot; leaning topics and comments in these posts are disgusting.  It&#39;s just as bad as when we get a bogus &quot;Q-anon&quot; pro Trump post.</p>
