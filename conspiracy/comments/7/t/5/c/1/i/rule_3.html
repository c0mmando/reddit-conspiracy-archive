       Yeah, there are definitely a few accounts that seem to spam certain domains eg zerohedge/truepundit/gatewaypundit/activistpost and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The danger I feel is in identifying users as related to the domain they spam, how can you be sure it's an employee of zerohedge or whatever?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could also lead to false flags eg people spamming msnbc links to purposefully get the domain banned.

       That is an issue- proving someone's affiliation to any particular source is obviously difficult. On the other hand, we do have proof of Shareblue using shills through the r/pol fiasco.

       My real point is that, without a rule in place, what is to stop them from doing the same here? Can we call them "malicious"?

       I'm sure that if there is real Shareblue evidence, the mods could verify privately.

       Not really. That is to prevent non-community members from spamming the place with their personal blogs/channels/sites. It doesn't address someone that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an active community member pushing a source they are employed by aka paid shills.

       Ban the users, sure why not, but not the source.  Also, everyone knew r/politics were promoting share blue in some capacity.  Their decision yesterday was surprising and kind of funny... like they didn't know share blue was heavily promoted on their sub from day one, I feel like there was even an announcement.

       I think banning direct links to sources that pay to shill makes more sense than playing wack-a-mole with users and alts. If the sources don't have click data and revenue streams, it takes a lot the motivation to pay shills away.

       First of all, I doubt there are any large corporate groups paying users to push their content on this sub, maybe, but I doubt it.  Second, how are we going to prove it anyways, just because a user tends to post from a specific source we should ban the source?  You are going to end up with situations like r/news who
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1lecql/the_russian_news_site_rtcom_has_been_banned_from/">
        banned RT for this exact reason with little to no evidence
       </a>
       .  Also, trolls could frame up that source by creating sockpuppets and acting like a overt shill.  The last point is, r/politics knowingly allowed that to happen in my opinion and my guess is there was a falling out between the mods and shareblue which resulted in this 'new discovery'.  It's a heavy handed way of dealing with a situation I don't think is happening.

       This isn't about shilling, it's about banning sources for paying users to promote their content.  And yes, I think there are groups on both sides paid to push their agenda, but I don't think I have ever seen shareblue on the front of conspiracy.

       Sure, it's one form yes, but you seem disingenuous about what we're talking about.  You're proposing banning sources based off of shills pushing the content on this sub, which I don't believe happens on this sub and if it does, their pretty shitty at it.

       Sure, I agree, but this post and the conversation I'm desperately trying to have with you is about banning specific sources that shills are trying to push on this sub, which I don't think is happening and if they are, they're doing a shit job of it.  I actually think they were also buy votes in order to push their content on the front page of r/politics to get more attention.  But none of which has to do with this sub's content and sources, yet you seem to think it's happening here and we need to start censoring specific sources.  Can you give me a source you see being pushed onto the front page of r/conspiracy?  Or maybe some users you think that are paid to push specific sources in this sub?

       I'm all for cutting off direct links, but I hate the idea of silencing folks that can't archive for whatever their reasoning is. I know that archiving is hit or miss for me depending on whether I can get a decent connection sometimes. Others just don't know how. Dunno.
