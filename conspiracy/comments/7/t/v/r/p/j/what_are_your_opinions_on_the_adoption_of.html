       SS: I've been interested in crypto for many years but have only recently begun to ponder the consequences of our world gradually switching from fiat to crypto, as far as TPTB potentially manipulating it for nefarious purposes. I hope to start a quality discussion on an issue that I've found to be somewhat divisive.

       If you examine the foundation of crypto you see it is a castle built on sand,
       <em>
        silica sand
       </em>
       . It depends too much on complexity which, in the end, you either believe or don't that is has intrinsic value. Practically speaking it's too ephemeral. Say you think the encryption itself, all those calculations, is a store of value of those binary digits. Because it's impossible to do by hand and you're basing your assessment on belief, belief that there is value in these formulae, it may as well be wampum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, thirty years ago it would have taken a genius a lifetime to make one on your Commodore 64. Today it takes dedicated video cards and weeks, tomorrow, Turing's Law is still in effect, you could make a billion in a week. Supercomputers today can do the same thing and
       <em>
        swamp the entire bit-shit space.
       </em>
       You say,"But, but, but they promised to make only so many and then stop!"  What about the unaffiliated "coin" scams, did they agree too?
      </p>
      <p>
       These fraudsters are rolling you in flour and looking for the wet spot. It's a symptom of predatory capitalism at the peak of the biggest bubble ever blown in the history of the world.

       No money has intrinsic value.
      </p>
      <p>
       All money is just a "thing" you use because it has certain characteristics. Is the "thing" divisible, portable, durable,... There's about 8. Then you can use that thing. Doesn't matter if it's silver, paper fiat or digital.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin is not set in stone. Try to change it. I dare ya. Start a grass-roots campaign. Or try to force people, miners. Go on. Or start a new coin. You'll fail, I guarantee it. Because the formula for Bitcoin is that it is perfect. It's physically impossible to create a better formula for digital money. Try. I actually welcome your attempts.

       I don't know whether you are trying to convince me or yourself. Perhaps there are chinks in your armor. You are what is known as a "true believer". Confirmation is as simple as your last logical fallacy, ad hominem, "attack the man" telling me you know you are on shaky ground. Otherwise, why bother with the attack?

       You only address the last line. Which is not even an ad hominem.

       If called out for ad hominem you, my adolescent friend, doubles down and now slings more mud. I am a
       <em>
        Nationalist

       and support free markets, so you really pull that out of your ass with the "cowards" comment. You're adding a Red Herring as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tempest is in your own head, clinging there to your mental construct you built around bit-fraud.  Remember, "there is no fraud without a fairy tail." Your blather about how the blockchain corrects itself or prevents anyone from inventing their own bogus currency is embarrassing to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst thing I can imagine is some idiot with a bank of computer towers loaded with vid cards stuffed in his garage, burning electricity, and he's paying for it on
       <em>
        credit cards.
       </em>
       Furthermore, this retard may be
       <em>
        buying
       </em>
       them with cash, or worse an index or ETF which has "bit" in its name. Witness Kodak brushing of its dusty ass by tacking on "block" to an experimental photo identification code. The rubes jumped on that with the speed of light. Good luck. Never smarten up a chump but I tried.

       The proof-of-work consensus algorythm that allows for decentralized digital assets is a top 4 invention
       <em>
        of all time.
       </em>
       It is only preceded by man's control over electricity, fire and maybe one other thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in its infancy, today, it's worth 500 billion dollars and the attention of individuals in the biggest governments
      </p>
      <p>
       If the hegemony of the banking cartels behind the US dollar
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       have killed Bitcoin, they would have killed it by now. And whether you like it or not, Bitcoin and all other forms of fiat money are in direct competition with one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       So every time you hear someone mentioning that Bitcoin "went to a new all-time high", you'll know it's not just because of Bitcoin. It's because the USD is losing value. Inflation is no fun and games. All 600 fiat currencies have inevitable gone to zero and the dollar is on its way out. Could take another 5 to 7 years, but historically no un-backed fiat currency has lasted more than 60-70 years. And with Nixon in 1971 taking it off the goldstandard, we're slowly getting there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the writing's on the wall, with more than 20 trillion in debt. And that's not even mentioning the, by estimation, over 100 trillion in liabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have fun being a statist/nationalist for a little while longer. Because there is no end-game scenario wherein Bitcoin does not swallow up all the world's wealth. Because if you like retaining your purchasing power, you'll move your fiat into either real estate, precious metals or cryptocurrencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless if you want to learn zero lessons from Zimbabwe, Venezuela and other countries. If you want to learn no lessons from Ancient Rome. The US has degraded into decadence with such extreme speed these last 4 decades, it's pretty shocking. And all great empires go through that period of decadence before their inevitable demise.

       There was an episode of The Simpsons where Homer looks
       <em>
        at the Internet
       </em>
       . An image of a bloated network router with Blue Belly flies circling it is flashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later Homer is surprised to learn "You get the Internet on computers now." You say
       <em>
        get Bitcoin on computers now!
       </em>
       They have Bitcoin on computers now. Fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       At best bitcoin and blockchain are an interim psy-op to move off Bretton Woods and onto BIS's "Special Drawing Rights" another ephemeral made up nothing. You swallow bitcoin a "Rope a Dope" to get you to finally accept a global currency administered from top down not for your benefit, for theirs.

       George HW Bush said "the biggest problem with stealing wealth is not destroying it in the process." Perhaps True Believers, like yourself, think they'll put their wealth in Bit-Shit like a little life raft. Sad to say, you will forget to get on the raft yourself, bye bye wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prattle you just wrote about the bit-shit revolution looks more like some kind of infantile religion where Bit-Daddy comes to save the day, bah!

       You can get Bitcoin via sms or e-mail too. Heck, even via smoke signals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin doesn't steal wealth. It transfers it. See, the problem is you don't even understand how money works. It's a transfer of money. You could imagine Bitcoin as a sort of digital Euro. And the tl;dr would be that everyone just stops using dollars, because the fundamental attributes of the new Euro are better than those of the USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where you probably lost it: in a free market, the best "thing" always wins. You've just become highly accustomed to having someone ram their opinions down your throat. "Make the lie big and simple and eventually they will accept it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Fiat currency is the biggest scam ever pulled over on humanity by a wide margin. If you want to debate that, I welcome it. But you won't. You're a Stockholm syndrome victim. Become dependent on the system. Like a prisoner in Plato's allegory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, this likely comes across as prattle to you.  But I'm not a true believer. I believe in empirical evidence and facts. And I used to believe in politics and "the country." So I lived both lives. One was an absolute lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin isn't a
       <em>
        re
       </em>
       -volution. It's an
       <em>
        e
       </em>
       volution. It won't come back around. It's a brand new world. The world has never before had
       <strong>
        hard
       </strong>
       money.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not realise it, but before the 1900s, something like 95% of the population of the US was self-employed. There wasn't hardly any government. You didn't even need a visa to travel the world. So that is empirical proof that Western civilisation peaked in the early 1900s. We've been slowly giving up freedoms for "the greater good" for a long time. But we're all individuals and we've lost individual freedoms. So "the greater good" is an absolute lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure you're heavily projecting when you say my analysis is "religious." Everything is based in empirical evidence. For instance, Moore's law has Bitcoin scale globally. Free markets have historically provided solutions for
       <em>
        everything.
       </em>
       From roads to medicine to police to judicial courts. Everything gets worse the second the institutionalized mafia (to govern the mind- government) steps in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn off your tv for two months, turn off your radio. Read up on how anarcho-capitalism actually provides solutions. It can and will work. Then come back to me.

       You should really pick your demons. International wholesale banking, the Rothschild system, the Federal Reserve (which is neither), the rich.

       ? Rag tag "Evolutionaries" at the cusp of a new age, riding into town and taking over one imaginary "coin" in a computer, on a network, at a time. That lets you

       It's not even necessarily that I want to create it. It's just a fact that all this is coming. It's like the automatisation of labor through A.I and robots. Truck drivers and taxi drivers will be among the first hit. But it's all coming, sooner or later.

       Especially when you factor in machine-to-machine economics. For the first time ever, an AI can do business with another AI. You could run code that finds self-sustainability - or not. It either dies or thrives, without human interaction, by using Bitcoin to pay for its own electricity, if it manages to run a business plan that makes money. These sorts of interactions are already happening on a small scale today within Bitcoin. This blows my mind. The possibilities are vast.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see myself as anything. You've been reminding me of V from V for Vendetta with your colorful choice of words though. Though in a sense I don't feel a certain responsibility to turn the ship around. I have personally come into contact with the results of central banking, and I find it unacceptable. So it has to go. I want my future children to live in a better world. A full-on attack on central banking is a prison sentence at best. But Bitcoin is like sneaking it past everyone. It is truly a gift to humanity.
      </p>

       You probably think the division of church and state is good. Most people do. But your great-grandparents and their peers probably couldn't have imagined a world like that. I'm telling you, your great-grandchildren will wonder how a world without the seperation of money and state could have ever existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and I assure you, putting money into Bitcoin is work. To some, at least. Have you seen the charts? It's a rollercoaster. Even if your your gameplan is set in stone - so no trading - watching your capital go from X to Y on a weekly basis is not for the faint of heart. Securing your coins while the hardware and software is in its infancy is not for tech-illiterates. Bitcoin has awful user interface and
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       are the sole caretaker of your capital. You lose your own private keys, you
       <strong>
        lose everything.
       </strong>
       It's digital gold, it requires some form of planning and responsibility. And prices
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       go and stay at bottom prices for years. It's a risky investment. Even if you put in the hours to go over the code, the math and the economical incentives, in the short-term, anything could happen.

       We're playing badminton right now. I wish you no harm. Furthermore, I wish no harm to come to you. That's why I bounce my perspective off of you. Why don't you learn plumbing? Seriously, I've seen more plumbers "write their own ticket" than almost anyone else over my long life. A van, some tools, learned skills, tough conditions. I've seen these guys become kings, independent, and rich. Everybody has to shit, drink, shower. That's where you'll get your security. Even in total chaos, your skills will be rewarded whether you're paid with food, barter, silver, hell, even bitcoins. With a little forethought you could retire at young, I did. Your greatest store of wealth are your skills, determination. I'm not waiting for a new era to rescue me, I suggest you do the same.

       Bitcoin difficulty adjusts with increased hashpower to maintain the inflation schedule, and ultimately the coin limit.  Specifically, the way it works is that the difficulty of finding a new block adjusts every two weeks in order to keep a 10 minute interval between blocks.  This limits the number of blocks, and thus new coins, produced even with increasing computing power.  Every four years, or so, the number of new coins in the block reward halves.  This limits the total number of coins.

       Bitcoin is too unstable to be a currency, as are all the others. It's a pyramid-like investment scheme that promises people they'll get rich if they invest. Very little about it as a currency. Though it is touted as almost divine as a currency--utopian.  It's easier to use Visa or Paypal, and easier to understand. I think the USD works just fine.

       Yes and no. It depends which crypto gets adopted. There will be a maximum of 21 million bitcoin available. The fact that it's a fixed supply will create demand and counter inflation. I believe the USD inflation rate is 2%/yr right now because the fed prints money non stop.

       I'm actually more excited about having control of my wealth, no bank needed. Just the other day one of the major US banks had a "glitch' which made every account go to $0.00.  People couldn't get their money.  Years ago Cypress took 10% from every account in the country overnight do the government could pay off some debt. I'd rather have access and control my money myself.

       That's why I don't necessarily  think Bitcoin wins long term. Projects like iota use a tech called tangle. There's no transaction fees and the network gets faster with more people on it.  Point is crypto is still pretty young and someone might come out with the winner in a year or two.

       So the main problem I have with cryptos is that they are starting to consume too much energy.  Someday, when we have clean free energy, it will be okay.  But right now?  Burning fossil fuels to generate hashes seems pretty wasteful.

       Call me a pessimist, and put technology aside (this is certainly not an issue, given time).
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't see how Crypto can replace currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? The Power-that-be is the biggest hurdle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself, why would the banking cabal (FED) allow this crypto to take over their existing scam? And you know they control the Congress, the whole government &amp; media. In short, everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you answer is "No, they won't". What makes think there is prospect with this crypto money? Unless you have a way to make the power-that-be bows down to your demand, right? But how? Don't forget the whole Congress is doing the cabal's bidding. All it takes is only to pass a bill. And Crypto will become illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if not, I think Bitcoin can only be an investment novelty at most. I imagine anything else is (probably) better if Crypto is only good for investment eg. painting,vintage stuffs, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seriously think Crypto can only shine as an official medium to exchange goods and services. And this can only materialize if there is way to block the power-that-be from interfering. Is this a possibility?

       I know this is meme, but I think the blockchain could save us. Imagine if more people adopted it. We could give payments, contacts, etc without big bro stepping in. We just need to find a way where we don't need fiat to buy in. Steemit is a good start. I think a decentralized world with freedom of information could be amazing. But yes, definitely needs to be more energy efficient.

       The only way to stop Bitcoin (Cash) is to ban the internet and computers.

       There may be some "casualties" in the short-run, but in the long-term the free market will fix it.

       The supposed backdoor hacks can't really kill Bitcoin. It's an open ledger. You can trace the money anywhere it goes. You best believe if some people get hacked through hard-ware backdoors there will be a lot of eyes on the transactions.

       You can get Bitcoin via sms or e-mail too. Heck, even via smoke signals.
      </p>

       Bitcoin doesn't steal wealth. It transfers it. See, the problem is you don't even understand how money works. It's a transfer of money. You could imagine Bitcoin as a sort of digital Euro. And the tl;dr would be that everyone just stops using dollars, because the fundamental attributes of the new Euro are better than those of the USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where you probably lost it: in a free market, the best "thing" always wins. You've just become highly accustomed to having someone ram their opinions down your throat. "Make the lie big and simple and eventually they will accept it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Fiat currency is the biggest scam ever pulled over on humanity by a wide margin. If you want to debate that, I welcome it. But you won't. You're a Stockholm syndrome victim. Become dependent on the system. Like a prisoner in Plato's allegory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, this likely comes across as prattle to you.  But I'm not a true believer. I believe in empirical evidence and facts. And I used to believe in politics and "the country." So I lived both lives. One was an absolute lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin isn't a
       <em>
        re
       </em>
       -volution. It's an
       <em>
        e
       </em>
       volution. It won't come back around. It's a brand new world. The world has never before had
       <strong>
        hard
       </strong>
       money.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not realise it, but before the 1900s, something like 95% of the population of the US was self-employed. There wasn't hardly any government. You didn't even need a visa to travel the world. So that is empirical proof that Western civilisation peaked in the early 1900s. We've been slowly giving up freedoms for "the greater good" for a long time. But we're all individuals and we've lost individual freedoms. So "the greater good" is an absolute lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure you're heavily projecting when you say my analysis is "religious." Everything is based in empirical evidence. For instance, Moore's law has Bitcoin scale globally. Free markets have historically provided solutions for
       <em>
        everything.
       </em>
       From roads to medicine to police to judicial courts. Everything gets worse the second the institutionalized mafia (to govern the mind- government) steps in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn off your tv for two months, turn off your radio. Read up on how anarcho-capitalism actually provides solutions. It can and will work. Then come back to me.

       You should really pick your demons. International wholesale banking, the Rothschild system, the Federal Reserve (which is neither), the rich. You don't have a snowballs' chance in hell bringing that down. "Anarcho-capitalism" is what we have but with BIG players making sure they keep theirs and GET yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you think of yourself as a monetary Che' Guevarra with your dusty team of hardened misfits who are bringin' down
       <em>
        the Man
       </em>
       ? Rag tag "Evolutionaries" at the cusp of a new age, riding into town and taking over one imaginary "coin" in a computer, on a network, at a time. That lets you
       <strong>
        make money without having to work for it
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're going to fill your bit wallet you made yourself and buy a Harley Davidson and ride like a Samurai into the new world, yeah.
