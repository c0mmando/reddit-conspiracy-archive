    <div class="md"><p>I have pulled strange fibres out of keratosis-like areas of my skin. A deep set, very “dark” blackhead-like mark on the back of my shoulder glowed extremely brightly in blacklight. I managed to extract it using frankincense, the skin around it blistered heavily the day after and healed very quickly. Also extracted a large parasite that seems non organic from my eye (it was a very unpleasant experience). I think that it is non organic because I put it in a glass jar and it has not moved/grown/broken down/multiplied at all since being jarred.</p>

<p>I am not 100% convinced of morgellons being a sort of parasite/legitimate illness in and of itself as opposed to being a sort of symptom. I have done more research into heavy metals/toxic elements being the reason for these strange symptoms. My Dr tells me that I certainly don’t have lyme, I have never been tested, but I have never experienced the trademark lyme “bullseye” markings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it to be delusional parasitosis. I have worked for dermatologists and psychiatrists, and the patients who brought in scabs with fibres (matchbox sign) always had their samples come back as regular scabs with natural (wool, cotton) or synthetic (acrylic, polyester)  involvement.</p>

<p>Basically, delusional parasitosis with formication leading to itching causing open sores that their clothing gets caught in.</p>

<p>I have not ever seen a shred of evidence that Morgellon&#39;s is a thing outside of social conditioning, and while a disease spread via Internet is super interesting, the base explanation for the physical causes are banal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Morgellon&#39;s is fascinating because of the role the internet plays in it - delusional parasitosis is not new, and has many underlying causes.</p>

<p>Morgellon&#39;s specifically has one - the internet. You&#39;d never hear of it otherwise and it would not be a thing that would occur to you. It&#39;s an issue of presentation as opposed to symptoms. Even if someone legitimately had scabies or some other skin parasite, &#39;matchbox sign&#39; (which is the behavior of collecting scabs and presenting them to people) is a recognizable &#39;sign&#39; of a psychodermatological issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems fair - I would have never heard of morgellons or thought that strange benign seeming marks on/in my skin were anything potentially serious or sinister if it wasn’t for the internet. I still figure that my symptoms are caused by a tick parasite (I have had many ticks before), toxic element/metal poisoning (I live in an area with lots of old mines and such) or black mold poisoning/something of the like (moldy apartment building)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly can&#39;t say it isn&#39;t caused by any of those things - I believe in chronic fatigue syndrome even if I don&#39;t know what causes it.</p>

<p>All I know is that of the cases of Morgellon&#39;s I&#39;ve seen, the data simply doesn&#39;t add up. No one is suddenly growing cotton out of some random scab, and I&#39;ve got a lab report that says &#39;this is cotton.&#39; If it were some parasite or nanomaterial or whatever, they would not all grow different materials in different colors that all look suspiciously like a sweater I have seen the person wear.</p>

<p>Have to go with the science on this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m not an expert on this nor do i have personal experience.  my personal experience is more with other environmental things that produce skin rashes, etc.  and my general advice here is to be familiar with traditional old school medicines like garlic and things that can help you handle your own health problems instead of relying upon mainstream medicine.  sad to say i&#39;ve had a few of these problems and i&#39;ve been able to avoid mainstream medicine in solving them.  and that&#39;s been a trial and error process.  traditional medicine hasn&#39;t really addressed the problems i&#39;ve run into.  the diagnoses have been extremely slow and incomplete and there&#39;s always a concern that you&#39;re going to the source of the problem to get the solution (which tends not to work).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be honest, I first heard of Morgellon&#39;s many years ago thanks to some cheesy reality &quot;news&quot; show in the 1980&#39;s.  I was so frightened I might catch some weird skin disease from space it may have contributed to my general anxiety disorder.  I&#39;m not entirely joking.  As a child I contracted chicken pox and became so hysterical that the scabs were permanent, I had to be sedated.  So watching that segment on Morgellon&#39;s was probably not a good idea.  </p>

<p>I thought I read the NHI had determined Morgellon&#39;s was psychosomatic or largely misdiagnosed in the very rare cases it occurs.  Recently, though it seems to have been classified a real condition, although of unknown cause or origin.  I understand the working theory is that it&#39;s caused by a tick like Lyme disease, or related to Lyme disease.  It&#39;s still incredibly rare (thank God).  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it came from outer space, or is related to chemtrails or GMO&#39;s or PCB&#39;s considering the first reported case was in 1674. </p>

<p>Summary:  The human body does some crazy stuff.  Morgellon&#39;s is one of them.   </p>

<p>Short summary. They think Lyme and Morgellons are related and tick born. Treatments can be similar for both. There has been very little research into Lyme let alone Morgellons as it was relatively recently that Lyme was accepted as &quot;real&quot;.     </p>
