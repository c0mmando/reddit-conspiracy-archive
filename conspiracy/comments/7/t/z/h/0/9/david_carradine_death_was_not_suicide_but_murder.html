<p>I do believe it myself from the 1st night the evidence came out there was something else at play.</p>

<p>Money is the main motive here, </p>

<p>I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5tt7MJZN_U">another video</a> which seems to suggest the same thing that Carradine was actually murdered.  </p>

<p><strong>Even his own family believes that he was murdered.</strong></p>

<p>The day after he was found dead his family was speaking with the media saying that they believe he was murdered and it was a cover up. </p>

<p>Wake up people this was not a suicide! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if Harvey Weinstein was behind it. 
Both Daryl Hannah and soon to be announced Uma Thurman were probably sexually assaulted by Weinstein during the Kill Bill movies production. 
A movie that David Carradine worked on and I think he found out what Weinstein was doing and threatened him. 
Weinstein got revenge some years later by having him murdered. 
Easy to connect the dots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might actually be onto something here.  You know he was into some of the depraved stuff that Weinstein may have been into as well being in the hollywood scene and all. </p>

<p>For all we know Carradine had blackmailed him or threatened to do so, in exchange for movie parts / silence / money etc.   </p>

<p>I dont think it was a clean cut deal.  there was money involved. possibly blackmail.  He was setup. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s why I believe he did it to himself:</p>

<p>Early 00s, living in Hollywood I was getting up super early to run before the traffic and pedestrians came out and I was heading back to my place when I crossed through a parking lot and saw one of the hookers from the motel next door (I saw them all the time, very friendly).  She was sitting on the curb with some dude who was slumping down and puking.  She was trying to feed this man milk but he kept puking it all over the place.  He lifted his head: David Carradine.  He was strung out on probably crack and she was trying to help him get right.</p>

<p>He was and had been on a death wish routine of drugs and prostitutes and sex since forever and it finally caught up to him when he was found dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It never was called a suicide, it was autoerotic asphyxiation. </p>

<p>The combination of passing out, at the same time as having an orgasm, is supposed to make the orgasm feel much much better and some people get sort of addicted to it, or can&#39;t get off as easily without it. As you can imagine, this is a tricky business.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try this at home, kids</p>
