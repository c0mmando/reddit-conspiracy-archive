All the body parts were confined to an area of 75 acres. Also another wrong fact that you&#39;re parroting is Indian lake is 1.5 miles away, not 6. The wind that day was blowing at 12 mph. I mean it isn&#39;t to believe all the debris from the impact crater can be picked up by the wind like a kite if it gets high enough. What they found 1.5 miles away were scraps of paper. They found the engine 300 yards away at the bottom of the hill it crashed on. It wasn&#39;t an open field. No there were no eyewitnesses on record saying they say a plane getting shot down.

<p>It runs at a loss actually.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t matter what you say, like I already said, the actual evidence speaks for itself, the transcripts, which even <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/13/bn.01.html">CNN published</a> prove what I am stating.</p>

<p>More? OK here you go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But what we do know is that there&#39;s a site about half mile behind me, where the plane went down, where most of the debris is, and then about six miles away up by a lake, there is another area that&#39;s been cordoned off, and state police and the FBI have said definitely there is debris from the plane located there.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What we do know&quot;.......&quot;and then about six miles away up by a lake&quot; How does one measure &quot;up by a lake?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;WE don&#39;t want to speculate about this large debris field. But it seems to me from covering a number of plane crashes on the scene, that if nothing else, <strong>this is not typical for a plane crash to be spread across an area this large.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>CABELL: It&#39;s certainly doesn&#39;t make sense, because most of the debris has been found in a very compact area, within 100 yards, 200 yards, maybe a little bit beyond that. <strong>Then all of a sudden they&#39;re telling us six miles away, they have another concentration of debris, very small pieces.</strong> Most peoples here no bigger than the size of briefcase. The debris six miles away may be smaller. We have talked to a number of individuals here. They say they have talked to people who saw this plane during the final moments. They haven&#39;t confirmed whether they saw -- whether they talked to anybody who saw this plane actually land, or crash rather, and as to whether it broke up on the way, we don&#39;t know that. The FBI being very tight-lipped about that.&quot;</p>

<p>Literally interviews and recordings from NYC eyewitnesses. The Pentagon hitting plane flew so low before hitting it clipped poles. Literally everyone driving to/from the Pentagon at the time saw the plane.</p>

<p>There was definitely something fishy about 9/11, but there not being planes is the dumbest I&#39;ve ever heard. Why in the world would you use two missiles when everyone and thier brother in NYC would be looking and it being filmed at least for the second incident.</p>

<p>It straight up makes no sense when we already had remote pilot capabilities and could easily send a plane without a pilot.</p>

<p>It seems people forgt motive. For another instance take WTC 7. Why would you demolish it with WTC 1 and 2 going down. If it wasn&#39;t focused on by select groups people would care as much about WTC 7 as the other 7 buildings that collapsed besides WTC 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Did they sneak in demolition explosives to blow up something secretive? If you can sneak in and plant explosions you can sure as he&#39;ll sneak something out. Not to mention the chance someone stumbles upon a piece after demolition. It just makes no sense.</p>

<p>Additionally when performing a complex operation you keep it as simple as possible. The more elaborate the more points of failure you have. Let&#39;s compare two options.</p>

<p>A) You remote control two planes into WTC 1 and 2. You let chance dictate what collapses and even if nothing does you still have a major incident on American soil and can perform another terrorist attack if needed.</p>

<p>B) You involve countless people in setting up explosives in the extremely busy WTC 1 and 2, possibly risk explosives in other buildings, use missiles that can be caught on camera, and make it seem identical to a plane crash.</p>

<p>Option A has way less risk of being caught than option B. KISS, keep it simple stupid.</p>

<p>If you look at seismology graphs from that day you will see successive shocks indicating of each floor collapsing seperately. Physics is pretty close to my occupation and it makes perfect sense once you plot it this way. One floor collapsed falling on the one below causing it to collapse thus eliminating lean on each floor.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s something we may never know. So far no engineering report has released how they modeled WTC 7. It&#39;s also unique as the suppression system was take out by WTC 1 and 2 collapsing. We really don&#39;t have a precedent since the extinguishing system normally curtails like fires.</p>

<p>This is why I bring up motive. I have not seen or can&#39;t think of a solid reason to bring WTC 7 down on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well isnt the motive irrelevant? the fact that we dont know how or why it fell means something was done to it to bring it down. shouldnt that be investigated or looked into more? why leave that building out of the initial report? kind of silly to say that since you cant think of a motive then there&#39;s no reason to suspect anything nefarious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well right now we have two reports. NIST which gives its explanation of why WTC 7 failed and the Alaskan  University report which claims it didn&#39;t happen according to NIST report. Neigther provide thier documentation. </p>

<p>NIST was government funded and beholden to that narrative. AFU was purposely created in the belief NIST is wrong and to challenge it. It set out for a goal rather than be objective. You can easily see this in thier presentation where they show a video showing and claiming free fall while every other video shows inside collapse followed by outside collapse.</p>

<p>Both studies are tainted, one due to aparent bias and the other one government funded. That&#39;s why I fall back on possible motive. There isn&#39;t a source I trust. I&#39;m also not sure how to have an investigation that would be impartial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coincidence maybe. Or the fact that the fuel on board was burning at such a temperature that it weakened the structure. Hence the bowing of the walls just before collapsing which caused the building to collapse 1 floor onto the next (as the person above mentioned). The weight of the floor above collapsing added huge weight to the floor below which had been weakened itself in the collision and extreme heat. As the planes came in at different angels it damaged more than 1 floor on entry. Contrary to conspiracy theorists the building did not collapse at terminal velocity. Not even close as you can see rubble falling at terminal velocity much faster than the main towers behind it. I could be wrong, but from my basic knowledge time the collapse in real-time of the tower collapse and drop a rock from the same high and see for yourself. Not trolling just explaining how the physics have been explained to me and I am no expert. I could be wrong, but all evidence points to this fact :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing about educated people: they&#39;ve invested time, energy, and a great deal of money into a piece of paper that says they&#39;re educated. Smart. Smarter than the average bear, even. Much of that &quot;intelligence&quot; is just learning to parrot authority, learning which authorities are acceptable to repeat and which aren&#39;t. Creative, unique, outside-the-box thinking isn&#39;t valued in academia. That&#39;s not what American education is set up for.</p>

<p>Being considered stupid is the BIGGEST insult to someone whose identity and means of living (employment) hinges on being educated. (e.g. See the slandering of Trump - what do they primarily say about him? &quot;He&#39;s an idiot, stupid, moron, etc.&quot; Worst possible insult they can think of. They did the same with George W. back in his day. And Carter, before him) In school, you are taught that your worth - your intrinsic value - both material and social, is directly correlated to your intelligence, or your ability to navigate the educational system successfully. And again, navigating the educational system successfully means accepting the indoctrination, learning which authorities are acceptable to parrot. </p>

<p>Examples of acceptable authorities to parrot include CNN, WaPo, NYT, and the networks sans FOX. The people you mentioned do not wish to <em>discredit</em> themselves by endorsing an alternative narrative whether they in their heart of hearts believe it or not. It&#39;s not worth the social capital they would expend doing it. The sanctioned, &quot;authentic&quot; authorities have told people the official narrative for 9/11. If an educated person steps outside the bounds of acceptable discussion, suggesting an alternative explanation that doesn&#39;t mesh with the official narrative, the peer pressure to get back in line is immense. One mustn&#39;t appear <em>stupid</em>! That could be costly.</p>

Do your own research instead of parroting the garbage you read on those websites. I&#39;ve taken more physics and science classes than 95% of the population. I work in surgery for a living. It isn&#39;t hard to your mind around any of these subjects if you understand physics  Guys with PhD&#39;s have dedicated their to this subject, the most studied subject in the history of engineering and yet you believe you know more than them? You guys really crack me up because none of you took any classes in science past introductory level. How are you qualified to talk?</p>

<p>I don’t need to talk about the melting point of steel or any other nonsense to cast doubt on the government’s theory of the conspiracy which destroyed the towers. Because their explanation is literally a conspiracy theory as well.</p>

<p>It really IS basic physics which disproves the existing theory.</p>

<p>an object will only accelerate if there is a net or unbalanced force acting upon it. The presence of an unbalanced force will accelerate an object - changing its speed, its direction, or both its speed and direction.</p>

<p>In my mind, the speed and manner of the collapse of both the north and south towers violated this principle. It requires some other, as yet unverified force to explain the collapse of both towers</p>

<p>I fully expect u/FuckTheClippers to attack me personally for my opinion, because it would out of character for him not to do so.
Nevertheless, if he has some theory that explains how the force of the uncollapsed floors failed to change the acceleration or direction of the collapsing floors, a theory supported basic physics, I would certainly consider his explanation</p>

<p>They violate the laws of transfer? Hahahaha way to prove how uneducated you are. Show me the equations they violate. Every computer simulation performed by PhD physicists says otherwise. In fact 99% of the simulations show they fell at exactly the expected rate they did in reality. Can anyone here who has an actual science background please talk</p>

<p>That is precisely the point. It only take high school physics to understand why no physics PhD student has ever managed to produce a tower collapse experiment that shows the supposed mechanics of their destruction.</p>

<p>And as all physics PhD students understood their high school physics, that&#39;s why there&#39;s not a single one who has even tried it, even 16 years after the event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your last video didn&#39;t account for one huge component, the 500mph airplane slamming into it. Let&#39;s do some simple physics since you think it can be disproven. F=ma. Right? Mass is the plane is 770,000 lbs. Acceleration is 500mph. Convert that to about 900km/h and  350,000kg. Your last experiment doesn&#39;t account for 315 million Newtons slamming into the structural components of 9 stories. It also doesn&#39;t account for the fire that went down the middle of the building. People were getting off the elevators burnt to death from the jet fuel inferno racing down the elevator shaft. So your last experiment is rubbish</p>

<p>First video, same concept was missing. You are only making yourself look unfamiliar with the subject. Watch more videos of the damn people in the buildings right before it collapses. You can see plenty of fire everywhere. Molten aluminum inside a calorimeter (I highly doubt you even know what that is Mr. Uneducated)  containing enough oxygen to fuel a fire becomes highly explosive once exposed to water. Any basic high school chemistry student knows that soft metals are highly volatile when heated and exposed to water, like water from the sprinkler system in the WTC. Everything you&#39;ve thrown at me I&#39;ve disproven</p>

<p>Also, since you are so obsessed with equations where none are required, I should like to see an equation that IS required to support one of your more controversial statements. That is, your claim of BILLIONS of Newtons being at least peripherally responsible for the collapse of WTC 7. I can neither prove or disprove this number, but as it is your claim, the onus is on you. I take this to mean that you can provide an estimate of the mass and acceleration of the debris required to equal billions of newtons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 billion newtons = 100 million kilograms or 100 kilotons mass when it is not in motion or accelerating. That is, when the only force acting upon it is gravity.</p>

<p>Each tower had a total mass of roughly 450,000,000 kg</p>

<p>Your statement of billions of newtons is seemingly high, so I rounded down to 1 billion newtons. This is roughly 25% of the total mass of the entire tower (only one tower was in a position to debris upon WTC7.)</p>

<p>Already the numbers are whack. Andf since it is your claim, and also your claim that no one else in this sub is educated to understand da gweat big, fucking huge numbers of which your edumacation grants you such deep understanding, you go right ahead and provide the mythical equation that will shed light on the billions of newtons that caused the collapse of WTC7. I&#39;m sure it is contained in all the computer simulations you keep driveling on about.</p>

<p>I’m also sure that you’re the Ticketmaster of Wolf Tickets. A real big talker. If you spoke to me in this manner irl, it wouldn’t matter whatsoever the outcome. I’d sock you right in your dicksuckers. Just saying...bro</p>

<p>By the way, I would be curious to know your opinion regarding the current STEM vs STEAM controversy in education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official explanation offered by NIST is incomplete, they&#39;ve admitted a couple of times that they cannot fully explain the collapse of 1 and 2. In fact their explanation of those two collapses only goes up to &#39;the point at which the buildings were poised to collapse&#39;. You can easily confirm this by taking a look at the peer review paper &#39; Fourteen Points of Agreement with Official Government Reports on the World Trade Center Destruction&#39;. It&#39;s a very short read. </p>

<p>Similarly the explanation they offer for the collapse of building 7 is not fully available for public viewing &#39;for reasons of public safety&#39;, so again, what is one to think? On the one hand you have three historical firsts; steel framed buildings collapsing as a result of fire (the official explanation for each collapse is fire, not the impacts), and each collapse mirrors that of controlled demolition in its speed and symmetry, and at each site molten steel was observed. Numerous professionals in the relevant fields of physics, engineering, demolition, etc, have spoken out on this and expressed a learned opinion on the cause. There are those educated people like you&#39;ve mentioned who back the official story, but I honestly do not see anything like the number of professionals willing to put their name and reputation behind it as I do those who are willing to do so with the demolition hypothesis. That some PhD is able to create a mathematical model that convinces a layman is one thing, but in view of the rest of the facts I am forced to side with the more probable cause, which is clearly that of controlled demolition.</p>

Who am I to argue with two professionals in that field?</p>

<p>In fact one of them, a man called Danny Jowenko, was later quoted on July 13th 2011 in an exclusive Press TV interview, by Dr. Alan Sabrosky, Veterans Today board member and editor, who specifically drew attention to Jowenko&#39;s statements on the nature of the collapse of building seven. Three days later Danny Jowenko crashed into a tree on a straight road and died.</p>

<p>debunking911 is an aggregation site that pulls in sources from all over the place and gather them together. There is a veritable ocean of information for those that really want to learn about the collapses. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists are only capable of trying to find flaws in arguments and look for gaps in information. They have no consistent position of their own to put forward because they are arguing for a reality that simply doesn&#39;t exist. I enjoy looking at other perspectives, but every actual study into the incident conclusively demonstrates that the 9/11 case is closed from all but an academic standpoint</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, seems I&#39;ve been discussing with you on a couple of threads at the same time, forgive me if I get my wires crossed, it&#39;s very late where I am and I&#39;m tired.</p>

<p>Anyway, I had a look at that site and would like to say firstly that anybody who thinks there were no planes that hit either of those towers is either mentally incompetent or deliberately muddying the waters for those who are genuinely searching for answers.</p>

<p>Secondly on the explanation offered by that site on the collapse of building 7, I am aware of it. I am not a professional in physics, mathematics or engineering however, I am an English teacher, and so cannot comment on the plausibility of their explanation. I am aware however that the official explanation offered by the NIST is not fully available to the public, &#39;for reasons of public safety&#39; so what am I left with? Incomplete explanations for the highly unusual collapses of three buildings and a number of learned professionals who claim that it was controlled demolition. I watch the collapse of 7 against video footage of known demolitions and I can&#39;t tell them apart. I am told by demolition experts that this was controlled demolition. Who am I to question them and my own eyes? I have no personal investment in the government of the United States, my world does not crumble to consider what I see and hear to be true. </p>

<p>Because the alternative is to study civil engineering/city planning/chemistry/physics and spend years combing through the data looking for flaws or to blindly believe in the other side of the argument which doesn&#39;t have reputable studies backing it.</p>

<p>Not sure what you mean by that.</p>

<p>The vast majority of them agree with the official reports and the many studies that have been done since the incident. Why would they speak up about it? </p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s so noteworthy whenever one speaks out against the official story. If you want to get a real picture of the general opinion on the 9/11, you should look through engineering publications for peer-reviewed studies on the subject. Let me know how many you find that think any of the collapses were controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Also, what department? Hired by whom?</p>

<p>His claim was that the building should have withstood pools of burning jet fuel. Which is correct. However, that&#39;s not the only stress put on the buildings that day. I imagine if he was fired for it, it&#39;s because he was pushing a false narrative</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fact that NIST cannot fully explain the collapse of 1 and 2 and refuse to fully divulge their explanation for the collapse of 7. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fact that those three buildings all fell at essentially freefall speeds suggesting practically zero resistance, even though there is no historical precedence for any steel framed building collapsing as a result of fire at any speed, let alone at such impossible speeds as this. The combined collapse speeds for all three buildings put together is little over thirty seconds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fact that each of the three buildings experienced complete global collapse, and each into its own footprint, which would require instantaneous, simultaneous failure throughout each and every piece of solid framework in a perfect and precise manner so as not to let any of these buildings collapse to one side. Also a complete historical first in a building fire, minus the use of explosives.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fact that an abundance of molten steel was reported at each site for months after the event, even though the maximum temperatures reported by NIST were of 1000°c and steel does not melt below 1500°c. </p>

<p>It is also a fact that although NIST are admittedly unable to explain all these things with their explanation of a fire based collapse, the demolition hypothesis explains each collapse and it&#39;s anomalies in their entirety.</p>

Just because you feel some things are not fully explained, most of which is refuted by experts, this in itself does not lend any credibility to an, in my opinion, outlandish controlled demolition theory.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I stated some of the most important facts, although the report by FEMA also shows a high temperature erosion occurred to the steel, which is also inconsistent with a fire based scenario yet fits the demolition hypothesis. </p>

<p>It is not a fact that these buildings were brought down by controlled demolition, but seeing as these huge anomalies can all be explained by such a scenario, it is undeniably and by far the more probable cause.</p>

<p>As for the question of how such an undertaking was possible and how many would have had to have been complicit, who can say? Are those members of FEMA who arrived on September 10th complicit? They were sent on a drill. Were the air traffic controllers complicit because they took so very long to report the planes were unresponsive and off course? They were involved in war games. Personally I think a grand assumption is often made on just how many would have been complicit. The bottom line is science trumps all assumption, and the science cannot be ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what your point is, I couldn&#39;t open one of your links, another asked me to download material, which I do not wish to do, and the other described the hijack as it occurred. If there are inconsistencies or mistakes in my argument, I welcome you to point them out, I would not be surprised at all to find them, I&#39;m writing this mostly from memory of what I&#39;ve read. If however you choose to direct me here and there and expect me to read entire articles to verify simple points, I simply don&#39;t have the time.</p>

<p>Was there evidence of a high temperature erosion to the steel? Yes there was, this is fact. The New York Times described it as perhaps the biggest mystery surrounding the events of 9/11. Is this consistent with a fire based scenario? It is not. FEMA described steel that looked like Swiss cheese. How do fires that burned at a maximum of 1000°c produce such a result as this?</p>

<p>Did FEMA arrive the day before 9/11? As I understand it, yes, but if I am wrong I do not see much significance in the fact, I was merely making an example with regards to your suggestion that huge numbers were involved. The same goes for what I said about the air traffic controllers, if I remembered incorrectly it is neither here nor there, my point was that the response time was wildly corrupted by the war games that were going on, but this was not the fault of the air traffic controllers and does not make them complicit in any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>As for your claim that 99.9% of engineers disagree with the demolition hypothesis, how on earth would you know that? I am aware of a number of professionals in the relevant fields who put their names and reputations behind the demolition hypothesis in the organization AE9/11 Truth, and I understand there is a similar organization of firefighters who back the demolition hypothesis, but where are those professionals who have put their names behind the official story?  It is such a controversial subject, there must be those learned professionals who wish to show their support for the official explanation, lacking though it may be. Where are they? I&#39;m aware of debunking sites but I am not aware of any that boast such impressive credentials.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An article in The Newsletter of the Structural Engineers Association of Utah describing an speaking appearance by Leslie Robertson (structural engineer responsible for the design of the World Trade Center) contains this passage:</p>

<p>“As of 21 days after the attack, the fires were still burning and molten steel was still running”<br/>

<p>Although this is generally attributed to Leslie Robertson, it’s not at all clear that he ever said these words. The quote actually comes from <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/moltensteel.html">an article by James M Williams</a>, recounting a keynote address that was delivered by Robertson, so it’s at best a second-hand interpretation of what he said. </p>

<p>What is the truth, then? We sent an email to LERA, Robertson&#39;s engineering firm, in an effort to find out:</p>

<p>This statement has been attributed to Leslie Robertson and used to support some of the more unusual claims regarding the 9/11 attacks. I was wondering, is this statement correct, or could you clarify it at all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a short time later, an email arrived from Leslie E Robertson himself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I&#39;ve no recollection of having made any such statements...nor was I in a position to have the required knowledge.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brief, but direct: he doesn’t recall making the statement, and wouldn’t have known if it was true anyway. </p>

<p>Previously we concluded that the phrase was Williams alone, but it seems that’s not entirely true. James Williams sent us his notes from the Robertson address, and it does make reference to molten metal. Only that’s it: he wrote “molten metal - still running”, not “molten steel”. (We’ve made the notes <a href="http://911myths.com/NCSEA_oct_5_2001_Leslie_Robertson_s_lecture__notes_by_James_Williams.pdf">available here</a>, with permission).</p>

<p>Robertson says he didn’t use the “molten steel” quote, then, and Williams notes don’t disprove this. The key is to find out where the “molten metal” line came from. Was it something Robertson said, and has since forgotten? Or a note in response to a photo? We’re trying to obtain the original Powerpoint slides of the address, which should offer a clue, but in the meantime this story should be regarded with caution: it’s clearly far from definitive evidence of molten steel at Ground Zero.&quot;</p>

<p>Copied from <a href="http://911myths.com/html/leslie_robertson.html">here</a>.  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>So do I personally believe there were second hand accounts of pools of flowing metal at ground zero 21 days after the incident?<br/>
Sure. Even though the official reports make no mention of it I think it&#39;s conceivable that molten metal was observed, the buildings contained lots and lots of metals, like alluminium, zinc etc., after all.<br/>
Do I believe molten <em>steel</em> was observed? No I don&#39;t. There is no evidence to support otherwise.<br/>
Do I believe molten <em>metal</em>, assuming it was in fact observed, supports a malicious conspiracy? No I don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So that particular quote from Leslie Robertson was a poor reference, but what of the other quotes listed in this site you referenced? </p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/moltensteel.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/moltensteel.html</a>      </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying very hard not to swamp you with information, it would be easy to simply direct you to a site and say, there, read that. Here, for example are three more short passages from the AE9/11truth site supporting the claim that there was molten steel and excessive temperatures at the WTC site, all taken from this page:</p>

<p><a href="http://www1.ae911truth.org/faqs/347-high-temperatures-persistent-heat-a-molten-steel-at-wtc-site-challenge-official-story.ht">http://www1.ae911truth.org/faqs/347-high-temperatures-persistent-heat-a-molten-steel-at-wtc-site-challenge-official-story.ht</a></p>

<p>FEMA documents in their Appendix C of its May 2002 WTC Building Performance Assessment Team study, for sample 1, “evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent intergranular melting.” A “sulfur-rich liquid” containing “primarily iron, oxygen, and sulfur” “penetrated” into the steel.</p>

<p>Bechtel engineers, responsible for safety at Ground Zero, wrote in the Journal of the American Society of Safety Engineers: “The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400ºF to more than 2,800ºF.”</p>

<p>University of California professor Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl, the first structural engineer given access to the WTC steel at Fresh Kills Landfill notes, “I saw melting of girders at the World Trade Center.” Astaneh also “describes the connections between supporting columns as being smoothly warped: ‘If you remember the Salvador Dalí paintings with the clocks that are kind of melted – it’s kind of like that. That could only happen if you get steel yellow hot or white hot – perhaps around 2,000 degrees.&quot;</p>

<p>I still see reason to believe that there was molten steel produced that day, so what can I do but follow that to its natural conclusion that there was more at play than simple office fires?</p>

<p>These sites often use a tactic called quote mining.<br/>
&quot;Quote mining (also contextomy) is the fallacious tactic of taking quotes out of context in order to make them seemingly agree with the quote miner&#39;s viewpoint or to make the comments of an opponent seem more extreme or hold positions they don&#39;t in order to make their positions easier to refute or demonize.&quot;<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Quote_mining">(Source)</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the three examples you posted;<br/>
1) &quot;severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s discussed in the Worchester Polytechnic Institute research I linked to earlier.<br/>
Long story short; the metal was studied and found to have corroded at 
temperatures between 800 and 1000 degrees C.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>2) Thermal measurements taken by helicopter [..] more than 2,800ºF.
Where&#39;s the evidence of this claim?<br/>
The article they link to (on their own site) doesn&#39;t supply these measurements.<br/>
Plus there is lots of <em>actual</em> research contradicting these claims. (<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0429/thermal.r09.html">example</a>)  </p>

<p>These &quot;9/11 truth&quot; sites have no interest in finding <em>the</em> truth, they are peddling BS to try to sell <em>their</em> truth. They don&#39;t care about established facts, laws of science or logic.<br/>
In reality this whole &#39;truther movement&#39; died some 10 years ago and they&#39;re mostly stuck regurgitating long refuted claims.<br/>
On the other hand <em>real</em> 9/11 based science has been used to reconsider applied building practices and is actually currently being used to make buildings safer.  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>How any educated person fails to see the <em>real</em> truth about 9/11 and gets lured into conspiracy fairy tale land is the true mystery to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I read the quote, but where is the actual evidence?<br/>
Where is the data from these daily measurements?<br/>
I did some digging and found none. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>What I <em>did</em> find was an analysis from a NASA JPL scientist (Ryan Mackey);<br/>
Details <a href="http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums%20/showpost.php?p=4452063&amp;amp;postcount=418">here</a>.</p>

<p>Summary:
&quot;The article -- which lists no source for that claim -- is in error. [..] The &quot;helicopter thermal imaging&quot; mentioned in the Professional Safety piece were, in fact, DEA helicopters. There is no DEA helicopter in service carrying a thermal imager calibrated anywhere near 2800<sup>o</sup> F. That requires a specialty instrument, viz. <a href="https://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/">AVIRIS</a>, which flew the same mission on a fixed-wing aircraft. The original article is simply not credible, and its conclusion is refuted by superior data.&quot; (ie. the <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0429/thermal.r09.html">data</a> I linked to in my previous post)<br/>
(<a href="http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4446887&amp;amp;postcount=368">Source</a>)</p>

<p>And later:<br/>
&quot;The &quot;2800 F&quot; reading was reported as coming from the FLIR of a DEA helicopter -- a system that, under no circumstances, is calibrated nor can be calibrated to measure a temperature that high.&quot;<br/>
(<a href="http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/showpost.php?p=6981487&amp;amp;postcount=123">Source</a>)  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, it is not my intention to attemot to change your mind. You asked &quot;How does any educated person fail to see the truth about 9/11&quot; and I&#39;m merely trying to illustrate how an educated person might arrive at completely different conclusions as your own.<br/>
What you decide to be <em>the truth</em> I&#39;ll leave to your own interpretation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been sitting in my phone waiting for my vpn to start working so I can add some links but it&#39;s no good, I could be waiting ages, I&#39;m in China and the great firewall of China is proving next to impossible for me to scale. Please to forgive.<br/>
The truth is indeed open to interpretation as you say, and despite the numerous, unambiguous quotes about molten steel, including the one by Abolhassan - which he did make, despite his objection to having it used by the truth movement - evidence of the existence of molten steel at the WTC is not quite as easily confirmed as I had previously thought. </p>

<p>I did intend to add a link here to a group of firefighters describing molten steel after the event. If you wish to see it search, &#39;9/11 firefighters describe molten steel like lava&#39; that should do it.</p>

<p>Can these men tell the difference between molten steel, or lava as they describe it, and aluminum which I believe takes a far more liquid form? I choose to believe that they can.</p>

<p>But evidence for molten steel is not the only evidence to suggest those three buildings were brought down by controlled demolition, or that the entire event was a false flag operation designed to create public support for a war on Afghanistan.</p>

<p>I must say here that I am perfectly aware that I could be completely wrong about all this. Of course I could, but then so could you, one doesn&#39;t purposefully choose the incorrect side of an argument, we just believe what seems correct to us at the time.The main factors that lead me to believe this outlandish fairytale, in no particular order, are as follows:</p>

<p>The knowledge that under Kennedy the joint chiefs of staff planned to commit acts of terrorism against the people of the United States and blame them on Cuba in order to gain public support for an invasion on Cuba - Operation Northwood.   </p>

<p>The fact that it was a false flag event that lead the United States into the war in Vietnam - the Gulf of Tonkin incident.                    </p>

<p>A neo conservative think tank called the PNAC in which Cheney was a member, released a publication in the year before 9/11 in which it was stated that &#39;Creating Tomorrow’s Dominant Force - the process of transformation is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor&#39;. This quote suggests such an event as 9/11 might actually have been desirable to some.</p>

<p>Similarly there was a quote made during negotiations for oil pipeline rights in Afghanistan in August 2001 in which the U.S. told the Taliban: &quot;Accept our offer of a carpet of gold or you&#39;ll get a carpet of bombs before the next snows fall.&quot; Was it purely by chance that they were able to make good on this promise with the full support of the American people?  </p>

<p>The collapses themselves, in particular that of building 7. Seen here against three known controlled demolitions.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Rm6ZFROmc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Rm6ZFROmc</a></p>

<p>Until eight years ago I never questioned the official story but then I saw this. As I understand it, until 9/11 there was no historical precedence for a steel framed building collapsing as a result of fire, yet it is fire that is stated as the cause of collapse in all three instances. 1 and 2 were unusual cases though, if not for building 7 I would not have questioned the event at all, but 7 falls in classic controlled demolition type descent, even down to the crimp in the near centre of the roof, initiating collapse in order to cause the building to fall in on itself, perfectly into its own footprint. The first hundred feet of its descent occurred at perfect freefall. I&#39;ve heard the official explanation, for what it means to me, I am a layman, but even a layman can comprehend the enormous improbability of each and every supporting beam failing instantaneously in such a way as creates this perfect symmetry. To achieve such a collapse professionally takes a great deal of knowledge and expertise, and of course a great deal of well placed, correctly discharged explosives. When I ask how any educated person can fail to see the truth about 9/11, I really do a huge disservice to common sense. I really ought to ask how any &#39;person&#39; can fail to see the truth about 9/11, because it truly does seem self evident. </p>

<p>But maybe I am wrong. Maybe the collapse of building 7 was just the most frightful and unfortunate, coincidental freak of nature in history.  I just personally don&#39;t think it was, that&#39;s all. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that, unless there has been some new development in recent years, the official explanation for the collapse of 7 is not fully available to the public &#39;for reasons of public safety&#39;.</p>

<p>Similarly, the NIST have said on a couple of occasions that I know of that they cannot fully explain the collapse of towers 1 and 2, which leaves the door of speculation open further still, unless one considers the possibility of controlled demolition, in which case each building collapse occurred naturally, without anomaly.</p>

<p>Video footage of squibs is in keeping with the demolition theory, though I am also aware of the counter argument to this point so, like you say, it is open to interpretation.</p>

<p>Likewise the number of firemen and people who were there who claim to have heard explosions. Some say they were mistaken and it was the collapsing floors striking together they heard. I happen to believe those who were actually there rather than those who were not.</p>

<p>There is an MIT engineer called King who gives a convincing talk on the pyroclastic clouds produced by each collapse, stating them as proof of controlled demolition. </p>

<p>The organizations like ae9/11 Truth or Firefighters for 9/11 Truth. I&#39;m sure you can find a host of professionals in the relevant fields who are willing to put their names and reputations behind the official story but I&#39;ve not come across them to such a great extent as those who support the demolition theory. I&#39;ve heard far more assumption made to the effect that 99% of the scientific community support the official story. It seems to me that the real truth of the matter is that the scientific community on the whole have mostly remained silent on the subject.</p>

<p>The documentary &#39;Explosive Evidence&#39; shows a mixture of scientists, architects, engineers and demolition experts, one of which, Danny Jowenko was later quoted on July 13th 2011 in a Press TV interview by Dr. Alan Sabrosky, Veterans Today board member and editor, who specifically drew attention to Jowenko&#39;s statements on the nature of the collapse of building seven. Three days later Danny Jowenko crashed into a tree on a straight road and died. In view of the fact that so much else points to a possible conspiracy, I find this fact suspicious. </p>

<p>Please YouTube search &#39;Danny Jowenko seeing building 7 collapse for the first time&#39; to get an unbiased point of view from a professional.</p>

<p>There are a number of things in terms of the possible organization of such an event that give cause for suspicion:</p>

<p>The changing of long held flight protocol earlier that year restricting the power to give the shoot down order to Cheney, Rumsfeld and a small handful of others.  </p>

<p>Cheney&#39;s new position, taken only a few months before the event, giving himself full control over war games and hijack situations.</p>

<p>The numerous drills and war games taking place at the same time as the attacks, some simulating hijacked aircraft, might arguably have acted as a smoke screen, which allowed events to unfold with greater ease. One air traffic controller commented that he &quot;did not know what was real world and what was exercise.&quot;</p>

<p>As Captain Eric H. May, a former US Army military intelligence officer, stated: “The easiest way to carry out a false flag attack is by setting up a military exercise that simulates the very attack you want to carry out.”</p>

<p>The testimony of Norman Minetta in which he described a young soldier reporting to Cheney on the progress of an approaching aircraft that was heading for the Pentagon. &quot;The young man came in at intervals, saying, the plane is thirty miles out. The plane is twenty miles out. The plane is ten miles out. The soldier then asked, do the orders still stand, at which point Cheney whipped his head round and said, have I told you anything to the contrary?&quot; The man holding the hearing asked Minetta, &quot;Was he talking about the plane that struck the Pentagon?&quot; and Minetta confirmed that &quot;Yes, he was.&quot;</p>

<p>The privatization of the WTC complex just months before the event, after it had been owned by the port authority its past thirty years. The insurance payout to its new owner, Larry Silverstein was huge.</p>

<p>The put options made in the weeks leading up to 9/11 predicting the airline stock would fall. A spokesman for Bloomberg was quoted as saying, &quot;This would be the biggest coincidence in the history of the world, if it were a coincidence.&quot;</p>

<p>The magic passport of one of the hijackers that survived the fireball, only to be found in one piece on the streets below.           </p>

<p>That video of the guy they said was Bin Laden confessing. He looked &#39;nothing&#39; like him. My cat looks more like Bin Laden than that fella.</p>

<p>Ted Gunderson, a man who served as the head of the FBI in Los Angeles, Memphis, and Dallas, consecutively over a period of thirty years, eventually turned whistleblower and was quoted as saying that most terrorist attacks in the USA are perpetrated by the CIA.</p>

<p>There, I&#39;m done. I&#39;ve written most of this from memory, I don&#39;t doubt you&#39;ll find the odd little mistake if you try, like I say, I&#39;d have liked to have provided links, but overall I&#39;m confident that I&#39;ve remembered accurately.</p>

Plenty of pictures of debris falling all over it you can search.  <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/Bankers.jpg">Here&#39;s one from right after the South tower fell on it</a> The billions of Newtons of force in the falling debris scooped out the side of the building facing the twin towers. The gas generators on the upper floors were punctured by the debris and created the fires. The buildings burned for 7 hours after the buildings structural components eventually lost integrity from the combination of collapsing debris and raging fires. Watch the collapse video. You can see the top of the building cave in first into the hollow center caused by the debris and continue the transfer of momentum. When in the history of humanity has a building withstood billions of Newtons of force from one of the top 10 tallest structures in the world collapsing on it? The real modern marvel is that it stood up for 7 hours. That should prove to you it wasn&#39;t a controlled demolition. </p>

<p>The US governments Bin Laden and his 19 merry men fable is a conspiracy theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue is that the &#39;truth movement&#39; only agrees on one single thing; that the &#39;official story&#39; is a cover-up.</p>

<p>As for who was responsible and how it was done, take your pick. Cruise missiles? Directed energy weapons? Nano-thermite? Bombs placed there during construction? The list goes on …</p>

<p>If the &#39;truth movement&#39; can come up with a plausible explanation that better fits the evidence, rather than anomaly hunting, they might be taken more seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is all those answers may be correct. Nano-thermite blew out the holes in the towers where the &#39;planes&#39; hit, &#39;Reagan&#39;s Star Wars&#39; Directed energy satellites brought the towers down, and a cruise missiles hit the Pentagram) As for who did it.. Netanyahu said Israel is &#39;benefiting from attack&#39; as it &#39;swung American public opinion.&#39; Or government got the Patriot Act. Appears to be problem, reaction, and solution.</p>

I remember being glued to the TV for two or three months before I decided in disgust that it was just nonsense. Not because I was questioning the narrative but because of the drivel of small bits of information on an insane loop made me feel like I was being infected.</p>

<p>Fast forward many years later, I hear about and then investigate what I believe is the truth only to find when I talk to people about it it&#39;s as if I have two heads and I&#39;m speaking a foreign language. </p>

<p>In reference to people of note &amp; those you have listed, I think that they are either incapable and/or unwilling to even investigate what happened or they certainly know the truth and willfully choose not to say anything in public about it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even Abby Martin who I consider to be a  rarity in journalism - courageous with strong convictions - backed off her assertion that 9/11 was an inside job now. It has become a bad meme where anyone who brings it up is instantly labelled and has their life&#39;s work completely discredited. Those already on the fringe of academia or the media knew this and knew it wasn&#39;t worth it.</p>

<p>The reality is that the propaganda war on 9/11 is completely lost. There will probably be a bunch of shows and documentaries riddled with disinfo on &quot;the truth&quot; in 30 years or so like they currently do with JFK. 
Imo there is more than enough &#39;open conspiracy&#39; to criticize the government and US empire on as is (e.g. verifiable and respected info such as John Perkins &#39;New Confessions of an Economic Hitman&#39;). The empire has already shown itself to be an illegitimate, murderous, and tyrannical force. So using just public knowledge and sense should be able to convince most people shit is fucked and needs to change in a real way. </p>

Nothing has been solved other than some TERRORISTS hijacked a plane and flew them into buildings under the order of OSAMA BIN LADEN. Why is this so hard to accept? The real question lies in who worked with Al Quieda? people from the west? was it only Saudis? Were there other hands in this for more sinister reasons? Israel?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about buying it, it&#39;s a matter of looking at the historical precedence for such a collapse as occurs at freefall speed, into its own footprint, and producer molten steel. There is absolutely none if one chooses to believe these three buildings were felled by fire. If one considers the possibility that explosives were used, you have a history of countless occurrences that mirror each of these characteristics precisely. And in light of the fact that NIST admit that they cannot fully explain the collapse of 1 and 2, and refuse to release their explanation for 7 in its entirety, one has little choice but to go with the explanation that has the greatest probability of producing the known results, that being symmetrical freefall and an abundance of melted steel. Its the most scientific option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s necessary to question that which remains unanswered. NIST admit they cannot fully explain the collapse of 1 and 2, and they refuse to fully divulge their explanation for the collapse of 7, and since the anomalies of symmetry and speed of descent, plus the existence of molten steel on the site, as well as the well documented occurrence of a high temperature erosion to the steel all fit the demolition hypothesis, it is only reasonable to consider that as a strong possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know Popular Mechanics were responsible for spreading the idea of a pancake collapse? The idea totally ignored the vertical, steel beams that would have had to telescope in on themselves to enable such a collapse, and was easily refuted, but it satisfied the vast majority who still believe it to this day. Overlooking such a huge part of the collapse mechanics was either monstrously incompetent, or deliberate. The editor of their magazine had the surname Chertof, the same surname as the newly appointed head of the Department of Homeland Security. A reporter questioned him about this connection and he denied knowledge of the man. His mother when asked confirmed them to be cousins. My point is the opinions and word of that organization are highly questionable.</p>

<p>I have read much that they have to say on the subject though. Mostly very reasonable arguments. On the subject of molten steel however, and please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, they say it was actually aluminum, which as I&#39;m sure you know, melts at a far lower temperature than steel. Here I have no choice but to go with the word of those who actually visited the site, like Leslie Robertson, the chief engineer in charge of building the twin towers. After his visit to the site he stated at a conference that &quot;As of 21 days after the attack, the fires were still burning and molten steel was still running.&quot; This is only one of a number of such accounts made by professionals who visited the site. The FEMA report also describes &#39;intergranular melting of steel&#39;. Who am I to say that they are all wrong and that Popular Mechanics are right? I lost my faith in Popular Mechanics long ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a conversation, not a basketball game</p>

<p>I definitely do not have an education in a STEM field. And thus far, we have only your word that you possess such an education</p>

<p>I’ve been around, seen a thing or 3. I recognize an internet bully when I see one. It is easy to call people dogs via the Internet. Where I’m from, it’s called sellin’ Wolf Tickets. In prison, a guy sellin’ Wolf Tickets is talking mad shit from the other side of the bars. When the doors break for yard, Mr. Wolf stays in his cell.</p>

<p>You may be more educated than I am, but you sure as fuck ain’t been in more scraps than me. I am not a bad ass, I just happened to have been born into institutions, and lived a good portion of my life in them. 200 fights, maybe more, got my ass beat in more than half of them. What I learned is that there are talkers, and there are doers.</p>

<p>That is my back story, in a nutshell. And yours is STEM educated sports ball fan.</p>

<p>I’m sure neither of us are more than the sum of those parts</p>

<p>I’m also sure that you’re the Ticketmaster of Wolf Tickets. A real big talker. If you spoke to me in this manner irl, it wouldn’t matter whatsoever the outcome. I’d sock you right in your dicksuckers. Just saying...bro</p>

<p>By the way, I would be curious to know your opinion regarding the current STEM vs STEAM controversy in education.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>but what of the other quotes listed in this site you referenced?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These sites often use a tactic called quote mining.<br/>
&quot;Quote mining (also contextomy) is the fallacious tactic of taking quotes out of context in order to make them seemingly agree with the quote miner&#39;s viewpoint or to make the comments of an opponent seem more extreme or hold positions they don&#39;t in order to make their positions easier to refute or demonize.&quot;<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Quote_mining">(Source)</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the three examples you posted;<br/>
1) &quot;severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s discussed in the Worchester Polytechnic Institute research I linked to earlier.<br/>
Long story short; the metal was studied and found to have corroded at 
temperatures between 800 and 1000 degrees C.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>2) Thermal measurements taken by helicopter [..] more than 2,800ºF.
Where&#39;s the evidence of this claim?<br/>
The article they link to (on their own site) doesn&#39;t supply these measurements.<br/>
Plus there is lots of <em>actual</em> research contradicting these claims. (<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0429/thermal.r09.html">example</a>)  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>3) professor Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl<br/>
Read his <em>actual</em> research here: <a href="http://vm136.lib.berkeley.edu/ENGI/WTC/wtc_documents.html">World Trade Center Archives at UC Berkeley
</a><br/>
(To save you time: You won&#39;t find any conspiracy supporting evidence there)</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>To quote the man himeself:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All those who use my quote in this context of conspiracy
theories are absolutely wrong and are doing a dis-service to the truth,
the victims and their families and the humanity. No one should use that
specific quote &quot;molten metal&quot; out of context, to indicate that I have
seen molten metal and then use my good name and reputation as a
researcher to conclude that there was a conspiracy.</p>

<p>All I tell to those who use my name is: &quot;please stop using a phrase
&quot;molten steel&quot; from eight years of my work and statements to further
your absolutely misguided and baseless conspiracy theories and find
another subject for your discussion . You are hurting the victims&#39;
families immensely and if you have any humanity you would stop doing so
and will not use my name nor the out of context words from my work &quot; .
But will they listen?</p>

<p>Best wishes and hoping that these conspiracy theorists will stop using
my name in any context.  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>These &quot;9/11 truth&quot; sites have no interest in finding <em>the</em> truth, they are peddling BS to try to sell <em>their</em> truth. They don&#39;t care about established facts, laws of science or logic.<br/>
In reality this whole &#39;truther movement&#39; died some 10 years ago and they&#39;re mostly stuck regurgitating long refuted claims.<br/>
On the other hand <em>real</em> 9/11 based science has been used to reconsider applied building practices and is actually currently being used to make buildings safer.  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>How any educated person fails to see the <em>real</em> truth about 9/11 and gets lured into conspiracy fairy tale land is the true mystery to me.</p>
