    <div class="md"><p>Well I couldn’t disagree more. I am responsible for my own actions and no one else’s. I didn’t make the choice to perform their actions so by what logic or moral code should I be held accountable for them?</p>

<p>To be quite frank I think that’s one of the most detrimental and bigoted mindsets to have. To blame someone for something they had no part in based solely on their genetic make up. </p>

<p>I’m all for having empathy, but I refuse to make people accountable for others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I understand your logic when you say you are only accountable for your actions. This is true.</p>

<p>But if your living standard is at a certain level due to wealth and land acquired by either slave trade or the genocide of another group of people, how could you not feel guilty? </p>

<p>For example: if your grandpa stole a car and then gave it to your dad who then handed it down to you, would you feel guilty that you are driving a stolen car? Or would it not matter because you didn’t steal it yourself? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t feel guilty because I have done nothing wrong. It’s a pretty simple concept.</p>

<p>Also, you’re grossly over simplifying what happened in America. White people didn’t steal the wealth of blacks, they built a nation exploiting some Africans that they traded other Africans goods for. They were industrious and prosperous, but were ruthless and cruel to people they considered outside of their tribe. Obviously by today’s standards we would never condone what happened, but every great civilization is built on some level of savagery when you go far enough back. People were brutal for much of our history, that’s human nature and it seems to be shared by all races, not just whites. </p>

<p>My ancestors also ended slavery. They also shaped the free world.</p>

<p>My ancestors did a lot of shot good and bad. What benefit is it to anyone for me to live in the past that I had no part in?</p>

<p>Again, I can empathize with the situations of others, but it’s absurd to hold myself accountable if I didn’t cause those situations.</p>

<p>Also I don’t believe that people are simply the result of their circumstance. Given wealth at a young age it is possible to squander it, and being born poor doesn’t mean you can’t rise up. I think people use this type of thinking as an excuse for their own poor decisions or lack of ambition. Everyone has struggles, you aren’t going to get anywhere obsessing over them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your logic is very cold though. You’re saying you don’t feel guilty because you yourself did not commit the crime, but if you are benefiting from the crime, you are just as guilty unless you’re doing your best to make up for those injustices. </p>

<p>Also, your description of how America came to wealth is almost like you’re justifying what they did because it’s been done in the past by other civilizations. There is no right way to view slavery or genocide no matter how you try to rationalize it.</p>

<p>Lastly, you mentioned that we all have chances to make something of ourselves or destroy ourselves.  This is true. But would you rather be born rich with the option to squander it away or would you rather be born poor and have to work your life to achieve wealth? </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that whites have an advantage in America due to the fact that they benefited from slavery and genocide. This fact alone cannot be argued with. I’m not saying you personally have to feel guilty for it, but as a group of people, I don’t know how you couldn’t feel guilt. I know I could never sleep knowing my ancestors did those things and I’m benefiting from it. I’d want to do as much as I could to pay back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Logic is cold. That’s why it’s logic it does not rely on emotion.</p>

<p>You realize not all whites are rich right? You realize that poor whites exist? That they face the same struggles as a poor person of any skin color?</p>

<p>Your examples are just patently absurd. The idea that there is some monolithic white man is false. You should learn to look at people as individuals and not just whatever feelings you assign to their ancestors.</p>

<p>Should I hold a serial killer’s son accountable for his father? </p>

<p>The obsession with race is disgusting. Breaking people down into nothing more than their skin color and genes and assuming that somehow tells you anything about them or should dictate how they should feel is morally abhorrent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mind you, by engaging in this conversation, you are contributing to the obsession with race.</p>

<p>I’m not saying all white people are rich or trying to judge people by their race. I’m speaking about those who my statements apply to. </p>

<p>The problem with your serial killer example is that the child is not benefiting from his fathers killings.</p>

<p>Once again to reiterate; I’m stating that IF AND ONLY IF you are benefiting from the atrocities of your ancestors, you should hopefully feel guilt and want to do actions to make right by victims of these atrocities.</p>

<p>When you say logic is cold, thats true. But I’m not speaking of logic in general, I’m speaking of <em>your</em> logic which is actually just an opinion. Therefore I’m saying your opinion is cold. </p>

<p>In summary, you don’t have to feel anything about what your ancestors did. That’s on you. All I’m saying is if the whites who do benefit from those past monstrosities did more to make right, this country would be a lot less divided. </p>

<p>It doesn’t seem like that’s going to happen though because a lot of people share your “logic”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for one thing, true investment into the communities of these groups. Not just government assistance or welfare.</p>

<p>It really just comes down to money really. I’d love to see some wealthy whites put some money into good housing and schooling for these groups of people. If they had good education it would go a long way towards changing things.</p>

<p>I live in NYC. If you take a walk into some of the richer neighborhoods which are predominantly white, the homes are beautiful, the schools (public schools) are amazing and have some of the best teachers education can offer. </p>

<p>Walk through a black neighborhood and everyone is strung out on drugs, the buildings are beat down and destroyed and the schools suck.</p>

<p>Why? No money. No money = low quality education which = no jobs which = poverty and a continuous cycle of misery.</p>

<p>To make things short, I think money would make it right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think that Jews should also pay money for this seeing that they owned slaves in America? Or does the genocide of their people offset their crimes? Also, let&#39;s not forget that there were black slave owners as well. Do we track family names down and hold them accountable?  Hundreds of thousands of white men died to free slaves and have it abolished during the civil war, do their families have to pay?</p>

<p>The point is, chucking money at a specific race for crimes that they didn&#39;t commit isn&#39;t practical and it&#39;s simply not going to happen. Everyone living in America today benefits from the blood of all races of different people that built this country. I won&#39;t feel guilty for something that someone else in my race did, my family never owned slaves. Having a victim complex, no matter what color your skin is (whites have it now too!!) is counterproductive and not going to improve your quality of life. At some point we need to accept the past happened and move on as a whole or everyone is fucked. I hope we move on soon because it&#39;s not looking that great for humans right now.</p>

<p>Literally every human being is benefiting from the actions Homo Sapiens committed to become the predominant hominid race. Should I feel guilty my ancestors more than likely fought and killed other hominids which allowed my race to prosper?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) No I’m not adding to the obsession with race considering I am speaking directly against the idea. That would be like accusing a vegetarian of causing more animal suffering for eating vegetables. It makes no sense.</p>

<p>2) How in the world could you ever possibly get an accurate assessment of exactly what benefits were derived from what thing your ancestors did. Just because an ancestor may have owned a plantation doesn’t mean that’s the only thing that made them successful. Maybe they were particularly good at investing, or took the money they made and used it to found some other venture. If a new pursuit was successful based on the merits of the enterprise itself is that still tainted? </p>

<p>What about the Africans? Shouldn’t they feel bad that they benefited from selling competing tribes into slavery?</p>

<p>What about the defendants of the Roman Empire or Vikings? Or Atilla the Hun? How far back do we go? How do we rank privilege points?</p>

<p>It’s a fool’s errand and I still have yet to see any reasoning for how it isn’t morally abhorrent.</p>

<p>3) Using logic to mean an opinion is stupid. They are practically antonyms. </p>

<p>Everyone has benefitted from something their ancestors did. By virtue of being alive they are benefitting from their ancestors and we know from history that no culture has always behaved in a way that would be consistently moral by today’s standards. It makes no sense to arbitrarily say that specifically this sin that white ancestors in America committed is somehow the one that needs to be atoned for.</p>

<p>Maybe the reason people share my “logic” is because it’s actually logical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what &quot;actions&quot; should I want or try to do for these &quot;victims&quot;? Who are these victims? Who decides who is victim, and who is aggressor? I think I understand where you&#39;re coming from, but when you look at history from an emotional standpoint you fall into the trap of timelessness. What wrongs must be paid back now? How far back do we go? Do we base the severity of the the wrongdoing on time elapsed, or number of victims, assuming we can count them? While I&#39;m not supposed to be racist should I just treat every minority person I come across differently because they&#39;re family might have been abused at one point? Even though mine immigrated here after pretty much every example I&#39;ve seen used. Should I walk around giving away the hard earned money and possessions I&#39;ve managed to aquire in my twenty-eight  years of life? Which isn&#39;t much, but getting better. Should I apologise to people who aren&#39;t like me, because it seems as though that&#39;s how you want me to see them, for being a white man? Even though who I was born to, where I was born, just like my ethnicity, was completely out of my control? I understand what you&#39;re saying. But we as humans have got acknowledge the sins of our fathers. Learn from our dark sordid history, and work together, all of us to create a better, and brighter future for all. Trying to figure out who is to blame for the past, or the most to blame for the past does not move us forward. It only keeps us rooted in various forms of self-pity, shame, and hate. This type of mindset is slowing down the advancement of the human race. And if it continues to grow, and spread, it will lead to more great atrocities, and untold suffering...</p>

<p>No they didn’t. They enslaved many parts of the world that had no slave system previously. Democracy is also not a white invention. There were equivalent systems to it that arose organically all around the world from Ancient India to MesoAmerica. Nothing “free” about what Colonialism did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Yes whites did end slavery in America, which is the point I was referring to.</p>

<p>2) I never said they “invented democracy”. Shaping the free world refers to the principles of freedom and equality that were built into our constitution that allowed a fairly young nation to grow and prosper and served as an example for eventual changes world wide later. </p>

<p>3) Again literally every single culture has raised another, enslaved another, or harmed another at some point. Why should we arbitrarily say that this particular time whites in America did it they should have to atone for it? Why should the Africans that enslaves competing tribes get a pass?</p>

<p>You could throw darts at a wall to decide which culture is the most evil and you would be just as accurate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) The slaves in America were bought as slaves. They didn’t invent slavery just because it looked different than previous incarnations. If I make up my own recipe for a pie, did I invent pie? I mean my recipe is unlike anything anyone else has had..... but it’s still pie which has existed for ages.</p>

<p>And yeah they did. Remember how slavery ended a while ago? How we no longer have slaves? That was the part where we ended it. Fun fact: the people that ended it were white! Blacks had no legislative power so it took white citizens to realize and understand why this was a corrupt system and take the necessary steps (including fighting a war) to finally end it. So yeah. Whites did end slavery. </p>

<p>Now see here is where it gets complicated because you might say, well some whites fought to keep slavery like in the South. That’s true! It’s almost as if we shouldn’t group in such a large number of people under one label....</p>

<p>It might just be wrong to claim that any particular person should feel or act a certain way based on their skin color...</p>

<p>But if you insist on being racist you have to give said race the benefits of their ancestors, not just their sins.</p>

<p>3) I’m an intellectually honest person and I think my statements speak for themselves. I’m not going to degrade myself with shit-flinging here. If you want to keep up the petty insults and assumptions about my character go right on ahead, but it says a whole lot more about you than it does me.</p>

<li>Yeah they were captured and enslaved due to the supply and demand transatlantic slave indistrial complex that Europeans started there, which eventually destroyed the African kingdoms participating and brought them as well into slavery. You seriously think Europeans back then had zero blame despite creating the very system? Laughable. </li>
</ol>

<p>And again, no whites didn’t end slavery. They created it in many areas that had no system of race based permanent bondage. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I’ve said nothing racist I’m just telling the facts, while you’re making up lies to claim white accomplishment. If you’re not aware Africans flight in the civil war too. What your Statment should be is that some whites fought to end the white slavery system. That would be more accurate. But they certenly weren’t fighting to end it in many of the other colonies they had around the world where the natives fought and won independence from slavery. Again debunking your claim of whites ending slavery. And ending a system you started is not accomplishment, since you want to play identity politics.  </p></li>
<li><p>Not an argument. Your own Supreme ignorance of any and all History showcase your claim. You didn’t even deny using Alt-Right talking points, meaning you are admittedly a white identity politics user who hasn’t studied history. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Who said anything about them not having blame? I described what happened, and at various points have already conceded it was morally wrong. And yeah they did. See above. Unless you are arguing that there is still slavery in the United States? Because I already clarified that is what I&#39;m referring to since the discussion i was having with OP was specifically centered in an American context.</p>

<p>2) If you think we should judge anyone based on the skin color that&#39;s racist. If you are advocating for white guilt or any form of it that is a racist mindset.   </p>

<p>I am aware Blacks also fought in the Civil War, not really a factor in whether or not slavery ended though. If you remove whites from that equation slavery does not end. It was clearly a white led effort, and had to be due to the way the government was structured at the time. It was white led war efforts, it was legislated by whites, and enforced by whites. So... say it with me &quot;Whites ended slavery&quot;</p>

<p>Interesting you think ending slavery wasn&#39;t an accomplishment. So I guess we should have kept the system going then? I think it was a major step forward personally, but then again I have strong morals. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re trying to make some irelevant argument about whether or not they should get brownie points I don&#39;t care. No one should get brownie points for anything their ancestors did. Neither should they get black marks on their record. I think the whole idea is preposterous. But if you&#39;re going to make an argument that we are responsible for the crimes of our ancestors then to be intellectually consistent you have to believe that we should also get praise for what they did. </p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m just going to live my fucking life because that&#39;s the only life I&#39;m responsible for. If some idiot wants to tell me owe them something because of someone I never met and had no control over I have absolutely no problem telling them to fuck off. </p>

<p>3)It wasn&#39;t an argument, interesting you thought it was, seeing as there is no argument provided. It was an explanation of why I&#39;m not going to waste my time refuting childish insults that have no relevance. I didn&#39;t deny they were alt-right talking points because I don&#39;t need to. They obviously aren&#39;t, and I&#39;m not bothered if you think so. Others will have no trouble seeing right through the absurd claims you&#39;ve made. </p>

<p>Umm I never said Slavery still is in the US, however it still officially is. If you look up the numbers the US has thousands of slaves. Not that I know how they come up with those figures. </p>

<li><p>No, you are claiming credit for some group based on skin. And if you remove them from the equation yes Slavery does end because race based permanent sevatude would never would have existed here. Africans wouldn’t even be here.  Say it with me: Whites didn’t end Slavery. Whites started Slavery in more places that didn’t have slavery. However some whites fought against white slavery at one point in time. That’s called a civil war. So no. ‘whites’ did not end slavery. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>1) No I claimed it wasn&#39;t the fault of their descendants. But I also think the entire idea of fault is kinda of ridiculous considering again where do you draw the line? It&#39;s all arbitrary at this point. You&#39;re picking and choosing which parts of history you want to emphasize, every culture has &quot;blame&quot; in that sense. Every culture has done things morally reprehensible by today&#39;s standards. I&#39;m only concerned with cultures that continue to perpetuate those sins. Not ones who have grown and moved past it. </p>

<p>And are you being serious with the slavery? No it&#39;s not still going. Again we are specifically referring to the african slave trade, that has been the point of reference this entire conversation when we&#39;ve mentioned slavery. That is over. If you don&#39;t concede that point then there is no point talking to you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible there are sex slaves or indentured servants brought over from immigrants who had a similar system set up in their country, but that is not relevant at all to the African slave trade and it&#39;s also fucking illegal. Are we going to blame whites now for things that are illegal by the standards of their country? </p>

<p>2) No I&#39;m not, did you just skip my previous paragraph here? Here I&#39;ll make it easier to spot:</p>

<p>I THINK THAT NO ONE SHOULD RECEIVE EITHER PRAISE OR REPRIMAND FOR THE DEEDS OF THEIR ANCESTORS. I THINK IT IS MORALLY REPUGNANT TO HOLD SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACTIONS THEY HAD NO CONTROL OVER.</p>

<p>Is that clear enough for you bud? The entire tangent about the good things ancestors have done was to show that it doesn&#39;t make sense to hold people accountable for the sins of the father because by the same logic you would have to praise them for the positive deeds of their ancestors. It was to show how such a system is arbitrary and self-defeating at no point did I say it was a system we should follow. </p>

<p>Also again, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SLAVERY IN AMERICA. If some other culture somewhere else decided to start a system of slavery they are responsible for that. I don&#39;t care where they got the idea, they are responsible for their own choices. America ended the slavery it started here in America. America is not responsible for other countries. </p>

<p>3) I&#39;m not alt-right, I&#39;m not ignorant of history, and I have refuted you&#39;re points repeatedly now. You keep trying to change context and dodge the points but the fact remains that there is no moral or logical grounds for blaming a child for what their ancestors did. </p>

<p>We&#39;re done here. I&#39;m tired of repeating myself and for any third party I think my points speak very clearly on their own. I&#39;m not going to waste time proving myself to you, because frankly I don&#39;t care what you think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me just address a personal anecdote for you today.</p>

<p>I am taking a Native American and diseases class at university. We are learning about how the natives died and how our evidence is limited and what we do have is likely skewed. </p>

<p>It’s a discussion class. So we were talking yesterday and I accidentally referred to historical Americans as “we.” I knew as soon as it came out of my mouth I would probably be critiqued for it. </p>

<p>My professor with Cherokee heritage went on a 7 minute spiel on how historians and historical writers need to refer to the past as a foreign country.</p>

<p>He emphasized that investigating these things are a matter of accountability SURE, but us personally, should not feel guilt. We had NOTHING TO DO with what happened in the past. </p>

<p>So should you as a modern human feel guilty over what other people did that we have no direct link to at this moment in history? No. We should not.</p>

<p>So no one should feel guilty over what was done in the past. There’s a thing called context. Just because something isn’t right doesn’t mean there isn’t a reason it was done. It’s unfortunate but that’s how life is. </p>

<p>Not a goalpost shift, I never said you claimed he was alt-right specifically. My point was that it&#39;s fallacious to claim his points are alt-right since he has not stated he&#39;s alt-right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They owe just as much as you, I or anyone else owes.  I can&#39;t agree with this at all.  People don&#39;t have a choice which family they are born into.  They aren&#39;t guilty for atrocities they didn&#39;t commit nor are the obligated to give out reparations.  There are many factors that go into the wealth of a family. It&#39;s would be a vast oversimplification to say your great great grandpa had a couple slaves and now all the money you inherited is now owed to people who may or may not deserve it based on something that didn&#39;t even happen to them.  Of course if one is aware of atrocities their parents committed they may feel the need to make up for those atrocities, though admirable I would not say it is NOT their DUTY to do so.</p>

<p>I think if someone thinks someone else is treated unfairly they should do what they can to help those people or make things right.  It&#39;s easy to pretend you want to help but with someone else&#39;s money or time.  Holding someone accountable for something their ancestors did any time in history is just flat out ridiculous if you think about it.  It would ultimately boil down to everyone that lives a privileged life should give it up to someone who doesn&#39;t.  But then you also have to realize that people less privileged have ancestors that have also committed atrocities.  According to your theory, how can they pay for the damages if they don&#39;t have any money? How is it that only people living comfortably are held responsible for their ancestors actions yet people living in poverty aren&#39;t?  How does that make sense morally?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to add this as a rebuttal. You realize that if you go back far enough one of you ancestors raped someone for you to be here. Rape and murder was the norm back when we were in the caves. By your logic, you should feel guilty just for existing. Does that not matter because it was so long ago and if you say that then at what point do you think we aren&#39;t responsible for our ancestor&#39;s actions. 3 generations.. 4. When does it end?</p>

<p>A much looser argument I can make is that fact that we are all technically related. Some people are wealthy because of their cousin&#39;s wealth. So if you want to make that case then we should feel responsible for all of humanity&#39;s actions collectively and not just our immediate relatives. Which again sends you down the rabbit hole of feeling guilty just for existing. So no we should not feel any responsibility for what our ancestor&#39;s have done because we had no say so in the matter.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that you should be guilty if any of your ancestors committed a crime. I’m saying that IF you are presently benefiting off of wealth that was acquired off of the backs of slaves or genocide, you owe it (IMO) to the decedents of those people to pay back in some way.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean you need to walk around apologizing or losing sleep. It just means giving back to their communities and creating opportunities for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In reality everyone is benefiting from stolen land. The land inherently belongs to no one. No one has the right to claim land therefore land can not be stolen. We are animals. Just because we can intellectualize laws and rights, they don&#39;t mean anything in the grand scheme. There are many rulers who we look at and literally call &quot;(insert name) The Great&quot; because they were so good at plundering and conquering land that didn&#39;t &quot;belong&quot; to them.</p>

<p>I think you are headed in the right direction with your argument but you just have a parochial outlook. You are focusing on one aspect when you should be looking at the big picture. We all should be giving back to each other and helping all of our brothers and sisters who are disadvantaged, not just one particular group whose ancestors were the most recent victims of human nature&#39;s proclivity to acquire power through any means.

<p>&quot;Joel Stein - I have never been so upset by a poll in my life. Only 22% of Americans now believe &quot;the movie and television industries are pretty much run by Jews,&quot; down from nearly 50% in 1964. The Anti-Defamation League, which released the poll results last month, sees in these numbers a victory against stereotyping. <strong>Actually, it just shows how dumb America has gotten. Jews totally run Hollywood.&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. They are the FAKE JEWS whose King converted to Judaism around 700-800AD for political reason. </p>

<p>They&#39;re basically Eurasians/Caucasian. Or &quot;Northern Turks&quot; (north of Caucasus mountains/Eastern European/Western Russian) that are simply known as Khazars back then. Their kingdom was wiped out by Genghis Khan.</p>

<p>They are not the Biblical Jews of Judah/Judea/etc. One thing for sure they will never admit they are Fake Jews (just like Trump will never admit he is a Shithole Racist). </p>

<p>These &quot;Jews&quot; also ditched their family names and adopt local names like -Steins, -Bergs, Gold- ... FYI, &quot;Rothchild&quot; is German for &quot;Red Shield&quot; - You probably can guess why did they do that - Not trying to assimilate, or there won&#39;t be so much resentment that eventually lead to event like Holocaust.</p>

<p>BTW, they said Hitler is financed by the elite fake Jews. And they are the ones who invented Hasidism that spot the kind hat/black suit that is basically European fashion. We know Alladin doesn&#39;t dress like that.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you even doubt it ... that&#39;s AntiSemitic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the difference is that the jews have spent the last 50 years constantly trying to relive it and keep the fear of it happening again alive as a glue to hold them all together in their tribalism.</p>

<p>they use that fear to scare their kids into zionism, seriously do a little bit of research on how the whole birthright trip is structured and how they brainwash the shit out of those poor kids.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve lost two friends to that trip, they leave being normal western jewish kids, and come back fear mongering zionists who think their actions are justified because other people have done it to their people since the beginning of time. they end up thinking they have  a free pass to return the favour to the descendants of their old enemies.</p>

<p>For others such as Native Americans it does not actually qualify as a genocide. Yes there were a massive amount of deaths, but they were primarily through the natural spread of disease.

    <div class="md"><p>My progressive school system was nothing but a skipping record of how evil white America is (and how we are alone in all our crimes for the totality of history)  I honestly don&#39;t know anyone that got that &quot;bleeding with patriotism&quot; schooling everyone on the internet refers to...we practically skip all of ww2 (unless there is a strong preface that Hitler was a Christian conservative) and we got right into Vietnam. </p>

<p>I can honestly say there wasn&#39;t a moment free of white guilt in all the history ed I&#39;ve had in public school....it was dead natives, whales, slavery, whales again, saw Roots twice, segregation, Vietnam, etc. We got to see an actual holocaust unit, but we had to come after school was over.</p>

My junior year we had an entire 3 weeks we learned about everything surrounding WW2, and at least several days on it in every other year.

<p>Even if they didn&#39;t teach you something, it&#39;s not like they are hiding it. The information is waiting for you to read it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While, with the Native Americans they weren&#39;t a homogeneous group and had internal wars for long before Europeans arrive. It is a long messy mix of integration, alliances, wars between tribes, wars with Europeans, ect. Additionally, plagues right before Europeans arrived, and right after, did a lot of the work. Which is why the focus is often on specific events like the trail of tears, which even have a lot of caveats associated with them. </p>

<p>The same is similar for a lot of Africans and Arab genocide events, with the exception of some, like the Armenian genocide. Hell, even Rwanda is barely mentioned in any detail, I don&#39;t think most people would be aware of it if it wasn&#39;t for the movie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may be the unpopular comment here but I think there are a couple of reasons. </p>

<p>First I think that WW2 was fairly recent (as compared to the trail of tears etc) and that the media has evolved by this time so it was highly publicized, and even moreso, politicized. </p>

<p>Second, and I might be wrong here. I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re loving in the West. If I&#39;m incorrect, please correct me. But the sad truth is that there is A LOT of strife, genocide, etc, going on in 3rd world countries that Western media either just doesn&#39;t report on (because they&#39;re pushing a different narrative) or sadly, gets reported on but westerners just don&#39;t care because it&#39;s so far removed from their day-to-day routine. </p>

<p>Keep in mind I&#39;m no political genius or anything, I could be completely wrong. But that&#39;s my take as an average, middle income white American. And not to get preachy but I think it blows because ALL of these atrocities deserve the entire world&#39;s attention or even potentially, intervention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. It seems like some of them don&#39;t like identifying as white though. Maybe it&#39;s a get out jail card so they can&#39;t be made to feel guilty for this white privilege cancer, even though zionists are the ones pushing the political correctness/multiculturalism agenda.</p>

<p>Look at the H&amp;M scandal recently over that hoodie, the owner of H&amp;M is pro Israel. Europeans were protesting years ago to try and stop them opening up stores in Israel and they still did it. <a href="https://electronicintifada.net/content/swedish-fashion-chain-hm-under-pressure/8759">https://electronicintifada.net/content/swedish-fashion-chain-hm-under-pressure/8759</a></p>

<p>There was also this incident recently in , St. Kilda, Australia. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1jOTvweXUw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1jOTvweXUw</a> 
The Premier of Victoria is a Zionist. 
<a href="http://www.jccv.org.au/news/1223/59/Zionist-Council-of-Victoria-and-the-Jewish-Community-Council-of-Victoria-s-Annual-Israel-Independence-Day-Cocktail-Reception.html">http://www.jccv.org.au/news/1223/59/Zionist-Council-of-Victoria-and-the-Jewish-Community-Council-of-Victoria-s-Annual-Israel-Independence-Day-Cocktail-Reception.html</a></p>

<p>This recent headline seemed a bit odd too. I don&#39;t have anything against Megan Markel, but the timing of it seems odd with all the SJW/progressive movements. 
<a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/the-diary/meet-misha-nonoo-the-jewish-matchmaker-who-brought-harry-and-meghan-together-1.449219">https://www.thejc.com/news/the-diary/meet-misha-nonoo-the-jewish-matchmaker-who-brought-harry-and-meghan-together-1.449219</a></p>

<p>It definitely seems like zionists could be trying to spark racial and ideological tension between us all, but we just need make sure we protect innocent Jews. We can&#39;t forget that they are against the corruption themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jewish people had the support of the US president, not FDR but Truman, and the British. The British had long spoken of helping the Jews, partly because they were a hassle/burden to deal with. In WW1 Britain was already planning an Israel via the Balfour Declaration. The Holocaust offered the best argument for a Jewish haven, and so that message was beaten down into everyone&#39;s heads. In all honesty, the Jews did face a lot of oppression and we&#39;re hated historically for the stupid fact that they were a different religion.
Now, the people of color were very weak at uniting. Not only did it hurt because they often lacked communication (native Americans) but many were uneducated and so could not create proper ways to handle a revolution (Africans). 
Furthermore, the main reason we don&#39;t discuss those genocides is because we profited off of them and it hurts the ideal image of America. We still use the land we took from the native Americans and white Americans have a 400 year head start of success compared to blacks. It&#39;s an awkward stain no one wants to discuss because it tarnishes our perception of the state. Basically, every genocide is horrible but it&#39;s only publicly spread if apart of a movement towards some goal and more successful with a world powers support.</p>

<p>I think this might be part of a bigger picture, ie in order to establish a Zionist state &quot;rightfully&quot;, having a &quot;victim&quot; card does help in that cause, to the extent that anyone who currently questions or speaks up against the country, people, religion or political actions might find themselves bordering on the line of antisemitism (which might be illegal in some countries). </p>

<p>That said, no offense meant, I&#39;m not against Jews people or Jewish religion or Israel as a independent state. Though some of the governmental policies and actions do seem set out to inflict conflict in the region. </p>

<p>Whilst there are many other genocides in history, none has gotten as much publicity (whether legal legislation or political movement or media in documentaries or movies).  No genocide should be more significant than another, each lives systematically taken regardless of color is still a human life lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I&#39;m late to the party here, but I want to clear a few things up.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The holocaust is more often mentioned because it was part of a world war that involved many countries. A world war that the US was a part of which is one of the reasons it&#39;s taught in the US. Also  Raphael Lemkin, inventor of the term genocide, was a Jew from Poland who escaped during the war and was at the Nuremberg Trials to try and get genocide recognized under UN law. A lot of push was with the &quot;action groups&quot; of WW2 that were just death squads made to murder as many Jews as possible behind enemy lines. </p></li>
<li><p>Many genocides happen under the guise of a civil war such as the Armenian genocide.</p></li>
<li><p>The reason Native American genocides aren&#39;t considered genocide by the UN is because the US is a permanent member of the security force and also doesn&#39;t recognize the authority of the International Criminal Court. If the US recognized these genocides and many others the US leaders at the time could be found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The US would also be required to pay restitution to the victims, which they don&#39;t want to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Many genocides aren&#39;t recognized by the US because of the political ties held with other countries. Again the Armenians are a clear example as we have a large air force base in Turkey which is highly strategic to carryout missions in the middle east.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you have any further questions I&#39;d be happy to answer them</p>

<p>I’m not even American or living in America and I read about how bad white people are every day.</p>

<p>You don’t see it because you’re looking for news that confirms your biases. Your internal filter doesn’t process the stuff that’ll show you’re wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you’re saying and of course down every family line there’s been wrong doing. </p>

<p>I’m not saying that you should be guilty if any of your ancestors committed a crime. I’m saying that IF you are presently benefiting off of wealth that was acquired off of the backs of slaves or genocide, you owe it (IMO) to the decedents of those people to pay back in some way.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean you need to walk around apologizing or losing sleep. It just means giving back to their communities and creating opportunities for them.</p>

<p>Once again, this only applies to those who are still benefiting from cotton fields, stolen land etc. not to poor whites or working class whites who only benefit socially and not economically. </p>
