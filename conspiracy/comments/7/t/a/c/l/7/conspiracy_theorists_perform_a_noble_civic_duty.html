        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Conspiracy theorists perform a noble civic duty for society. They guard against corruption by being a vessel for truth. I thank the agencies who decided to demonize the term, because although it took some time, we are now at the precipice of an age where true anti-corruption fervor will sweep the globe, thanks to the efforts of conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Today people are much more likely to believe a conspiracy theory than even 10 years ago. The reason is thanks to technology and other changes to society, which has led to a large increase in the number of conspiracy theories being proven right. Combine that with the well documented increasing mistrust of the media, and the academic intellectual meltdown, and you quickly get to a point where conspiracy theorists are the most trusted voice in town.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists should embrace the trust given to them by the people, but never forget the true purpose is to unearth truth and expose corruption for the good of the average person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. Conspiracy theorists certainly aren&#39;t in it for the money or fame! Do you agree that truth-seeking and anti-corruption are the two key tenets of Conspiracy Theorism? Or is justice a distinct third?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in order for &quot;corruption&quot; to exist, you need a set of rules or laws, which would be justice. They are not mutually exclusive, and you cannot have one without the other. Make sense, no?</p>

<p>division and tension.. in reality the conspiracy theorists want us to embrace their nutjob narratives of 19 arabs plotting in secret to sneak attack the US with hijacked planes... or the crazy unfounded theory of two brothers plotting to blow up a marathon.</p>
