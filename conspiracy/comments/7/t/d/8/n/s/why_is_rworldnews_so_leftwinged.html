<p>On a different note, what are your best sources of news on here? As you can guess, I&#39;d prefer ones without biased content.</p>

<p>I genuinely can&#39;t comprehend how someone who has any understanding of international politics can think that Shareblue, which people treat as synonymous with Hillary Clinton, is far left. It genuinely boggles my mind.</p>

<p>The Clinton&#39;s are notorious for taking the already-not-very-left American Left and bringing it to the center and further aligned with the right.</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks that Hillary Clinton, and thus Shareblue, is somehow far left obviously has no understanding of what words like left and right mean, especially outside of America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>slowly inched towards believing we should censor hate / offensive speech</p>

<p>calling literally everything that goes against their views racist, islamaphobic, etc</p>

<p>forcing trans ideology forcefully onto society and demanding that people simply accept that women have penises and will share a locker room with your kid and if you object you are a bigot </p>

<p>I&#39;m super pro choice but the left&#39;s talking points talking about a growing baby as clumps of cells is really counter productive</p>

<p>journalism is statistically proven to favor the left because mst journalists tend to be democrats.  There has been a total destruction of ethical reporting over the last 2 years.  It&#39;s really quite bad.  Super charged words in articles labeled as news that should be in the opinion section is basically the norm now.</p>

<p>The left&#39;s odd embrace of all things islam while still finding it perfectly acceptable to consistently mock christians (I am not religious but i find it a bit alarming)</p>

<p>liberals have a desire for forced diversity that i believe is bad for general progress.  I do not want women being promoted or put in power for being women.  I want the very best women to fight their way there to prevent terrible women from encouraging an idea that women are inferior in certain roles</p>

<p>liberals are encouraging racial division and normalizing hostility against white people, particularly white men.  This is harmful for obvious reasons butmostly I fear that it persuades people away from investing energy in self improvement and action to deal with their issues in life and towards focusing on a point of blame that absolves them of any responsibility for or agency in their lives</p>

<p>immigration - the left was not always so accepting of wide open borders.  liberals are inching towards putting the rights of illegal aliens ahead of citizens - that is not how a republic functions.  We can not properly prepare and plan a society if we do not know who is living in it using resources, spending money, committing crimes etc</p>

<p>Voter ID laws - it&#39;s insane to call this racist.  If black people can not obtain an ID they need to stop voting democrat bc that shit is fucked up.  Similarly, I&#39;m annoyed by the idea that it is the duty of the state to make it as easy as possible to vote.  In order for a republic to thrive and the rights of citizens to exist, the participants must take their responsibilities seriously.  Using cash lotteries and seeking people out to vote seems counter intuitive to me.  People who have no interest in participating in government are likely to be ignorant voters easily swayed by the people making it easy to vote.  I do not see that as a good thing.  People who vote because they understand the role their decisions has on the republic today and in the future, in my opinion, will vote in a way that is beneficial for all.</p>

<p>Trump - the left has become delusional with this guy, it&#39;s like the whole party has become the Tea Party of the left and it&#39;s a bit blinding and causing people to become (or at least sound) really fucking stupid.</p>

<p>FISA abuses - I&#39;m anti Fthe FISC as a general rule.  However, in my younger days, I was firmly planted on the left in large part because the party seemed adamantly opposed to the Bush admins overuse and abuse of surveillance on citizens.  Obama really disappointed me by his expansion of and abuse of things I already saw as violations.  I find myself ideologically aligned with Rand Paul pretty closely on this issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never, when did I claim that they did.  I also didn&#39;t claim that trans people were forcing anything, I am referring to &quot;the left&quot; in general.</p>

<p>I am mainly concerned with the increasing desire to suppress dissenting opinions and a desire to criminalize speech.  It&#39;s fairly fundamental part of liberalism to champion freedom of speech. It&#39;s mainly liberals that I see supporting the ideas that are essentially suppression of speech they find hurtful or offensive.</p>

<p>And the way you are phrasing that actually proves my point.  The whole adoption of using terms like existence and violence to describe people who have  an opinion on anything related to transgender people is extremely alarming.  I do not deny anyone&#39;s existence.  I resent the fact that discussion surrounding changing laws, regulations, and definitions and a desire to compel certain speech and criminalize others is increasingly censored.</p>

<p>I know you exist, I see you and I can touch you and have no issue calling a trans woman a woman.  I do certainly take issue when nasty trans women tell me to suck their dick but lots of cis women piss me straight off too.  What I can not tolerate is you equating someone&#39;s refusal to call a person a woman as denying their existence.  I&#39;m a cis female.  There is nothing that someone else can confirm or deny about me that calls my existence into question.  </p>

<p>Same with violence.  It&#39;s not used in a context that is intended to communicate a strong emotion like a violent reaction.  I often see it written as &quot;literal violence.&quot;</p>

<p>These are my issues and to be clear, as of yet, no trans person has broken into my home.  If one did, I&#39;d be happy to serve them a drink and see if they wanted to rewatch the marvelous mrs maisel with me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being from the nordic countries, my &quot;left and right&quot; aren&#39;t really your &quot;left and right&quot;.</p>

<p>We have something.. or well.. something talked about often called  a &quot;Opinion corridor&quot;. Its supposed to represent a long corridor with different rooms you can enter and talk about certain things. One door has &quot;immigration&quot; one has &quot;cultural identity&quot;. And the likes.</p>

<p>One thing that has happened is that most of these doors have been figuratively locked. Talking about Immigration is racist. Talking about your own cultural identity (aka &#39;muh white people&#39;) is racist, maybe even fascist. Talking about #MeToo out of the aspect of males that doesn&#39;t contain the phrase &quot;Im sorry for being male&quot;.</p>

<p>The thing about &quot;the left&quot;. Is the systematic shutdown of free speech. I was like that when i was 13-14. Thought punching people who thought &quot;wrong&quot;  was ok. But as i grew up, i grew fond of the saying &quot;I might not agree with what you say. But i will fight to the death to support your right to say it&quot;. And it constantly rings true for me.</p>

<p>I want, as a liberal person, you might even call me a socialist. To be able to talk about anything and everything. And not feel ashamed or accused of &quot;wrong think&quot; because the topic is sensitive or it &quot;hurts feelings&quot;. Hell, i&#39;ve got loads of baggage i <em>feel</em> i cant talk about, because the subject matter is simply &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>I feel, that we&#39;ve moved away from &quot;everyone is equal, no one is better than anyone&quot;, completely. And it damn sucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And? Who gives a shit? Seriously, you may be too dull to see it but &quot;politics&quot; in Reddit is just a bunch of monkeys (the right and the left) talking about something that is way above them. Seriously, do you think that you have any power? Do you think that world leader give a shit about what you think? No, so you and your opinions can just fuck off. Go ahead, be an SJW or a fascist for all I care, you&#39;re just building your sense of grandeur even though no one gives a shit about what you have to say. &quot;The rest of the world doesn&#39;t agree with you&quot; Great, it really affects my life if some libtard in her mom&#39;s basement </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, consider that the tech sphere as a whole has tended to be fairly Left-leaning. Just going off of general trends. Throw in a bit of pack mentality and confirmation bias, and since a lot of people&#39;s exposure to the internet started with Leftist values, they tend to keep those values, and then in turn pas them on to others. Now look at the number of Left-leaning news outlets compared to Right-leaning ones. So you have people with an overall trend toward a Leftist perspective, getting information from predominantly Left-leaning sources, on a subject matter where people tend to draw strong battle lines and compartmentalise.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s your answer.</p>

<p>There is no source for news that isn&#39;t biased.  Only thing you can do is read a news story and verify it the best you can.  Unless Trump Russia is in the headline, you can safely ignore that.  I&#39;ve clicked on 10,000 of those articles and have yet to see a shred of evidence, it&#39;s like buzzfeed clickbait at this point.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t trust a single news story, ever, until you can absolutely verify it&#39;s authenticity.  We have been lied to way too many times to trust the MSM, no matter if they lean left or right, they all lie too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Social media in general is run by left wing progressives that follow groupthink. Companies like Google and Twitter discriminate against conservative employees, and they alert their staff when right wing people are visiting their premises. I&#39;m a centrist so I&#39;m not shilling for either side, but the groupthink and discriminating people based on political affiliation is some 1984 shit. It&#39;s only going to going to get worse now people are self censoring themselves because of political correctness. 4 of the major websites, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit are all left wing, which is fine because it&#39;s a free market and people don&#39;t have to use them. The problem is the blatant censorship of opposing views and opinions of people that use them who aren&#39;t left wing. The main issue I see on Reddit is abusive admins who have a bias. With Google/Youtube, Facebook and Twitter it&#39;s the echo chamber problem, people are just having their biases reaffirmed. All the sites should remove upvotes and allow for more anonymity for those that want it so we can cut down on the virtue signalling. We would get a more honest reflection of society too if people can speak their mind without fear of being labeled a bigot, racist, sexist etc. I don&#39;t want some cesspit social media with true racist views about things like skin colour, I just want to be able to discuss ideologies, but some seem to be off limits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an impartial, genuinely... I will get hate from everyone for being that way.</p>

<p>Reddits upvote/downvote system rewards one way of thinking more than multiple opinions or any kind of critical thought. I think the term circle jerk is really appropriate when describing some of the behaviour seen.</p>

<p>To expand on that, if you dont toe the line in reddit you get caked in either negative counter arguments that dont really go anywhere because most of the time its just someone vomiting up something they read earlier but didnt really think deeply about, or simply just get hated on.</p>

<p>I feel at one point this method struck at ideals that genuinely harmed or caused grief like homophobia or racism. But over this time has become quite polarised and in an ironical way has become what it wanted to get rid of.</p>

<p>It has not happend yet but slowly you can see how a right wing opinion is being shamed and pinned to extremes, without really seeing that there are more extreme leftists.</p>

<p>TLDR- The whole system is massively polarised and no one knows for certain what is true anymore because Critical Thinking was not taught on an international level, but why should reddit care... Its almost authoritarian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leftist ideology plays into the hand of the elite billionaire globalists who want a one-world government, which would mean complete totalitarianism and control.</p>

<p>Conservative ideology is very critical of a large Federal government and tends to lean towards nationalism; and these ideas threaten the plans of these elite embracers of a New World Order.  Conservative ideology also tends to support <em>traditional</em> family values, for instance that there are only two genders: male or female. This also threatens the globalists because there are already too many people on the planet. They want to reduce the population drastically. A convenient way to achieve this goal over a short span of a few centuries would be to break the traditional family structure so that less people are reproducing (this happens through a multitude of facets: feminism, homosexuality, a diminishing of he role of the mother in the family, and by keeping wages just low enough that both parents in a household have to work full-time to in order to barely scrape by). But I digress.</p>

<p>In short, yes. World Politics is <em>definitely</em> being censored. And it leans very, very hard left because leftist ideology happens to be the perfect farce to trick people into accepting a one world government. All I can say is these people don’t give a shit about us. They are out for themselves and they think they’re really fucking clever. We are on to them now, thanks to some very courageous heroes that have risked their lives and well-being so that we might be able to know the truth. </p>
