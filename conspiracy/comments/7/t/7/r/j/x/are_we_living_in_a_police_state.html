    <div class="md"><p>He also had a broken nose, bruises all over his body and boot prints on both wrists indicating he was forcefully held down while four of them were beating him. Luckily there’s witnesses and video.  The cops in the video were telling the woman to stop recording or they were going to take her phone from her so she took off running. Video was almost immediately taken off Facebook live. There was a big cover up and we had to get a second autopsy as well. It’s all fucked. </p>

<p>However, Reddit is a very, very public forum and perhaps much larger than you realize. You are putting your case at risk by discussing it outside the walls of confidentiality and without consent and advice from your lawyer. </p>

<p>Of course OP shouldn&#39;t be penalized! That is not at all what I am saying. However, their lawyer would one hundred percent absolutely not be pleased if they were made aware of this post and the release of potentially sensitive information that could aid the other side in winning. </p>

<p>It is true though, they are taught to aim for points in the legs to subdue targets. It looks fucking brutal as seen in the <a href="https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=244_1456969337">Rodney King tape</a></p>

<p>If they are filmed striking someone in the face with a fist or slap, it&#39;s against their code of conduct and they are usually removed from service.</p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re going to catch a beating, just expect a long drawn out one while they wap your torso and legs into a black jelly. Your smile will be fine though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes we live in a police state in America. Some parts of the country put excessive restrictions and control on police, whereas some don&#39;t put enough. Every local government handles policing differently. Overall, I would say when it comes to most big cities, we live in a police state. Rural areas can be just as bad, but I&#39;d say often are not. The excessive controls on police in some parts of the country are used as talking points for certain groups to advocate for easing up on controls on the police in other parts of the country. Unfortunately the issue is seen by many, as some blanket status of policing in America that applies to all Americans, when in reality every region is different. Policing is run by local government, you shouldn&#39;t expect it to be consistent throughout the country. In too many places, the relationship between the police and citizens is not only disproportionately in favor of the police in such a way that effectively nullifies the bill of rights-it is downright abusive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know they&#39;re rioting in Iran, right? Do you even understand what a police state is? It&#39;s when the police have excessive power over individual citizens. It&#39;s when the police become so militarized they resemble the army. It&#39;s when police can beat up and kill citizens without fear of consequence. It&#39;s when the state surveils<br/>
everything the average citizen does and compiles records of same that are kept forever. It&#39;s when there are random checkpoints where ordinary citizens are forced to show their ID. It&#39;s when the average citizen is afraid of the very people who are supposed to protect and serve <strong>them</strong>. We used to chastise the old Soviet Union for doing these things. And now? Well, it&#39;s so commonplace in our society people such as yourself don&#39;t even recognize it as the aberration that it actually is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read your other post, you need a lawyer ASAP and you need to see trauma therapist. I used to be a big pro police guy myself until one day I was parked in my car waiting for my takeout order in front of the restaurant. Two cops pull up on me and approach the vehicle, demand I get out then throw me against the car and illegally search it then arrest me for ibuprofen. They were mad because they thought I was doing drugs, then got proved wrong and took it out. In the car they threatened me and said they would say I tried to fight them if I don&#39;t shut up (i was complaining about the illegal search). Later the cops at the station were talking with each other and referencing some &#39;game&#39; they had where they tried to bring in as many people as possible and get a record. My experience is not nearly as bad as yours and I wish you the best, but fuck the cops, we aren&#39;t in a police state yet but they are clearly above the law. Its a serious problem</p>

<p>Absolutely.  And one so highly propagandized that; A) it doesn&#39;t even know it (statistically speaking) and B) because of A), it doesn&#39;t even need to be as much of police state that it is entirely capable of being. </p>

<p>To me civil forfeiture  is enough to prove where in a police state they can take your stuff without you being proven guilty of anything. They can shoot you or your family and get away with no consequences.</p>

<p>Sorry about your dad!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely not a police state.  Cops have to jump through so many hoops to get warrants.  Look how many people get away with crime after crime.  Cops are extremely restrained.  As for militarization I think that is a natural evolution because the firepower that is available to criminals.  It wouldn&#39;t make sense to have a police force that does not have the weapons and armor necessary to go up against the threats they might encounter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reality is that it is much worse than a police state. We live in a serfdom society. You are still a subject to the king, and his Court. Police brutality is out of control. Police are usually the most arrogant , stuck ups, but are so stupid. They know nothing.
Instead of learning and real trade, or skill. They settled the deal for their soul for a mere maybe $30,000 a year.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re using sarcasm you&#39;ll have to throw a /s in there or something.</p>

<p>It is true though, they are taught to aim for points in the legs to subdue targets. It looks fucking brutal as seen in the <a href="https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=244_1456969337">Rodney King tape</a></p>

<p>If they are filmed striking someone in the face with a fist or slap, it&#39;s against their code of conduct and they are usually removed from service.</p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re going to catch a beating, just expect a long drawn out one while they wap your torso and legs into a black jelly. Your smile will be fine though.</p>
