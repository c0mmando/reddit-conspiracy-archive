       The story of Apollo 13 is analogous to the Phoenix, it's the story of the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Think about it:
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       had to happen on Apollo 13 -- these people are Freemasons of the highest degree! 13 is the Phoenix and Apollo 13 is the same. The same as Osiris and Baal/Nimrod before him. NASA is riddled with the symbolism of the occult.

       Gus Grissom death,challanger explosion had a days notice the o-ring might be to cold to risk taking off.The crew of Soyuz 11 stuck out to mr they were killed after undocking from space station Salyut 1 after a three-week stay. A cabin vent valve "accidentally"opened at service module separation. The recovery team found the crew dead. Iirc they are the only 3 people to die in space. There was also an america astronaut on a space walk and a metalk rod punched throught his suit and he didn't die from the pressure difference or lack of oxygen but I'm not sure maybe your blood won't boil in the vacuum of space if you only get a small hole. There's a lot to look into gus Grissom and the Apollo 1 crew.

       You'd lose pressure pretty quickly even with a small hole. The suits are only pressurized to around 14 PSIG. Space would be in a sub 200 micron vacuum, which is very deep.

       Basic logic is the best evidence against all of NASA's lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       We haven't sent humans on the Moon for over 40 years now, and they're selling the idea of sending humans to Mars. Logically, you'd want to have bases on the Moon first. You know, baby steps. Not only that, but it would save enormous amounts of fuel if spacecrafts were launched from the lunar surface instead of the Earth's. Their decisions do not make any logical or financial sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       They send Astronauts out of the safety of the ISS and into the dangerous, life-threatening, void of space to fix issues with the ISS itself. Would you send scuba-divers outside the submarine to fix issues? No. Everything can be handled from within. That's how real engineers should've built the ISS. Not to mention all the loose wires on the inside. All of that should be neatly tied behind removable wall-pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Astronauts are supposed to be the best and brightest, selected from thousands of applicants. The best engineers, scientists, physicists, military, etc. Do they actually sound smart to you? What do they do up there, what experiments? Growing lettuce?

       I understand, and I'm faced with the same problems when trying to discuss these issues. The relentless brainwashing basically turned science into a religion that cannot be questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person changes from within. Nothing you can say will actively change their beliefs and ideas. That has to come from themselves after making research. My advice is to plant a seed in their minds simply by voicing your own beliefs. Don't argue over them, don't challenge theirs. State your own beliefs and let them research it on their own if they wish.

       I never really thought of those particular things, but damn that makes no sense when you think about it. Even our server rooms down here on earth have all the wires and stuff neatly tucked away. It's almost as if NASA is trying to hard to make it seem legit.

       Also, the repairs on the outside of the ISS don't make a lot of sense either.

       Atmosphere burns up all the little particulates that are traveling at a high speed in space and filters out radiation. The ISS is protected against these things but sometimes it's enough to damage something externally. Space is hazardous and expecting everything to be repaired from within makes me think y'all watched too much star trek

       But the infrastructure you would have to put on the Moon, where there literally is nothing to support you by way of natural resources, would cost insane amounts of money. Mars has an atmosphere is the reason we are trying for Mars.

       Many of us are still waiting on some actual real-clear-images of the base lunar module, moon rovers and flags etc that was left behind. Would even settle for an up close area wide view that can at least be studied and used for discussions. Let alone the images would make for some great classroom material/posters etc. With all these high powered telescopes and satellites we have accrued, it should be rather easy, no?
      </p>

       Or better yet launch a small camera probe from the ISS, it would save on fuel costs and in a few months the world could have some new material to work with. We all can then study in an open free society, by sharing informed ideas of how materials from earth actually deteriorate or behave over time on a moon environment in space.

       Devils advocate. For the record I think most of the space related shit we are told is lies to justify the money that supposedly goes to it. But anyway.

       In regards to setting up a base on the moon before colonizing Mars, keep in mind that Mars is an actual planet with an atmosphere, not just a chunk of space rock in orbit.

       If you were wearing a pressurized spacesuit would you jump around and repeatedly fall down onto razor sharp volcanic basalt whilst joking about it over the radio - because that's what they did.  Unbelievable.
