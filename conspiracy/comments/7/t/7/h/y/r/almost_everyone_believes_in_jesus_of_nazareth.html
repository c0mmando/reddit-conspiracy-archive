       Even most atheists and agnostics believe that historically there existed a man from Nazareth who claimed to be more than just an ordinary carpenter, whose choice of words and actions eventually led to his death by crucifixion at the hands of the Romans and Jewish authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       This information is believed by most scholars to be historically accurate, and it would be unintelligent to say that Jesus Christ was just some made up character who never actually existed. It's possible that some of the stories being shared about him never happened, but this doesn't change that this unique person did live on the Earth as a man, maybe he never walked on water, but he did love others with an unconditional love, he cared for the poor and broken and was willing to die for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The decision that humans now have to make is about the truthfulness of his claims and his message, and about the truthfulness of the testimonies of his loving actions. The question is not, do you believe that there existed a man who claimed to be the Son of God, the question is, do you believe his claims, do you believe in him, do you believe he was telling the truth, or do you choose to believe that he was nothing more than a Jewish carpenter with a wild imagination? Perhaps someone who lost his mind and started to believe he was more than just an ordinary human? But if you have faith that he is the Messiah, the Savior, the Son of God, then you can also have faith that his death was the doorway for God to deliver salvation to the World, and that we can share in the same resurrection as Christ if we put our faith in him and our trust in God. This is a great hope to have in this life, the hope of an eternal afterlife with a loving God and Savior.
      </p>
      <p>
       His life is the reason why we should believe, he lived a life full of love and grace, showed us what is possible for humans if they are united with God, full of his perfect love. His sacrifice on the cross is also why we should believe, because he willingly gave up his own life to save ours. He had many followers in those days who believed he was their Messiah, who were willing to fight to protect him, but he allowed himself to be arrested and crucified, because this was the greatest act of love mankind would ever witness, the sacrifice of the holy Son of God for the sins of mankind, the pathway opening up for humans to be born again as children of God.

       The Son of God offers us a path to salvation through him, through his holy blood, I don't know of any religious systems that provide humans with a path to reach a holy God. The New Covenant system of salvation by faith in the Son of God by being forgiven of sins through his sacrifice is revolutionary, there is nothing else like it in the world.

       Truth can sometimes sound arrogant. Arrogance would be saying, there are many paths out there to reach a holy God, but my path is the only right path. I am saying that there are no other paths out there, there are ways to find peace and become spiritual, but if God is holy, then the only way to be forgiven of our sins is through Christ, do you know of any other saviors who died for our sins?

       I don’t even know if it’s arrogance as much as it is just ignorance. Most of the major religions give a path to reach god. For them to say they don’t know of any would have to mean they literally don’t know basic information on any other religion beyond their own.

       I don't mean this to be rude at all... but what's the point of your post? It makes more of a statement than opening up a discussion. Are you advocating that Jesus is real simply because you claim most people believe in him (without providing any evidence of that, also)? Just want some clarification on the point of your post.

       The point is to say, here is the most important man in the history who has ever lived, the most followed man, and his actions were loving and caring, doesn't this give significance to his claims to be the Son of God, even if you don't believe the supernatural things, shouldn't everyone take a closer look at this man who actually existed simply because of his unique love and lifestyle full of selfless sacrifice?

       I get that. This just isn't really conspiracy related. It's just an opinion you've posted. Not saying it's a bad opinion or that I even disagree... but now that I have more of a picture of what you meant, just doesn't seem fleshed out for conspiracy sub cause it doesn't talk about any sort of conspiracy

       Josephus and Tacitus were not yet born when Jesus is alleged to have lived. At best, they wrote hearsay.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same book in which Tacitus mentions Jesus (which he refers to as superstition), he wrote about Hercules literally interacting with people. If this book is evidence that Jesus was real, is it not also evidence that Hercules and the Olympian pantheon are real?

       Tacitus lived from 56 – 120 AD and Josephus from 37 - 100 AD, both after the death of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tacitus didn't believe in Christ, he thought of him as just another god-like person that people worshiped similar to Hercules. His record of this belief is what is important, his record tells us that other people in the second century after the supposed time of Christ believed in him.

       The existence of believers does not prove their beliefs to be true. Again, if Tacitus is evidence for Jesus, why is his work not equally evidence for Hercules?

Tacitus text only references the title, 'the anointed one' which refers to many historical figures in the region and era. . .does it not?

       I'd edit and flesh it out more. Like, this would be a conspiracy if Jesus' existence was being swept under the rug. The only problem is, it's not, really. I've seen so many shows about the history of Jesus that mention those same docs. I even learned about it in school, too, that there are census docs and things with Jesus of Nazareth listed. But that's not a conspiracy because it's not hidden... it'd be more of a conspiracy if Jesus was censored from the world but he's not really, in my eyes. Pretty much anyone knows who Jesus is in a basic format, even if they just know he's a part of the Christian religion. I guess what I'm saying is, you need more info and research here to really convince us of anything. What's the conspiracy? Is it that there's the info but people don't believe in him? That to me isn't a conspiracy because it's people choosing to reject it. Not being kept in the dark and not allowed to know about it.

       The issue is that people do not know what they are rejecting. They are rejecting the mainstream version of Jesus that is being presented to them through the world, but very few people know about the pure version of the Son of God who went out of his way to love others.

       I mean that's exactly the story in the bible. The son of god went out of his way to love others who were rejected by his society. Is that not the story in the bible? It's the story in the one I had read. They are rejecting it because they just don't believe in the god part most likely. The Jesus part is cool. But I don't believe in god. I don't deny a possibility that someone like the Jesus could have been real. I totally believe that's possible. He was threatening already established religions and governments and that would have gotten him killed. But I don't believe that would have been done because god wanted it. It would've been because he was a good man. No god needed. If someone doesn't believe in god and believing in Jesus' existence also requires the belief in god, I mean, they aren't going to accept it because that's their view. That's not really a conspiracy. They have the story, it's public knowledge. Unless you're inferring the story isn't true which I guess you are with the miracles and stuff but you still are putting god into it and that's usually why people don't believe in Jesus because they already don't believe in god so why would they believe in him either?

       Eh... kinda. Believing there was a guy named Jesus is very different than believing he was specifically the one described in the Bible. I’m not even just referring to the supernatural elements.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reliability of the accounts in the Bible (specifically the lack of first hand accounts-most if not all of the stories are actually written down by people who never personally witnessed the events they are describing) mean that many people who believe in Jesus really wouldn’t go beyond the fact that he existed. They may or may not agree that he actually did any specific activity Christians believe he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think saying “most people believe in Jesus of Nazareth” is misleading at best,

       There is a difference between saying most people believe in Jesus of Nazareth, and most people believe in Jesus Christ the Son of God from Nazareth. We should all believe in the historical man, the decision that is left to make is if you believe that he was more an an ordinary man, he claimed to be the Messiah and the Son of God, but anyone can say those things. I believe his loving actions and words and miracles prove that he was telling the truth, but many people do not even believe that this man from Nazareth even existed, or his mother or his followers, but history tells us that was this unique man who lived almost 2000 years ago.

       That really depends on what you’re saying he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we simply asserting that a man named Jesus existed or are you claiming more than that? If you’re claiming that he performed any specific action you won’t have the same number of people agreeing with you.

       Now realize that maybe not everything that you have heard and read is true. Maybe some men have deceived you and told you some lies about God. I believe he is all-good and all-loving, just because you put some words between quotes that you took from a book that someone told you was holy doesn't mean that is actually what God said a long time ago. We need to seek God on our own spiritual journey to find the truth, if the path is clouded in darkness, then you're probably on the wrong path, redirect your ways towards love and light.

       The history of Jesus is so warped. I think he probably actually existed though. Out of respect for my friends around here that have beliefs, I won't go on a rant. But jesus didn't tell us anything new. And I do think his story was more or less modeled after contemporary stories of other similar gods.

       I think the most important thing about him was his lifestyle. He showed us that humans can live a life of selfless love and sacrifice in the service of others. I cannot think of anyone else like him, in history there have been other peaceful and loving people who devoted their life to serving others, but there's almost always something that comes up after their death where we find out they were stealing money or cheating on their wife or something crazy, but not about this man, he was the only one who is remembered for being good all the time.

       His life and teachings are important I will agree with that. His need to die for our sins is where I have an issue. God in my definition is all knowing, all powerful. God can do anything at any moment including forgiveness of all sins. The idea that his son would have to die for this to be accomplished makes no sense to me. Jesus life and teachings of unconditional love are what matter to me, not his death and resurrection.

       His death was necessary because God is holy and humans are not holy, only one, the Son of God. His death allows us to be forgiven of our sins and therefore be acceptable to God. It's not that God doesn't want to come near or touch sinful humans, it's that God is a consuming fire of light and unrighteous humans wouldn't survive his presence. The Son of God allows us to be born again, those who are born again are purified by the blood of Christ and can therefore be in the presence of a holy God. Sinless blood is required to forgive sin, if we are not forgiven of our sins we are not ready to meet God.

       The God I believe in could accomplish all that with a symbolic snap of the fingers. Jesus having to die makes no sense to me no matter how it is explained. With that said. Have I accepted Christ into my heart? Yes. Am I born again? Yes. Does he walk with me all the days of my life? Yes. Do I speak with him for guidance and wisdom? Yes. Would I give that up? Never. I have a personal relationship with the father the mother and the son. Could I have had that without the son? I am not certain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been personally saved by Jesus at least one time that I saw him. My head was complete smashed in and I called out for him to save me and there he was and he laid his hands on my head and my skull reshaped and he hugged me and he was gone. Whether it really happened or not, I experienced it vividly and I will never forget it.

       Wow, that's incredible.

       I think the reason you don't understand the sacrifice is because you are not understanding the importance of free will. Free will is required to freely love God in return for his love towards us, and that means that God would have to freely allow created beings to reject him and his love. All humans are born into the rejection of the first Adam, his sin corrupted the human nature, that's why we're all sinners even as little children. But Christ is the second Adam, he uncorrupted our nature by giving us a new one that can be received by faith in him. If humans didn't have a sin problem no righteous blood would be required, but God is holy and we are born sinful, so we need to fix that problem if we want to spend eternity with God, that is why Christ died for us, to fix that problem, to reconcile us and give us peace with God. We have the free gift of righteousness according to Romans 5 if we are spiritually reborn through the Son of God.

       You can try to live a life free from sin and seek God, but if you have to face the Lord on judgement day and your sins haven't been forgiven in this life, then you will have to answer for your own sins. When the Son of God died on the cross as a sinless human, he was able to take our sins upon himself, he was paying for sins, but not his own sins, so it was a sacrifice for our forgiveness, and he is also the rightful judge, so he allows us to be saved through faith in him. If he didn't die for our sins, there would be no salvation system through faith in him, people would still be trying to do it the Old Testament way through animal sacrifices.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Peter 2:22 "He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. 23 When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. 24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness."

       I also don't believe God would ask for a human sacrifice, and I don't believe he takes pleasure in animal sacrifices. I think people have created their own version of God, but then the Son of God came who is the perfect image of God his Father, and he showed us that God is actually very gracious, merciful, and full of love. We need to look to the Son of God to figure out what God is like, we shouldn't rely on old books that were copied and translated hundreds of times before they reached us, we were never promised a Bible in the Scriptures, it was put together by man in an effort to silence heretics who were creating their own canons and literally saying the God of the Old Testament is not the same as the God of the New Testament, Marcion of Sinope is probably why we have the 66 books we do today.

       In Mexico there's a whole bunch of blokes called Jesus; that doesn't prove god, nor eternal light, love, hope and salvation. Nor does it make the game of thrones books true.

       Your logic doesn't make much sense tbh, and can you please  try to format your text, because you come across as a little crazy... and if your Jesus was who you think he was, I don't think he'd be so happy having people ranting about him on the Internet in this way.

       There are still a lot of people named Jesus, none are or have been the son of God.  God does not have a plan, nor does he have a son.  The Bible is taken from various sources.  Furthermore, there is a very distinct difference between the god of the old testament and the god of the new testament.
      </p>
      <p>
       The god of the new testament, Jesus, is a composite character drawn from various sources.  He does not accomplish anything of merit in his fictional lifetime.  Really, there are many traditional stories of the sun as a person traveling around with the twelve constellations doing things.  When you are worshiping Jesus, you are worshiping the sun.  That is why his death coincides with the three day "death" of the sun every year in December (i.e. it dips in the sky and makes a cross).  When you are worshiping Jesus, you are also worshiping a symbol for the age of Pisces whose sign is a fish.  Most of the miracles he performs are with water, and he even mentions ushering in the next age - the age of water, or Aquarius.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I appreciate your sincerity, but you really should consider what you are proposing.  If Jesus is the son of God, that means that God seeks to redeem his creation.  Why?  Because it was stolen from him, and now he has a plan to get it back.  God has a plan, in time, and it requires people.  Not only does God's supposed plan require people, but it requires only people that come to a certain understanding.  Bullshit.  This is not the God of the universe.  The God of the universe does not make mistakes, have shit stolen, and would not be formulating plans in time.  Furthermore, the God of the universe would not demand constant praise or even sacrifice - for all things would be know, and owned.

       i don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no historical evidence for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       the earliest reference is an insertion into a section of josephus circa 75. the insertion has been questioned as an inauthentic redaction a very long time. the section of josephus, without the insertion, reads almost word for word as a copy of vindex's speech from 68 mocking nero, esp the whole "if man he be" part (nero had married a transvestite that looked like the spitting image of his dead wife, whom he was inconsolable over, and he had performed epics on stage that included birthing scences. you were allowed to be homosexual and bisexual in rome as long as you pretended you weren't. nero didn't. you were not allowed to perform on stage period. nero did. that was too greek).
      </p>
      <p>
       the next appearance isn't until circa 110 in tacitus, where tacitus is talking about the great fire in rome in 64 (the one nero has been mocked for fiddling during for 2000 years). in the paragraph, tacitus says that the "chrestianii" the followers of "chrestos" had been blamed for causing the fire, mostly because they hated the world and they were sordid and pernious followers of a superstion (tacitus's words not mine), and they were sentenced to be burned alive (the penalty for arson). fwiw chrestos just means the good, it was used a lot for all kinds of persons and gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       the link to jesus, who is not mentioned, is a bizarre insertion, unlike anything else in tacitus's anals where he stops to say chrestos was in the time of tiberius (i.e. circa 30) and was crucified by the proconsul pontius pilot. this is not mentioned in any account of tacitus until the 14th century. it has been questioned as inauthentic for a very long time, because it appeared to have been erased and written over. xray anaylis, shows that it originally said nero, not tiberious, pronconsul porticus festus, not pontius pilot.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is critical because tacitus was the only pre-2nd century mention of christianity and dated jesus's death to that of the gospels, the earliest of which has been assumed to have been written after the sack of jerusalem in 70 by a roman for romans, since at least the 4th century and augustine.
      </p>
      <p>
       tacitus could not have been talking about jesus or christianity, because he is talking about some guy crucified during nero's reign, 30 years after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       jesus christ literally means god's helper annointed by combining to widely divergent languages that conveniently produces the most important and famous initials in imperial rome: JC, julio-claudian, of which nero was the last.

       christianity and jesus redivivus was created to combat nero redivivus that began immediately after nero died. people believed that nero would come back and liberate them and establish an eternal kingdom. nero was beloved by the people. parthia almost went to war with rome for refusing to give up nero redivivus. the effort to destroy nero's memory began about 40 years after his death by the senatorial class (pliny, plutarch, tacitus). the senatorial class were the ones who had named nero "hostis," public enemy, open to being killed by anyone, and the condemned him to a slaves death--to be crucified and flogged until dead. they told him that he could go die like his beloved slaves.

       since the general the senate had conspired with, galba, was forced to commit suicide less than a few months later after being usurped by otho, who was forced to commit suicide less than a few months later after being usurped by vitellius, who was executed less than a year later when he was ursurped by vespasian, the masses of rome had none but the senate to direct their anger on, so the senate got to work on the greatest PR campaign of all time, along with the flavians--vespaian and his two sons, who needed to legitimize themselves.

       jesus, even as a human, never existed. christianity was never jewish. it was born heretical. there is no way a jewish rabi or holy man preached it. two things are non-negotiable in judaism: one, eternal, indivisable god, who can neither be born, nor die, nor never not exist; and strict adherence to mosaic law. christianty from mark on had at best a bifucated god and held mosaic law in contempt...just like all good romans did.

       i've been working on a book about nero and jesus and christianity. i've been researching since early ladt summer and am still not done. to learn how much about nero that directly and significantly contradicts his reputation has been known for 2000 years, has been quite shocking. the rebranding of nero may be the greatest propaganic feat of all time.

       Thanks for taking the time to post this. I doubt many people take the time to look into the reality of the historical "Jesus" and just accept the idea because it's so often repeated.
