    <div class="md"><p>What if the people being called crazy are actually being observed as crazy?</p>

<p>In other words: it&#39;s not an on lookers job to attmept to understand you better. It&#39;s your job to use language as it&#39;s intended, and that&#39;s to be understood.</p>

<p>If you cant formally and structurally, using language and its rules, promote an idea that others who are trained in that same language and rules to know, youre ot even using the same language. </p>

<p>What happens then, when people babble? Or, when they seem to appear to talk crazy?</p>

<p>They are rightly assumed as such. The available information allowed in context of message speaks volumes more than the content that could be fake -especially here, on conspiracy. </p>

<p>So, EVERY ARGUMENT should be formally produced, with clarity and charity. Only then, can you produce expressions back that are also charitable and clear.</p>

<p>After all, look at all the agreement, but otherwise nonintellectual emotivism that is expressed in response to your simple plea without evidence. </p>

<p>You even lack evidence of this &#39;calling you crazy&#39;, and you rely on that generalization the probability of it happening to you particularly, as a weight in argument. </p>

<p>IN other words, I have yet to be called crazy. </p>

<p>You seem to be called &#39;crazy&#39;.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not crazy, perhaps the reason is still your fault, in that you fail to offer anything in the way of evidence of not &#39;possibly being crazy&#39;.</p>

<p>Look at your message. IT&#39;s a plea to not be called crazy. </p>

<p>OK. But crazy people also say that. . . just show you have a comprehensive mind capable of communicating information. Simple as that. </p>

<p>Language, at it&#39;s best use, is a formal process of two people&#39;s minds converging in unified understanding on concepts and the models that are produced of them.</p>

<p>NEXT: if the information is totally counter to the reality most people perceive via the vast majority of information they build their life model after, then you will be perceived as crazy unless your FORM of expression shows you are being serious and have a reason to use other&#39;s time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You first,</p>

<p>Your attempt at assessing non-sequitur variables to a logical-proof in argument, I presented, is called &#39;rhetoric&#39;. </p>

<p>So, if you want such information, you must make yourself equally vulnerable to non-sequitur attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, a common condition around these parts is the ability people dont have to be argumentative, thinking they are smart enough to use slippry-tactics that dont relate to the argument, as a relevant reaction. </p>

<p>The only relevant reaction to an argument is to address it.</p>

<p>If you fail to address the argument standing with reason, and instead, seek to argue around the argument itself, you expose an inability to out-argue the standing argument.  You&#39;re intent is seeking a &#39;way-out&#39;. The only way through is by going in and then expressing intellectual honesty in agreement or disagreement, WITH REASONS.</p>

<p>I agree.  You should study up on the apostrophe before trying again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What really gets me, from frequent, lengthy argumentation for over 2 years here, is that a large contingent of users here refuse to argue in good faith. They simply don&#39;t read the entirety of the arguments presented to them, and continuously focus on bits and pieces (usually whatever minutiae they latch onto in the first two sentences of your post) to the exclusion of all else. There can never be healthy debate with people like this, and I feel like it&#39;s to be expected that the average person, after a lengthy back and forth with someone like this, will be brought to a point of frustration whereupon the natural instinct is to resort to name-calling.</p>

<p>In my experience, the person who thus far has not argued in good faith then immediately mashes the report button, and the mod issues a summary ban for the individual who committed the grievous offense of using a bad word.</p>

<p>The end result is censorship of those who cannot maintain an absolute facade of civility, with absolutely no thought or regard given to what circumstances might have driven them to such a lapse.</p>

<p>I will never understand how anyone can believe an insult mixed into actual content, after being driven to an extreme of frustration, somehow destroys the quality of all discussion, while simultaneously refusing to agree that willful refusal to argue in good faith or even fully read arguments presented does not at the very least diminish discussion in a similar way.</p>

<p>yet, I am trained in language and philosophy. </p>
