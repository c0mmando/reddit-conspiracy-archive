They give you 2 options, you get random ads on youtube and google partners website or you get targeted ads by allowing them to collect data on things that you like.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory but I&#39;m not sold on it completely without evidence. When you watch channels that appeal to you, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ll see commercials that appeal to you. Ad companies pay a lot of money to figure out which channels would hit their target audience.</p>

<p>The amount of effort that would have to be put into sending specific ads to each individual television set would be so ridiculous, it&#39;d be nearly impossible outside of a streaming service that has your IP address.</p>

<p>Online streaming service like PS Vue? I could comprehend targeted ads. Cable? Highly doubtful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they appear on lots of different channels, I can tell when they&#39;re streaming because of the quality.  How many channels would advertise whiskey, diapers, resorts (we were just planning a resort stay), quickbooks (I use quickbooks for my small business) and credit scores which I just had a long convo with my bro in law about.  These air on network channels, kids channels, MTV, cnbc ect...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know enough about how ads work on cable to say that you&#39;re wrong but from my very limited understanding, commercials are all aired via the networks, not the cable providers.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I thought too.  I hope I&#39;m wrong, but pretty sure I&#39;m not, they&#39;re so specifically targeted, that it can&#39;t be coincidence.  That&#39;s the same way I felt about FB Instagram ads.  Then I tested my theory by setting my phone next to the tv while playing a Korean on demand show.  I started getting ads on FB in Chinese and my Yahoo news stories were all from Asia.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m noticing it on TV. Really hope I&#39;m wrong, because its so creepy, but also think about what Wikileaks revealed in Vault 7 that Samsung Tv&#39;s were spying.  So not totally out of realm of possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re right that ads are largely served by the networks rather than by the cable provider. However there is a precedent in that Comcast overlays its own ads over webpages when you browse the internet using Xfinity wifi. So one possibility is that Comcast is just overlaying a targeted stream over a more generic broadcast at the specific times advertisements are being aired.</p>

<p>We know that our phone apps are listening to us and selling data, so this is not that surprising.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, we don&#39;t know this. At least to the extent that they are actually collecting everything we say and are reporting it. Sure, I&#39;ve seen some people claim that this is happening, but the evidence was shoddy, at best.</p>

<p>The reality is that they don&#39;t need to listen into your conversations. They can probably glean a lot from your watching habits what type of people are in your house. They are also probably buying information about your online habits as well. With all of this together, no one needs to listen to your conversations, it would almost a complete waste (if they are just trying to target advertisements towards you) and way too risky.</p>

<p>But it wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all if they customize the ads you see. Unlike the claim by the other guy, I believe this would be trivial, especially if you already have internet with them.</p>

<p>Test it. Set your phone next to a tv playing a foreign language for an hour. Within 36 hours you will notice some web ads from things related to that country.  Go ahead, do it.  Report back.  For me I found a Korean tv show on demand.  Within a day I had ads in Chinese and Yahoo&#39;s news stories were all Asian related. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>This is not true. First of all, your phone doesn&#39;t have the on-board processing power to do that, so all the data would have to be sent to the Internet to be processed. Secondly, that would obliterate your battery.</p>

<p>Ad targeting is very sophisticated these days, but it&#39;s not spooky. It&#39;s just clever. Like for instance, if you&#39;ve set your phone to share location data with apps, if somebody <em>physically close to you</em> does a search for beef jerky, then you&#39;ll be more likely to see beef jerky ads, because the assumption is that you might also be interested in beef jerky. This is how stuff like the &quot;things my wife likes show up on my phone!&quot; is accomplished.</p>

<p>Facebook&#39;s targeting is even more sophisticated. Facebook knows who you&#39;re &quot;friends&quot; with (because you tell it) and it often knows when you&#39;re in the same place (because you get tagged in your friend&#39;s posts or pictures), so they can correlate your searches with your friends&#39; and vice versa.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really not scary. It&#39;s just clever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a Reply All podcast recently that tried to get to the bottom of this. They basically came to the same conclusion about the ads being served to us falling in the clever but (probably) not scary category. We definitely all get data-minded and served ads based on who we spend time in proximity with, where we go, what we search for, what they search for, etc.
I keep meaning to test the eavesdropping theory by randomly talking about some bullshit that I don&#39;t actually care about and am unlikely to be otherwise served comment for. Like talking about Gobots or Paraguay a few times to see if I start getting targeted by the Paraguayan tourism board. I&#39;m assuming I won&#39;t be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see all kinds of coincidences in the ads I see, but the creepiest ones I can generally find a digital link to explain. As in, my buddy and I were talking about Product X at a bar the other day and then I saw ads for it. But invariably he had googled the product or read about it or something. FB can easily collect data from both of us, see that he was likely interested in Product X, we&#39;re acquaintances and hung out recently, so maybe I&#39;d be interested in it too. It&#39;s convoluted in the description, admittedly, but it seems like that would be easy enough to implement for programmes familiar with that stuff. To be, that seems like a simpler solution than an app, or apps, constantly listening and transmitting data (although I definitely wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s impossible or not happening).</p>

<p>You just asked how something that is extremely easy to do could possibly be done. This should make you question how much you actually understand about any of this and question how much your interpretation of any of it is valid. </p>

<p>Instead, you dismiss this and simply claim that you have a lot of other evidence other than what you put forth (which was explained another way question). This is like the exact opposite of critical thinking.</p>

<p>This is probably the result of confirmation bias. Think of the hundreds or thousands of things you say a day. The fact that a handful of them can be linked to you in other ways is not surprising in the least. If you actually critically think about this, you&#39;ll see that there are many things you talk about that aren&#39;t advertised to you.</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> example you have given was that you put your phone next to the TV - for something you chose on demand - and that you started getting ads related to that. This is easily explained another, easier, and more simple way. A way you did not understand existed. How can you be so sure that the rest of your &quot;proof&quot; doesn&#39;t fall under an equally limited understanding?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You dont know me, so you assume I&#39;m just ignorant</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not <em>assuming</em> that at all. You asked a question that clearly indicated your ignorance of something very simple and common. Instead of admitting that maybe you don&#39;t understand that there are other possible explanations for the other &quot;evidence&quot; you have, you are simply vaguely referring to all the evidence you have, without putting it out there for critical analysis. I&#39;m suggesting that maybe you should be a bit more critical of your evidence, because you weren&#39;t with the only piece you&#39;ve put forth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are clearly offended by this notion, but why the hostility?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not offended by the notion, I&#39;m offended when people claim that they know for sure something has happened when they have no good evidence to support that claim. Remember, the only evidence you put forth is easily explained another way. Instead of admitting that you don&#39;t really know, you&#39;ve simply claimed that you do, without providing any further. That&#39;s what offends me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From another comment of mine on this thread:</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you examples. These examples don&#39;t prove anything but are pretty damning in my personal opinion:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>During the Super Bowl I had guests over. One of my sister in law had just gotten back from Ireland, she went to Jameson distillery there and was talking about how you&#39;re supposed to always mix a little water in with it for the proper flavor. Well the next morning I had a suggested article on FB that said &quot;should you mix water with whiskey?&quot; Neither myself or sister in law had looked it up online that night, I asked her. Also, I never search, like or comment on whiskey related things on the web. This is when I really started to pay attention and notice it was happening all the time.</p></li>
<li><p>I was at a gas station with a co worker. I always buy Arizona Green Tea cans. They didn&#39;t have any, so I said out loud, &quot;Damn they&#39;re out of Arizona Green Tea, I&#39;ll try the Pure Leaf (think thats the name of it) Green tea instead. Two hours later I had an ad for Pure Leaf Green Tea on Instagram. I have never searched for, liked or commented on Green Tea online.</p></li>
<li><p>One time a co-worker and I were talking about chicken wings because he had some for lunch. I told him how much I love Teriyaki flavored wings and that was the only kind I ordered when I got them. An hour later I had an ad for Teriyaki sauce on my Instagram. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This happens ALL OF THE TIME. I tell people about it, and then they start to notice it too. You can think all of those are coincidences, but I don&#39;t think they are, and I don&#39;t think its crazy to think they&#39;re not, especially when we give our apps permission to do just what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li>&quot;One of my sister in law had just gotten back from Ireland, she went to Jameson distillery there and was talking about how you&#39;re supposed to always mix a little water in with it for the proper flavor.&quot; They likely knew she was there, probably because she tagged herself there in some picture, or &quot;checked in&quot; that she was at the distillery. Maybe they even could tell by where she logged in. There are many, many ways for them to figure out that she was there. The figure out that she is in the same place as you, maybe because someone tags you in a picture together, or you both log on from the same IP address. Maybe you are a young male, at least semi-affluent, and you fit the profile of a person that might drink whiskey. Clearly, this is at least somewhat accurate because you were talking about whiskey to begin with. All of a sudden, you start to get things about whiskey because they believe you may be the target audience primed at that moment for whiskey related stuff. I&#39;m not sure what else you talked about the distillery, but I assume it was much more than just putting water into the whiskey. So the fact that it was about this one aspect of your conversation isn&#39;t super-coincidental, if it had been part of any part of your discussion about whiskey that night it would have seemed equally coincidental. Besides, what other numerous things did you talk to her about that you weren&#39;t targeted for? Or with other people that night?</li>
<li>I feel this is harder to explain, but who knows what else was going on that you are forgetting the mention. And, again, what else did you talk about at that gas station that wasn&#39;t advertised to you?</li>
<li>For whatever reason, they know you drink Arizona, and that makes you a prime target for Pure Leaf advertisements. The timing might be coincidental, but the advertisement seems appropriate.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>You can think all of those are coincidences,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they are coincidences (other than timing). What I am saying is that they don&#39;t need to be listening to your microphone to glean this information about you. If you are willingly allowing them to track you, especially by having the app on your phone, then they can figure all kinds of things about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the whiskey goes, it is still astronomically unlikely that they would target something so specific, even if they had data placed on her being in the Jameson distillery AND me being a whiskey drinker.  If they knew that, it would still be a huge stretch in my opinion that they would sponsor an ad for an online men&#39;s magazine about mixing water with whiskey after I had just talked about it literally for the 1st time the night before.  This would not help them sell whiskey, it would be selling me a visit to this men&#39;s website/magazine. So it wouldn&#39;t make sense for the water mixing thing to be a targeted ad to sell whiskey, and it would be an astronomical coincidence if they used the mixing to target me and I just so happened to have talked about it the night before.</p>

<p>I never search for iced tea online or comment on it.  I have no pictures of me online with me having Arizona green tea so why would they know I drink it?</p>

<p>Also, this happens all the time. The incidents I describes were the first ones I noticed.  My wife and I laugh about them now when we see them.  She started noticing too.</p>

<p>The timing IS very important on these things.  When these ads pop up within hours of saying the things on numerous occasion you can&#39;t say the timing is coincidence everytime, in my opinion of course. </p>

<p>However, what is actually &quot;astronomically unlikely&quot; is that, if they are capturing all of this data, and sending it back (because they would have to be sending back a ton of data if they were sending back that you were talking about something specific as putting water in whiskey), and no one has been able to sniff the packets nor show that the apps are still running while the phone is off and using the microphone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, we do know this. it has been confirmed some apps are partnered with other voice/sound recognition app providers and link to their servers in order to upload limited amounts of background data -- usually the sounds recorded while that app is open.</p>

<p>they listen for, say, product names, known songs, etc. and target you for ads with those things.</p>

<p>having internet alone is more difficult to manage this with because of VPN -- however, you still get targeted ads on windows because Microsoft itself is a sell out (Id have rather paid for yearly new OSs and risked security holes personally than have SAS, I am against software as a service though I cannot let it be known I am professionally or will never work)</p>

<p>but anyways windows itself has an &#39;advertiser code&#39; built into the OS and will communicate with advertisers regardless of your IP, which is why a VPN no longer stops targeted ads on windows -- aside from issues like facebook and google accounts.</p>

<p>anyway, this is 100% true.</p>

<p>since it was established as precedent to be legal to profit off this data, everyone either does it or goes out of business. If I made a commercial competitor to Microsoft that didn&#39;t lock people down like Apple, and refused to advertise, I would have to charge hundreds more, sell far less copies, and even with 2x the cost initially, the profitability would tank.</p>

<p>the only solution is to add hard privacy laws which kneecap corporate products with threat of force by the government, and put everyone on an even field forcing the old model to stay alive regardless of how industry feels about it.</p>

<p>if profits were mandated to be lower by LAW, and these methods of accruing extra money made ILLEGAL, everyone would have an even playing field without them, enabling people who want a different future to create it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This all started a couple months ago with one app in particular, this is not happening on the scale people fear, 99% of the anecdotal evidence for this has been debunked.</p>

<p>Your phone battery does not and can not support your phone streaming audio to a server without it being immediately noticeable both in battery draw and network data usage.</p>

<p>These phones are picked apart every release by people alot smarter than us and it would be absolutly known as a fact if any of this was happening and it&#39;s not and has sent been.</p>

<p>Your phone is not listening to you...</p>

<p>Your Web surfing habits produce more than enough analytic data for them to target adds at you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know some of it is not from web surfing habits, but you don&#39;t know me, so you&#39;re entitled to think I&#39;m just ignorant.  I&#39;ll give you examples.  These examples don&#39;t prove anything but are pretty damning in my personal opinion:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>During the Super Bowl I had guests over. One of my sister in law had just gotten back from Ireland, she went to Jameson distillery there and was talking about how you&#39;re supposed to always mix a little water in with it for the proper flavor.
Well the next morning I had a suggested article on FB that said &quot;should you mix water with whiskey?&quot; Neither myself or sister in law had looked it up online that night, I asked her. Also, I never search, like or comment on whiskey related things on the web. This is when I really started to pay attention and notice it was happening all the time.</p></li>
<li><p>I was at a gas station with a co worker.  I always buy Arizona Green Tea cans.   They didn&#39;t have any, so I said out loud, &quot;Damn they&#39;re out of Arizona Green Tea, I&#39;ll try the Pure Leaf (think thats the name of it) Green tea instead.  Two hours later I had an ad for Pure Leaf Green Tea on Instagram.  I have never searched for, liked or commented on Green Tea online.</p></li>
<li><p>One time a co-worker and I were talking about chicken wings because he had some for lunch.  I told him how much I love Teriyaki flavored wings and that was the only kind I ordered when I got them.  An hour later I had an ad for Teriyaki sauce on my Instagram.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This happens ALL OF THE TIME.  I tell people about it, and then they start to notice it too.  You can think all of those are coincidences, but I don&#39;t think they are, and I don&#39;t think its crazy to think they&#39;re not, especially when we give our apps permission to do just what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

Within 36 hours you will notice some web, FB, and instagram ads from things related to that country. Go ahead, do it. Report back. For me I found a Korean tv show on demand.

<p>Also not from the US.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just tell you right now that, maybe, just maybe, they didn&#39;t listen through your phone and instead just directly looked into what you turned on on your tv. Just a food for thought that it&#39;s easier, less expensive, doesn&#39;t require working with other companies, is a much more direct and reliable way and sounds more reasonable. I know, it sounds crazy, but it just might be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 2 issues here </p>

<ul>
<li><p>background microphone usage getting snuck in with other permissions, If I want to take a picture of my wang then that shouldn&#39;t bundle the microphone permission with it ( I&#39;ll point out that microphone is also a seperate permission, but even if you turn off microphone the application can still access it because camera is enabled, same goes for location, you can poll the location directly from the camera or grab the location where pictures were taken even if the location permission is disabled for an app ) </p></li>
<li><p>education, people don&#39;t realise that apps are doing this and therefore granting broad permissions anyway, if an app asks for &quot;all permissions&quot; and refuses to run without them being granted then plenty of users will just grant them if the app gives them the ability to do something that they want </p></li>

<p>Every big company does something like that, the google search helper knows you IP address and know what have you searched from that IP address, so it’s basically a convenience feature.</p>

<p>Once, I was in a dorm and I got anal beads and vibrator suggestions, but I’m a 24/M and only searched for new case for my phone.</p>

<p>Sorry, I call bullshit on this, unless you have a malware.</p>

<p>However, if you can somehow prove this, please prove. I like conspiracy theories, but it seems like too far fetched.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google searching on my computer can&#39;t prove something like that exactly lol. For example me and my dad a couple days ago talking about where we could buy a new <em>family name</em> tartan blanket. (Trust me ive never tried to buy one of these lmao) I searched : <em>first few letters of family name</em> first thing that came up was tartan, second was tartan blanket, third was crest . Not any profile pages, not the names of the people with same name, no cooperations. Completely random clan blanket was first to pop up on Google search bar. Far fetched yes I totally agree, but it&#39;s happened to me on numerous occasions and apparently my friend gets it on her mac all the time. Dunno how I can prove this though..</p>

<p>No mic on my computer. I use Samsung s8 but only apps I have is reddit, Insta, YouTube and Netflix. I assume all of which can use my mic since I&#39;m pretty sure they all ask permission when you download them. The stupid fucking Bixby piece of shit thing is probably listening even though i haven&#39;t set it up </p>
