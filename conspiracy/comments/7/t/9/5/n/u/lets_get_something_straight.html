<p>The &quot;elites&quot; and their cronies are well known for being Masons and involved in other secret societies. Which are known Luciferians/Gnostics. We <em>know</em> this stuff, most of us. It&#39;s a private club filled with pedophilia, sacrifice, other sexual perversions, and corrupt as all hell.</p>

<p>So why, when they decide to release a bit of their esoteric nonsense, the justification they use to do all the horrible shit they do, is everyone here frothing at the mouth praising it? Knowing it&#39;s either lies, evil as fuck, or a bit of both?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Matrix is a clear cut example of Gnostic theology in film. Also Star Wars, Superman/Batman or any &quot;superhero&quot; movies, most any Disney movie especially things like &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;inside out.&quot; It&#39;s in your musical lyrics,  &quot;black hole sun&quot; &quot;stuck in the middle with you&quot; anything by Lupe fiasco, one of his songs eludes to &quot;there&#39;s only 2 ways out, one is the door (Jesus), the other is me (Lucifer)&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually quite scary, once you know all their theology, how it&#39;s in literally <em>everything</em> we see on the tube, hear on the radio, on the news, pushed by celebs and social media, there&#39;s thousands upon thousands of YouTube vids pushing it with millions of views. In fact, I&#39;d bet there is hardly a single thing not containing some form of that theology that makes it popular mainstream since at least 1930.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After a long time in research and conspiracies you go onto another level where it seems mainstream and its compromised. Don&#39;t get me wrong I respect the fellows involved in it but I like to be real and I strongly dislike distractions on our real reason why we exist and why are we are being farmed and distracted in every way thought possible. </p>

<p>Who are our higher authority? The invisible of the invisible. You square that which becomes a paradox , not the actual government, people need understand we are stopped at the government for a reason yet they are the same just like everyone just like us but on a higher level its a big blame game that we are stuck in and can&#39;t move forward for that reason. I am talking about that still the paranormal manipulating of our existence in all dimensions  to keep us in this matrix of sorts and if spoken about you get suppressed or oppressed, its like its been ingrained or conditioned into us but by whom?</p>

Through multiple generations, we have forgotten that it was a platform invented to sell us products and accepted as a religious belief that it is there to inform us while it entertains.   Advertising agencies are defining reality for the mass majority of TV watching nations.  It is both fascinating and horrifying.  Imagine any other time in history - if people spend more than 10% of their time concerned with and discussing the plays in the local playhouse.  This is the society in which we live.

<p>This is the reason it is known. Another form of torment, for that which you cant be 100% reasonably sure you understand. IN that, a feed-back loop of desperation to know, while desperation to exists (in perception) is created. </p>

<p>You already exist, and what you know is pragmatic to how you intend to act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There s a common conception of those that believe in the occult that it isn&#39;t this inherently evil thing. It&#39;s how you use it.</p>

<p>Some of these elite, or practioners might have their own, morally warped beliefs, values and praise their prefered deities. That doesn&#39;t mean that everything that is esoteric falls into the same paradigm as to how these guys are doing things.</p>

<p>I guess your personal take kind of boils down to whether you beieve in the esoteric or not, but that being said, what they believe isn&#39;t all there is to esotericism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the knowledge of the esoteric itself, and seeing signs that there is more to it. I doubt it&#39;s because people generally condone child sacrifice, cannibalism etc. What they&#39;re doing is one faucet (and I agree about &quot;their&quot; way being fucked up) of something that is supposedly neutral but can be used in any fashion, for whichever goal in mind.</p>
