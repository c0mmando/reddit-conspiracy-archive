He demonized Goldman and said she would be owned by them. Now he is surrounded by ex Goldman execs. He never said it was a bad thing but triggered you nicely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s true that they were involved with other bad actors. I would imagine that is why trump would give them a position in his administration in order to ensure a strong economy. FYI: Goldman Sachs invests in mega projects such as oil rigs and large national infrastructure projects. Insurance bonds as well. They absolutely know how to influence the economy. Those type of projects can destroy a small nation if they fail or prosper an economy if they succeed. Just because we don’t like them does not mean they do not have a skil set. Be logical instead of emotional. </p>

Simply holding the office of the president might not be enough power to overturn the fed or the banking cartel. I hope he does something about it but there is no way to know.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I mean like democrats and republican traitors sending jobs overseas. Allowing techn giants to eliminate jobs with technology without even a policy from Or program from the dept of labor. Food stamps simply confirms you are starving. Helping the bottom ten percent while the rest desperately scrounge is not helping your population. It is keeping everyone desperate. Maybe you did well with democrats in charge while they gave free reign to tech giants and globalist companies and forgot about the middle class but I know people who lost everything. Flooding the labor pool with low skill workers knowing that it would drive up the supply and drive down wages is criminal. Politicians are nothing but corporate elites and the democrats are the most dangerous because they use misleading labels such as dreamers to prey on the compassion of the public while families cannot afford decent housing or college education for their children. As a former democrats I will never forget how they lies so much and divided this country with race during the obama administration. The primary was the straw that broke the camels back. </p>

I found the ploy pull the race card when he was questioned for the lack of a birth certificate an example of his use of identity politics. I also found his prioritizing hate crimes as more important than violent crime or child abuse crimes also an example of pushing divisive policies. His administration espoused cultural Marxist values which specifically is designed to divide the population. I can go on but I don’t feel like discussing this topic I was miserable during his admistration my family and friends lost everything and he made no effort to protect Americans. So many children ended up in foster care because his administration impovershied the nation. It was a nightmare. </p>

<p>Real answer: Because the best and brightest with the skill sets needed for the positions he filled are going to be working at those companies; I suppose he could have hired less qualified people because even though the others were more qualified they had jobs at the top companies in their industry so nobody in their right mind would want them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think that good people can&#39;t work at Goldman Sachs? I consider myself relatively good, certainly not evil, but I&#39;d work there; it&#39;s one of the top companies in it&#39;s industry, I&#39;m pretty sure most bankers or whoever works there would jump at the chance. The flip side of that is if I was looking to hire the best people I&#39;d look there.</p>

<p>You might think Trump is dumb, or he only got lucky becoming a billionaire, it was all because of his dad, whatever, one thing nobody can possibly deny is that he&#39;s surrounded himself with people that have benefited him, he apparently knows a thing or two about hiring people.</p>

<p>A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent&#39;s argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent.

    <div class="md"><p>According to Fire and Fury, Cohn was Kushner&#39;s idea, and Powell was Ivanka&#39;s. Bannon was likely a coincidence, since his value to the Trump campaign was based on totally different credentials than former Goldman Sachs employment; and Mnuchin is not really a surprise since it makes a lot of sense to pick a banker for Secretary of Treasury. I don&#39;t know about Clayton.</p>

<p>Where does Trump fit into all this?</p>

<ol>
<li>He loves bankers and rich people, and one of his major motivations in life is to ingratiate himself to that class.</li>
<li>His dynastic outlook on life causes him to trust Kushner and Ivanka as advisors even when he probably shouldn&#39;t.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, when his children-advisors suggested adding Goldman Sachs employees to his administration, he had no reason at all to contradict them. Simple as that.</p>

<p>Note that Kushner himself is also a former Goldman Sachs employee, for a short amount of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lobbyists and former lawyers/CEOs get appointed by presidents all the time. What&#39;s unique about Trump is the changes their trying to make without the due process. It&#39;s fuckin weird. GWB had Cheney and Rumsfeld to smooth the edges. Trump&#39;s people are just like, <em>fuck it, let him tweet something, have people freak out and we&#39;ll just push it through before the GOPs leave in the fall...</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think that good people can&#39;t work at Goldman Sachs? I consider myself relatively good, certainly not evil, but I&#39;d work there; it&#39;s one of the top companies in it&#39;s industry, I&#39;m pretty sure most bankers or whoever works there would jump at the chance. The flip side of that is if I was looking to hire the best people I&#39;d look there.</p>

<p>You might think Trump is dumb, or he only got lucky becoming a billionaire, it was all because of his dad, whatever, one thing nobody can possibly deny is that he&#39;s surrounded himself with people that have benefited him, he apparently knows a thing or two about hiring people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The basic underlying implication of the OP is that having cabinet members or staffers involved with high finance is in some way 1) remarkable or unusual and/or 2) nefarious in some way.</p>

<p>In pointing out Obama&#39;s close cabinet ties to Citi Group, I am debunking those assumptions implied in the OP.</p>

<p>Not whataboutism. Perfectly appropriate to bring up to broaden the scope and depth of the discussion.</p>
