    <div class="md"><p>Right about what? I don&#39;t think Donald is gonna get indicted either but it&#39;s not some pipe dream. 4 criminal indictments in an investigation that he has tried to shit down over and over again. He went on TV and admitted he fired Comey because of Russia. He would be lucky if he gets off from an obstruction charge. </p>

<p>The response: No - e.g. &quot;dream on&quot;</p>

<p>The conclusion: You concocted an Ad hominem attack against the first implication that the thesis provided with no proof nor logic, may not be acceptable. You are only here to incite, you offer nothing of value and you just are a troll on your 4th account.</p>

<strong>This is a copypasta of my own post, I don&#39;t have time to write a new post  under each new post of the same topic .</strong></p>

<p>We both know that the Muller Investigation has been discredited for a long time, this has been a witch hunt from the beginning and becomes clearer every day.</p>

<p>The line-up of Mullers team is undoubtedly partisan and should have been prevented, </p>

<p>I understand if Potus had any concerns about it.</p>

<p>If I had been Potus, I would have given the order to the responsible members of congress to put together an impartial team within 1-2 months.</p>

<p>You know, just like me, it would have been the right thing to do.</p>

<p>If there has to be an investigation, then  in the end everyone has to be able to believe in the result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I&#39;m pretty sure of that.</p>

<p>It was already foreseeable in the middle of 2015 that they would blame Russian influence for this, in case the Trump would become president.</p>

<p>I know for sure because I experienced in Germany that they prepared and tested this move.</p>

<p>If there was anything to find, we&#39;d already know.</p>

<p>I find it frightening with how little effort, the masses can be steered.</p>

<p>And that the goal of Muller&#39;s investigation changes almost weekly doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem either.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen all this before.</p>

<p>&quot;Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be here somewhere,&quot; he told the audience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the recent &quot;bombshell&quot; it was Trump&#39;s ire at realizing Mueller was pursuing obstruction charges that made him want to fire Mueller. In the same time period here tweeted:</p>

<p>&quot;They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice&quot;</p>
