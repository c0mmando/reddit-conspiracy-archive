    <div class="md"><p>I understand your argument, but I disagree in nuance.</p>

<p>For instance, there is an &#39;openness&#39; about discourse here, and more so, complexity of issues.</p>

<p>Reason: most posts start as a generalization and it&#39;s the respondents who add the meat and potatoes of the conceptions. It&#39;s the respondents who act as detectives here, all asking the W and H questions. </p>

<p>For example: Flat earth exists here right along side &#39;the deep-state&#39;</p>

<p>Both conspiracies, and both seem crazy to anyone with a naive mind. </p>

<p>Yet, I cant find anyone who does not belive in a deep-state, and I still find plenty of people promoting or exploring the idea of flat earth.</p>

<p>Too me, flat earth is retarded. Yet, I still read all the info, and still converse with other people attempting to utilize reason to promote the logic of an idea. </p>

<p>I like conspiracy because I am formally philosophically trained. It&#39;s only here that I see attempts at &#39;charity&#39; of dialectic, and attempts at concision in building a narrative - without the obvious rhetoric with intent. </p>

<p>You see, it&#39;s one thing to reason poorly, which is fair - we all did this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s another thing to bull-shit, which is kind-fair, as some bull-shitters dont know they are bullshitters.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 100% another process to purposely bull-shit for your cause. This is r/politics. This is R/news. In some cases, this is even R/philosophy.</p>

<p>Here, people are seemingly intelligent enough to ask questions, and wise enough to assume the opposite at all times. THis is a form of pragmatic-ideology, and not fanatic-ideology. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot easier to change the mind of a skeptical conspiracy theorist than it is the true-believer, and often, the wiser man is the one asking rather than telling how the universe works. </p>
