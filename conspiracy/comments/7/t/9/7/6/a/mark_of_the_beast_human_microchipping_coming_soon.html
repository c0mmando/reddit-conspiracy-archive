       I think that this is crucial to submit because of the recent microchipping of people in the news. The BBC did a piece a couple of years ago about the company in Switzerland that was microchipping their employees. There was the train company that also microchipped their commuters. The school in America who microchipped their kids to stop truancy. The list goes on... Soon the world may be experiencing mandatory microchipping in the name of the war on terrorism and this film is what that future it about.

       Why would they micro chip you when we mostly all carry a gps voluntarily?

       Good question. The microchip will not be easily removed. You can throw away your phone or passport or alexa but you would have to be very desperate to remove a chip implanted under the skin. And actually you have raised a good point - Why wouldn't you receive a chip unless you have something to hide? If I said they were to microchip every suspected terrorist in the country, you might be for it. 
But I think  they will get the next generation with gaming technologies. Maybe the will find a way to link gaming with the microchip - I explore all this in the film .
What about child kidnapping? It happens more often than you think. If the child is microchipped, you could track them.

       Chips in pets move and travel to places they aren't supposed to be. I believe the IUD or whatever women use has had similar issues. Surely they need to iron that stuff out prior to implementing anything like that. Puts a whole new meaning to "I lost my debit card" lol.

       I think that you are right. There are a lot of bits that need ironing out and I hope it takes long enough for me to get this fillm out! And yes, you won't lost the chip so no more issues with losing your bank card - one of the advantages of this system.

       Why not? You can have a biometric RFID implants for access, payments, EMS, and overall identification. No need to force adoption, just make it desirable: no need to memorize passwords, PIN, or any other biometric info offered, just a swipe of your hand.

       Whether you believe in the Bible or not, it's still happening in the world today. If you believe it relates to Biblical prophecy, then great. You know the Obama Care Bill? I saw the original bill that said all citizens must be microchipped. Later they removed it and called it conspiracy theory, BUT I SAW IT!! I actually went to read the bill in the white house documents and it was there. I just want to get the message out there. That's why I'm making this film.

       I mean, I never said it wasn’t happening but I’m also not convinced it’s insidious. There is potential for abuse, but that’s true of all technologies, I still have no intention of becoming a Luddite.

       My point was really that it seems odd to be up in arms over it since anything considered to be a sign of the end times should be welcomed by those who believe in them.

       But if it came about and they basically said if you dont take the microchip you will be arrested as a terrorist, would you take it just because of apathy or would you refuse knowing that you would be breaking the law to do so?

       You have made my point for me. This film is about a family that refuses to take it because they are Christians and in the Bible there is warning about a time when everyone will be forced to take a scar on the hand or forehead and they can't buy or sell without it. According to the Bible, this will lead them to destruction. Some Christians believe that is going to be a microchip. This family in the story is fully emerced in this belief and it plays out what happens to them when they are captured by the government. It's a fictional story based around some true things happening now. It was written in 1994, long before chip and pin, microchipping or anything like that - funny how close it is to the truth now.....

       If it would cause the world to end then shouldn’t we all welcome it?

       Christians get to go to heaven and non believers would have always faced that end anyway. That was my original point when I said shouldn’t Christians be happy about this.

       I understand why you might think that it would make Christians happy to see the end of the world, but the word Christian means follower of Christ and Christ said that his heart would be that every person comes to know him in a personal way. I don't want to end up preaching on here but in answer to your question - No, they would not be happy because millions of people will have ended up in hell. Christians are all about helping people, not destroying them. It's a difficult one to discuss in a forum but the film is not about destruction. It's about seeing things from both sides of the fence. I tried to make it very balanced. It discusses the benefits and the negatives of microchipping and government control.

       Ah there’s the reason I’m not a Christian.

       You should rejoice that we nonbelievers go to Hell, it is the will of your god after all. He chose this life for us. If he’s real he’s fully in control of everything that happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an omniscient god places two humans that couldn’t even grasp the difference between good and evil in a garden with temptation (a concept they clearly couldn’t comprehend) and then punished them and all their descendants for eternity unless they praised him and sacrificed..... well that’s no god I could ever bring myself to respect.

       I'm not going to have this debate online here. Mostly because that's not what this post is about. You should view your issues at r/christian.

       Well, don't say things then like Christians require "sacrifice".  The only real sacrifice you need is to put others on the same level as yourself respect-wise.  That's why the Dalai Lama is a great guy...he gets it.  He understands
       <em>
        circumstance
       </em>
       . Just like many Christians understand the importance of Buddhism and other religions.  There's value in them all.

       Except they think Buddha is going to hell. I consider having to devote my life to an entity I consider cruel a sacrifice.

       Seems pretty apparent to me that it’s believers that are saved, not the rest of us heathens.

       In Catholicism the catechism is pretty clear about what would happen to someone like Buddha: "Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved".  I hardly think God would kick the likes of Buddha and Zoroasater to the curb.  Rather, the institution of Christianity was just the beginning of the end, so to speak.  I told my brother that Christianity was a wake up call, and that we will see the City soon...and heathens will be outside the gate to the city.  And it's funny because all of the REAL heathens are outing themselves quite readily these days (and I mean bad ones), with little thought of the surrounding exigent circumstances.  Then again, we are finding out that history is a little "scripted", so maybe it IS partially an act.  Still, I am 100% confident that even the heathens will be given reason to believe, and it's merely logic to look around and see the very rapid changes in the last ten years.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, even the KJV version of the Bible (ughh) says that judgment is based upon works, not upon belief.  Rev 20:13
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up very poor and Catholic.  Was an altar boy for many years and even did my sister's weddings.  Completely stopped practicing for almost 20-25 years, and still don't.  But I've had such inexplicable occurrences in the past year and a half that I can't help but believe now.  I mean, I saw a perfectly equiangular triangle rainbow cloud the day after my grandmother died last year...and she lived life like a miser and was almost entirely selfless.

       I get "transmissions", like a medium, and, if anything, I learned that religions each play a respective role and that almost all have important lessons.  Also, gods (plural) are very real and are very much at work in the world, which is a bit creepy to learn at first.  Woulda never thought that as a kid!  But, they still fall under the purview of God proper, and they are/were cast down to Earth for the "fun times".  Having fun yet?  I know I am.

       No, but that sure is the problem with people who do believe the Bible. You nutjobs see the end of the world as a good thing, not something to be avoided at all costs.
