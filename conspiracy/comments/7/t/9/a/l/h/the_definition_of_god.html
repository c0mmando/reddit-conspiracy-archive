        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To speak of “God” properly, then—to use the word in a sense consonant with the teachings of orthodox Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, Hinduism, Bahá’í, a great deal of antique paganism, and so forth—is to speak of the one infinite source of all that is: eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, uncreated, uncaused, perfectly transcendent of all things and for that very reason absolutely immanent to all things. God so understood is not something posed over against the universe, in addition to it, nor is he the universe itself. He is not a “being,” at least not in the way that a tree, a shoemaker, or a god is a being; he is not one more object in the inventory of things that are, or any sort of discrete object at all. Rather, all things that exist receive their being continuously from him, who is the infinite wellspring of all that is, in whom (to use the language of the Christian scriptures) all things live and move and have their being. In one sense he is “beyond being,” if by “being” one means the totality of discrete, finite things. In another sense he is “being itself,” in that he is the inexhaustible source of all reality, the absolute upon which the contingent is always utterly dependent, the unity and simplicity that underlies and sustains the diversity of finite and composite things. Infinite being, infinite consciousness, infinite bliss, from whom we are, by whom we know and are known, and in whom we find our only true consummation. All the great theistic traditions agree that God, understood in this proper sense, is essentially beyond finite comprehension; hence, much of the language used of him is negative in form and has been reached only by a logical process of abstraction from those qualities of finite reality that make it insufficient to account for its own existence. All agree as well, however, that he can genuinely be known: that is, reasoned toward, intimately encountered, directly experienced with a fullness surpassing mere conceptual comprehension.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. And it&#39;s the same thing. Any god we know of here, other than <em>the God</em> Yahweh, is part of the fallen sons spoken of in 1 Enoch and Genesis. When God divided up the tongues of the people at the tower of Babel, He divided them, and their lands, and gave them to these other God&#39;s. Basically said &quot;fine, you want these other God&#39;s you got them.&quot; People then, just like today, were mostly idiots. They didn&#39;t care if these other gods wanted human sacrifice so long as they got the new &quot;iphone.&quot; The very next chapter God goes to Abraham, tests his loyalty, and begins ISRAEL. </p>

<p>Joshua, and then David, are sent around to kill all these other god&#39;s children, the nephilim. Stamp them out. Kill even the animals in these lands. All these other gods are loosely united under Lucifer. They are all in opposition to God.</p>

<p>God has a divine council, a sort of round table that his Sons had seats at. The catch phrase &quot;only begotten son&quot; is an improper translation. It should read &quot;unique&quot; or &quot;one of a kind.&quot; </p>

<p>Your close, in ancient versions of the bible there were more gods. And the gods were talking among themself. They are all named in some bibles.</p>

<p>But in after contact with the zorastrians the Jews decided that only Yahwee could be god. Others like ELOHIM and many more and no longer being used.</p>

<p>When you read the bible with this info it becomes funny really the conversations.</p>

<p>And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 And God saw that the light was good. </p>

<p>are 2 gods one creating and one looking.</p>

<p>Bible is filled with this stuff.
