<p>If you wanted to convict someone of causing damage to mental health,  you would need specifics: names of the people doing the harming, names of the people who were harmed, and the words that caused the harm.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have any of that. What you have is a conspiracy theory with no facts to support it. That&#39;s good enough for a fantasy, but not good enough for a conviction in a court of law. </p>

<p>Come on now, this is the most trivial internet drama possible, and demanding MSM coverage of it is hilariously overestimating the importance of Reddit.

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of people there that have and do speak out about the total astroturfing by SB.  But they get drowned out and muted by all the downvotes and shills.</p>

<p>It makes sense too. The shareblue agenda is really not aligned with reddit views.  Reddit is generally very progressive wrt to political views. Before the mass astroturfing Bernie Sanders was by far the most popular candidate on there and his views massively supported.   Shareblue HATES  Sanders and anything that is non-centrist which completely is at odds with the progressive agenda.  It&#39;s hard to notice it but you have to sort by controversial because it&#39;s all massively downvoted as shills parrot the talking points of the day.</p>

<p>I think most people just gave up and moved on to other subs and sites tired of the peopaganda.  It really is an evil thing these shilltanks have done, trying to gaslight millions of people and astroturfing corporate politics where people are trying to sincerely converse about their viewa. To me it is really damaging</p>
