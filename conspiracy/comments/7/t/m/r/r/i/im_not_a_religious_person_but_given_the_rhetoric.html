        Islam:

      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus is the penultimate prophet and messenger of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus is a Messiah (Christ), sent to guide the Children of Israel with a new revelation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus is the most mentioned person in the Quran.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Quran teaches Jesus to have been born a "pure boy" (without sin) to Mary as the result of virginal conception, similar to the event of the Annunciation in Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Islamic theology, Jesus is believed to have performed many miracles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muslim belief is that Jesus did not physically die, but was instead raised alive to heaven.

       Traditional views of Jesus have been an account that portrays Jesus as an impostor who committed blasphemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Talmud teaches that Jesus is being punished for all eternity by being boiled in his own excrement.

       Yeah as a Christian I’ve never understood why as a country we have such a close relationship with the nation of Israel. The same old reason of “the only democratic government in the Middle East” blah blah blah is always brought up. I don’t have to time to write it out here but I’ve always wondered why.

       There's nothing Christian about any holy war for the past 2000 years. Jesus specifically picked the opposite of a war horse for his triumphal entry.

       I told my conservative Catholic mother-in-law that I have no qualms with Jesus, it's his hypocritical minions I have a problem with.

       I'm not an adherent to monotheistic dogma, but I do ask myself, "wwjd?" The ideologiez of Jesus (or the idealized image of him,)  and people like him, are  worth reflecting.

       What has always "ground my gears" is the FACT that many who shroud themselves in the bible and use it as a baseball bat at times completely ignore what Jesus said about how to treat the poorest among us. Additionally, the radical right are in deep denial about the fact that the prophesies of Jesus are liberal leaning, the moneychangers he kicked out of the temple weren't tree hugging vegans.

       I believe it's because of the artificial creation of the concept of Judeo-Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The term (Judeo-Christianity) in its current form originated with George Orwell as a linguistic attempt to fight anti-Semitism in the late 1930s."

       I believe you. And like OP said, Islam shows more respect for Jesus in the Quran than Jews do in just about anything. I mean they did have Jesus killed. Muslims didn’t do that. Christians have more in common with Muslims than we do Jews. But shhhh, that’s not supposed to be talked about. Christians and Muslims are supposed to hate each other.

       Let me give you a relevant example.

      <p>
       Egypt was a democratic country, from 2012 to 2013, just one year.
       <br/>
       Then a military coup that put a dictator general as president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess which side did America (the guys who support democracy) supported in this case?

       That makes sense and fulfilled prophecies written 680-701BC by the prophet Isaiah
      </p>
      <p>
       3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
      </p>
      <p>
       9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
      </p>
      <p>
       12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

       Silly little conspiracy in play in which a bevy of anti-establishment skeptics who despise the Neocons for what they've done and continue to do end up promoting the same fear/kill Islam "Holy War" bullshit that allowed their predecessors to sell the War on Terror the first time around.

       Religions are dangerous because they tell you to have faith in the extraordinary. It is a perfect market for extremism. Belief without reason. We don't see a lot of atheist bombers.
