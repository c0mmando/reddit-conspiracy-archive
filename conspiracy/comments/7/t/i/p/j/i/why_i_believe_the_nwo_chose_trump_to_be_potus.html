       Trump is the ultimate distractor. He says and does outrageous stuff all the time which drives the media and the masses into a frenzy.
      </p>
      <p>
       While everyone is distracted, the global elite line their pockets and consolidate power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are some that are naive enough to think the US has free and fair elections. These people need to wake up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter what name is on the ticket, the house always wins. The more divided we are, the less power we have and the more power goes up the chain. It's been done for millennia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NWO needed a distraction following the strong public outcry and grassroots movements that came about following the global financial crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       People began to call out a corrupt system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama put a fake charm and 'honesty' on an incredibly corrupt system. When people began to see through the fakery, Trump comes along to distract. Right on cue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidence? I think not. We need to remember that we are stronger together. Cliche yes, but it's the only way to avoid a totalitarian world order that's fast approaching.

       Does US bankruptcy law even apply to the government entity itself, or just the people and corporations within the country? I’m not a lawyer, but I do know that $20 tril of debt (likely more than that) is a big problem.

       You are making the charge of bankruptcy which carries legal weight to it. That’s all I’m trying to say. There is a grave misunderstand of what an individual or corporation goes through when bankruptcy is declared.

       the answer is easy to figure out.  they needed an outsider to come in and pretend to clean house when it became obvious that the satanic pedo cannibal crowd was going to be uncovered unambiguously and this would shake the foundations of governance globally as these are the control structures used by the aforementioned satanists.  an insider candidate would have zero credibility in the face of these revelations.
      </p>
      <p>
       and just look at what we're getting now.  threats of ww3.  more police state bullshit.  secret courts.  militarization of the cabinet.  all the things you'd need to pull off another stasi.  no surprises in this playbook whatsoever.

       I agree with your statement mostly. I think this whole thing about sex offenders and pedis being cleaned up and Trump somehow being worshipped for it stinks. Too much hypocrisy and the writing was on the wall, that segment, at least the most reckless portions of it, had to go, they were gonna get found out anyway and it's an easy sacrifice. It's not to be applauded as much as just considered part for the course. Sex offenders should be taken down as a matter of course, not as some extra special crusade. Even the lowest jailbird knows you fuck up a pedo if you get a chance, it's not heroic, it's just law of the jungle. Makes me mad it seems like so many real predators are thriving while the smaller fish and even some innocent people get sacrificed. There are a whole lot of lawyers and politicians in d.c. right now living large that knew our tax dollars had been being funneled into a slush fund for 20 years to protect politicians who got hit with allegations, and none of them spoke up until now and it's been brushed under the rug despite the hashtags and even still its like some low level sacrificial lamb type shit.

       Deep state has gotten a lot of what it wanted over time, but there are setbacks and roadblocks even to the deep state and the NWO agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a lot of effort was put into toppling Castro, or toppling Assad, or they wanted to kill Gaddafi a long time ago and failed, but more recently succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Charles De Gaulle of France put up obstacles to NATO that the deep state was unhappy with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the US left South Vietnam under conditions that were less than ideal for what the objective had been.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the recent election, I am sure there were many efforts on both sides to rig it. Hillary successfully cheated Bernie. But no one really saw it coming that Trump would take out all those career politicians on the Republican side, that was a win for the media, it was a great farce, and it was thought to be helpful to the Democrats at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, the corporations have been getting what they wanted, but its still a messy sausage factory how stuff goes in at one end and comes out the other.

       Its a kind of disinformation to be too ignorant of real history.

       I believe the NWO get whoever they want. They can easily manipulate elections so if they wanted Hillary, I believe she would be president. The key is and has always been to give people a semblance of choice. Trump offers them something Hillary couldn't.. A cult of personality and the ability to deflect and distract.

       Some of them did, eg Soros.  There are definitely factions.  Peter Thiel, who has attended Bilderberg, supposedly helped the Trump campaign with his data analysis company Palantir.

       The biggest fear of the global elite is a revolt by the masses. The NWO would start WW3 to avoid another French revolution.

       By not wasting your energy hating someone because they're a republican, why not work together to find out where you hardearned money is going? Who's polluting your rivers? Who's keeping you from retiring before you're nearly dead? Only coming together with one voice and standing as one will stem the tide.

       Yep, people need to understand they; republican and democratic politicians, are working together at the end of the day. It's almost like a friendly competition for votes and donar dollars. They still need votes and they know one side can get them by talking a sort of game and vice versa but the donar dollars often come from one place to both parties.  They are more on each other's team than they are on the teams of the people they are supposed to represent. It serves their ends to keep us divided.

       Meanwhile, we keep getting more censorship, more "security measures", more and more radical social standards in reaction. The world is getting changed and nobody notices because they're too busy being indignant about the latest Twitter outburst.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all of this in just 1 single year. Jump ahead to 2020 and you might be amazed at what the "new normal" will be. Don't believe me? Here's one example.
      </p>
      <p>
       A little over a year ago, Hugh Hefner was still alive and people thought he was a bit of a joke. Harvey Weinstein was still one of the most powerful men in Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Hef is gone, Weinstein is an outcast... and guys like James Franco have their careers instantly ended by a couple of allegations tweeted online. This, in one year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said. Hang around til 2020 and see how far things go.

       The temporal focus is all wrong. People here are trying to come up with explanations for past events by looking at causes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Far more productive to understand the here and now by studying actual effects. Studying the effects let you understand what the trends are.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr; The reaction to something is just as important as the thing itself. To argue otherwise is to say that cause matters more than effect.

       Definitely not the worst theory I've read. If it is all controlled and thought out to the level of your analyst by tptb, I tend to agree with you. People are spending their time, me included, getting all up in arms about shit that may be somewhat important, but isn't really as important as things that slip by right under our noses.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, notice there's been a # metoo and it's done some good but Harvey is still free, and while I'm sure his days are more stressful than he is used to, me suspects he still buries his face in a pile of coke and top flight whores in a bungalow by the sea as soon as the sun goes down.

       Then in this case the plan backfired magnificently. I think Trump is exactly the sort of kick in the ass this country needs to unify in some meaningful way against that established power. I get using him as a distraction but the vitriol people feel for him I think has really made a lot of people ask what the fuck we did to get to this point, and what can we do so we don't end up here again. Will we learn? Well, perhaps not. Hopefully we prove "them" wrong and learn some thing or two from this absurd daydream.

       Trump is a reality tv star and made himself into a brand.  I think he was vetted heavily, and found to be the actual lesser of two evils by the white hats at alphabet agencies.  I am very interested in seeing where things go next.

       I believe the NWO get whoever they want. They can easily manipulate elections so if they wanted Hillary, I believe she would be president. The key is and has always been to give people a semblance of choice. Trump offers them something Hillary couldn't.. A cult of personality and the ability to deflect and distract.
