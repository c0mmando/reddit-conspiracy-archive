       Hip Hop star Jay-Z has blasted traditional Christian values in an epic rant where he claims to be part of an exclusive club of "smart people" who worships "our true lord; Satan."The billionaire rapper has also claimed that "God created Lucifer to be the bearer of truth and light," and that "Jesus never existed" but was merely a "tool created by smart people to control dumb people."During a backstage tirade at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans on Friday, Jay-Z pointed around the room saying, "ya'll being played." "There ain't no Jesus."Ya'll slaves to a fake religion."Do you think I got where I am praying to a guy that don't exist?"No. I found the guys who invented that guy and I joined the club."Then I worked my way to the top."I earned my new form of humanity and maturity when I fully embraced my older brother, Satan."The music star claims that Satanism became the "highest form of being" due to the ease of manipulating "mentally-challenged Christians" who "desire to be slaves."He stated that "there's real spirituality and guidance in the Church of Satan," that rewards its followers with "wealth and success," but "Christians have prayed to God for years and ain't gotten nothing back, just silence and emptiness."
      </p>
      <p>
       This, apparently, is what caused Satan to have "gotten a bad rap" from Christians who worship a "fake religion, built by assholes."Pointing to a small crowd of backstage ticket winners, the multi-Grammy Award-winning musician said: "How many of ya'll have gotten rich, or famous, after you prayed to God?"Come on, raise your hands?"As the young fans began to murmur nervously, Jay-Z announced: "I can answer for y’all because I am free."I answer to a higher power."None of you are rich and none of you are famous because no one is listening to your prayers."I got everything I wanted because I surrendered to our true lord, Satan."Because I recognized Jesus is the original fake news, designed to enslave humanity.""God created Lucifer, not Jesus, so he could rule over us as Satan."I’m telling you this because I know you guys look up to me and want to emulate me."I will give you this one guarantee, if you start following the doctrine of Lucifer, you will taste success."The secret of the universe opens up to you. "It is immediate and glorious."The 99 Problems rapper also promoted his Satanic beliefs onstage, telling the audience they should ignore the rules of the venue and the security staff trying to enforce them.Jay-Z instructed his fans to "Do what thou wilt" instead of respecting the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no secret Jay-Z is a longtime follower of the English occultist founder of the Satanic religion Thelema, Aleister Crowley. The religion is based on the idea that the beginning of the Aeon of Horus was marked by the start of the 20th century, in which a new ethical code would be adhered to: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This statement indicates that followers, known as Thelemites, should seek out their true path in life, and follow their "True Will."Jay-Z’s Satanic preaching is just the latest in a long line of public glimpses into the dark side that the rapper has shared.
      </p>
      <p>
       He recreated his image as a dark lord, after starting his career as an aspirational rapper, flashing Illuminati hand gestures and promoting Satanic symbolism as he rose to the top of the music industry.Jay-Z has since attempted to tone down his dark image since establishing himself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer. However, this latest disturbing rant in New Orleans suggests he has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society, far deeper than ever before.The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati has moved onto the next phase of the master plan, and has begun openly promoting sinister spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.Perhaps those most influenced by Jay-Z's Satanic promotions are his legions of disenfranchised youths, who aspire to one day lead a lifestyle like their hero.

       This is for those that are still on the fence about the whole elite satanic conspiracy. We are in full blown spiritual warfare and IMO Jesus is the way, the truth, and the light. Jesus leads the way to the path of victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jay-Z May have earthly success but that comes at a very high price. We need more love and unity, compassion and forgiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The teachings of Satan are all about selfishness and greed. The elite worship Satan, sacrifice innocent children to Satan, and are the reason the world is such a sick place in 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
       What path do you choose? You don’t have to believe in Jesus to know that the Satanic path leads to spiritual death and hell upon earth. I love you all and hope we can come together to defeat this evil.

       so basically he's saying that because he got "better" treatment over others that this is a good model for everyone.  but it's not of course, because if everyone got "better" treatment then it wouldn't be "better" by its nature.  the problem with these ideologies of selfishness are that they're selfish and inherently divide.  either you're on the side of the takers are you're on the side being taken from.  and the takers are the last people you should go to advice for if you're not on their team.  it ain't like they're fixing things for everyone else is it?  they're just digging their hole deeper - because it's all they know how to do.

       Abandon ship and stop feeding the beast. Sell your assets buy land and start a homestead. We don’t need money or anything society offers. We have to look out for one another and get back to our roots. The parasite can’t survive without the host.

       It’s madness. It’s so hip and cool to bash Jesus these days meanwhile witchcraft and the church of Satan are growing at a staggering rate. The “conspiracy” is out in the open and folks need to wake the hell up before it gets too late. The beast system is breathing down the back of our necks. They are ready to pull off the NWO and soon!

       There is a obvious satanic cult among the big players in government, media, and entertainment. They all use the same symbols, attend rituals, and belong to secret societies. Satanic worship has been a staple of elite circles for thousands of years.

       If it's so obvious, why aren't you providing any sources? Artists and musicians like to include occult references in their work because it draws attention. It doesn't mean they are actually part of ancient mystery cults or 18th century clubs for Bavarian elites.

       So you really think that all mainstream, artists, actors, and politicians just use Satanic imagery to draw attention? The reason they are mainstream is due to their allegiance to Satan. The elite only promote those who are willing to to their satanic cultural programming.

      <p>
       First off, you are using the world "all" - which I immediately disagree with. Instead of just making a broad stroke like that - how about we start by listing specific mainstream artists, actors, and most importantly - politicians that use "Satanic imagery."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to debate something as vague as "all artists/actors/politicians." Let me respond to specific examples.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So then please define "the elite" here. It seems almost comical that the Rothschilds, the Queen, and the Bush/Clinton dynasties are personally vetting movies and albums based on how well they cater towards Satanism. It's not "the elite" who are deciding who and what gets popular - that's just as much to blame on the public as anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to blame the ills of culture and society on an satanic illuminati boogeyman is an ignorant way of dismissing the critical failures of human nature itself.

      <p>
       You still haven't provided even a single reference to back up your theory. If he doesn't try to hide it, and it's so obvious -- what exactly am I missing? Is it the hand symbols? That he made a "black album?" Are there any direct examples or is it all just vague nods towards nothing concrete?

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This seems like you are just making things up now. What are the levels of Satanism exactly? What level is Jay-Z within that hierarchy? What are your sources for determining the overall levels, and his level? What is "the satanic program?" Is it a coordinated effort among likeminded groups? Who are those groups? Does it include things like the Satanic Temple of Minneapolis? Does it include the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn? Does it include the Weinstein Company?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not ignorant of satanic and luciferian groups - in fact I've spent decades researching them and their many facets. Which is why I'm so overly critical when someone tries to call out superficial actors and artists as being in some secret satanic group of elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are rich and spoiled artists, which tend to be experts on controversy and public relations campaigns. Often this includes throwing in a pentagram or ell seeing eye for the explicit reason of making twitter explode with theories.

       I am not putting jay-z up there with the Rothschilds. He is a court jester and the only reason he is promoted is because he, just like all the other mainstream artists, play the luciferian game that their elite masters push on them.

       Are you meaning "all the other mainstream artists" in a literal sense? Can you name some others? Also what is the "luciferian game" you refer to? Are you aware of the stark differences between Satanism, LaVey Satanism, and Luciferianism? When you say "luciferian" game it implies gnostic principles - but until this point you were only referring to Satanic practices.

       I'm not trying to be dense or coy here. Please, share with me just a few of these symbols and methods you keep mentioning. Even others in the comments here bring them up but not a single link, image, song, article, etc. has been shared to back any of this up beyond vague twitter rumors.

       But... you still haven't even provided a single example. You just keep saying "it's obvious, they all do it, everyone knows this" but none of that is true. It's not obvious. Not everyone does it. Not everyone recognizes it.

       Help me understand what I'm missing here. What is it about Jay-Z specifically that is so convincing that he's a literal Satanist working for the elites?

       I really wish I had time to elaborate but today is not a good day for that. Perhaps, I’ll make a more in depth analysis as soon as I can. I understand not everyone is seeing this topic through my lens but I am not the only one that is seeing the full scope of the Satanic agenda. The entertainment angle is not even where I spend most of my time in research. The conspiracy is far grander in scale and I could write a book about it due to the vast amount of information I’ve collected over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Y’all have a good one and no matter what you believe, let’s try to be kind to one another and let us understand that we need unity to defeat the enemy.

       Much love!

       It's almost as though entertainers in rap / hip-hop would just say wild and bombastic things to get attention and drive sales?

       The question is, even if it is fake news, who the fuck is writing this fake news and what's the motive behind it? This is planned and deliberately let out as news through a popular enough outlet. Whether its fake news or not, it's planned deliberately to be read for millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we assume it's real, then it's self-explanatory what's going on here. If it's fake news, you might wonder whether it's just being put out in the media to test reactions and such. Whether Jay-Z comes out and debunks this doesn't ultimately matter in the end, since I'm convinced he believes that stuff anyway.

       Looks like they are trying to make people dismiss the issue all together with these “fake” stories that are actually based in reality.

      <p>
       It resonated as truth to me and I posted it only later to find that it was from a notorious “fake”/ “real” news sites. It came from Topbuzz but I saw the buzz and in my mind I just thought it was buzzfeed and boy did I catch hell for an honest mistake. There are some extremely sensitive people up in here!!

       Sorry folks, I promise I’m not the “anti christ” bearing “false witness”! Look on the bright side, at least we had a discussion about these sites and their motives.

       I don't mean to be too disagreeable with you, since I think we have more in common than not, but I disagree a bit :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Materialism, Sciencism, and getting humanity to believe that it's pointless, accidental pond scum seems to be the direction we're heading in.  Get people to believe that they're less than animals, and they'll act that way.  People are straying from deities and superstitions, and looking for something more sciency to guide them. (generally)
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say that the Gospel of Thomas is one of my favorite books from that era.  It's given me more than a little bit of head scratching.  But N.T. Jesus is a tool.  A tool made for a specific reason.  To pacify and ostracize militant messianic jews, and later, to rule over the goys who bought it hook line and sinker.  By the time Constantine was done perfecting it, it was fully weaponized into the feudal system that kept much of the world in the dark ages for 1000 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the
       <em>

       power of Jesus.

       I would argue that Materialism and bad science are doctrines of Lucifer. The trans humanist movement is tied right into new age scientism that seeks enlightenment through technology without spirituality. Also we can’t deny how pop culture is trying to bring back witchcraft and grow the church of Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree Christianity has been used as a tool for the elite to pacify, but when I read scripture I feel empowered. I see Jesus the rebel who fought the establishment and whipped the money changers right out of the temple. He inspires a sense of righteousness indignation within me, but unfortunately most see Jesus as a “turn the other cheek pacifist”. Jesus has a lot more fire and power in his message than you would think. He was a revolutionary and died for his beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real power of Jesus shows us how to effectively battle the enemy and take power away from them. The fear of God is not about being a pushover to evil, but rather having a hatred for wickedness and using love and light to snuff out the darkness.

       I will submit that this rant may in fact be completely fabricated (I mistakenly thought it was from buzzfeed) but that’s what really pisses me off about sites like neonnettle, yournewswire and now this topbuzz.
      </p>
      <p>
       These sites print stories like, “ MacCully Culkin and Mel Gibson give shocking testimony about child blood sacrifice within Hollywood” without making any proper documentation. Both Culkin and Gibson have a history of speaking out against Hollywood and this does seem like something they would say and we know children are being sexually abused in Hollywood, but when these sham sites print this stuff, people go to snopes see that it’s “fake” and completely disregard the issue entirely when there truly is some sick shit going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerned people pass this stuff around and when snopes “debunks” the testimony people just assume there is nothing to see here,  when nothing could be further from the truth. It’s grade A disinfo that tries to discredit real issues of satanic ritual abuse that has been going on in elite circles for 10,000 years!!
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not that hard to believe Jay-Z would make comments like this bc he is a satanic artist and he hangs with blood drinking witches and other sick fucks. This is Jay-Z’s philosophy whether he actually made the rant or not and that’s what’s important here.

       so you acknowledge it's likely fake, can't discern the difference between BuzzFeed and "TopBuz" and were blatantly deceived. Snopes calls BS (all things you also just acknowledged), but still
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are the Righteous Concerned, spreading "the truth", and not the one propagating and willingly spreading disinfo to the masses?
      </p>
      <p>

       The rant MAY be fake, we don’t really know, but it is still in line with his philosophy. He is a satanist no matter what my friend.

       The fools are these deceived materialistic, greedy, scumbags that have caused immense suffering to humanity bc of their sick twisted beliefs.

       These sham sites print stories that are based in truth. They just make up false testimony, in order to discredit real issues. It’s counter intelligence, but I see what they are trying to do.

       Would anybody be shocked if this rant is real? You know he thinks this stuff whether he said it or not. The evidence is overwhelming and there is nothing fake about satanic worship among the elite.

       That’s assuming these comments are fabricated, but seeing how Jay-Z is open about his luciferian beliefs; This is not really that much of a stretch.

       It was late when I posted and I honestly thought it came from buzzfeed instead of topbuzz, but this counter intelligence technique is worth discussing so I’m glad it came up.

       They are trying to discredit a serious issue and even if this rant is fake news, it takes nothing away from the truth of the elites dedication to Satan. We just need to keep an eye out for these sham sites and not let alleged fake news make people dismiss a real problem we face.

       and yet here you are, continuing to use and need a laughably fabricated testimony from a disinfo news aggregate to confirm the obvious. 🤔
      </p>
      <p>
       sounds like an add driven click bate shill to me. What's your job position at TopBuzz? Are you just a contributing writer or maybe the lead editor? You seem pretty adamant about sticking to the claim and continuing to host and propagate the content regardless of it's authenticity, because even if it's not true, it obviously still feels true, and that's all the truth you need.

       No, silly, Jay-Z is just a pawn in a 10,000 year old satanic conspiracy that is rapidly approaching endgame. Jesus tried to give the heads up 2000 years ago, but popular consensus is that he never existed or was just a chump.

       He has been cloned since the Sumerian dynasty. He played a mean lyre in the Hellenistic period, but hasn’t really put out anything decent in the last several thousand years.

       This was exactly their goal. Bring out a 'fake news' article which actually contains their beliefs and mindset, then later debunk it so no one takes it seriously anymore and cronies like you can go and say 'TopBuzz disinfo'. It's almost as if it's... By Design.

       The takeaway here is that the elite worship Satan and have for at least 10,000 years. They sacrifice children bc that is a tenet of Saturn/Satan worship.

       You see the rituals he does in public with Mariana Abromavich. Just imagine what happens behind closed doors. This is nothing new my friend. Ritual sacrifice is a staple of the elite. 9/11 and 10/1 were mass ritual sacrifices. They don’t care about human life and satanic ritual abuse is the real deal among multi generational satanic bloodlines.

       Never head of topbuzz until after I posted this, and honestly when I saw it I read it as buzzfeed. I believe these sites are trying to write “fake” news about topics that are actually based in reality in order to discredit the real truth of satanic ritual abuse and elite Satanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘Twas an honest mistake, and I’ve definitely caught my fair share of grief about it. My apologies to all.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I stand my my belief that Jay-z is a Satanic goon and is helping his masters push Satanic beliefs upon the masses. This is more than just clever marketing and damn near every high level artist does the exact same thing as Jay-Z. You don’t make it big in this industry without selling your soul to the devil at the crossroads. Nobody is familiar with the story of Robert Johnson, the blues legend?

       and yet here you are, continuing to use and need a laughably fabricated testimony from a disinfo news aggregate to confirm the obvious. 🤔

       sounds like an add driven click bate shill to me. What's your job position at TopBuzz? Are you just a contributing writer or maybe the lead editor? You seem pretty adamant about sticking to the claim and continuing to host and propagate the content regardless of it's authenticity, because even if it's not true, it obviously still feels true, and that's all the truth you need.
