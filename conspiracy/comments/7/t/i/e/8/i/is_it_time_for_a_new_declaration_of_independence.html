    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. On the other hand I have heard that only 3% of the population took part in the revolution. So the up side is we don&#39;t need everyone to understand or care. Just the ones who really care about where we are going as a people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well...the honest truth is that <em>everyone</em> needs to care about where we&#39;re going as a people because we are seeing exactly what happens when only a small, select portion or percentage of the population cares about things and the rest are generally apathetic:  That small, select percentage end up enacting laws and legislation that benefits them at the expense of everyone else, and ultimately ruling over the rest.</p>

<p>So ultimately...that&#39;s not really much of an upside because, again, we need <em>everyone</em> to care and participate - not just a select few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lost hope a long time ago. I live in California so Iâ€™m in the bubble. Most people that I interact with think Trump is the problem. The problem is much bigger than Trump, </p>

<p>They refuse to believe that there is a much bigger problem than Trump.</p>

<p>They refuse to believe that the DOJ and the FBI, a problem that precedes Trump by decades, is the real problem.</p>

<p>We have to start from scratch at this point.</p>

<p>I believe that we need to STOP paying taxes. Marching in the streets is useless. The only thing these people understand is $$.</p>

<p>Stop giving them $$.</p>

<p>Rise up!!!</p>

<p>Throw your shoulders against the wheels that drive the economy.</p>

<p>Only then will they understand. Only then will we see results.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I look at the history of people here that I disagree with. And for the most part, they are people just like me.</p>

<p>Yet, we are divided.</p>

<p>Mission accomplished?</p>

<p>Fuck that! We still have power!!! We can still make a difference!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taxes could be a key but how? Most people in America get their taxes pulled out before they even get the check. 
The problem is a lot greater than Trump. I voted for Trump and am already feeling duped. I mean Hilary wasn&#39;t any god either but I want to stay away from the left or right paradigm. The problem is bigger than Republican and Democrat. 
I also believe we still have power and more importantly we are the only ones who can change anything. We are what they fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youâ€™re right. I always got money back but many of my friends arenâ€™t in that category. For some reason, they have to pay.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m an independent contractor and from now on, I refuse to pay for a system that refuses to support the less fortunate.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m sick of paying for more war on people that I have no problem with.</p>

<p>I refuse to pay for oppression.</p>

<p>I refuse to pay for Israel or Saudi Arabia or ISIS.</p>

<p>Our government is out of control. They support people and policies that do not benefit us and oppress people on the other side of the world.</p>

<p>Occupy Wall Street only occupied parks when they should have occupied banks and Wall Street. </p>

<p>Who is supporting these worthless fucking people? </p>

<p>We all need to realize that we donâ€™t need them. We donâ€™t need stuff. </p>

<p>Iâ€™ve simplified my life to the point that none of these people have any hold over me.</p>

<p>I have no debt. They canâ€™t take anything from me. </p>

<p>Thereâ€™s nothing more dangerous than someone who has nothing to lose. I have had my freedom taken from me and I donâ€™t fear them.</p>

<p>Theyâ€™re the ones that need us. We donâ€™t need them.</p>

<p>I believe we need to find where they live. We need to make their lives miserable. They bought into this system and we need to find them and make it so they have no security.</p>

<p>When ever they show up on social media, we bury them. When they show up in public, we shame them. Drag them out in the streets and make them pay for their policies.</p>

<p>They are the 1% and we are the 99%. We have the numbers. We are in control.</p>
