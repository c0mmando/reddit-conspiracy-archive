<p>Guide stones say 500 million. I believe it&#39;s happening now. Slowly 3-5 generations. They are going to let us just fizzle out. Birth rates and sperm count are already way down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking directly to African fertility aspect, global birth rates  tend to be influenced most by social and economic factors. This <a href="https://youtu.be/QsBT5EQt348">kurzegast</a> video sums it up pretty well. To summarize, birth rates are high when people live off the land and need many children to till the land. As the country develops and cost of living rises, the reasons for having many children fade away and the costs of child care rise significantly. The result is an eventual decreasing and stagnation of population (without considering conspiracies).</p>

<p>I do think that there are many additional factors contributing to fertility reduction like plastic pollution. But I don’t think that the African race has specifically more interest concerning this topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A government official has for the first time acknowledged the practice of injecting women of Ethiopian origin with the long-acting contraceptive Depo-Provera.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt;Health Ministry Director General Prof. Ron Gamzu has instructed the four health maintenance organizations to stop the practice as a matter of course.

&gt;The ministry and other state agencies had previously denied knowledge or responsibility for the practice, which was first reported five years ago.

&gt;Gamzu’s letter instructs all gynecologists in the HMOs &quot;not to renew prescriptions for Depo-Provera for women of Ethiopian origin if for any reason there is concern that they might not understand the ramifications of the treatment.”

&gt;He also instructed physicians to avail themselves of translators if need be.

&gt;Gamzu’s letter came in response to a letter from Sharona Eliahu-Chai of the Association of Civil Rights in Israel, representing several women’s rights and Ethiopian immigrants’ groups. The letter demanded the injections cease immediately and that an investigation be launched into the practice.

&gt;About six weeks ago, on an Educational Television program journalist Gal Gabbay revealed the results of interviews with 35 Ethiopian immigrants. The women’s testimony could help explain the almost 50-percent decline over the past 10 years in the birth rate of Israel’s Ethiopian community. According to the program, while the women were still in transit camps in Ethiopia they were sometimes intimidated or threatened into taking the injection. “They told us they are inoculations,” said one of the women interviewed. “They told us people who frequently give birth suffer. We took it every three months. We said we didn’t want to.”
