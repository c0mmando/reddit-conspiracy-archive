       I feel like if the top fbi officials are involved in using fake evidence to prosecute and go after a US citizen, it should be assumed that this has been done in the past to other citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was another case where a lab technician was found to have contaminating evidence. And all past cases involving the technician were thrown out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like when a dirty cop is revealved, his/her past cases are oftentimes overturned, or dismissed. The fbi are law enforcers as well. Will this apply? Why or why not?

       This is the relevant legal theory in the U.S. -

       . Illegally obtained evidence will be suppressed if it is found to violate the 4th or 5th amendment generally. It won't cause the rest of the case/evidence to be dropped assuming there is sufficient legal basis without the suppressed stuff. If you know a specific member of law enforcement has done something unethical that hurts their credibility and it's relevant you can point it out to the jury/judge as a reason not to believe them. That's about it.

       Yeah I disagree a year of Mayor Pig Fucker in the newspapers would change your tune. Moreover there is no guarantee the media reports your acquittal. They say you tainted the cops because you are the mayor and you are forever known as a pig fucker. You know many people have   been destroyed in just this manner. No matter what Mueller says the media will always say Trump colluded, they have to in order to explain how HRC lost. They cannot fathom people do not agree with them. Point is we need to start ousting  lying news media economically, criminally or death it all matters not to me. Lying to subvert our constitution deserves the death penalty in my book, otherwise we are a lawless nation.

       Well we’re on the same page with your last statement there. Only disagreement we have is on how blatant trump has been subverting the constitution by asking for “loyalty” from independent agencies and firing people who won’t give it to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much public trust in Mueller that people will take what he concludes with his investigation as fact. There will absolutely be people who would still think there was collusion mainly due to how just fucking stupid the trump team has handled these accusations.
      </p>

       Long story short I have much more faith in muellers unbiased opinion than I do hate towards trump. I just want the truth.

       Mueller covered up Saudi involvement in 9/11. He helped cover Uranium1. He is best friends with Comey who is a crucial witness in this supposed obstruction investigation. The Russian collusion is dead and you know it so he pivots to obstruction fine then with Comey as a friend he should recuse himself but he doesn't. Mueller is a piece of garbage. If he was prosecuting you with all these skeletons you would scream to high heaven as well. Pretty clear your bias is to get Trump and not justice. Witch hunt is all this is, I think post memo a lot of people will realoze what garbage Mueller is.

       Yeah I still think Mueller is garbage. I definitely believe if not for the FBI lying to the FISA court there would be no Mueller investigation. McCabe's testimony said this so my opinion is Mueller investigation should be shutdown and it should be looked at for its level of corruption. I think it will take a few more months but its dead.

       You can also say “fake news” as much as you want but Obama dealt with soooooo much bullshit from the media and he handled it like a pro. Trump crumbling this much from criticism from the media is just a sign of poor leadership in my opinion.

       Dude pass the bong stoner, Obama had the most complicit media in history other than Fox, msm was his propaganda tool. Please try your bullshit somewhere else. You are biased or retarded take your pick.

       Yeah so it's not the fact that this fake dossier was compiled or who payed for it.  The problem is the Obama justice dept used unverified disinformation to get a FISA warrant to spy on a political opponent.

       Okay I don’t even know enough about that and don’t have the time to look into it but the whole argument here was that this is planting fake evidence and I have yet to see how that’s the case.

       Yeah will do and if that were the case I would want the investigation to proceed to prove to everyone I was not a pig fucker. I would not try to fire the guy investigating me because that’s going to make everyone think I fuck pigs
