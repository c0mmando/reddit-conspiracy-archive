    <div class="md"><p>There are no easy answers to LV.</p>

<p>Whatever happened, the Powers decided that utterly stumping the entire political and media-savvy population of the country was a better option than transparency and a free flow of valid information.</p>

<p>We can make guesses, some of them fairly good guesses, but there is no way to validate those, at least from what has emerged so far.</p>

<p>Our job is not to worry what actually happened. Our job is to define exactly what kind of state apparatus can and does act in the manner that has been on very high-visibility display since LV happened.</p>

<p>Should we concentrate on that task, I think the results will be far more productive and satisfying, if frightening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pieces are out there to figure out what happened, if we get any surveillance people will figure it out exactly. The best running theory I find closest to the truth is Paddock was an arms dealer, possibly CIA tied. No other reason for that many guns of that caliber in a hotel room. There&#39;s also the running theory that the saudi crown prince was staying at the same hotel a few floors up, that the weapons were going to be used on. The events that followed were the aftermath of the deal gone VERY wrong after the security guard stumbled onto the wrong fucking floor. you can see the crown prince getting escorted by heavily armed forces(swat/FBI/something) here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo</a>  .  This is all jut theory and we may never be able to confirm it, but if we can see the tapes how paddock got the weapons into that room might give away some sort of blackops type thing. No way one dude carried 100&#39;s of pounds of guns and ammo up to his room unnoticed, especially in Vegas that has thousands of cameras everywhere. There was also a power struggle mass arrest tied to the saudi crown prince the week after the shooting which might be him shutting down people related to the attempt on his life. </p>
