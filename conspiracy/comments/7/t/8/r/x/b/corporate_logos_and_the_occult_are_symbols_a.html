        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-26 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AreEternal.html">AreEternal</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was thinking about the Tower of Babel recently.  The story goes that a united humanity with a single language wanted to build a tower to God.  God saw what they were doing and said, “Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another&#39;s speech.”  The tower was destroyed and different languages were born.  </p>

<p>So now, if a group of people wanted to unite humanity, it would have to be done through symbolism instead of language.  Corporate logos are the most widely dispersed symbols on earth.  For example, the Golden Arches transcend language and the symbol is universally recognized as representing McDonald’s.  What’s interesting is the underlying themes and repeating patterns found in corporate logos.</p>

<p>Check out these symbols.  </p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Logo_NIKE.svg/1200px-Logo_NIKE.svg.png">Nike</a></p>

<p><a href="https://seeklogo.com/images/T/toyota-logo-BE11A14C6B-seeklogo.com.png">Toyota</a></p>

<p><a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/d/d0/IE6.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20121221232621">Internet Explorer</a></p>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1844231573/Boeing_twitter_avatar_400x400.png">Boeing</a></p>

<p>All these symbols have one thing in common, a curved line representing a ring.  According to many occult researchers, the curved line represents Saturn, which the occult elite are reported to worship.  There are many other logos with this theme including Nike, Nissan, DirecTv, etc.  Is the curved line found in symbols a coincidence or do these logos have power?</p>

<p>Another popular motif among corporate logos is the triangle or pyramid.  The pyramid represents The few ruling over the many.  Ignoring the obvious pyramid logo on the dollar bill replete with the all seeing eye, the pyramid is represented in many logos.</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Citgo_logo.svg/1200px-Citgo_logo.svg.png">Citgo</a></p>

<p><a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/a/a3/AOL-logo.svg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20160220160959">AOL with bonus Saturn symbol</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.carlogos.org/logo/BMW-logo-2000-2048x2048.png">BMW</a></p>

<p>There are plenty more.  Adidas, SunTrust, Loomis, Mercedes, etc.  So again, is this pyramid symbolism a coincidence or is it premeditated dispersal of occult symbolism.</p>

<p>The star or pentagram is another popular symbol used in corporate logos.  The pentagram is probably the most widely recognized occult symbol, specifically the upside down pentagram which supposedly represents Satan.  When researching the meaning of the pentagram I learned that it can represent the five wounds of Jesus on the cross or that the five points represent spirit, earth, air, fire, water or a symbol of protection, etc.  Here lies the difficulty in researching possibly hidden symbols projected by a possibly nefarious elite.  There’s no clear consensus on what some of these symbols mean.  Many cultures across the world have taken the pentagram and projected their own meaning onto it.  Still, I find it interesting how prevalent the star or pentagram is in corporate logos, coincidence or not.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.richardcassaro.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Magic-of-Macys.jpg">Macy’s</a>. So magical</p>

<p><a href="http://brandchannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/converse-1024x908.jpg">Converse</a>. Is that a sideways pyramid too?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.spoofee.com/images/dealofday/original/906445.jpg">Sirius</a>. This is acutally a pretty good pun; SIrius the Dog Star.</p>

<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the Pentagon, that black hole of money and bad intentions representing the military power of America.  </p>

<p>While researching these logos I found a very intriguing one.  It falls under its own category.
Do you see the snake in the <a href="http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/012b5fbcd93a4c309dd6fe702b9c5267/british-telecom-rural-phone-box-and-bt-logo-bk7py6.jpg">British Telecom</a> logo?  The snake reminds me of the vector symbol on <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ec864623324b3cc8dda1e08053f02ff4">NASA’s</a> logo.  Is that a snake tongue inside the Saturn ring or am I going to far?</p>

<p>This is the wall I come to when researching these logos.  Is all this symbolism coincidence, a misunderstanding, a natural selection of eye catching images, or a nefarious plot to control.  In my opinion, corporations as a whole haven’t earned the benefit of the doubt.  Most of them seem hell bent on destroying the Earth and hoarding as much money as possible, funneling their profits to a select few, and that select few ain’t me and it ain’t you.  </p>

<p>I’m leaning towards these symbols being used against us.  Weaving a web of imagery that ensnares us in a consumer driven death rattle, driving from store to store in our emblazoned chariots crested with occult symbols on our grills and steering wheels.  Clogging my mailbox with their flyers that in turn clog the landfills.  Into the Earth these symbols go where hopefully they hold no power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you are correct that the symbols are related to the Occult and magick. What we&#39;re looking at with these Corporate brands is a mass sigil- something that conveys an <em>idea</em> with its mere observance by the human mind, within the proper cultural context. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I would agree, but I would also add that the same power you have identified can be used <em>by</em> the People, or by anyone really. There is no inherent good or bad with the power of symbolism, what matters is the Will and Intent behind them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am saying that it may be advertising whizzes that are the occultists. </p>

<p>Masons are in every town across the western world.  They live their little symbols and many may be deeply into the occult but more are just putting these out there to identify them as mason affiliates. </p>

<p>Knowing their secret handshakes doesn&#39;t mean you are on board with everything done by them. </p>

<p>Despite the argument they are not secret, they are. From hidden libraries and to backroom deal even court cases decided sub rosa, they abound and love the secrecy. </p>
