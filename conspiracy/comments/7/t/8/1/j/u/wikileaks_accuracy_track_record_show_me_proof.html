<p>Ultimately, doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s leaks, that&#39;s the point. People leak things to them, they leak it to everyone, you get the leaks they leaked and there you go, something real you wouldn&#39;t have had otherwise. Job done, thanks very much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True enough, he ain&#39;t no savior, he&#39;s got an angle like everyone else. In simple terms - think about how much mileage he gets out of things he knows but won&#39;t tell you. At some point the gravity underneath him flipped, now he&#39;s just another secret keeper.</p>

<p>Difference is - his USP if you will - his secrets come with a cryptographic guarantee. For someone like me, who just wants to know the secrets for the sake of knowing them, that makes all the difference. I don&#39;t have to trust him to get value out of him, so I&#39;ll support him until he&#39;s done, or that changes.</p>

<p>Accuracy is the wrong metric for evaluating Wikileaks. It&#39;s not as if they are journalists doing actual reporting. Journalists should be judged on accuracy. But Wikileaks just dumps stolen documents onto the Internet. What&#39;s the room for error in doing that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. It was that simple. I disagree with the &quot;moot point&quot;..it is information...accurate information...the real problem is that it causes an &quot;imbalance&quot;.</p>

<p>If we had the Trump campaign emails we would be able to do a &quot;comparison&quot;. Giving us a more balanced picture. So, instead of disregarding true information in order to restore balance...it would be better to encourage the release of more information to restore balance.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why Trumps campaign emails weren&#39;t released. It doesn&#39;t actually make sense that they weren&#39;t...when looking at the ability of the administration to keep a secret. </p>

<p>If we take things at face value the Trump administration is the leakiest we&#39;ve ever seen. </p>

<p>Once again..doesn&#39;t make sense. </p>

<p>Is Assange to be given &quot;god status&quot; as the curator and purveyor of all accurate information? No, that would be lunacy. </p>

<p>Maybe someone needs to create a site called WikiLacks that strives to restore the balance of leaked information.</p>

<p>It will still have to be accurate and unaltered. Otherwise...what&#39;s the point?</p>

<p>But the insanity to me...is the endeavor to take information away to restore balance. That will never make sense to me.</p>
