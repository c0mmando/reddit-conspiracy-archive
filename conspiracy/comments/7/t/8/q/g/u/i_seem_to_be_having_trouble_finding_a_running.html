       CNN's most recent article says 37 so far, however it might take time to get all the numbers in. It could easily be a little higher. Best you can do is fallow news updates and check if they keep an updated tally.

       For as long as I can remember now, we've been saying 36,000 people die each year from the flu.  When we've asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for updated figures, they told us 36K was the best they had.

       That, and the fact that people don't die of the flu. They get the flu, which leads to (or exacerbates existing) complications. Cause of death ends up being something like respiratory failure secondary to severe pneumonia.

       Didn't we agree that the average reported deaths since 2010 are 33k per year? That is 600 per wk, right? With the majority of flu deaths being children and elderly,  37 children sounds

       I don't think it's even divided between the elderly and the young--here's a source saying the annual toll on children is 100-300. If that's actuate, then 10% is significant.

       NPR said 37 as of today. These stories would be remotely believable if they dug a bit deeper and provided stats on this time last year and the rate of diagnosis. They don’t - they would if it supported their fear mongering. CDC records deaths due to flu even if the patient died of pneumonia (which is a large number of cases especially in the elderly). In other words, flu figures are bogus and if they aren’t (they are) they remain insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

       Without perspective, no number means anything, really. 3,000+ ppl per day die in car wrecks.......

       CDC uses two categories of underlying cause of death information listed on death certificates: pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) causes and respiratory and circulatory (R&amp;C) causes. CDC uses statistical models with records from these two categories to make estimates of influenza-associated mortality."

       we get to see exactly how many of the deaths were really caused by Influenza
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g. In 1999 the pneumonia deaths were 62,065 and influenza just 1,665
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g.2. In 2010 the pneumonia deaths were 49,597 and influenza 274

       Excuse my ignorance on the subject, but I'm confused on how can the flu kill and why it's making such a big impact all of a sudden. Does it make you more susceptible to pathogens by weakening your immune system? Is there a new strain of influenza going around i.e. swine flu 2.0? All opinions/answers welcomed.

       Part of problem is that any death from respiratory infection is reported as flu, even if it was not tested, or if it was known to be pneumonia, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       For another, this years flu vaccine is only 10% effective, and if you get it, it will make you susceptible to other strains of flu, and it will prevent you acquiring natural immunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Past studies have shown an increase in deaths from flu in the elderly ever since widespread vaccination has been done, not less. Children admitted to hospital for flu are more likely to die from it if they were vaccinated.

       Ah, I see. So it's being used as a blanket cause for more serious illnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the purpose of getting the vaccine if it's only 10% effective, but at the same raising your chances of getting another strain of the flu? Also begs the question, why is being pushed so hard this year?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like something sinister is going on.

       Even the cdc has been caught overestimating flu deaths.  Difficult to get accurate numbers.
