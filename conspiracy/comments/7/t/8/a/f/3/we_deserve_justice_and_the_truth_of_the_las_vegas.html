        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>recently today I seen a video of a women who was shot in the head taking her first steps again.   This whole narrative about the shooting and the way the FBI has been conducting the investigation is bullshit. I remember 9/11 regardless of what you think about it we had answers quickly even if they were bullshit. I feel the FBI know we smell the shit there trying to feed us. 
This shooting I take personal and the whole Stephen paddock story stinks to high heaven. The weird crime scene photos, no really clear picture of Stephen paddock other than the ones the narrative gave us, also Jesus Campos looking like a different dude in every interview. </p>

<p>We as Americans, i don’t care who you are should fight for the god honest truth on this one. This was one of the first massacres that had dozens of videos and people who say those were crisis actors are ignorant. We can’t just stand by. I feel the fbi or cia had a hand in this and if we let them get away with this it’s a sad day for America regardless of who you are or whether you are left or right. </p>

<p>I believed the whole lone shooter narrative till I heard  and saw the footage of gun fire. I am a veteran and have been in a combat zone and more than one shooter pulled the trigger. </p>

<p>How can we all band together as American people to demand the truth on this one or hell atleast a half truth. We have the technology people are smarter in 2018 you can’t get shit by us. </p>

<p>Sorry for the grammar as I suck at texting lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not convinced of the shots coming from anywhere but the two windows, although the lack of any muzzle flash or smoke is curious. Nor do I know if the victims were crisis actors or real. There is a video of a woman being shot through the calf that seems pretty legitimate, but who knows. What I do know is the official story seems like a steaming pile of cow manure. Major points were constantly changed by the officials and there are some glaring inconsistencies with the story, things that should have been readily apparent and verifiable from day one. Things like the shooter spraying 200 rounds down the hotel hallway, when there is a surprising lack of bullet holes in both the doorway and the hallway itself. Things like the Jesus Campos timeline of when he was shot. Things like the introduction of the &quot;engineer&quot; Stephen Schuck as another character in the story a couple weeks after the incident. Things like the recording of both Campos and Schuck during the shooting where they both simply sound bored, despite a maniac massacring people feet away and one of them with a supposed bullet wound from a high powered rifle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/adambradley717">/u/adambradley717</a> I&#39;m not sayin for sure anyone was outside shooting bc idk. One person did report seeing shell casings as fleeing the scene in a parking lot near tropical iirc but that&#39;s not really much. Anyome else who claimed to see anything or be chased is dead. That to me IS suspicious ls all I&#39;m saying. Then just the photos and the way the did them and didn&#39;t photograph vital evidence is kinda suspect. If you put the pictures in studio there&#39;s not only marks from them making the images a lower quality but there is photoshopping. I don&#39;t believe that food cart sat in the hall for 3 or 4 hours either.  Or that room service cleaned both rooms before the attack..how could he get all that up alone in a matter of hours? While installing cameras and making an improvised breathing device etc etc..Maybe there was a lone shooter but imo there was others who got away somehow. &quot;How to remove a harddrive&quot; was Google searched at what time? During or right after the attack? We&#39;re is it then? Why are there more gloves? And shoes and why did paddocks gloves come off from the crime scene to coroner? Maybe to forensics? But his shoes apparently changed too,along with his known height on his Id..his earlobes don&#39;t match and a few other things. So now not only does paddock not look the same...undeniably jesus campos changed in appearance greatly from the massacre to the ellen interview. For someone so scared and hurt they can&#39;t do an interview with a real reporter he sure didn&#39;t lose sleep or appitite. Idk what happened but leaving out pictures of the room that had vital info is suspect to me...it&#39;s all his identification proving it&#39;s him like someone wanted then to believe it was him. I wonder if they ever even compared prints. I think people died just in the fact it&#39;s easier to kill ppl than hire actors and it goes with the depopulation agenda but there&#39;s something like the guy above said..this smells like a heaping pile of shit. Fbi,cia,military etc all have a code of conduct and you don&#39;t talk or give out info on your people or snitch. I guess 58 lives isnt important enough bc NOBODY is talking...family,homeless,witnesses and L.E. of course... etc etc..some people have a sense when something is off and in this case it&#39;s A LOT of people, that&#39;s no coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree there are a lot of strange things about this incident, however I still haven&#39;t seen anything to convince me there were shots coming from more than the two windows.  Before yesterday, I was convinced that the &quot;door locked from room 135-134 had to be breached was enough, but I had dismissed that the word &quot;locked&quot; was used interchangeably with the word &quot;secured&quot; and a door like that &quot;secures&quot; itself when closed, as there is only a handle on one side.  I&#39;ll entertain more information, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I&#39;m still trying to keep an open mind on this but I feel like dismissing the theory of multiple shooters in the crowd isn&#39;t insane. When I started thinking about it, really there aren&#39;t that many people who&#39;ve reported multiple shooters. And, I&#39;m not just throwing that assertion out there. I did some research and like 70% of people who&#39;ve seen multiple shooters in mass shootings/crimes turn out to be wrong. But, that wasn&#39;t really enough for me. So, I went on YouTube and watched all the videos I could. Honestly, there aren&#39;t that many people who are giving interviews saying this. These channels just keep saying it so we tend to start believing it. I found most interviewers that said they had a witness wouldn&#39;t name them or blacked out their face and changed the voice. Sadly, I also had to admit to myself there&#39;s ppl out there who say things that aren&#39;t true for one reason or another... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Witnesses often report things that turn out to be non-factual.  Hand-up, don&#39;t shoot is a great example.  That beautiful narrative came from Michael Brown&#39;s friend doing an interview with the geniuses in the mass media who took it as fact and ran.  People have died because of that lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I too feel the shooting came from the windows. Still, the multiple Campos’es  had to be one of the most blantant things that strongly reflect this being a big coverup , that plus Ellen felt like a big slap in the face to pretty much anybody expecting any answers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read the entire police account on the Las Vegas pd website.  Some of the things you mentioned are answered in there.  The bullet wound from a rifle was actually a shrapnel wound. He thought he was shot with a B.B. gun.  So it makes sense to me that he wasn’t freaking out about it.  Plus they list the bullet holes in the hallway and tell how many shots were fired down the hall. It was less than the 200 you stated-maybe 70-100?  I don’t remember exactly.  But some things can be explained if you have time to read the info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watch all his videos along with a few others. Since changing to Blackstone after his family was being targeted I was skeptical but I&#39;m still giving him the benifits but...nobody goes on record,there&#39;s always a big lead but doesn&#39;t seem to come or he has huge info he can&#39;t release yet. I like jake but he was being offered huge amounts to report what he was told by a 3rd party when he was being targeted. Then changed his name to Blackstone of all names? I still watch him though and know he is capable of good investigating but if you had to chose your family and kids being at risk daily or changing your name and reporting something else from the truth..the answer is simple. I hope he&#39;s legit but you can&#39;t ever put all your eggs in one basket imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, really fair post here. I watch his videos too. Like you, I am skeptical, but he has posted a few interesting things that keep me on the look out for his videos. </p>

<p>He has high production value in his videos, relatively speaking, and compared to some of the yahoos who post about this stuff, he is much more tolerable and offers a pretty coherent narrative. That being said, his sourcing asks us to take a huge leap of faith. However, I think the road he is going down now with the Bohemian Grove stuff is kind of fascinating, and he does provide some source docs for that, it seems (unless hes altered them). But yeah, I don&#39;t take everything he says as gospel by any means. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found Charlton, Jason Goodman (even though I don&#39;t like him, he&#39;s focused on Vegas), and Laura Loomer (another person I don&#39;t enjoy personally, but props to her on some of these leads) pretty good with this Vegas stuff. Would love if some likeminded reddit folks  wanted to build a big theory that lays out everything we know about the night of the event. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watch Jake, too (and most of the others you mentioned). I DO NOT recommend that guy Charles Watson. He doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t really made up your mind on where this is going (if SP did it, what can be explained, debunked, etc.), there are channels out there that do address that type of thing. </p>

<p>For instance, the Bohemian Grove thing... I saw on a map that these two places are actually pretty far apart and in reality it&#39;s going to be very hard to prove one has to do with the other. Wish he&#39;d go back to Adam Katschke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. I was really on board with him at first but now I&#39;m starting to question where he&#39;s really going with this. And, I was one of the people on here posting his videos initially. Especially when he uncovered the Katschke thing. </p>

<p>I can understand a couple of unnamed sources. But, when it starts to be Witness #14 or whatever, I started getting really skeptical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed and ty for addressing it as las vegas shooting and not &quot;first October&quot;. I&#39;ve been through facts of the preliminary before and eyewitness accounts and nothing adds up. Extra gloves were found,photos doctored abd we didn&#39;t see the main beds in the master suit out of all the pics they took. There&#39;s gotta be a reason bc apparently his id,passport,credit and debit cards along with Mary&#39;s vipx card for the casino was spread out on that bed. No pictures of the bathroom with the prescription of valium..was there valium In his system or was the prescription full or empty?? Why leave out such a big area of importance? Something that couldn&#39;t be photoshop out? We don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s Steven paddock on the ground..things don&#39;t match up and if he was working undercover for the cia,fbi etc etc MSM can&#39;t release identity of undercover agents if it could affect a case or other undercover agents wellbeing. I&#39;m not saying nobody died bc I don&#39;t have evidence of that but I sur know they want us focused on the hotel and not the venue...a whole investigation into the venue should have been done just like his room. Paddock is creamated now so no chance for another independent autopsy. There have been coroners in history that were corrupt as can be and covered for whatever was asked. Making the autopsy match the narritive. What gave the right and why would the fbi delete all phone video people handed over and scrub thier phones?? And not treat the venue the same way paddocks room is being done? They laid tar over all the evidence a day or two later like they knew what happened without a doubt but then the story changed from fbi,lvmpd,mgm the hotel room had items moved and an accidental discharge of 3 rounds in 32-134 by swat. Swat us well trained so what scared him enough to pull the trigger? He&#39;s the only one who didn&#39;t appear in the 60 minutes interview too and supposedly leaked the photos. Child porn the perfect chess move to get people to stop looking into the case and let it die. Nobody wants to be backing a possible predator. The fact Steve had a plane for sometime,and switched up cars a lot upgrading in size is very suspect to me. Signs of possible drug running and if that&#39;s the case how high up the chain did the drugs go? Did he know to much? I&#39;m not ruling out he was a crazy guy that shot up the concert for no real reason and had 23 guns and over 1k rounds of loaded unused ammo and killed himself 45 mins before police even entered the room. He could have taken police out and went out with suicide by cops. Instead he stopped..shot himself and other pairs of gloves and shoes were found along with the room service receipt indicating more than 1 person the night before. 500hrs of video tape but we can&#39;t get any without mgm incriminating himself..the guy wasn&#39;t alone imo. He also had tape over both cameras on his smart phone 🤔 I think that&#39;s a clue...how would he know people can access your camera? Was it a government phone and that&#39;s why? No pic of the &quot;phones or phone charger&quot; tgat was first reported as a military grade charger for some type of communication device...hmm a radio maybe? More people maybe? Look at everything left out of the preliminary and then it starts to add up a little better. Jesus now took the service elevator..he was checking 3-6 different door ajar alarms. Smoke and heat detectors can clearly be seen in the new released pics and they look not tampered with. Was there any key card entry to his room at times we know he was in the rental or his car driving?? Easy question to answer and mgm has all that info. They know for fact if he was alone or not snd what really happened. I could add so much more but at this point I guess just let fbi and lvmpd dig a hole. Tapes will come out in court for the victims families suing mgm I would imagine. A lot of mysteriously strange deaths of eye witnesses claiming to be chased or seeing multiple shooters and seeing people with guns fleeing. There&#39;s more than 1 person saying a Hispanic female warned you are all getting ready to die 45 mins prior and was ejected by security. Was she warning them and kicked out? Or mocking them? They say she was pulling people&#39;s hair while saying that and it almost sounds like she was trying to convince people she was serious and to leave. Idk it a big rabbit hole. If I know a mass shooting is going to to place I would probably be pulling hair abd causing a scene to do all I can to get attention and save lives. They make the woman sound bad but she VERY well may have been tring to do good...who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has to do with the amount of shootings there tends to be, that the attempt to generalize it to a date causes it to stand out less.</p>

<p>The destruction of WTC towers were (from the media accepted result of course) planes hitting a building after getting hijacked. That has been burned into the memories of anyone alive at that time, and there has not been anything close to that since that used airplanes as weapons.</p>

<p>Columbine shooting, aurora theater massacre, Pulse Nightclub shooting, San Bernardino terror attack etc.</p>

<p>Re-branding of the Las Vegas Massacre to it&#39;s date is an effort by Vegas and the casinos to distance the town from the shooting in people&#39;s minds.  It costs them $$ to have the massacre associated with Las Vegas, MGM, and Mandalay Bay.</p>

<p>Here you go: (with apologies for paraphrasing) </p>

<p>Agreed, and thank you for addressing it as Las Vegas shooting and not &quot;first October&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been through facts of the preliminary before and eyewitness accounts and nothing adds up. </p>

<p>Extra gloves were found, photos doctored, and we didn&#39;t see the main beds in the master suit out of all the pictures they took.</p>

<p>No pictures of the bathroom with the prescription of Valium; was there Valium in his system?, or was the prescription full, or empty? Why leave out such a big area of importance. Was there something that could not be photo-shopped out?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s Steven paddock on the ground. Things don&#39;t match up, and if he was working undercover for the CIA, FBI, etc. MSM can&#39;t release identity of undercover agents, if it could affect a case or other undercover agents’ wellbeing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying nobody died, because I don&#39;t have evidence of that, but I sure know they want us focused on the hotel and not the venue...a whole investigation into the venue <em>should</em> have been done just like his room.</p>

<p>Why not treat the venue the same way paddocks room is being done? They laid tar over all the evidence a day or two later, like they knew what happened (without a doubt) -but then the story changed from FBI, LVMPD, management of the hotel room had items moved and an accidental discharge of 3 rounds in 32-134 by SWAT.</p>

<p>SWAT is well trained, so what scared him enough to pull the trigger? He&#39;s the only one who didn&#39;t appear in the 60 minutes interview, and supposedly leaked the photos.</p>

<p>Child porn the perfect chess move to get people to stop looking into the case and let it die. Nobody wants to be backing a possible predator. </p>

<p>The fact “Steve” had an airplane for sometime, and switched up cars a lot upgrading in size, is very suspect to me. Signs of possible drug running - and if that&#39;s the case how high up the chain did the drugs go?</p>

<p>Did he know too much?

<p>He also had tape over both cameras on his smart phone &amp; I think that&#39;s a clue that he knew people could access the camera?</p>

<p>More people, maybe? Look at everything left out of the preliminary and then it starts to add.</p>

<p>Jesus now took the service elevator; he was checking 3-6 different door “ajar” alarms. Smoke and heat detectors can clearly be seen in the newly released pictures, and they appear to be not tampered with.</p>

<p>Did she [also] warn police? What else did she say to security? Did they eject her so people didn&#39;t get nervous and leave? –And, is that then, what set the shooting into motion?</p>

<p>Did Paddock find out someone had warned the crowd? Because it seems he started earlier than planned and wasn&#39;t fully ready….</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vegas shooting was a psychological operation. No one was really killed. They are killing off characters , so they can&#39;t be questioned. they won&#39;t tell you the truth about this, because then the whole operation would be a waste, and there would be no psychological effect. Who? Once The DOD receives the funding from the federal government, then it is a go. The FBI is there to play cover up. It doesn&#39;t really matter what you believe, as long as you believe it was a real shooting, with real death, that is all that matters.</p>

<p>All they did was fool you. They committed no crime. Through the smith Mundt modernization act passed through the ndaa it is completely legal, and funded by the federal government.</p>
