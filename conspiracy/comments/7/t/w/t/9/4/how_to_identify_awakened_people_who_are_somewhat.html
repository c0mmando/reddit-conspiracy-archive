       This may just be my experience, but everyone I’ve met down the rabbit hole either has a threshold of plausibilities that they do not allow themselves to think past (understandable, some theories are most unpleasant to entertain), OR deep down the rabbit hole, I find out that they are practicing Satanists of some sect- who I have far too many fundamental idealogical objections to for either party to get past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a name for big, BIG picture folks in the good/neutral realm? Like Terence McKenna, Aldous Huxley, Orwell, Kubrick?

       I’ve been calling myself “Glinda the Good Witch” lol, I’m sure there’s a better word out there

       Just because those people won't go past a certain threshold in plausibility, doesn't mean they will always be like that. It just takes some people a little longer than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as how to identify others, I don't know of a way except to ask them, "How awake are you?"

       Exactly. Some people just need more time than others. You just have to be there for them when they start seeing past their previous threshold.

       You’re right, I just let myself get a bit bitter from frustration, which is very silly of me. I have been quite thrown off by the number of low key Satanists around, it’s caused a bit of panic deep down. I’ve got a pretty “to each their own” attitude, I just get worried that my fundamental opposites don’t have such an individual autonomy based viewpoint

       Do you mean you personally know some low key Satanists? I hate to tell you, but real Satanists don't let anyone know. They are extremely secretive and even pose as Christians.

       I was in deeper than I should’ve been before I started to get hints to what it was about. I was out when I showed my limits/opposite core.
I found some of those people to be incredibly interesting conversationalists, I’d like to find others who have similar philosophical allure without us hitting a brick wall with our core selves.

       He is an ex-Satanist that now de-Occults people.  Perhaps you would like to hear him speak.  It sounds like you had a similar experience to his.  He realized that all was not as it seemed, then he bailed out.

       I understood your post as asking for "celebrity" awakened people. What I'm saying, assuming this is the correct interpretation, is why look for celebrities when on the net there's so many awesome awakened people who are just not widely known.

       Is the battle an actual match against good and evil, or is it a competition to see which side is better at shepherding/recruiting?
Are good and evil apathetic towards each other, since extremes require their paradoxical opposite?

       The good people live their life, the bad side idolize the good ones in order to trip them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sets up this weird kind of reverse-worship from the bad side spending all their effort to study the good ones and the good ones simply don’t care.
      </p>
      <p>
       They end up spending more energy to fake being good, pretending to be happy, and trying to trip you up then they would if they just did good things in the first place.

       Shamelessly going to post a link to a forum I frequent here. It's gotta a little bit of everything for everybody. More importantly, people there are mostly aware Satanism/Luciferianism isn't a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you'll find some likeminded people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely be cautious of satanism/luciferianism though, they themselves are likely decieved (giving Luciferianism/Satanism that positive new age spin).

       Thank you so much! :) I’m quite aware of both, I find Satanism more childish and annoying than anything else lol. Small minded stuff. Luciferianism seems very different in my mind, the intellectual and conscious sect of that end. I respectfully disagree with them.

       There is a huge conspiracy done by them, to deceive people that just because they can ap, or have an imagination that you are Awake. Truly, i say to you. If you are also awake, but say the battle is won. You have too much invested into yourself, and are open to attack by said entities. Being awake is like becoming a child again yet finding your true father all the bad that you have done have been burned away to nothing and peace returns to you. The only thing left to concern yourself with is to break the bonds with these people and entities and obey the one who has delivered you, for you did not deliver yourself. Most cant see the Gaslight. you are no better off if you do either so let it go.

       The best way to identify woke people is by how much they drink. The more woke they are, the more they drink.  There is probably some kind of math formula for it, but Im too drunk to figure it out.

       Self is God, why not choose your ideologies. Good is boring often times leaves you alone Bad attracts many people who won’t be considered friends. Don’t worry about finding the good ones nor bad ones, life works different in which the enlightened just appear. Be aware before those enlightened were considered satanist or more precisely witches, it didn’t end well at all for them...

       The self is the root of all evil and is nothing to value, IMO. Good and bad are products of personal perception. I can’t get on board with the traditional Christian defined “bad side”as self-worship is the absolute opposite of freedom from the illusion of self. Gnostic Buddhists don’t seem to be as numerous as I would wish aha

       Let me tell you a little story... well the first part at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had always had this fear of falling asleep and i didnt know why until it personified itself. Sitting in its angry chair accusing me, while I was just waiting for sleep to count the day. As i was bout to sleep, it could be breathing down my neck, and i would be frozen with a fear that cant be defined. Days merged and time froze. People seemed very distracted with me almost like they can read my thoughts. After so long without sleep, your inner voice is gone and all you can hear are echos of other peoples voices. Very deep the chamber in witch the echos bounce off of. So loud you just have to get away, but it always fallows. Then it gets really close to what you could be thinking, you dont know because you literally cannot hear yourself think. So you go in search of yourself because your not present, with the past most fitting for this task you break off into two different states of conscience. Never finding my way back to either one, i question my memories! If i have to be brought to this by someone else, not suggesting them for myself, than from who’s perspective am i remembering the present from. The world has become a very different animal and everything seems coincidental yet contradicting at the same time. I was Playing limbo, bar being reality, pushing me lower into my sub conscience, not to fall from that reality and not to fully touch the horrible reality i was actually living in!! I truly believed i had it bad before, that there is no bad or good without understanding we are pushed and pulled into different thoughts from another’s more sinister, or most genuine...Until I meet the Accuser, I am...or am I?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now i cant say i didn’t try at anything to control this. Drugs, more drugs. Psychiatry, legal drugs. Nothing is working. Maybe a little sleep from a harsh anesthetic, ETHER. Very desperate, and foolish of me to believe that something like this could just make me forget. We sleep to forget you know! We leave this place and take on another form, a more pure form in a chaotic realm. You could not remember because there is truly nothing to compare it with this world, but even within this form we still dream!! So beautifully horrified i was to land somewhere in between all this. Its has so many possibility’s, yet confining me outside of what was truly perceived by others as real, until i met her!
      </p>
      <p>
       Necromancy, truly in love with the thought i was dead and that this must be what all them movies they meant for you to see where you cant leave earth until you find rest, but hate this must I stay out of memory since the corruptible can prove that it is not So, Am I looking for anything familiar. My path is my soul, and the ones who are on it are in possession of my mind! At the end of this path was someone very familiar, almost like i had dreamed of her so long ago when i was just a boy. She had me! She always did. Another day was promised to me and i took it as a oath of inheritance. She had possession of this day, and never gave it any thought till i came to claim it. When it started to come full circle, I am no longer bothered by the Accuser. Now I feel...am I the Killer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Resting on this hollowed ground, now she is starting to answer questions. Witch is not getting me any closer but even more inside. The room was sealed off from the outside and it was only her, and the only me! Its starting to make sense and now we are not going anywhere. Somethings are just too strange to believe outright when you are no longer able to communicate through words. The room was filled with memories, past and anything possibly perceived as the future. To the floor i was brought down to, but this couldn’t be where it ends! I must go even deeper. She would be my guide, and we would navigate it together. without her craft, I would have had nothing to compare to and would have fallen completely into madness with no way back. She would gently guide my thought through my own torment and hell, but as these make up this new conscience, my memories are being taken and altered!! She had been in this before, and now she was In full control. The Killer is Me!
      </p>
      <p>
       I break the seal and the bonds are put on like shackles. No matter were i went, or who i would be around it was HER!! I can hear what people where thinking, and at the same time hear her voice telling them what they should forget to remember about everything!! Nobody was really themselves, and they were led by other blind people. I was in it now, i have opened myself up to a world that could not be controlled or comforted by my own senses, there is no way out!! So i go even deeper to hide, and guess who was there waiting for me! Oh how much i dreaded this day, I wished i had never been born. Not even suicide would free me, I know whats on the other side, and its not somewhere you want to be alone!! I am so welcomed to this place, and its so tempting but i know this game, its no less real than what you are bound to be, think, and feel! Now i know there is a fight to be had. I will not leave this world without getting what is coming to me!
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt this wrath overtake me, so i am a target! They all know what im here for and tell me to go back to her if i want this to end. Oh Lord, please protect me from this beast within me, telling me to kill to preserve! I was so scarred, losing all control I put myself into a trance and return to her to try this again. This time she will count on me being more passive...so i come for her envy!
      </p>
      <p>
       What i didn’t expect is her to be so submissive, now i take it all back from her! Now i have my and her memories and thoughts, I’m in her head or so i thought. She is starting to become very attractive, and i know if i take it to the next level i will truly become bound to her. She knows what she is doing...seducing me, trying to bring me back into ego death. I hold out for the longest time, something about making love to a witch seemed like something that i should not do. Sleeping with the enemy! But she had been very busy indeed in their minds while i was on the run. She couldn’t just have me left me with nothing, and she knew i couldn’t leave her without something. Love is so real! Its is something that binds us to a ultimate understanding. With what, you don’t know till you go. Into a world of fake and forgery is were you find out how powerless you are to love. A thief i have become. My heart like a black hole. Now i have come in too close with another black hole. The Pull from this social inertia, had drawn many others into this instability until inevitably we become one, they would all be consumed by the Necromorphic apathy that had preceded us!!

       As we would lay together witch seemed like months and years, time just didnt apply to us. We had a mental capacity for anything. The seal of the room could no longer contain what was being conjured up! Anyone within a certain distance us were almost driven insane with the desolation we projected. Ethereal became Astral. Such a heavy vibration the both of us ministered together, people could feel it, and be swayed by its low commotion. Many turning very hostile as the vibration got even deeper. She tried to teach me how to control them, but i couldn’t understand. Very guarded, i would never fully open up to her. I think that what took me there but left me standing beside myself. This girl was a real deal witch! Now there are no doubts about that now. How long can I keep her on my side before she knows what im trying to hide! How much of a hold does she have on these people? When does projection become introspection. Im fighting this psychic war with no experience what so ever. Paranoia sets in, and in turn you have to become what you fear to survive! What i always feared just so happened to be what saved my life!

       It gets very chaotic from this point on and will take some time to articulate...to be continued

       Ask them if they're aware of how relevant the movies in the Final Destination films are in relation to the individual rather than as a horror movie.

       Always remember: Awakening is an individual process.
If you are actively seeking, you are working towards a certain degree of understanding, as far as understanding is to be considered a state which is achievable to our form of existence. You are slowling lifting your veil of ignorance. 
So does everyone else conscious or unconscious. You can look for other people but almost everyone else will be at another stage on their journey.
