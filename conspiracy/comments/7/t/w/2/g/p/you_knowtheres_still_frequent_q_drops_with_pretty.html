<p>To anyone reading, shit is absolutely fucking going down right now. r/Conspiracy is being astroturfed to fuck. Q is still dropping information, and new things are being put together. Go looking for it. Help the movement. Spread the information. </p>

<p>Friendly neighbourhood reminder: late 2016 leaks about the pizza and U1 and the media being beholden to elites are the key to much of the insanity we see in the world and on this sub lately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the sentiment.. I also WANT it to be true, as many who believe it. If it isn&#39;t happening now, then who else would be able to make it happen. If it isn&#39;t happening now, then it likely will never happen.</p>

<p>So it can be said that we NEED it to be happening. </p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that it is still HIGHLY likely that it is not. No one at a certain level ever goes to jail. Our reality is constructed, and if anything were to come of this, that would also have been constructed. Sad but true.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>yeah that&#39;s it though.  even if a jury would be a circus, it&#39;s what&#39;s needed.  it&#39;s the right medicine for society.  because, frankly, the whole legal system is fucking flawed.  and its failures need to be exposed broadly to everyone in a way that they can no longer make excuses for.  the simple fact that one needs to speak a separate domain specific language to even participate effectively in the court system tells you that it&#39;s not a service that&#39;s available to the common person.  so all and every way the courts can be shown to be flawed - these need to be public and loud.  besides in a case like these, where it&#39;s likely it&#39;s human trafficking and who knows what else, the real punishment is the attention it garners to anyone even remotely related to these acts.  that&#39;s the real deal.  and putting everything behind a mil tribunal really fucking misses the point.</p>

<p>no i disagree.  the scale of this is absurd.  just go watch the recent jordan peterson interview with wendy mesley.  look at how deeply invested in the lie the apparatus of the mainstream media is.  they all know.  they know what&#39;s going on.  that apparatus is everywhere.  it&#39;s in the military.  it&#39;s in the police.  it&#39;s in medicine like you wouldn&#39;t believe.  it&#39;s in schooling.  it&#39;s across the board.  there&#39;s no truth and reconciliation for people like that.  they&#39;ve chosen their outcome.  and they will get it, one way or the other.  if they&#39;re smart they&#39;ll leak now.  but in terms of how deep this goes.  it&#39;s as deep as your worst fears.  it&#39;s systemic.  and a lot of people know, and a lot of people were tolerant of it, lacking the fucking spine to change it or to provide alternate approaches.  we&#39;re dealing with a systemic failure that is as bad as it can be imagined.  there&#39;s only one cure for that kinda bullshit.  it has to be completely expunged.  i&#39;m not advocating violence.  i&#39;m not advocating acts that will lead to the suffering of innocent people.  i&#39;m advocating absolutely for sure a removal of their ability to do more harm.  and if they can&#39;t accept that than maybe blood must be spilled.  and it&#39;s gonna be theirs, for fucking sure.  so it&#39;s time they spilled the beans and break the cycle.   </p>

<p>Probably have to go truth and reconciliation exc3pt for the masterminds they gotta hang. </p>

<p>no i disagree.  the scale of this is absurd.  just go watch the recent jordan peterson interview with wendy mesley.  look at how deeply invested in the lie the apparatus of the mainstream media is.  they all know.  they know what&#39;s going on.  that apparatus is everywhere.  it&#39;s in the military.  it&#39;s in the police.  it&#39;s in medicine like you wouldn&#39;t believe.  it&#39;s in schooling.  it&#39;s across the board.  there&#39;s no truth and reconciliation for people like that.  they&#39;ve chosen their outcome.  and they will get it, one way or the other.  if they&#39;re smart they&#39;ll leak now.  but in terms of how deep this goes.  it&#39;s as deep as your worst fears.  it&#39;s systemic.  and a lot of people know, and a lot of people were tolerant of it, lacking the fucking spine to change it or to provide alternate approaches.  we&#39;re dealing with a systemic failure that is as bad as it can be imagined.  there&#39;s only one cure for that kinda bullshit.  it has to be completely expunged.  i&#39;m not advocating violence.  i&#39;m not advocating acts that will lead to the suffering of innocent people.  i&#39;m advocating absolutely for sure a removal of their ability to do more harm.  and if they can&#39;t accept that than maybe blood must be spilled.  and it&#39;s gonna be theirs, for fucking sure.  so it&#39;s time they spilled the beans and break the cycle.   </p>
