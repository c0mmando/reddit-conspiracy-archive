       I think we've basically exhausted everything there is to say about a memo written by Nunes. Unless the report it's based on is released, we're just going to see the GOP spin on the facts. Dems will put together their own memo, which will be the Dem spin on the facts. Without the full report, we won't know more in five days than we already do now.

       Well we've speculated, but without yet seeing the actual memo I'd hardly say conversation about it has been exhausted.

       Schiff looked scared, didn't he? Talking about how good it was for Trump and bad for the FBI/DOJ. Wray see's the memo last night, McCabe's out today. I don't think spin does that. For those of us paying attention, it's just the beginning... =)

       I'd still like to see the Dem memo and the full report. No one that doesn't watch Fox News is going to believe a Nunes written memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nunes has been working for Trump for a while now. His words aren't worth much.

       I'd like to see the dem memo as well.  Don't need to go making insults at people telling them they watch Fox news and believe bullshit.  Your dems are just as capable of bullshit and do partake. If you go around saying this memo is bullshit without even seeing it than how can you expect the other side of politics to believe a memo released by the dems is going to be the facts that set the story straight? Plugging your ears and saying nah nah nah my sides right and your sides wrong isn't going to get us anywhere.

       I don't believe the Dems version will set people straight. I said that above. I believe both memos will be bullshit spin. We need the full release to know what's really going on.

       I'm sure that reporters will "hear" some of the things that are in the Dem memo, just as they "heard" about things that were in the Nunes memo, but it's not going to have the same impact unless it's released in full like the Nunes memo will be.

       I'm sure the repubs have just opened a Pandora's box. We'll see chunks of leaks coming out shortly. Ted Leiu already hinted at it saying it's pretty much a complete letdown

       No, not everything in the memo will be false.  I don't believe I said that.  The memo will be cherrypicked and misleading.  It's author has zero credibility, and the fact that the committee voted no on releasing the Democrat memo, means that the committee cares more about selling their version of events than actual transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if you believe the leaks and rumors about the memo, the memo says that the FBI used the Steele Dossier in order to obtain a FISA warrant in the Russia investigation without divulging that the Hillary campaign played a role in the formation of the dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaks also say that the memo doesn't say a word about all of the other intelligence used to obtain that FISA warrant.

       It's shit like that.

       I feel this is the problem. The left will never believe the memo, the right will never believe Russian collusion- either side can throw as much evidence as they want at the other - and neither side will ever believe it. But what would I know just a lowly Aussie just watching Americans tear themselves apart at the seams.
      </p>

       I wonder what it will be that swings the debate and which angle is correct. The thing is. Will we ever actually "know" ?

       That's a very long answer type question, because it's a very complicated and tangled mess of a story.  The problem is that we may actually "know" one way or the other one day, the facts at some point will likely come out, but getting the American public to believe a consensus around it is incredibly difficult because basically none of the parties involved in this story (Trump, Clinton, Republicans, Democrats, the American media, the F.B.I., etc.) have exactly unimpeachable integrity.  They all have proven instances in their past, even their recent past, where they have lied, or distorted facts, or covered up wrongdoing, etc.  So, if everyone is a liar, you can easily see how a person could choose to believe whatever they want to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the whole Russia scandal, comes down to this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Did Russia hack American political institutions, such as the DNC and Podesta?
       </li>
       <li>
        Did Russia use that information and other propaganda in an attempt to influence voters?
       </li>
       <li>
        Was there a transactional relationship between Russia and the Trump campaign in exchange for this assistance if it did indeed happen?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Did that information and propaganda, if it happened, change the outcome of the 2016 election?
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The left, in order to achieve a public consensus on the Russia story have to show that the answer to all four of these questions is unequivocally "yes."  All the right has to do is show that the answer to one of these questions is "no" or at minimum, cast a shadow of doubt in the minds of the American public that one of the answers could be "no."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the answer to questions #1 and #2 are provable and will eventually be "known" in time.  #3 is difficult.  It's very hard to prove a transactional relationship under American law, but even that is possible.  #4 is impossible.  How can you quantify how much influence Russia had on changing people minds about who they were going to vote for?  How can you as an individual say that this facebook ad, or this newsfeed, or what have you was the thing that caused me to vote for Donald Trump, or against Hillary Clinton (polls showed that the #1 reason Americans chose the candidate they voted for was to vote against their opponent.  Most Trump voters are actually anti-Clinton voters, and vice versa)?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want me to prognosticate on how this all ends, I'd say that Trump survives the investigation, if only because his party won't turn on him and who knows how the 2020 election will go?  Trump is historically unpopular, but never underestimate the Democrats ability to make a catastrophe out of an advantage.

       I find it fascinating we are at a point with a full public conspiracy that has two sides like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like yourself, and others I am sure, excited to read to memo to learn more about the 'deep state theory' and alleged FISA violations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people like myself, who are excited to see it to show how incomplete and biased in info is in an attempt to discredit an ongoing investigation into conspiracy and corruption.

       Both sides fully believing they are right and that shit is about to go down.

       I think different parties/groups can collectively be right/wrong about something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because a particular group can be biased toward thinking a certain way does not mean they are incapable of being right about something like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As in, Democrats can still be bought and paid for while being correct in the fact that Donald Trump colluded with Russia.
      </p>

       Just like Donald trump can still be a total douche while saying we need a major infrastructure reform and being correct.

       At this point, knowing what the public knows, I do not think it is possible to fully make that assertion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is evident that he does not take the threat seriously, has failed to implement steps to defend against outside influence in elections and has never really spoke against the country as he would do to similar powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly there are already filed charges and multiple agencies confirming interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true question is:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Trump just some guy, REALLY focused on making america great again. Completely ignoring the evidence that there is a legitimate campaign to intervene in public opinion and sway voters and just thinking there is more important shit to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he financially indebted to the Russians from years of documented and failed business dealings involving shady shell corporations and mafia financing. Which is corroborated on the record by his own son and multiple financial documents, that also appear to be the subject of a current special council investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       THE REAL bombshell IMO is the the more recent revelations about Dutch intellegence having access to cozy bear. If that is true??? That would have given both intelligence agencies access to who is in there and being able to track them and figure out the funding and directive operative source of the operation.

       That's the best part about using RES tags. Sure people can abuse them and help further increase their own echo chamber, but I use it to simply tag real people that are here for discussion, and trolls that I see all the time just trying to derail conversations. My threads are all filled with green and red usernames, and it makes wading through all the bull shit much easier and enjoyable.

       I never said anything about agreeing. Personally I don't buy the whole Russia narrative to begin with. I simply judge users based on, are you able to have a rational and polite exchange of ideas, or not. If I disagree with you, even better.

       You just said "Obstructing an investigation even when you're innocent and the investigation was a joke to begin with is still illegal"

       No it isn't

       If I accuse you of being a pedophile rapist murderer and an investigation was opened to look at you but the investigation was opened based on a lie and falsities I WOULD BE THE ONE IN TROUBLE. NOT YOU.

       If there was enough credible information on me being a pedophile rapist murderer, and an investigation was opened and I paid off potential witnesses, or used my power in a position to intimidate people to not testify, despite not being one. It's still illegal for me to tamper with a criminal investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the crime shifts from potential rapist murderer pedophile to trying to impede the investigation.

       The 5 stages of grief and loss are: 1. Denial and isolation; 2. Anger; 3. Bargaining; 4. Depression; 5. Acceptance (&lt;--if we're lucky). People who are grieving do not necessarily go through the stages in the same order or experience all of them but i think any rational human being see's this for what it is.

       The issue there is that it has been seen by so many republicans and democrats at this point, just not the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if there was ANYTHING in there, there would have been even more screaming about it. Yeah, at first it was REALLY loud and people were trying to get the memo out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But once a few democrats and less "core" conservatives saw it, the memo died down a LOT. Now, it is at the point where it will be released, and my guess...
      </p>
      <p>
       It will confirm there was continued surveillance of the administration/close people to it, visa FISA warrants that are argued are based on false pretenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like how a lot of people are saying "The manafort/flynn violations had nothing to do with the trump administration" and tried to take them out of context. when in reality the more we know, the more it connects it to the overall conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO the memo will just show the people who had warrants issues and try to say it is invalid and then BOOM more info will come out that will confirm the opposite. just like every one of these 'bombshells' before this

       Ok, but that is different. The accusation is the Dems illegally or unethically used the DoJ to spy on Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that isn't true it doesn't matter if the collusion is real or not. Just like it doesn't matter if Benghazi or Whitewater produced charges. It is worth investigating.

       They have been investigating for a year. They have found nothing that says Trump colluded. Nothing. At all. Regarding the Dems, there's more evidence they conspired against Trump using the DOJ and FBI than there is Trump colluding with Russia to get elected. Investigate all you want. When it's proven Trump didn't collide then let's drop it and move on. Dems lost, get over it

       Oh it would have leaked by now. Everything negative against Trump leaks. Hell, his son gave closed door testimony and it leaked before he was even done. Adam Schiff leaks like a sieve. There's no huge piece of evidence Mueller is holding up his sleeve. I feel sorry for those who believe Mueller will save the day. We've been on this for a year and nothing has come forward.

       But Carter Page actually made those trips to Russia and he could not explain the reasons why he went in his testimony to Congress. In retrospect it's clear that the FISA warrant was justified. Donald Trump's own Justice Dept continued them when he was in office!

Evidence that shows Trump conspired with Putin  to win the election.Why would he have some low level nobody handling something like that? Please show me. Once and for all.

       is that Carter Page brought a recording of Trump to Russia for Putin on which Trump offered to change the US policy on Russia, Crimea and the Sanctions in exchange for help winning the election.

       for Donald Trump's claim that Obama had "his wires tapped". Well, it turns out that Mensch was right about Carter Page going to Russia and she was right about the the Obama DOJ obtaining a FISA warrant to spy on Page. So, it's still possible that Mensch was right and that this tape may exist somewhere. Or the tape was destroyed and all we have are these leaked confessions.

       Evidence I said. Not allegations. I've heard allegations Obama was born In Kenya. Then he brought out evidence and ended those allegations. You can allege anything. Show me proof. None of what you said is proof. It's been a year. It's time to shit or get off the pot. Dems want this to last years. There may be a tape of Bigfoot rapping with Biggie Smalls. Until I see that tape it means nothing. All you have are might haves or could haves.

       What evidence are you demanding to prove collusion? Do you know of any organized crime that was prosecuted with hard evidence? Do you think criminals are so dumb that they would leave a paper trail, or emails or recordings of their crimes? Even if that evidence did exist, do you think Trump's legal team would turn it over? Organized crime is prosecuted with witness testimony. Flipping low level criminals on lesser charges. We know that Flynn, Papadopoulos and (if rumors are true) Gates have flipped. What we don't know yet us what testimony they gave to Meuller in return for their plea. We know that Team Trump was open to receiving help from Russia, that they offered Russia Sanctions relief and that they hid, and lied repeatedly about their contacts with Russia.

       Hacking the DNC, DCCC, Clinton Campaign and the Election Boards in 21 States to steal information on voters and attempt to compromise election officials is a crime. It's theft and its espionage. Accepting anything of value, including material and information, from a foreign government is a violation of Campaign Finance laws, not to mention that the "materials" were stolen. The legal definition of "aiding and abetting" a crime is knowing that it was occurring and expressing ones support for it, which Trump did when he declared his support for Russian hacking during the campaign and said publicly that Russia would be rewarded for finding Clinton's missing emails. Then there is the evidence of money laundering, and Russian money being washed into the Trump Campaign coffers. And the fact the Flynn offered Sanctions relief to Russia is itself a violation of those very Sanctions.

       So Trump is guilty of aiding and abetting cause he said " Hey Russia release her emails" are you kidding right now?  You failed to mention he said the media would Reward Russia. Not himself. Jesus, is this is what you're leading with. Aiding and abetting?  The dossier was almost certainly comprised of info given to Steele by Russian sources. That's a fact.  Hillary PAID FOR IT that info. To her, It had value. She then accepted it. By your very logic she's a criminal, right?

       No, and I'm not sure why this is so hard for Trumpettes like yourself to understand... opposition research is legal. First hand communication between Steele and his sources is legal. Sourcing oppo research from people in Russia (who the fuck else would disclose events that happened in Russia, except Russians???) is legal. What's ILLEGAL is hacking into your opponents servers to steal their private communications. That is exactly what Nixon was impeached for, except his goons physically broke into DNC headquarters to steal files. Nixon didn't actually do the breaking-in himself. Conspiring with others to commit a crime is also illegal. That is the criminal definition of "conspiracy". It is proven that Russia committed crimes against the US. What did the President know and when did he know it?

Are you for real? You'd be using that as your example of collusion. You'd be crying for impeachment. So Trump hacked into Clinton's campaign? Show me evidence of that. What a claim you're making there. Trump hacked his opponent?

       Yes! If the only thing that Trump had done was hire a firm to collect research within laws of this country, than there would be nothing to investigate! What Hillary and the DNC did was legal! The Benghazi investigation lasted FOUR YEARS. The Classified Email investigation lasted SIX YEARS. You Trumpettes are acting like crybabies because the Meuller investigation has barely gone on for ONE YEAR. Get over it, and dig in, because this isn't going away. And you won't be seeing the evidence for along time. Flynn's sentencing hearing was just postponed again today, to sometime after May. Another sign that Flynn is cooperating and won't be sentenced until Meuller has everything that he needs.

       You're a joke. So if Trump hired a firm to get info on Clinton and that info came from Russia you'd be okay with it? What if Trump then took that info and passed it off to the FBI as legit intelligence and the FBI then got a warrant using that phony intel to spy on Clinton. You would be okay with that? Yeah fucking right. Trump's son had a meeting about adoption and Dems were crying Treason! If Trump bought false info from Russia in order to use against Clinton to win an American election I have a feeling you would be singing a different tune. In fact, I think you would be crying COLLUSION. Ironic. Theres more proof Clinton colluded with Russia than Trump did. Lol You cannot be taken seriously arguing any differently.

       I said I wasn't a Trump supporters during the campaign but have come around since his election. The way the Dems and the media have been acting is embarrassing. The media literally makes up.negative shit to use against Trump. Every one of these false stories cut against Trump. They never have to retract a positive story about Trump. Why is that?

       5.4% projected growth this quarter. No denying that. Obama never even got 3% GDP in 8 years. This is Trump's economy. Stock market breaking records.. Better economy and more money in voters pockets from this tax break. These are the things people really care about. Not exaggerating crowd sizes. Nobody cares about that. If they did , they wouldn't have elected Trump

       I agree. Republicans care more about giving money to the 1% and their globalist donors. I feel sorry for the suckers who think that a temporary 2% income tax cut while giving a permanent 14% cut to corporations is good for Americans.

       For one you can't indict a sitting potus. So you would have to impeach him first. Good luck with that. Mueller will NEVER seek an indictment against Trump. There's zero evidence that Trump broke any laws. Mueller isn't hiding anything up his sleeve
 We would have heard about it a looooong time ago if so. Adam Schiff leaks like hell. You sound desperate. Plus with this memo coming out soon. Dems are scrambling with desperation to block it's release. They are afraid of something. Wonder what it could be?

       I can see if Trump's opponent was a saint bit it wasn't. It was Hillary Clinton. She's a known liar. She's incompetent. Scandal and corruption follow her everywhere she goes. Document missing, emails erased in the face of the courts. The media catered to her. Helped her in debates. Were paid to write fluff pieces. The DNC hamstring the primaries for her. She paid for phony intel. She covered up sexual abuse by her husband and as we've  found out, her staffers.Her supporters have no room to talk. The most qualified candidate ever? That's laughable.

       I'm serious man. I WAS NOT a Trump supporter when he announced. I became a Trump defender after watching this media driven hatchet job on him. It's shameful what the Dems have said and done to a duly elected president.  I believe alot of people feel the way I do. The media is out of control. They straight up lie. Why is it all the fake news that's been proven as fake is ALWAYS negative towards Trump. There's never a positive story about Trump the media then had to retract and correct It's always thinly sourced hatchet pieces. Why is that?

       The media hates Trump I don't deny there is a frenzy. I ignore most the BS stuff. Golf, two scoop, and all that crap doesn't matter.

       That shit is similar to the crap Republicans talked about with Obama and his Dijon mustard and tan suits.

       The stuff like reports how much money Trump is making off his Presidency.

       Thee difference between you, and people who understand what is going on, is that there is a wealth of evidence already at our fingertips that neatly summarizes a fact pattern that has already been revealed by the likes of IG Michael Horowitz, Obama appointee Adm.

       The memo is a small part in a larger narrative. You should look up who Michael Horowitz is, and what he has been doing the last year. You should also look into who U.S. Attorney John Huber is,
       <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/03/29/us-attorney-for-utah-huber-probing-gop-raised-concerns-about-the-fbi-surveilling-trump-aide-ignoring-clinton-uranium-ties/">

       You would have to be

       Because of the entire fake news narrative around the memo pushed by Russians and bots, it sent Republicans into a hysterical fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they wanted to do a special prosecutor but we all know that wasn't going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is the best they could come up with.

       Also, there is a huge difference between them

       this when it has nothing to do with Trump at all.

       It couldn't be more obvious that you just slurp up the narrative the media is giving you right now. I appreciate that you think Sessions doesn't know what he is doing. I'm sure a lot of your ilk believe the same thing. Can't wait to see this unfold.

       Because it appears as though you can't even answer those basic questions. If you could, you would not be asking about a "refusal" to release a report. Nobody is "refusing" anything.

       You honestly read those FBI texts and House Committee reprts and still believe FBI was npt complicit in the paid for HRC and DNC cronies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, i'm shocked they don't have epstein shit on Trump but the fact that for 2 years they have produced no shred of malice from Trump other than some crude comments and women paid to come forward for having explicit relations with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       as conpsoracy teoris, am shocked... but what's beginning to more evidence is the Bureau was used bring a federal investigation with  a fake dossier against Trump incase HRC lost as insurance policy. That evidence is plain to see now.

       I am much more concerned with the findings than two shitty investigators who were removed.

       Except one of those "shitty investigators" specifically altered the announcement that no charges would be filed against Clinton to remove a reference to "gross negligence" which would have been a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       That shitty investigator participated in a cover-up of crimes discovered by the FBI, that the FBI chose not to prosecute.
      </p>
      <p>
       It now has become apparent that the shitty agent had a very strong motive to cover up those crimes.

       First of all people act like Comey didn't approve the changes.

       It's not like Strzok snuck in and changed it while Comey or other senior investigators had no clue.

       Second changing your statement to remove a legal term is the proper thing to do when you aren't going to use that term.

       Some Republicans hired an organisation to carry out opposition research against Trump. When Trump became the nominee, they stopped funding that research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the Democrats hired the same organisation to carry out opposition research against Trump.
       <em>
        Then
       </em>
       that organisation hired an ex-British spy to compile a dossier on Trump.

       The Republicans had absolutely nothing to do with the "dossier".

       Agreed. While I fall into the narrative that the other shoe is about to drop on the Democrats, I can't help but be in awe over how the entire country has been suspended in conspiracy for the last year. Two completely incompatible, highly involved, deeply reinforced conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       For myself, I generally accept that there is no situation under which I will know the full truth, and that I am wrapped up in a narrative. This does not change that I believe this narrative; but it does temper the emotion that I put into the narrative. I think this is the most rational thing a person can do.

       The 'ongoing investigation' into alleged Russian collusion was a ruse from the start. The goal was to get the independent investigator to essentially set up a parallel Justice Department and to prevent Trump from having the right to govern that he is allowed by being elected President. Even worse, it was a 'soft coup' attempt, to try to remove him from office, as a last-ditch effort to undo the election results by Obama holders and other deep state DNC loyalists. It's corruption of the highest order and we should all be grateful that it's being exposed.

       Oh, in what way has the special council stopped Trump from governing?
      </p>
      <p>
       He has passed more EOs than any president in decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has signed the few laws congress has sent him. He failed to pass the Russia sanctions something that even just the pressure of the investigation should cause. He has played plenty of golf. What is the council preventing?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a recent conversation, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, raised concerns about a forthcoming inspector general report examining the actions of Mr. McCabe and other senior F.B.I. officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, when the bureau was investigating both Hillary Clinton’s email use and the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia. In that discussion, according to one former law enforcement official close to Mr. McCabe, Mr. Wray suggested moving Mr. McCabe into another job, which would have been a demotion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead, the former official said, Mr. McCabe chose to leave.

       I'm excited to read it but i'm not expecting anything more than desperate fan-fiction from Devin Nunes.

       This is the same guy that ran to the WH to tip off trump about details surrounding the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'll be interesting nonetheless. Political theater at its finest. And just wait till the leaks come out that will fact check it too. This could make or break the investigation into trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... Cuz if this at all falls even a little short of its hype, ohhh boy. We'll have no better proof that the repubs are hiding something BIG and they're running defense for trump. You don't pull a stunt like this without consequences for falling short or yanking people's chain

       The 5 stages of grief and loss are: 1. Denial and isolation; 2. Anger; 3. Bargaining; 4. Depression; 5. Acceptance (&lt;--if we're lucky). People who are grieving do not necessarily go through the stages in the same order or experience all of them but i think any rational human being see's this for what it is.

       Some Republicans hired an organisation to carry out opposition research against Trump. When Trump became the nominee, they stopped funding that research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the Democrats hired the same organisation to carry out opposition research against Trump.
       <em>
        Then
       </em>
       that organisation hired an ex-British spy to compile a dossier on Trump.

      <p>
       The Republicans had absolutely nothing to do with the "dossier".

       If there was enough credible information on me being a pedophile rapist murderer, and an investigation was opened and I paid off potential witnesses, or used my power in a position to intimidate people to not testify, despite not being one. It's still illegal for me to tamper with a criminal investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the crime shifts from potential rapist murderer pedophile to trying to impede the investigation.
