      <p>
       Last December I started building these things called crystal power cells attributed to being discovered by John K Hutchison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, they have been doing what they are claimed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Continually output power, day after day after day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am using three as night lights.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are always on.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of them is the eight cell stainless steel core and copper design, that was featured in the annotated photo guide found at the bottom of this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       The others I have made since then are becoming much more powerful as I come to understand the process and gain practice in creating this technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/e1Rcfo9.jpg">
        Here is one that is made of only five cells and outputs 2.3 volts under load.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The amperage output varies according to the load attached to it, it seems, which is strange, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not very electronically savvy, and some have asked me to find the internal resistance but I have not done so yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I am not experienced with electronics, I know something good when I see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I can build a light that seemingly does not go out, I do not need a bunch of calculations to tell me it is a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do want to know exactly how they work, and I am sure there will be comments just screaming that they are plain old galvanic cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if they are galvanic, why then, if they last longer than any battery we can buy, are they not in clocks, or stacked in light posts for clean light at night?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this tech seemingly so hated by the "scientific community"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was banned from the technology sub just for mentioning them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wether or not they are galvanic is irrelevant if it is superior technology to what we use now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do yourself a favor and build one.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can watch what should not be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is enlightening.

      <p>
       P.S.S To those who have seen these posts before, DO NOT use cyanoacrylate glue, it degrades the cell over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I created a cell with a carbon core. The voltage was about one volt, but the amperage seemed lower than usual. I do not recommend carbon.

       No, not at all. This cat is crowing about a self sufficient energy source that is ground breaking. But, in fact, it's not. A dinky little battery is one thing, but he can't make it do anything of significance. Additionally, if it
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       ground breaking, he would have been visited by some guys in suits making him "an offer he can't refuse". The big companies that profit from making us fools pay for energy are not going to sit still for some joe blow to take their profits away.

       Yes, they are a good start. But they

       aren't a truly self sufficient source.

       I thought so too at first. Especially the copper and zinc plated bolt just screams galvanic cell. The difference here is the electrolyte solution isn’t a solution but instead crystalline, which are not electrically conductive. Salt water is conductive but table salt is not, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be a combination of galvanic potential and possibly some sort of semi-conductive rock salt, or even a new type of air-battery, which could be huge. Forget the electrodes here for they are common and well studied, I want to know more about  the mixture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest issues with batteries today are their degradation from charging discharging cycles. Dendritic-solids build up around the electrodes preventing the ions from reaching them and transferring their charge, in a process called “diffusion limited aggregation”.

       Magnesium Sulfate is hygrscopic, coordinating 5x H2O per MgSO4 molecule.  I assume that is what makes the salt mixture electrolytic.

        The amperage output varies according to the load attached to it, it seems, which is strange, I think.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No. A load has a resistance, which changes the physics of the whole circuit, as load and device circuit make up a voltage divider.
      </p>

        I am not very electronically savvy, and some have asked me to find the internal resistance but I have not done so yet.

      <p>
       To calculate the change in amperage caused by the load, you need to know the resistance of the load and the resistance of the device circuit.

      <p>
       Good for you. I appreciate your experiments and concede that you might have found something. But others will need a bit more convincing with numbers. It would be good if you could tell us how much current your stuff is drawing, and for how long it's been on. That in turn gives us the capacity expended so far. Once that number goes beyond run-of-the-mill galvanic batteries, people will start listening to you.

       Even without the oceans the earth is very spherical. The difference between the height of Everest and the depth of the Mariana Trench is ~18,842 meters. The radius of the Earth is ~6,371,000 meters. This means that the Earth is within 0.3% of being a perfect sphere. By comparison, a golf balls and baseballs fluctuate by ~0.6%

       I agree he is scientifically illiterate but the original discoverer, also a hoaxer, may have accidentally stumbled upon something important and underestimated its importance and moved on to other shit claims. A solid electrolyte between electrodes is a big deal. He said as hard as crystal... which is what caught my very expert eye.

       He also encapsulated it away from air... water degradation was ruining its performance so not an air battery. I am some who can legitimately research this and I might try now as its simple enough to do, however, i am going to do googling first as I believe this has been debunked and havent really looked yet.

       It isn’t that simple. The electrolyte is solid not a solution as typically used. This is more along the lines of an air battery or semiconductive rock salt. It’s the mixture that is important here, not the copper or zinc electrodes.

       I think it is converting heat, its not galvanic. Here is a much simpler experiment than the one I proposed before:
      </p>
      <p>
       shine a lamp onto it very near to the crystal so that it heats up. Measure the output current. If it the power source is piezoelectricity, then the current should increase.

       Peizos dont produce continual amperage though, especially not DC. Once you discharge a piezoelectric the voltage is gone until you unpress it and get the opposite voltage. They are used as bbq lighters for a quick spark.

       I did. Its a Hutchinson battery corroding the metal to create this effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will last a long time but not indefinitely and its trading the metal at the cost of this. I read your link

      <p>
       "The power output is only at 1 milli Watt at 23 degrees Celsius, but considering the time and the total energy output since 1999 of approx. 150 watt hours, we assume that possible electrochemical effects have stopped a long time ago and that the electric energy, which is being produced today, has no electrochemical origin. It may be mentioned, that 150 watt hours at that size means, that this crystal cell has far excelled the best modern commercial batteries. Here it also has to be considered, that a part of the weight is due to the aluminium cylinder and may be subtracted."

       It doesnt need air. Its solid. It is self charging. It works using the same metal for both electrodes. There is something novel here in its infancy. It should be investigated not hated. It’s not violating physics like he claims. We just dont fully know whats going on. Its not zeropoint or whatever, but a solid state battery that recharges over time would be a big industry savior.

       Op, I believe you made an air battery. Despite your best intentions, i dont believe you yet that it is more than that. I sent you a personal message which describes a series of simple experiments to prove its differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) use the same metal for both electrodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) make it under argon, or let it self-charge under vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it still works without air, and without galvanic potential, you have discovered something serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one but not the other you have either a chemical cell or an air battery. Im guessing the latter because of the solid crystal. It is not porous to the human eye but oxygen and other atmospheric elements can move in and out. You should research air batteries further.

       LEDs don't need much power, you can run them for ages on a coin cell.   Your cell is the size of like 50 coin cells so I would expect it to last ages.   Also, it's massive and all you can run on it is a tiny LED, is this really supposed to be impressive?  Light an incandescent bulb and get back to us...

       You need to draw more current than an LED, do that and record the amount of Amps/Voltage over time and then get back to us. Currently you have a swimming pool full of water (your battery) and you have a pinhole trickle of water leaving it (your LED). The reason you don't see the level of water in your pool going down is that the amount of water leaving is extremely small. If you were to put a bigger hole in the pool (motor/resistor/heater/etc.) and then measured that flow (amperage) and the height of the water (voltage), you would see how much power is in your battery.

       Like I said in another comment this is 100% a primitive solid state battery. It was invented in the 50's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hutchison probably read one of the books ( from the 60's and 70's )  that are referenced in
       <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a176283.pdf">
        this document from 1987
       </a>
       , found the instructions and  renamed it to crystal power cell and attributed perpetual energy to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the document (from 1987) states that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Little commercialization has occurred, but in the speciality areas the solid state batteries may be quite useful for highly stable, long life, low power applications."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Commercialization has been limited because of performance and cost factors
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It also states that batteries are used for pacemakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still quite interesting though.
      </p>
      <p>
       These type of batteries are now heavily R&amp;D'd to replace lithium batteries.

       I never said that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A new class of solid state electrolyte was developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1990s, which was later incorporated into certain thin film lithium-ion batteries, which is considered to be a form of solid state battery.[7]
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2013, researchers at University of Colorado Boulder announced the development of a solid-state lithium battery, with a solid composite cathode based upon an iron-sulfur chemistry, that promised a higher energy capacity.[8]
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2014, researchers at Sakti3 announced a solid state electrolyte lithium-ion battery, and claimed higher energy density for lower cost.[9] The company was acquired by Dyson in the following year.[10]
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2017, John Goodenough, a co-inventor of Li-ion batteries, unveiled a new solid-state battery, using glass electrolytes and an alkali-metal anodeconsisting of lithium, sodium or potassium, which is not possible with conventional batteries.[11]

       The horizon is supposed to appear level, and it does.  It's a fallacy to suggest that the horizon should appear to curve like the limb does,  the horizon is always horizontal.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a flat earth, the sky would always subtend 180 degrees.  On a round earth, the sky subtends more the higher you go.  It turns out that observations of the horizon match the round earth prediction,
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the horizon is not supposed to appear curved.  It's a dishonest argument to claim that a level horizon proves a flat earth.

       I think it's cool and I might try it.  You should check out "earth batteries" you probably have everything you need to make one.  Tesla believed there was free endless energy everywhere, don't give up.

       it isnt irrelevant if something is an infinite source of energy or just another metal ion battery, they would be totally different in fact.  This is both possible and well known.

       i think that it is great that you take an interest in the physical world, terrific really. AND i even think that there are sources of energy that are
       <em>
        functionally
       </em>
       (not actually) unlimited, which we could explore.

       There is no self charging part, he uses a lot of copper for his anode, which contain a lot of electrons. There is nothing new about 'his' design, this is a diy solid state battery..
