       OP, if you have spent time carefully sorting and linking to all of these then I have to applaud you for your effort and what you would say is research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call me narrow minded or whatever but the Flat Earth is just not something I can even start to take seriously.

       But again, if you have put this together yourself then I commend you on your efforts. Have an upvote for that.

       The point is being able to look into an idea and its supporting evidence to see if it works or not. Rejecting anything outright means that your mind is closed. It's a good test.

       You have to actually form an argument,
      </p>
      <p>
       Expecting someone to review 100 citations of possibly complete bullshit is not on the 'other' to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to argue the value and variable weight of the topic, and how those sources relate to that argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could post 100 videos about big-foot. But that does not mean anyone who does not waste time watching them is bias, nor is there any argument made, so what is actually being asked of the conscious?
      </p>
      <p>
       To simply consider flat-earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most have. They consider it, based on the rest of their information available, to know its bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to convince people to invest time into learning what you feel is important to know; as they are regulating their mind by learning what they feel is [more] important.

       Science has proven the earth is round many times over. We test it every time we launch something into space, use GPS, look at other planets and stars, and make extremely accurate predictions about terrestrial and celestial events. If you can't perform those same feats with a flat earth model then it is not worth considering.

       Well the conspiracy is that NASA is faking images of a “round earth” so the only “flat/dome” earth pictures are depicted in ancient societies so they are easily dismissed by most. But an additional area that flat earth is depicted is in the Bible itself. Genesis 1:7 or Job 37:18.

       There is nowhere in the Bible that describes a spherical Earth. Some passages directly describe it as flat, immovable, and covered, and others allude to it being flat. Other belief systems in different parts of the world and throughout history have also described a flat, covered earth. It was't until about 500 years ago before the spinning globe theory was pushed in mainstream science by sun-worshiping occultists. That theory has been put into question since flight and video have been invented, and with no evidence to support the theory since.

       Every society since the ancient greeks and even before have known the earth is round. All it takes is watching the night sky and paying attention to the patterns of the sun and the moon. Once the greeks invented geometry that confirmed it.

      <p>
       Seriously, basic trig and geometry are enough to prove the earth is round. All of science only works if the earth is round. That's not taking anyone's word for it. That's plugging in the numbers and doing the calculations yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the world is so obviously flat, then why can't flat earthers come up with a consistent model?

       I do indeed, and their movements are more evidence that we are not on a spinning ball, but that the things we see in the sky are moving, not us. Funny that they move on a flat plane (the ecliptic), does that make ball earthers flattards as well?

       Very flimsy then. It all only works if gravity is what they say it is, but even then, they have no idea what it is, only that heavy things fall (the word
       <em>
        gravity

       This is about proving that the existing scientific model is fatally flawed in numerous ways. Everything else is just theory, and theory we may not even be able to prove for several reasons: they won't let us circumnavigate the earth north/south, they won't let us have an expedition on Antarctica. Different people have different theories on what earth may be, or what shape it is, and offer their own proof. There won't be consensus.

       At the absolute latest, we know that Plato and Aristotle taught that the earth was a sphere (~350-400 B.C.). Also, Eratosthenes is the father of geography and wrote a series of books with that title and attempted to map the known world

       Weight has no meaning without gravity. Even if you wanted to reject the term "gravity", you would still have to come up with an explanation for the force that absolutely, positively exists

       But we have a working model for a round earth that we can use to predict events, send things into space, navigate the world, and relay communication signals. Why can't the flat earth model do the same if the round earth model is so flawed?

       You don't have to go to Antarctica to go to the southern hemisphere and see that the night sky is completely different than it is in the north.

       Meanwhile the entirety of the intellectual and scientific community disagreed, well into Copernican times, when his theory was at first rejected by most astronomers and scientists. Going back in time to find someone who agrees with your theory today, does not prove your theory. Someone preaching the flying spaghetti monster today may be looked at a thousand years from now in the same way you look at Plato's thoughts on the sky: if everyone believes in the spaghetti monster, they'll say "Look, the spaghetti monster has been taught for a thousand years." You act as if there was scientific consensus when the Sun-worshipers posited their theory.

       It visibly moves. No one would have thought the Earth was a sphere, not in the days of Eratosthenes, Plato, or Copernicus, without inventing wild theories of gravitational forces, which work on paper, but have never been tested (making it pseudoscience). They never thought hot air balloons would be invented which showed that the horizon did not fall from eye-level as expected. They never thought that video from a view from 120,000 feet, would show the
       <em>
        same thing.
       </em>
       The old theories were pseudo-scientific hypotheses based on the occult, with no proof, no evidence, still today.

       It's almost like there was a long period of religious fundamentalism that denied scientific discovery and attempted to purge ancient knowledge. Perhaps some sort of Dark Age.

       The ancient greeks knew the earth was round. The Chinese, Aztecs, Mayans, and several others either thought the earth was flat or didn't care enough to ponder on it. I still fail to see how any of this matters to your contention that the earth is flat.

       Or they made observations and came up with theories that matched them. They were later confirmed and/or modified once we developed the scientific method and improved our knowledge of the universe.

       They don't show the same thing...at all. Here's a pretty well written article on the subject written specifically to address the claims of flat earthers:

       Until you can thoroughly debunk that article your "theory" holds no weight.

       Wow....just wow. Those subtitles are incredibly disingenuous and show an ALARMING lack of scientific knowledge. He is absolutely correct in that we don't know what gravity is. That doesn't mean we can't measure it, predict it, and observe it. Even if you deny the thing we call "gravity", you would still have to explain the force of attraction between objects.

       Or how about a flat Earth supporter fly a balloon up and set a camera up take a picture of the Earth? Both ways, the image would appear circular, but if the Earth were flat, the image will show a larger amount of area than an image from a globular Earth from the same height

       This is like me saying the ultimate reason I know the earth is flat is because no one has ever been able to measure the curvature. I think this is because it's an optical illusion essentially based on your heigh and the weather to determine your viewing distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like it could be curved from the naked eye, as boats seem to drop out of your view which is assumed curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the increase in technology and magnification we can show that the observable phenomenon is just a result of perspective and angular resolution. At no point does the boat go behind any curve, if it did we would not be able to bring it back into view via magnification.

       A quick wiki search will confirm that he assumed: 
1. Crepuscular rays (when the technology was not yet able to make this assessment, interesting...)
2. The distance of the sun (has changed since his experiment)
3. The size of the sun (has changed since his experiment)

       The shadows he found work exactly as they should with a closer smaller local sun rotating around the center point, Polaris, on a flat earth. There is not much else to say here. Maybe watch vsauce's explanation if you remain skeptical.

       No, they don't. Even if they did, then that model brings up dozens of other problems. I've watched the video, have you watched any of the MANY debunks?

       Everything we have ever observed about the sun proves that light rays enter the atmosphere roughly parallel. That's the only assumption made by Eratosthenes and it is a correct one

       If you track shadows on the ground from hour to hour and day to day you could come to no other conclusion. Also, we absolutely know that sun rays enter the atmosphere virtually parallel

       We have every reason to believe the surface is not spherical (or pear-shaped). High-alt balloon video shows this. No curvature has every been measured, all water is level, no non-composite photographs of Earth which shows the shape they say it is, and so on.

      <p>
       You're clinging to a belief system because that's what you were taught, but you have yet to realize that what you were taught doesn't make practical sense and doesn't jibe with your own senses. The objects in the sky are round, but they do not prove the shape of the surface of Earth.

       Sorry but the “water is flat” bullshit is just ridiculous (and I say this as someone who actually finds the flat earth theories interesting). Do you think that water in a glass on the moon or on mars would have a curve to it? The ground is also flat because the earth is absolutely incomprehensible enormous.

       And yet I hear it all the time that ships seen only 3 miles away disappear over the curvature of this apparently tiny ball we are on. Then when video from high altitudes show an apparent flat plane stretching a thousand miles in every direction, the horizon of which rises to eye-level (which would not be possible on a sphere of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       size), we are told that the ball is so huge, you will never see evidence of a curvature at all, not one degree of it.

       The way we see things when we look out at the horizon is more consistent with an expanding flat plane than a globe. Look into optics and how vision works. Think of a looking out at a long hallway, and the way the floor appears to rise and ceiling appears to fall. Now think about a vanishing point, when your vision simply can't see further. That's the horizon.

       It is a point at which the object is no longer in view because of curvature, not because of a vanishing point.

      <p>
       That's almost true. A compass is drawn to the north pole because it aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field. Where the compass is pointing isn't always going to be directly north because the field bends around the earth's curvature and isn't static.

      <p>
       The only way this makes sense is if the north pole is in the center and the south pole is at the edge. However, if you do that then the distances are thrown off horribly, especially as you go further south. There is no model of the flat earth that can account for GPS or circumnavigation as we know it.

       I have to do some work today, so I'll just address the last part for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Magnification increases angular resolution (in reality). This is how we can test to see if boats falling beyond the horizon actually proves the globe or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's beyond the curvature, then no amount of magnification can bring it back into your view (you would just get a clearer picture of the water that is in front of the boat.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the boat is not behind any curvature but disappeared due to angular resolution, magnification will bring it back into view.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, magnification can test the claims of curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long range photography (done by ametuers with no dog in this debate) shows that we can see things that should be thousands of ft below and behind the curvature... some cases tens of thousands of ft of missing curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I want to be clear that I would bet anything against the current size of the globe. If it were a globe it would have to be way bigger and the earth as we know it would essentially be a slightly curved disc on the top (arbitratry) of the sphere.  And I do think this is a possibility along with the earth being a flat plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that is only if you think algebra is real and Pythagoras is capable of doing basic algebra.  I only say this because, i have just recently had a globe earth theorist denounce math all together saying it was fake... I don't know how to respond to that claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm happy to have a respectful conversation about this as it is an interesting topic. That much we should be able to agree on, oh and that Pythagoras knew how to math...

       I was curious to see what the people over in r/fe would have as far as evidence and what they had to say.  I visited that place once and asked two respectful questions.  Promptly got banned.  So fe people can have their little safe space where outsiders with an open mind are not welcome at all.

       I understand your anger, and accept it. You are suffering from the Back Fire effect because your core beliefs and values are being questioned. The same part of your brain that responds to a physical threat, also response to an intellectual one as well. Thus you act out in anger. Give your self time to be angry, let it scream until it runs out of steam, then take a deep breath and just listen. I am not here to tell you what to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you need someone to direct that anger at, feel free to respond to me with the most angriest, post you can imagine, and I will listen to you. I will listen because regardless of what I believe, we are in this stupid beautiful world, together all of us as humans, and I will be damned if I am accomplice to hatred. So, I love you and I will listen.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I had to check out this because it didn't seem correct. I used
       <a href="http://www.gematrinator.com/calculator/index.php">
        this
       </a>
       to help me. So you are correct that all these words make 33 in
       <strong>
        some
       </strong>
       gematria.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let me sum up :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        NASA is 33 only in "Jewish ordinal" gematria
       </li>
       <li>
        Blackhole, Bigbang and orange are 33 only in "Full reduction" and "single reduction" gematria
       </li>
       <li>
        Rover is 33 only in "Jewish reduced", "full reduction" and "single reduction".
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Eclipse is 33 in "Full reduction".
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There is absolutely no consistency. If you can use different ciphers to obtain 33, then I announce that  :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Flat Earth
        </strong>
        is 33 in "Jewish reduced" and "Chaldean"
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Bible
        </strong>
        is 33 in "reversed reduced".
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So ... is flat earth also related to freemasonry ?
