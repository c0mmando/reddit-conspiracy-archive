        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve researched NK exhaustively for around 2 years now and I still don’t know what to make of it. Most of me believes it is a long con set up by the CIA and possibly China leasing the land for propaganda reasons. It’s a perfect idea. Use this later on as a scapegoat for another nuke threat and put a false flag into the works. All they have to do is blame Kim and NK and the rest is history. </p>

<p>It just seems so obvious but at the same time I like to remain skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Winter Olympics right now is a huge part of it. if they don&#39;t compete, it would probably show the rest of NK they are not worthy of living among nations. they would also not think highly of their dear leader. Wait till after the Olympics to see what their true motive is. Also, they don&#39;t dare fuck with anyone while every nation will literally be at there front door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is Kim Jong Un attending the Winter Olympics this year? </p>

<p>If he is, my off the wall theory is the possibility of an attempt on his life and the military moving in on North Korea. While this is far fetched, this past year or two has definitely proven anything is possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more under the assumption China right now is like, DONT FUCK THIS UP. because if anything happens, China will also have great shame to show. I would highly dought Kim would show up to watch the hockey team. </p>

<p>Once winter Olympics are over, i think well go back to &quot;who has the bigger penis wars&quot; with nuclear threats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NK people wouldn’t know either way if their country was participating and it will likely be broadcast across the country that NK took gold in almost every event.</p>

<p>I completely agree with your second point that they don’t want to mess around with so many other countries being in their backyard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DPRK is a puppet regime of China, and to a lesser extent Russia.</p>

<p>These two nations have influence with the Old-guard of the late-kim, </p>

<p>and with that influence, achieve a large number of their black-market needs. Also, it&#39;s a physical land barrier between Russia/china and US proxy states (SK #1). </p>

<p>So, what really needs to happen is a negotiation with china and Russia about their illicit-market, and how the west can play-ball in their backyard while offering them corporate extensions into the pacific/africa/urasia - ever see how many bases and corporations operate in these regions?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>nk serves many purposes.  just like the bloody and horrible social experiments in the soviet union and china served a purpose of augmenting the nwo, so was nk a testing ground to push some opressive statecraft techniques into different and even further extremes.  the results of these masonic dictatorships are being applied daily across the western world today, introducing totalitarian mind control and other toxic social constructs.</p>

<p>another purpose of nk is to play a part along russia and china in keeping the still somewhat free west in check, providing a sort of global balance where hegelian dialectic can function.</p>

<p>a seemingly dangerous nk is a great excuse for the mic to sell weapon systems in the region (thaad and whatnot)</p>

<p>nk, so far appeared to the western world as a black box, hermetically sealed and opaque, its terrytory was and still is a safe haven of terrorist training camps, illegal and immoral scientific research on humans, a source of human organs and plasma, free and cheap slave labour, that is even exported abroad, a source of underage sex slaves, a major producer of meth and many similar criminalities serving the global elites.</p>

<p>in the meantime, even though the p in dprk stands for the people, all the assests of the country are being actively stripped away by the global elites, so that actually nothing is left by now and by the time of unification it will be an even bigger burden for south korea than east germany was for the western part.</p>

<p>for example eric schidt played his part in this in his recent visit to nk (remember data is the new oil).  </p>

<p>nk is a place where the average citizen has exactly zero protection from the state and the predators, sociopaths and psychopats who run the state apparatus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the dollar is not in a good position right now. its arguably set up for a major crash. china says theyd back a peaceful unified korea. south korea has not exactly been happy with the u.s presence in the region since the election. if korea unified and started trading in yuan instead of u.s.d itd be that much harder for the u.s to justify keeping that military presence in the region without an ongoing major conflict. also kim calling for peace while the trump regime is beating the war drum makes it that much harder to justify bombing the hell out of kim. its almost like the u.s is the baddies this time round</p>
