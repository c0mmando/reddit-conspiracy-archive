<p>In an internal FDA memo (8/21/90) to Paul Leber, M.D., director of the Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products, Psychiatric Drug Products group leader Thomas Laughren, M.D. agreed that much of <strong>Upjohn&#39;s information concerning withdrawal events was &quot;often poorly organized and confusing.&quot; The official expressed &quot;frustration that so little useful data have emerged...&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>An earlier memo (8/6/90) to Dr. Leber from Thomas Temple felt XANAX&#39;s effectiveness was &quot;clearly shown&quot;, the potential for drug withdrawal phenomena was &quot;clearly the area of main concern for two principal reasons. First, there is the matter of seizures... In addition, there is the issue of lifelong dependence, i.e., inability to discontinue therapy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The FDA has approved a drug in high dosages (up to 10 mg per day) for the treatment of panic disorder without evidence that it is safe for long-term prescription.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s examine the three trials, which were used by quoting a few written comments of FDA consultant Hillary Lee, Ph.D. (Statistical Review and Evaluation of 12/21/88). Keep in mind that, as is the custom, the manufacturer Upjohn sponsored these surveys. The FDA merely reviews their reports: &quot;The trials, studies 4404, 4412, and 4432, were conducted sequentially from April, 1983 to May 1985.&quot; Follow-up was ten weeks or less. An initial question you might ask is <strong>what happened to the subjects since 1985? - There is no data on this.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Study 4404: A 10-week flexible dose, single-centered, double blind, parallel, placebo controlled multicenter clinical 8-week trial. One comment was, <strong>&quot;it is disconcerting to note that the Dupont center, which had the largest sample size (19% of the total sample) and one of the lowest placebo dropout rates, showed a larger decrease in number of panic attacks of the placebo group than for the alprazolam group.&quot; In other words, in this center treatment with XANAX was worse than no treatment at all!</strong> As to the panic attack effect, the reviewer noted, &quot;only one center showed significant difference...&quot; between alprazolam and placebo. However at the dose of approximately 5 mg alprazolam was judged to be more effective than no treatment at all in the treatment of phobias.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The criterion by which XANAX effectiveness was judged was mean reduction of panic episodes per week. By that measure, one may reasonably suggest general anesthesia as a method of treatment (e.g., panic attacks would be reduced to zero and the procedure is FDA approved as generally safe). There are many other qualitative and quantitative indicators of reduction of panic attacks over the short term that these studies were conducted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In a memo (8/11/89) to the FDA Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee (PDAC), Drs. Leber and Laughren indicated, &quot;the single most significant concern associated with the use of XANAX in the treatment of panic and phobia behaviors is an increased (compared to current recommended uses) risk of dependence and withdrawal phenomena...Information gathered during the eight years of XANAX&#39;s domestic marketing for the management of anxiety disorders documents that the use of XANAX is consistently associated with reports of dependence and withdrawal phenomena...<strong>we are especially concerned that a recommendation for higher doses...will lead to an increased incidence of these untoward phenomena.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In the same memo the doctors added that HALCION (triazolam), a benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotic of Upjohn&#39;s, &quot;continues to exhibit an excess of adverse events...&quot; in spite of lower dose recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In the same memo the doctors added that HALCION (triazolam), a benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotic of Upjohn&#39;s, &quot;continues to exhibit an excess of adverse events...&quot; in spite of lower dose recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>On March 20, Dr. Laughren, in referring to long-term therapy of up to eight months, wrote a memo for the file that mentioned there was <strong>no &quot;systematic data to support the effectiveness of alprazolam for such use.&quot; The doctor noted, &quot;data on discontinuation from alprazolam in the Upjohn sponsored clinical trials were quite varied...even for controlled trials, seems to me that the design wasn&#39;t quite correct to answer the questions of interest.&quot; (i.e., withdrawal).</strong> He observed that even in the short-term treated patients, <strong>&quot;most experienced relapse (a recurrence of their symptoms) and a smaller fraction experienced rebound (a worsening relative to baseline of symptoms already present) or withdrawal (the development of new symptoms).&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Laughren added, <strong>&quot;we already know...many patients have difficulty stopping alprazolam, even with tapering; alprazolam withdrawal symptoms can occur even after low dose and short duration exposure; alprazolam withdrawal can be quite severe; and, at least some patients become tolerant to alprazolam and find it necessary to increase the dose...</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>This data suggest a strikingly higher risk of withdrawal phenomena for alprazolam doses greater than 4 mg/day compared to doses less than 4 mg/day.&quot;**</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Dr. Laughren&#39;s memo, application for XANAX in panic disorder have been <strong>turned down by Denmark (&quot;...insufficient data to evaluate long term efficacy and safety...&quot;), Germany, and Norway (&quot;...deficiency in long term data to support the safety of XANAX with regard to withdrawal phenomena...&quot;)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Dr. Laughren indicated that there was strong support for the use of alprazolam &quot;in the short-term treatment of panic disorder. However, there are deficiencies in this application with regard to how best to use XANAX in treating panic disorder; in particular, there was not an adequate exploration of the dose/response relationship or for the duration of effect...<strong>there was no systematic attempt by the sponsor to address the issue of maintaining patients who had responded during short-term treatment...There was no systematic attempt to look at withdrawal schedules.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>On April 20, 1990, Dr. Leber wrote a memo to the Director of the Office of Drug Evaluation which said, <strong>&quot;...it seems likely that the use of XANAX at the doses needed to achieve an anti-panic effect will incidence untoward events substantially greater than that so far observed among patients treated for anxiety.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In discussing the issue of safety of XANAX, Dr. Leber wrote, &quot;The case is, in some ways, a close one...Also contributing to the difficulty of the judgment is the relative sparseness of the evidence...<strong>it could be argued that the sponsor has failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that XANAX will be &#39;safe in use&#39; under the conditions of use recommended.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>What do quotes from the new XANAX (Upjohn) product labeling reveal? &quot;Demonstrations of the effectiveness of XANAX by systematic <strong>clinical study are limited to four months</strong> duration for anxiety disorder and four to ten weeks duration for panic disorder.&quot; One may well wonder at the <strong>motive for not having longer-term scientific data available on a drug that has been aggressively marketed for a decade and that sells for over $800,000 per kilo.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical dependence to XANAX. These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is seizure... studies of patients with panic disorder showed a high rate of rebound and withdrawal symptoms with XANAX...symptoms of withdrawal; heightened sensor perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesia, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease and weight loss.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation...The ability of patients to completely discontinue therapy with XANAX after long-term therapy has not been reliably determined...Withdrawal reactions may occur when dosage reduction occurs for any reason...<strong>withdrawal symptoms including seizures have been reported after only brief therapy with XANAX at doses within the recommended range for the treatment of anxiety (e.g., 0.75 to 4 mg/day)... seizure and death have been reported</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Death has been reported in association with overdoses of alprazolam itself...&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;XANAX has the potential to cause severe emotional and physical dependence in some patients and these patients may find it exceedingly difficult to terminate treatment...The following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of XANAX: seizures, hallucinations, depersonalization, taste alterations, diplopia, elevated bilirubin, elevated hepatic enzymes, and jaundice.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The necessary duration of treatment for panic disorder victims responding to XANAX is unknown...a carefully <strong>supervised tapered discontinuation may be attempted, but there is evidence that this may be difficult or impossible to accomplish</strong> without recurrence of symptoms and/or the manifestation of withdrawal phenomena.&quot;-</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Given the preponderance of evidence against approval, the vast majority of independent testimony given during the review recommend against approval citing too little data to support or the safety profile does not warrant approval</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The FDA panel voted and approval was won by one vote. Many of the panelists voting in favor were offered lucrative jobs at Upjohn immediately after approval. 2 of the decenting panelists resigned from the FDA claiming corruption, bribery and data manipulation</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>One panelists noted, A drug with unknown long-term consequences and potential for addiction has been approved by the FDA for a non-life-threatening condition, which may be treated successfully by non-drug means!-</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>XANAX has become a major economic success story for the Upjohn Company. Small wonder with its habituating potential and immediate appeal for sufferers of panic and anxiety disorders desperately seeking relief. In the end, the long benzodiazepine tranquilizer voyage is a journey into the darkest side of the twilight zone - another world&#39;s timeless hell for those that are lured there seeking calm. And yet finding - unrelenting heightened anxiety and abject misery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it worse than any of the other benzodiazepines?</p>

<p>As far as I know, long-term use or abuse is likely to lead to rebound anxiety.  I think most people with anecdotal experience describe it as bad, worse than opiate withdrawal.  I&#39;m sure this is pretty well known among prescribers and I think few people get long-term, high-volume Xanax prescriptions because of this.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you can walk into a doctor&#39;s office and complain about panic attacks and get an open-ended Xanax prescription.  You might pretty easily get a 30 day supply or something with a really good story about a brief major life event, but you&#39;re not getting put on it on an open-ended basis anymore than you can easily get prescribed oxycodone on an open-ended basis.  It might happen for people with really shitty doctors looking to just get rid of a patient with a chronic condition they can&#39;t really treat, but those same doctors would be unlikely to be tied to that same prescription, so it wouldn&#39;t get renewed.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more common to see long-term therapy use of clonazepam (aka Klonapin), which has a longer half life and thus requires lower doses.  And among the people I&#39;ve known with prescriptions for it, it&#39;s typically an adjunct to an anti-depressant for as-needed peak anxiety and not intended for daily use.</p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised that the very short half life benzos don&#39;t get used more often.  I only play a psychopharmacologist on TV, so I&#39;m not a real expert, but it strikes me that most people would get a similar benefit from short half life benzos as they do with longer half-life benzos but without the systemic build-up you get with a drug with 12-20 hours of half-life, at least for the larger base of the population looking principally for acute anxiety relief.  With a very short half life at daily use you at least stand a chance of going below the clinical threshold for several hours.</p>

<p>That being said, despite Xanxax&#39;s risks, it seems a lot better than the older drugs like barbiturates.  I think those were addictive and could pretty easily lead to respiratory failure in an overdose situation.  The benzos by themselves seem more resistant to fatal overdoses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no expert or even amatuer, but I&#39;m pretty sure you build up tolerance faster to drugs with shorter half lifes because you need to dose more often. Longer half life drugs are prescribed to prevent this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, overdosing is hard with just BZs. Actually, I can tell you exactly. The  lethal dose has been studied in rats and was reported to be in the range of 331-2171 mg/kg.

    <div class="md"><p>For &quot;ordinary&quot; use cases, though, you might not expect to re-dose.  If I just need to get to sleep on a plane, why not a 3H half life benzo vs. a 12 hour half-life?  I&#39;m not planning nor do I need to re-dose for any legitimate reason.</p>

<p>A longer half life makes more sense for treating a source of anxiety with a longer acute phase or where repeated use was likely and expected.</p>

<p>It is getting harder to get prescribed Xanax, but not hard enough. IMO</p>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>You hit on a very important point, and common misconception.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>It would seem intuitive that a drug building in your system would be a cause of concern vs. a drug with shorter elimination. The benzodiazepines who are the worst offenders are one with high-affinity and short half lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>High-affinity means it binds real tightly to the GABAa receptor (GABA is your brain&#39;s &#39;breaks,&#39; BZs mimic GABA). This basically leaves no space for the natural GABA your brain makes to find a space on the receptors to bind. So your brain says &quot;Oh, I can take off producing a GABA from my to do list.&quot; So when the drug is discontinued natural GABA is no where in site.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>If a drug has a very short half life the drug elimination is quick and those receptors that were tightly bound are suddenly stark naked, and screaming out for GABA. If a drug has a long half life and it slowly degrades given more and more space for natural GABA to fit in where it can and your brain will start slowly putting GABA back on the to do list. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this phenomenon exists with methylprednisolone, which is why you take a large continuous dose day 1, fewer day 2, and taper off over several days because of the body&#39;s slowed or halted production of cortisol and the risk of an Addison&#39;s Crisis.</p>

<p>That being said, midazolam (Versed) is used a lot in outpatient surgery settings, and I&#39;m not aware of too many people having an anxiety attack after this use and its half life is under 3 hours.  My wife had it recently for an outpatient procedure without any side effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true. Midazolam is the most powerful benzo there is. And it&#39;s only use is some dentists and minor surgery or something along those lines. It doesn&#39;t cause any rebound effect such as anxiety, simply because that&#39;s not how it works at all. You will need to take Midazolam over the course of a few days for the brain to get adjusted. And even then will it only be a slight discomfort. It&#39;s not until after a few months of daily use it starts to become dangerous </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did xanax once for about 5 months, every day about 5 - 10mg each day. The 6 month after that was the worst of my life :( the anxiety and panic disorder was about 4x worse that before I started, and i had residual withdrawal symtoms for almost a year. Its terrible if you ever want to stop taking it. So if you start doing xanax, be prepared to have to do it every day forever. But it does work, and does wonders... But the downside isn&#39;t worth it for me. I don&#39;t want to do it forever cause it makes you stupid and the dosage is extremely tricky... Sometimes you take too much and sometimes it feels like it doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;d rather have a baseline of anxiety rather than be inside the xanax bubble ever again </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t have said it better myself! The vast majority of people don&#39;t view Xanax the way they would Oxycontin in terms of the risk it carries. Today people view potent opiods with caution, both have very different risk of course, but Xanax isn&#39;t viewed with the degree of caution that it should. Many view it as no big deal, until they stop it and the reality check from hell shows itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also xanax withdrawal feels much worse than opiate withdrawal, if you&#39;ve taken it long enough. It can also last for months while an opiate withdrawal lasts a few days or a week at most. Even the most heavy heroin user can get clean in a few days. Sure there will be a long period after, with depression. And emptiness emotionally. But there&#39;s way to combat it. With xanax nothing eases the withdrawal, and if it&#39;s not fatal you&#39;ll not die but have the worst anxiety and panic attacks of your life for months on end </p>

<p>I honestly think you are not understanding what I’m saying or you’re confused. Have you gone through these issues yourself? Like I said in my first post this is all dose dependent. Somebody who took a lot more Xanax than me for a lot longer will have a different experience, but to say the heaviest of heroin users can get over it within 3 days just goes to show how little you know of this topic. I only speak from experience, what about you? Google? Yahoo awnsers? Study this more if you want to waste my time again reading your response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so sad. Anyone can Google it for themselves and see how right I am. There&#39;s a very detailed wiki page about benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and general benzodiazepine withdrawal.

Instead you downvote me and say I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, when what I said is easily verifiable.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You people seem to think that once you the drug is out of your system the withdrawal stops.&quot;</p>

<p>ok... you must be a little slow so let me walk you through this. </p>

<pre><code> &quot;Xanax withdrawal doesn&#39;t even start until after about one - two weeks&quot; -cmonbruh
</code></pre>

<p>What you wrote is pretty easy to understand. to go into withdrawal, you have to be out of drugs correct? so you are saying it STARTS in one to two weeks? ok. I dont see how I can be misunderstanding this post as incorrect as it may be. let me continue, stay focused my friend.</p>

<p><a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/xanax/">https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/xanax/</a></p>

<p>A basic FACT: xanax half-life is 11.2 hours thats how long it is until half of the drug is eliminated from your system. So that means in 22.4 hours the whole drug is gone. BUT, what you are telling me is that intact no, even though you stopped taking it, it takes ATLEAST 1-2 more weeks for the effects of withdrawal to start happening. If this doesn&#39;t sound correct go and reread your post. This doesn&#39;t make much sense but let me keep going I dont want to get stuck on this...</p>

<p>The next great quote of yours:</p>

<pre><code>   Wow. You clearly have never done neither xanax nor any opiate. So by your logic, xanax withdrawal doesn&#39;t last for up to 6 months (sometimes more) because its out of your system? Haha. Are you even serious right now? Jesus christ Google benzodiazepine withdrawal :D -cmonbruh
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, let me put a spotlight on this one sentence...</p>

<pre><code> So by your logic, xanax withdrawal doesn&#39;t last for up to 6 months (sometimes more) because its out of your system
</code></pre>

<p>And you somehow got this idea from this post? </p>

<pre><code>I’m shaking my head right now... look up the half life of Xanax. Most of the drug is out of your system in hours. How can it start in 2 weeks if it’s out fully the same day you took it? Do you know how withdrawal works? - me
</code></pre>

<p>let me make it smaller for your little brain so you can focus on the important part better. </p>

<pre><code>look up the half life of Xanax. Most of the drug is out of your system in hours. How can it start in 2 weeks if it’s out fully the same day you took it? -me
</code></pre>

<p>now if youre struggling to understand this let me explain. what that little quote of mine meant, is that xanax withdrawal doesn&#39;t start in two weeks, it can start the same day or the next one. it doesn&#39;t take 2 WEEKS. are you starting to grasp this? I hope so. CMON BRUH!</p>

<p>Im having fun. Please, just a few more quotes of yours for shits and giggles. </p>

<pre><code>I give up. You&#39;re to thick headed to speak to. Google benzodiazepine withdrawal if you don&#39;t believe me. Simple. I can&#39;t for the life of me fathom why people would argue the very basic facts. Xanax withdrawal will last for months, if you&#39;ve taken enough of it. Sometimes a full year. And you think you can speak from experience? With those baby doses? Are you kidding me? You don&#39;t have a clue what the fuck you&#39;re talking about. Neither facts nor personal experience. I did 10 times more than you and for a longer period of time. If you want to battle personal experiences I think mine speaks louder than yours. Furthermore I have the fucking facts on my side in addition to my experiences. So fuck off -cmon bruh
</code></pre>

<p>this post is too good I can feel true emotion coming from you CMONBRUH im going to have to break this down into sections just too much quality content.</p>

<pre><code> And you think you can speak from experience? With those baby doses? Are you kidding me? You don&#39;t have a clue what the fuck you&#39;re talking about. Neither facts nor personal experience. -cmonbruh
</code></pre>

<p>experience is experience no matter the dose? 1.5 mg a day isn&#39;t a junkie amount, but its enough for you to have withdrawals from after a short amount of time. I was on that for almost 2 years and that was my experience sorry you dont understand this lol. </p>

<pre><code> I did 10 times more than you and for a longer period of time. If you want to battle personal experiences I think mine speaks louder than yours.
</code></pre>

<p>yes infact, I would love to battle about who is the bigger drug addict because this is a very important topic for me that I cannot afford to lose lol. we will call it THE BATTLE OF THE JUNKIES. </p>

<p>IM A BIGGER PILLHEAD THAN YOU!</p>

<p>NO I AM!</p>

<p>FUCK YOU AND YOUR BABY DOSES! </p>

<p>lmao get a grip bruh seriously.. I dont care about comparing dick sizes. </p>

<pre><code>    Furthermore I have the fucking facts on my side in addition to my experiences. So fuck off
</code></pre>

<p>I dont see any facts other than you making a fool of yourself that I know for sure lol. I enjoyed reading your posts very much thank you for the entertainment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been on both and id choose the pain meds. As far as pain meds id either take (50-70mg) hydrocodone, (60-90mg oxy) or (10-30mg) methadone. If i couldnt get my favorite one then id settle for one of the others listed. I quit cold turkey off of all pain meds, however it was HELL. Well after i quit those i started seeking actual therapy and got prescribed xanax pretty early on. The dosages went up every visit. I still take them when i need them but luckily i am no longer psychically dependent on alprazolam. After a couple of detoxs off of the xanax i finally took some time off work and got a similiar med (Attivan?) That helped with the detox. Xanax withdrawl is one of those things thats hard to explain, but either way you look at it, opiates and benzos need to come with a much more dire warning from the doctor than what ive seen in the past. Pain pills USUALLY lead to heroin and xanax usually leads to a plethora of fucked up things. </p>

<p>Can anyone who witnessed the crack epidemic in the 80s-90s give me some sort of comparison to what we are seeing with the opiate/benzo epidemic were seeing now? Id be grateful for the insight</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your body adapts to your routine. For people who don&#39;t exert much energy during the day, the body will learn that not much energy is needed. The body will also adapt to support an active lifestyle. The first time in the gym is the hardest, but each day you go, you will have more energy than the day before. </p>

<p>I started a new plan last week and have been to the gym 3 times so far. The difference was noticeable after the first day and I actually crave getting back in there now, even though it sucked at first. If you can just mechanically make yourself get in the gym a couple times i promise you&#39;ll love it and have WAY more energy/confidence, way less anxiety and depression. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Euphoria is different than a lack of anxiety. Been on plenty of opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, dilaudid, codeine.

    <div class="md"><p>Idk i guess it affects you somewhat different. Only drug that comes close to euphoria in that catrgory for me is midazolam iv before surgery. Its like drinking 10 beers in 30 sec so its pretty nice i guess.</p>

<p>But the feeling of dilaudid(which couldnt fully numb the pain of a kidney stone😂) or oxycodone ir is very euphoric. I used to smoke really good weed many years ago and it was very euphoria inducing as long as it was CBD heavy and not THC, since THC is actually dysphoric.</p>

<p>I think the best drug i have ever had was hydrocodone mixed with homatropine. Not something you can do without getting hooked though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amygdala is partly responsible for anxiety because it switches on the fight or flight effect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Behavioral measures have been used to show that compared to facial expressions of happiness, fearful expressions are correctly identified more rapidly during threat than safe conditions (Robinson et al., 2011). A follow-up fMRI study replicated this behavioral finding and provided evidence of potential neural correlates of this effect including <strong>increased prefrontal-amygdala coupling</strong> (Robinson et al., 2012a). Similarly, research has shown that while static facial displays of fear do not alone increase startle reactivity relative to neutral emotional displays, they do so if they are presented during periods of threat of shock (Grillon and Charney, 2011). These results suggest that threat-induced anxiety can boost sensory-perceptual processing of affectively-congruent stimuli, such as fearful faces that convey the more relevant signal while anticipating shock, but the methodology (e.g., sluggish fMRI response, delayed startle onset) leaves open (in contrast to the above early sensory processing findings) the possibility that other downstream cognitive processes are influencing these biases (Pessoa, 2005). Finally, a recent study examined the impact of modulating expectancy of fearful and happy faces by pairing them with neutral cues. This task revealed that <strong>threat of shock increased responses to unexpected fear</strong> (but not happy) faces (i.e., <strong>prediction errors</strong>) in the striatum (Robinson et al., 2013b) indicating a bias toward detecting novel threats under anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically you&#39;re over-responding to a fake threat and your fight or flight stress hormones go nuts expecting a threat. It&#39;s like the cops being dispatched because there was a loud noise. Something happened to associate loud noises with criminal activity. Wiring in your brain is like that.</p>

<p>I would imagine some kind of conditioning to your stressors would numb you and you would stop over-reacting.</p>

<p>usually cause blunting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. That&#39;s the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>disrupt cognitive function</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Not even close. Antidepressants (and ketamine) are known to increase neurogenesis (the ability for neurons to form new connections) significantly.</p>

<p>Not only are you wrong. You&#39;re an extra special kind of wrong.</p>

<p>Exhibit A: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155214/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155214/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The recent evidence that neurogenesis occurs throughout adulthood and neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in the adult central nervous system (CNS) suggests that the CNS has the potential for self-repair. Beside this potential, the function of newly generated neuronal cells in the adult brain remains the focus of intense research. The hippocampus of patients with depression show signs of atrophy and neuronal loss. This suggests that adult neurogenesis may contribute to the biology of depression. The observations that <strong>antidepressants, like fluoxetine, increase neurogenesis</strong> in the dentate gyrus (DG) and neurogenesis is required for the behavioral effect of antidepressants, lead to a new theory for depression and the design of new strategies and drugs for the treatment of depression. However, the role of adult neurogenesis in the etiology of depression remains the source of controversies and debates.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because you had a shit doctor. Most antidepressants don&#39;t do jack shit for ADHD and the ones that do, it&#39;s a side effect.</p>

<p>Such condescension from your high place of knowledge. I am well aware of the fact that people often think they are experts when they know jack shit. I dont have any lemon juice to rob banks with though.</p>

<p>And arbitrary neurogenesis will not fix something that isnt damaged. I had no chemical imbalance to fix.</p>

<p>I was an intelligent 11 year old who thought busy work was bullshit and didnt do it. Throw on some quack doctors and i ended up obese and suicidal by 16. </p>

<p>It wasnt until i got off the antidepressants that i stopped being depressed. Oops there goes their efficacy.</p>

<p>Plenty of studies have shown that antidepressants increase risk of suicide, regardless of whatever horseshit you like to believe. They also tend to make people fat blunted zombies.</p>

<p>There is no dunning kruger effect at work, which may be a shame in the context of whatever delusional bullshit you have faith in. </p>

<p>As i said, got off the drugs, thin and fit, havent aged a day in 15 years. How many fat zombies on antidepressants are there now?</p>

<p>How many teens get doped up for being normal smart kids in a world that hates free thinkers, in an education system designed to churn out disposable workers?</p>

<p>That&#39;s how they work. They alleviate the stress by jacking up the serotonin. The blunting effect is part of it until you get used to it. It goes away over time. It takes awhile.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So they gave you antidepressants for acute depression brought on by something very clearly solved. That&#39;s not good diagnosis on the part of the doctor. You don&#39;t hand them out like candy to everyone who has some sad thoughts here and there.</p>

<p>Probably less than there are fit people on antidepressants. You don&#39;t realize how common these drugs are. Millions of people are or have been on antidepressants at some time in their life. Not everyone of them is fat. Genius deductive skills there. You sure about that IQ test?</p>

<p>So doubling the risk of suicide means its a rare side effect? 🤔</p>

<p>And obviously i never suggested throwing away all the drugs. Just the ones where the side effects outweigh the benefits. And actually Saffron has been clinically proven to be more effective than Prozac at treating depression, but its a plant and therefore not patentable like drugs are.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you don&#39;t understand the mechanism of action, of course it appears to be like magic. The increased risk of suicide is because the patient is able to follow through with their disturbed thoughts thanks to the extra serotonin and energy from the drug.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just the ones where the side effects outweigh the benefits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. Quit while you&#39;re ahead. Use that so called high IQ of yours. That&#39;s the dumbest thing I&#39;ve read so far. The side effects outweighing the benefits is a patient by patient basis depending on the severity of their condition. For example anesthesia drugs have some pretty horrible side effects for lots of people. Should we ban those and return back to ether? Or how about just cutting people open on the operating table without any sedation.</p>

<p>Motherfucking Dunning Kruger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saffron has been clinically proven to be more effective than Prozac at treating depression, but its a plant and therefore not patentable like drugs are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>St. John&#39;s Wort has been determined to be very effective as well. It&#39;s not used because you have a little side effect known as bleeding out on the operating table and it&#39;s almost impossible to regulate the dosage.</p>

<p>Saffron is also one of the most expensive things on the fucking planet. Do you even know where it comes from? It&#39;s so fucking hard to cultivate I wouldn&#39;t even be surprised if your supply is watered down with a similar looking plant. Turns out that there&#39;s no regulation for supplements. For all you know you&#39;re buying colored grass fibers and relying on the placebo effect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So ill keep taking my stuff thats worth more than its weight in gold that works, and you can swallow all the industrial waste you like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out the higher your IQ, the higher the chances are your head is stuck up your own ass. There&#39;s nothing quite like easily verifiable knowledge. No level of mental capacity will make up for the fact that your mind is empty.</p>

<p>Good day sir.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing though; my doctor also warned me that it’s not candy.  He said there could be dangers in prolonged use and very strongly suggested I do not make a habit of it.  I took him at his word and didn’t, taking maybe one a day for a week and then reducing it quite a bit after that.  Second week I maybe used it three times, the week following maybe only once or twice, and even less frequently following that.  I was given a sixty pill supply and still have about half of them sitting in my medicine cabinet half a decade later.</p>

<p>I honestly don’t know if I’m going to, or currently do, have side effects from my minor use.  I’m smart enough to recognize the potential for abuse and addiction so I treated it like it was potentially dangerous, which after reading this post sounds like it is.  I think it’s unfortunate more people don’t use their critical thinking skills when at the doctor, or when thinking over what their doctor told them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just try to manage as much as I can through the day. I never smoke before or after work as my job is pretty important and I doubt I’d do anything well while high.</p>

<p>But if you have the ability to buy from dispensaries the different strains are completely game changing. I used to grow my own and would specifically grow weed that made me energetic and hyper focused. </p>

<p>I’m also not anxious and depressed all day every day. I use it more after work because all that stress and anxiety built up all day and I use weed to sort of release that at the end of the day. I think it helps prevent the anxiety from building up to unmanageable levels.</p>

<p>But everyone’s anxiety and depression is different, I know for some people this won’t be an answer. There have been times I’ve been so depressed or had such a bad panic attack that weed unfortunately can’t help, but that happens a lot less frequently than it used to.</p>

That’s with a very high tolerance (smoking 3-8 times a day for the past 4 years) and pretty high quality bud (20-30% THC). </p>

<p>I’m able to function very well in a financial job that has a huge emphasis on accuracy and knowledge of applicable laws.

    <div class="md"><p>What honestly worked for me most (which probably won’t help many people) was getting out of the environment that was truly causing all of the craziness.</p>

<p>I went from living with ridiculously controlling parents who demanded nothing but the best. My younger brother has autism so once he was born I was kind of thrown to the wolves. Then both my parents worked full time so by the time I was 10 I was watching my brothers, getting them on/off the bus, cooking dinner. It was awful. I ended up leaving and getting married, and ended up in an abusive relationship. It was just bad decision after bad decision. </p>

<p>He ended up ending the marriage, I think I got lucky there. I ended up having to move back to my home town with no job, no place to live, and no insurance. It was in that moment I decided enough was enough and I was going to do whatever I could to fix it.</p>

<p>I did cliche shit like starting new hobbies, getting into makeup and taking care of my skin, new clothes, new everything. I went back to college, and found a new job. I stared working out and and feeling better for myself. I got really into bullet journaling where I can track my moods, and see when my ups and downs were. </p>

<p>Now I’m engaged to an amazing guy who is more supportive than I ever could have imagined someone could be. He doesn’t understand what happens, because most people don’t, but he is so patient with me. He encourages me to speak my mind where I’d just be quiet. He knows when to give me space if I’m feeling overwhelmed. He’s an amazing listener. It’s like having a built in therapist.</p>

<p>Last year I had a lot of financial stress and had recurrent panic attacks. I did end up seeing a doctor again and getting a prescription, but tried to just use it as an “emergency only” kind of thing. I’ve been able to manage wit just weed as a medication since then.</p>

<p>Anyway sorry for the crazy ramble! I know this is definitely definitely not an option for everyone, I just had no choice because there was literally no way I could afford to see doctors and get these pills once I lost insurance. That just gave me the kick to see what I could do to lessen the symptoms on my own. </p>

<p>The worst part? You simply don&#39;t care. Not like cannabis or alcohol. I mean you could be set on fire, and you would calm get up and say slowly &quot;guys I&#39;m on fire&quot;. Ok that&#39;s an exaggeration.</p>

<p>For example, I started to mess with people for no reason. I had this deviance that sprang up on benzos. I was mixing with opioids too. I know bad idea. But man It was either kill myself or take these. I&#39;m off em now.</p>

<p>But yeah. I can see why some mass murderers take it before their act. Because I can see how I could kill someone and it wouldn&#39;t bother me. Once I even considered it and how to get away with it. Then I was like &quot;why the fuck am I thinking like this&quot;. I soon realized it was the benzos, after a month of not taking them.</p>

<p>When you have a mental disorder that makes you believe you&#39;re on fire when you are perfectly fine, benzos can be a quick relief in an emergency. Definitely should only be taken with a trusted and sober person nearby just in case.</p>

<p>However, I agree that finding another day-to-day treatment for anxiety is the best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, CBD can be sneaky. It just slides into place with no muss or fuss and does what I need it to.</p>

<p>CBD shouldn&#39;t be giving a &#39;high&#39; sensation as there&#39;s no THC in there. By &#39;no THC&#39; I mean the THC should be .03% and below if its 50 state legal. I&#39;ve only taken CBD as a pill or capsule.</p>

<p>I liken the response to taking an aspirin or the like. In about 20-30 minutes I get pain relief and things that would&#39;ve made me anxious still register but they don&#39;t jump on the &#39;ANXIOUS&#39; button like normal. I can go about my day without over-reacting to these kinds of inputs. I guess mellow is the most notable effect if I had to narrow it down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just based on the fundamentals of psychopharmacology, it&#39;s obvious that taking a drug like Xanax everyday will eventually make your anxiety worse, but unfortunately most people don&#39;t know this, and so they trust their doctor, not knowing that he&#39;s basically a glorified drug dealer.</p>

<p>Benzodiazepines are GABA agonists and repeated use will downregulate GABA receptors, making baseline anxiety worse and requiring more of the drug to combat it. </p>

<p>This is really basic shit so there&#39;s no way in hell psychiatrists don&#39;t know exactly what they&#39;re doing when they prescribe this drug in the way that they do. They have the same business model as common drug pushers- get people hooked on your drug so you have customers for life. And the specific drug they prescribe depends on which company gives them the most kickbacks.</p>

<p>Benzodiazepines are great for acute anxiety attacks but taking them every day will make the problem worse and you will become dependent on the drug. That&#39;s why I was shocked when I went to a psychiatrist for panic attacks that I have maybe once every couple months and he prescribed me klonopin and told me to take it every day. There is absolutely no reason to do that unless the intention is for me to become dependent on the drug and buy more of it. </p>

<p>It makes me so angry thinking about how many normal, healthy people who have occasional anxiety this doctor has gotten addicted to benzodiazepines because they didn&#39;t know enough about psychopharmacology to not follow that ill intended advice. And it&#39;s not just this one guy. This is systemic.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>that is not only not obvious, there is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3321276/">little to no evidence</a> substantiating your position:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>If developing al all, tolerance to the anxiolytic effects seems to develop more slowly compared to tolerance to the hypnotic effects. In patients with panic disorder, neither anxiolytic tolerance nor daily dose increase was observed after 8 weeks of alprazolam treatment with continued efficacy [67]. This was confirmed by another study in panic disorder patients who already chronically took alprazolam. Here, no differences were found in cortisol responsivity or anxiolytic efficacy compared to alprazolam-naïve patients, independent of disease severity [40]. Another double-blind study allocated 180 chronically anxious outpatients to diazepam (15 to 40 mg/day) and found that prolonged diazepam treatment (6–22 weeks) did not result in tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of diazepam [68]. Furthermore, additional studies all show a continuing anxiolytic effect, at least for panic disorder [69–72], generalized anxiety disorder [73], and social phobia [74–76]. Although a declining anxiolytic efficacy after long-term use of benzodiazepines cannot be clearly established, it is important to remember that other disadvantages prevent benzodiazepines to chronically treat anxiety symptoms, such as continued memory impairment, accident risk, hip fractures, and withdrawal symptoms [7, 77]. In conclusion, there is no solid evidence from the existing literature that anxiolytic efficacy declines following chronic benzodiazepine use in humans.</em>&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Benzodiazepines are GABA agonists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as i mentioned in my previous post, this is not true. to expand on that post, it betrays a misunderstanding of the fundamentals of psychopharmacology. clinically used benzodiazepines (with the exception of flumazenil) are positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors -- that is, they enhance the inhibitory effect of GABA on that specific GABA receptor subtype by binding to a different site (the benzodiazepine, or BZD) on the receptor and promoting an increased influx of chloride ions into the neuron when GABA is bound to its &#39;docking&#39; site. intrinsically, they have no activity at GABA-A. an example of a GABA-A agonist is muscimol (found in <em>a. muscaria</em>); an example of a GABA-B agonist is baclofen..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is really basic shit so there&#39;s no way in hell psychiatrists don&#39;t know exactly what they&#39;re doing when they prescribe this drug in the way that they do.

<p>i&#39;ve had great success telling psychiatrists which drugs i wanted to have prescribed to me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>he may have been concerned that the panic attacks would increase in frequency and/or he may have been concerned that you showed other symptoms of an anxiety disorder. defaulting to the worst possible interpretation of his actions seems unreasonable and uncharitable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes me so angry</p>

<p>perhaps you should take a benzo.</p>

I’ve seen friends come down from months long binges and that shit looks rough.</p>

<p>I’ve only ever had opiate (specifically roxy) withdraws, which I’m thinking are two different things (benzo/opiate?) and that’s bad enough.
Anxious, uncomfortable, feel like my entire skeleton is itch and restless, that shit is rough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you can die from from alcohol and benzo withdrawals, usually just cold turkey but can happen even with tapering. Mainly from seizures from the GABA-A receptors getting super excited after coming off. The worst thing about benzos is how long the withdrawal and seizure risk stays for. Something like Valium, has a half life of 90 days or something ridiculously long (Xanax less than a day if I remember correctly). The normalization to the GABA receptors can take years, with the worst being the first 6 months. Just constant lack of mental clearity and anxiety, among other things. Not something I’d like to experience... again.</p>

<p>Opiate withdrawal won’t kill you, but you will be miserable and maybe wishing you were dead for a few days. Maybe a week. But then it’s over (for the most part). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow thanks for that info, that’s really interesting and equally frightening. 
Glad to hear you are off that shit now then (right?) that’s good news man.</p>

<p>Yea it usually only lasts about a week, that’s accurate, the physical feeling at least. 
I’ve been under some kind of high, weather it’s weed or something else for the better part of a decade consistently, so the mental sobriety is a constant factor for me, that I dislike if I’m being honest, but I don’t physically desire the opiates anymore, and that experience is enough to keep me away.</p>

<p>Plus I’m pretty positive I almost OD’d on bad pressed Xanax the like, second time I ever took it so I have absolutely zero desire to try it again lol.  </p>

<p>Stay safe out there!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From someone who&#39;s been heavily into opiates, Xanax and short acting benzos have caused far worse withdrawal than any opiate. Opiates I&#39;m more likely to relapse but the physical and mental pain of Xanax withdrawal has pushed me to the verge of suicide. Shorter stronger acting drugs seem to be worse than longer acting, 10mg a day long term is a recipe for long term dependence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now find out how many on the streets aren&#39;t Even real or have very much less xanax than is lead to believe. Pharmaceutical companies  only generic as far as i have read have a +/- 20% tollerance of the active drug. I wonder what a drug dealer would do with that -20% taken from the pills? Take it and use it to make more?. There&#39;s a huge problem with xanax and it doesn&#39;t matter how far you ween after being dependant it&#39;s REALLY hard to get off and that&#39;s coming from an ex heroin addict of 10 years that&#39;s been 6 years sober. Xanax is potentially HARDER than heroin to stop even if tapered down,I know from experience..heroin has a hard physical withdrawal about 30 days cold turkey everytime I went to jail or prison but xanax is physical and VERY mental. ALSO mini  seziures can start as early as 12hr after not dosing,your body will start switching with VERY raised anxiety and insomnia at an extreme level. Xanax has a short half life and is out of your system in most cases before you stop experiencing the withdrawal effects bt far.There&#39;s definitely something behind this. Sad thing is if they regulated it harder or cut people off the suffering involved would be horrible not to mention it&#39;s a legal wanted drug for big pharmaceutical to profit on in a massive scale. Out on the east coast it used to be easy to get prescribed anything but doctors have cut back bc they seem to notice a trend or pattern related to certain drugs. West coast anything is easy to get just like how it was east coast years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have bouts of panic attacks and xanax has been a lifesaver and I&#39;ve been using it for a while now. My dosage has never increased and it gives me more confidence knowing I can stop myself from losing my shit and having to leave whatever social setting I&#39;m in. Now if I&#39;m starting to feel a panic attack coming on I just sneak into the bathroom and put a .5mg pill under my tongue, wait about 10min, and I&#39;m better than ever before</p>

<p>Should be noted I don&#39;t take them everyday, just when I need it which comes out to about 2 or 3 times a week on average. Xanax has improved my life immensely and has allowed me to have a social life</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am glad it works for you. However, withdrawal from benzodiazapines often can mimic a panic attack. If you do not take Xanax (alprazalom) for 2-4 days and experience the onset of a panic attack, it&#39;s likely withdrawal and not a reemergence of a pre-existing panic disorder</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also xanax withdrawal feels much worse than opiate withdrawal, if you&#39;ve taken it long enough. It can also last for months while an opiate withdrawal lasts a few days or a week at most. Even the most heavy heroin user can get clean in a few days. Sure there will be a long period after, with depression. And emptiness emotionally. But there&#39;s way to combat it. With xanax nothing eases the withdrawal, and if it&#39;s not fatal you&#39;ll not die but have the worst anxiety and panic attacks of your life for months on end </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not true at all. Speaking from experience here I used to do 1000 dollars worth of heroin a week and day 3 of nothing you would still be in bed curled up in a ball wanting to die. I’ve also gone through Xanax withdrawals I used to get 90 .5 mgs a month and while the withdrawals were horrible also I felt better within 2 weeks of not taking any of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not from my experience no it didn’t last 6 months. This isn’t a pissing match for me buddy I know what Iived there’s no reason to lie especially about a topic like this. what is there to gain? You think I want to talk to your stupid ass lol? </p>

<p>I honestly think you are not understanding what I’m saying or you’re confused. Have you gone through these issues yourself? Like I said in my first post this is all dose dependent. Somebody who took a lot more Xanax than me for a lot longer will have a different experience, but to say the heaviest of heroin users can get over it within 3 days just goes to show how little you know of this topic. I only speak from experience, what about you? Google? Yahoo awnsers? Study this more if you want to waste my time again reading your response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didnt give me antidepressants for ADHD. They gave them to me for depression brought on by the fact that i had my IQ tested to see why i wasnt doing well in school and it was quite high (&gt;98% of the population of the planet high). </p>

<p>One can easily become depressed as a result of being doped up on shit that makes one feel terrible like ritalin and cylert and being a child told that theres something &quot;wrong&quot; with you. </p>

<p>Such condescension from your high place of knowledge. I am well aware of the fact that people often think they are experts when they know jack shit. I dont have any lemon juice to rob banks with though.</p>

<p>And arbitrary neurogenesis will not fix something that isnt damaged. I had no chemical imbalance to fix.</p>

<p>I was an intelligent 11 year old who thought busy work was bullshit and didnt do it. Throw on some quack doctors and i ended up obese and suicidal by 16. </p>

<p>It wasnt until i got off the antidepressants that i stopped being depressed. Oops there goes their efficacy.</p>

<p>Plenty of studies have shown that antidepressants increase risk of suicide, regardless of whatever horseshit you like to believe. They also tend to make people fat blunted zombies.</p>

<p>There is no dunning kruger effect at work, which may be a shame in the context of whatever delusional bullshit you have faith in. </p>

<p>As i said, got off the drugs, thin and fit, havent aged a day in 15 years. How many fat zombies on antidepressants are there now?</p>

<p>How many teens get doped up for being normal smart kids in a world that hates free thinkers, in an education system designed to churn out disposable workers?</p>

<p>The results speak for themselves. I mean havent you noticed the kind of fat losers chronic antidepressant users become or are you too blunted to pick up on it? Such a shame.</p>
