<p>Diaspora Ministry unveils system for tracking online anti-Semitism</p>

<p>“The time has come to put a mirror in front of our haters and expose the ugly face of modern anti-Semitism,” he said. “From now on we’ll know who every anti-Semitic inciter is.”</p>

<p>When needed, the Ministry works with the authorities in other countries to take concrete steps against those spreading hate.</p>

<p>The best way to deal with bullies is to stand up to them. We know what Israel hates - knowledge that they did 911 spreading, so we need to sticky these videos:</p>

<p>r/conspiracy stood up to CNN we can stand up to Israel as well.</p>

<p>The only way they will back off is if they realize it causes more trouble than good to doxx r/conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>Sure, since my worldview is based on facts like the article I linked.</p>

<p>I had the same JIDF shenadigans ages ago such as computer hacks until I switch to ubuntu. Recently someone made an account just to say &quot;were watching you&quot; in this thread:</p>

<p>I would appreciate it if you wouldn&#39;t quote someone else and attribute it to me.  I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re objective in doing that is, but it&#39;s shady as hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so a reply to yesterday. Apparently some one reported my post here.</p>

<p><a href="http://antisemitism.mda.gov.il/">http://antisemitism.mda.gov.il/</a></p>

<p>Then the IDF foriegn affairs IP was used to reapond in the thread. My buddy is disectimg who went through my phone and facebook yesterday. I filed a police report saying someone swatted my brother by finding where he was logged into his Facebook and sent police there for a domestic disturbance that never happened.</p>

<p>My brother had a warrant for failing to pay the final fees for probation because he had a couple grams of marijuana on him. </p>

<p>I&#39;m waiting for the police to get back because it would be illegal to call in a false report about a domestic dispute that didn&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>My buddy is a cryptoanalyst/ ethical hacker and is gathering the info. He says it looks like someone when through my stuff to see if I had a criminal history to swat me. But since I don&#39;t, they probably found my brother had an outstanding warrant for debt to the state and called the police on his location knowing they would find his warrant for not paying the state. </p>

<p>Its pretty fucked up soneone would go this far. We are currently going through the thread to extract user info to find if there is a common connection between accoubts and if they communicated through other systems to organize a brigade of the post and further hacking of my info.</p>

<p>1) Stifle free speech so that people cannot debate and therefore think critically. </p>

<p>2)Lower the bar so that we can tar and feather more people who challenge us regardless of the validity of their argument. </p>

<p>Pick one. </p>

<p>Because if they try to go w  no2, no1 will not go quietly, lest they shine a larger light on their own deeds. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree w rabid anti-Semitism / blind hatred but I see most people just want to be able to discuss simple maths that seem to be brushed over and turned into taboos w this particular group.  </p>

<p>This is really about the internet. They think controlling the web will put pandora back into the box. 
Its already out man. Even if they shut the internet down ( something i highly doubt can be effectively enforced) people will go back to books and print and will be paying attention to and talking about these issues and still challenging many of these ideas. </p>

<p>Of jewish conspiracies are utter bullshit, then that will come out to. </p>
