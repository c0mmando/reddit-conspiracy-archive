        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After watching most of the speeches at the World Economic Forum I&#39;m convinced that China will be making a move to take over the world in the next 5-10 years.  Here is some evidence...what are your thoughts?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Global elites have been pushing for China to join the new world order for a long time.  This is conspiracy fact, not conspiracy theory.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOjckJWqb0A">Watch this video of George Soros spelling it out 8 years ago.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Xi Jinping gave the opening speech at the 2017 WEF.  It was basically a coming out party that he has finally signed on to the agenda.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys6skqxQKMk">Here is the video (long)</a>.  Pay attention to the last few minutes where the WEF founder reinforces the 3 commitments that Xi made during the speech.  </p></li>
<li><p>China has been rolling out a social credit and total surveillance system that is pretty Orwellian to say the least.  <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/chinese-government-social-credit-score-privacy-invasion">Here&#39;s a good article that explains it.</a></p></li>
<li><p>At this year&#39;s WEF, George Soros had a pretty somber outlook on the future concerning Big Data and China.  Its like he just realized that the girl he was trying to hook up with his whole life has an STD.  <a href="https://youtu.be/UDmJcEB7O0c?t=20m22s">Here is a clip</a> of him saying that we could be headed to an Orwellian totalitarian state...led by China.  And <a href="https://youtu.be/UDmJcEB7O0c?t=40m2s">here is a clip</a> where he explains how he basically expects a third world war in the next 20 years.  </p></li>
<li><p>2 more clips from the WEF that mentioned China&#39;s dystopian system.  <a href="https://youtu.be/GhF7Skyx0F8?t=38m">Here</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/9f4svVN7ohw?t=19m16s">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>In the recent PPT leaked by Trumps NSC, they are clearly worried about <a href="https://imgur.com/a/XKzr9">the threat of China setting up a GLOBAL social credit system</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>North Korea has been saved as a &quot;trigger&quot; for the launch of WW3.  They have been beating the drums for years and will continue to do so until China is ready to roll. </p></li>
<li><p>Remember Chinagate when Bill Clinton sold military technology to China in return for campaign funding?  Seems pretty relevant now. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>All this is to say that there is a lot of buzz going around among global elites about how China has been selected as the new leader of the world and that we are entering a &quot;new era&quot;.  This is a troubling thought looking at the sheer size of their military and their current digital dictatorship.  </p>

<p>Sorry for the rather long post...anybody else worried about this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t China&#39;s bank already controlled by the elites? I apologise, I haven&#39;t done much research on China.</p>

<p>As ridiculous as it may sound, what I think is that US, China, Russia are all controlled and whether humanity wants it or not, we are going to get WW3 anyways. I remember in one of the interview Bill (William) Cooper mentioned that US and Russia are friends and they need each other (boogieman) for the military budget.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could be right.  The way I see it the west, China, and Russia are all fighting for world domination.  China and Russia have aligned themselves for the moment to fight the west but are holding off for 3-5 years until their military weapons systems are up to speed.  </p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t sound ridiculous to me either that they are all 3 in on it together.  We are building our own cage with the Internet of Things.  </p>

<p>These elites have history of financing the both sides of the war. This makes me believe that Russia, China and US are all on it together. Who is to say that the elites haven&#39;t funded all 3 of them now? What you say could be true too but I think Russia, China and US are just arms of the elites and they can start war from either one.</p>

<p>I believe their plan is economic collapse -&gt; WW3 -&gt; world government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good theory.  I think there&#39;s going to be an upheaval somewhere in there in America.  There&#39;s too much crap going on.  They&#39;ll come out and say pizzagate was real and the right will riot and then they&#39;ll say Russia really did hack the election and the left will riot.  People will lose complete faith in humans ability to make decisions and will turn to AI.  Not some walking/talking robot but algorithms and surveillance that will be used to make sure everyone and everything is transparent and accountable.  </p>

<p>If you want a rabbit hole to go down look up Jared Cohen (CFR member, former advisor to Condy Rice and Hillary, and high up at Google) and read the WikiLeaks about him and how he secretly started the Arab spring.  Think about it...it took 18 days for an unorganized, unarmed revolution to overthrow a government that had had 30 years of control.  It was a social media experiment.  Once they saw how effective it was, they knew the time was right. </p>

<p>A little out there but it makes sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is reason to believe that the economy as you and I experience it is just another control matrix, designed to keep the lower classes where they belong. Think about it: there are more than enough resources to afford everybody a comfortable life, but the elites need an excuse not to share their hoards with lesser men. They have acquired so ridiculously many assets that the devastation of the outside world wouldn&#39;t really hurt them, even more so if large-scale automation becomes a reality and economic productivity is decoupled from human labour. To them, WW3 would just be a convenient way to get rid of dissidents and to combat problems like climate change, which even they aren&#39;t immune to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll use my religious viewpoint on this topic. Back in the (iirc) 70s the Coptic Pope Shenouda had a sermon which he did weekly to explain the Book of Revelations. In the book of revelations there are four horses of the apocalypse. Pope Shenouda gave an alternate interpretation and different order of these horses. Each horse was to symbolise a global superpower/nation which the elites/Zionists use as their global superpower. The first horse is the white horse, which he interpreted it as the white man/race and the coinciding superpower is America, a dominantly white race. The second horse would be the pale/yellow race which would then coincide with the Chinese race. The third horse would be the brown/black horse which resembles either an African/Indian race which will become the next superpower of choice after China. The final horse is the red horse, which would symbolise ultimate death, war and blood spilling. This final horse would symbolise a large period of bloodshed and the second coming of Jesus Christ. This is an alternate view as to how it is written in the Bible but we all know the Bible has been altered and many revealing passages have been taken out and are hidden presumably by the Vatican.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing.  I&#39;ve actually been reading revelations a lot lately looking for this type of thing.  China&#39;s current system sure seems like the mark of the beat and I think it&#39;s interesting how it says the dragon (sometimes a symbol of China) gave the beast his power, and his seat, and great authority.  Read <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/chinese-government-social-credit-score-privacy-invasion">this article</a> about China&#39;s social credit system and then apply it to the cliché mark of the beast passage.  Think about the beast as an AI control grid that they need to give an &quot;image&quot; to.  Also consider that in that article it mentions how everyone will be given a social credit score between 350 and 950 and how for example <strong>&quot;those with more than 666 points can get a cash loan of up to 50,000 yuan (£5,700), obviously from Ant Financial Services.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because democrats are buried in anti Trump rhetoric, Republicans are swimming in a see of pro Trump shit, and China is engaged in a brilliant plan to assume the vacuum created by Brittish and American exits from former empire nations.</p>

<p>The writing on the wall, if not clear with the construction of a new military base in the South China Sea, should have been evident when the heads of the Zimbabwean military flew to China to beg permission to take out Mugabe. I am convinced they pledged allegiance to a long term Chinese rule of Zimbabwe in exchange for short term rule.</p>

<p>The Chines have a temporarily failed attempt at a rival to the Panama Canal in Central America. Chile, Ecuador, and Brazil have opened their countries up to large inflixes of Yuan in exchange for capital investments. Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique and soon when the Chinese fuck over the Subcontinental investors in South Africa China will ne the world leader.</p>

<p>When the west gave up on imperialism Russia and China tried to take the ball. China has it, Russia is bogged down with Euro centric battles in the Ukraine and Balkans. It is Chinas time on the main stage and they will dominate in a fashion that makes Led Zeppelin look like Demi Lovato. Move up and let the man go thru. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wall st created both the soviet union and modern china - to further the nwo agenda using hegelian dialectic you need to control both sides (both the thesis and the antithesis). wall street is controlled by the knights of malta who are the successors of the templars, the inventors of international banking.</p>

<p>the social experiments in the communist world are simply the latest iterations of jesuit reductions and serve(d) a purpose of developing a collectivist, totalitarian society and a practical body of knowledge on how to run these types of opressive systems.<br/>
the nwo is all about combining and applying all the worst elements of these experiments globally.  this system is feudal for the masses, fascistic for the state and corporations and luciferian for the elites.  </p>

<p>this is why everything is stacked against us; city life, pollution and big ag/pharma are meant to weaken us, msm to distract and brainwash us, education system to dumben us, central banking to extract our wealth, etc, so we are unable to resist this slide into tyranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s this insightful article from last May about China systematically dismantled CIA spying efforts in the country from 2010, killing or jailing around 20 covert sources.
<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/china-killed-jailed-cia-spies-170521082959779.html">http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/china-killed-jailed-cia-spies-170521082959779.html</a></p>

<p>Then last week, the double agent is arrested and publicly named.  They also think he shared information with Russia.
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/china/amp/cia-china-turncoat-lee-may-have-compromised-u-s-spies-n839316">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/china/amp/cia-china-turncoat-lee-may-have-compromised-u-s-spies-n839316</a></p>

<p>Which explains why a few top Russian FSB hackers were arrested by the Kremlin </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Mikhailov served in the F.S.B.’s Center for Information Security, the agency’s cyberintelligence branch, which has been implicated in the American election hacking. But it is not clear whether the arrest was related to those intrusions.</p>

<p>He was detained along with one of Russia’s leading private-sector cybersecurity experts, Ruslan Stoyanov, the head of computer incident response investigations at the Kaspersky Lab, which makes antivirus programs.
