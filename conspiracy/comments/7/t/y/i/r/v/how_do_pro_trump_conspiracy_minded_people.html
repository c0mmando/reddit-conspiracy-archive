    <div class="md"><p>As a Jew I&#39;ll explain it like this: </p>

<p>I think he means to say that Israel leadership (not all Jews) leverages political dirt and western media infiltration to coerce politicians in the west to support Israel. Because Christians in America blindly follow Zionism (for biblical reasons), it&#39;s easy to turn the majority of Americans against any politician who stands in the way of Israeli nationalism (Zionism).</p>

<p>In other words, its impossible to operate politically in America without supporting isael because our largely Christian public is deeply indoctrinated, all politicians have exploitable dirt, and Israel has an extensive espionage apparatus which facilitates this dynamic through media manipulation and constant repetition of the notion that anything against Israel is inherently anti-Semitic, because halocaust.</p>

The recognition of Jerusalem as the Capital is a good move, imo, as it will bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table. I feel for the people of Palestine, but let&#39;s face it, you can&#39;t have leaders that begin their negotiations with a position of &quot;Isreal shouldn&#39;t exist.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Na.  I&#39;m semi-pro trump.  Didn&#39;t vote for him but support a good amount of what he has done.  My personal opinion is that he&#39;s not as up to speed with conspiracy as most Trump supporters on here believe.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s not playing 4-d chess.  I think he&#39;s just a normal businessman who genuinely does what <em>he</em> thinks is best for the country and some of that is in line with what I believe and some of it isn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>My father in law is a die hard Obama supporter but there are still things that he doesn&#39;t like about him.  </p>

<p>If you watch the Davos speeches this year you get a clear sense that the elites are gushing at how much Trump is galvanizing the US from the rest of the world.  One chick asked everyone to send her thank you cards to trump for being a perfect example of how nationalism is failing and that she would personally deliver them to him.  </p>

<p>I think they saw that by letting Trump get elected and doing his thing...they could spin it and do even more good for the cause of globalism or whatever you want to call it than even Hillary. </p>

<p>I think he&#39;s the latter but I&#39;d rather have a useful idiot in there than someone who&#39;s full blown in on it.  This is all just my opinion though...at the end of the day it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he really was in on it or even if he was pulling some 4d chess moves or whatever to shake the system up (although I think this is highly unlikely).  </p>

<p>At best I think he&#39;s buying us a little time to prepare for whats coming.  </p>

<p>More to the point, you can&#39;t make a president succeed by blindly supporting them. The better thing to do is voice your disapproval with the way they operate.

    <div class="md"><p>Not cognitive dissonance at all. It&#39;s childish to think that someone&#39;s going to go into battle with Faction A, and picks fights with Factions, B, C and D.</p>

<p>In war, the last thing you want is a two-front war. You don&#39;t make unnecessary enemies. </p>

<p>What did Voltaire say on his deathbed with the priest asked him he he renounced the Devil? &quot;This is no time to be making new enemies.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s main battle is NOT with Israel. It&#39;s with the New World Order crowd that wants to implode all nation-states. The same people are going after Israel, too. (Go Google George Soros attempts to collapse the Jewish state.)</p>

<p>Netanyahu is, in many senses, like Trump: a nationalist who is battling to stay alive as his intelligence agencies try to undermine him (and as the globalists want to erase his country). Putin is also in the same position. As is Urban in Hungary. Or Xi in China.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically the nationalists versus the Globalists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire deep state and mainstream media is against Trump. If Israel controls the deep state and media, then explain to me why Israel would be using the deep state and media to destroy their ally Trump? This just proves to me that Israel isn&#39;t the number 1 enemy like everyone says they are. Even John Kerry speaks out against Israel and he was in skull and bones secret society. I don&#39;t support Israel but I also don&#39;t think they are the main evil of the world </p>

    <div class="md"><p>((THEY)) have long been known for their two sided dealings.  I think Trump is meeting them at this.   </p>

<p>In public, Trump acknowledges/supports Israel - this gives Trump the ability to not appear anti-sematic.  </p>

<p>However, by doing so he can attack their media entities - and one thing they cant use against him is &#39;anti-semite&#39;.  They kept trying to though, in the media, by calling him Nazi repeatedly.  Pushing it on social media.   </p>

<p>Trump is playing both sides, just like they are.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If globalization means you can communicate and exchange with the other side of the world, then nothing. Technological progress does make the world smaller, and that’s a good thing (in my opinion).</p>

<p>However in the central planners’ mouths “globalization” means “global governance”, “global policy”, “global institutions”, etc. - all euphemisms for the morbid centralisation of power. That is an old communist dream (which they used to call internationalism).</p>

<p>That last proposition is akin to global collectivism and tyranny. It goes against history, which for at least 200 years has been moving in the opposite direction: <em>de-</em>centralization of power. </p>

<p>The end-goal of civilization is local governance and ultimately individual sovereignty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, ignoring the obvious globalism as a nwo tactic (if you don&#39;t believe that) just look at the EU and their unelected leadership (that&#39;s always fun), loss of individual sovereignty, culture, control of their own money supply, and basic financial bullying but the World Bank (see Greece).  I&#39;ll assume you probably don&#39;t see anything wrong with forced immigration quotes (and the resulting increase in bombings in cities like Paris) so i&#39;ll leave that out.</p>

<p>1st - If your business is Realty in New York, it&#39;s best for business that you are pro-Israel</p>

<p>2nd - If you are going up against the Establishment, you need allies.  The Saudis and Israels are powerful allies.  Before you say , &quot;well, Israel is part of the Establishment&quot;, think about how Israel was treated during the Obama Admin.  Obama and the Establishment began treating Israel like troublesome children sitting at the kids table, now they are back at the big people&#39;s table with Trump.</p>
