        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Israel conspires to brainwash the world that attacking Israel is akin to Hitler attacking jews. This allows Israel to change the argument about their actions into a racial attack. Israel has every right to exist jews to prosper. Palestine also has a right to exist and Muslims flourish. Both sides must be held equally accountable and both sides must abandon their current leadership and usher in an intelligent and equality governments built on mutual respect or the situation won&#39;t change. It is going to take many generations to get over the poison these destructive leaders have bred. But, that is the reason Israel must be opposed and Hamas Hezbollah be opposed. The reconciliation needs to start now.</p>

<p>Edit: the foundation of American democracy is freedom of religion. The second rule is the government being free of religion. We shouldn&#39;t support countries that don&#39;t do this. This includes Israel Saudi Iran and so on. </p>

<p>Definition of empathy
1 : the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner; also : the capacity for this </p>

<p>Hello r/all please disregard the racist comments. They do not represent intelligent arguments about holding all men accountable regardless of race creed or nationality that we need to have as humans. Please be civil and constructive.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind some of these racist comments are from pro Israeli groups to keep us from having conversations about ethics and accountability regardless of race creed or nationality. Look how Russia dressed as Ukrainians to fuel their taking of Crimea and conflixt in eastern Ukraine. You can also research how the US army dressed as native Americans to attack tgemselves to justify a brutal retaliation against women and children and the taking of the native peoples land. It is a common tactic used to further a cause. Don&#39;t buy into it. </p>

<p>Edit 2: certain people have extracted my IP and have sent me death threats and spammed my online accounts. Thanks. I wonder what pro Israeli group would want to doxx me? </p>

It promotes the interests of Jewish people and gives preferences to Jews -- even foreign born Jews -- over the interests of non-Jewish Israeli citizens. Israel was founded by and has expanded it&#39;s borders by ethnically cleansing Arab Muslims and Jews from Palestine  so the territory can be given to Jews, many of whom are foreigners to Israel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what OP is saying is that it <em>is</em> possible to be against the actions and course of the Israeli government <em>without</em> being anti-semitic.</p>

<p>Saying &quot;what the israeli government and military is doing to Palestinian civilians and territory is a horrible crime&quot; <em>is not an anti-semitic statement</em>!</p>

<p>OP isn&#39;t saying it has nothing to do with Jews.  He&#39;s saying that being opposed to the actions of &quot;the Jewish state&quot; is <em>not</em> logically equivalent to hating Jews.</p>

<p>I have Jewish friends.  I have Jewish friends who think Netanyahu is an enormous dickhole and that Israel should calm their tits.  What OP says is correct - it&#39;s got nothing to do with Jewish heritage or tradition, and everything to do with the actions of a state lead by a few individuals bent on doing horrible shit, using &quot;anti-semitism&quot; as a smoke screen to cover their crimes.</p>

<p>If someone in Denmark says &quot;gosh it sucks that America is (was) selling bajillions of dollars of weapons to Saudi Arabia, seeing as the sauds just use those weapons to kill yemeni kids...&quot;, That statement doesn&#39;t equate to saying &quot;I hate all Americans.&quot;</p>

<p>But if you say &quot;gosh Israel is being awful mean to Palestine&quot; you get throttled with accusations of anti-Semitism.  OP is just pointing out the logical falicy of that line of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad that you recognize the distinction.  Your voice carries extra weight in this discussion, given your cultural background.  The more people who realize that legitimate criticism of the Israeli government is not <em>by default</em> anti-semitic, the better everyone is able to separate constructive critique from actual anti-Semitism (which, of course, does exist mixed into the greater stream of discourse on the topic).</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely a delicate topic, but it&#39;s important that people recognize the distinction between legitimate criticism and bigotry.  Calling <em>every</em> critique of Israel &quot;anti-semitic&quot; just dilutes the meaning of the term and adds substantial confusion to the overall dialogue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Biblical Verses Saying that the Jewish People Will be Gathered in from Exile Only When the Messiah Comes</strong></p>

<p>Isaiah 11:1-12
A royal scepter will emerge from the stock of Jesse, and a sapling will sprout from his roots. The spirit of G-d will rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and power, the spirit of knowledge and fear of G-d… And it shall come to pass on that day, that the L-rd will once again acquire the rest of His people…and He will gather the dispersed of Israel, and the scattered of Judah He will gather from the four corners of the earth.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 37:21-24
So says the L-rd G-d, behold I will take the Children of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from all sides, and I will bring them to their land…and My servant David will be king over them, one shepherd will be for all of them.</p>

<p>Talmudic Sources Saying that Jews Are Forbidden to Return from Exile on Their Own and Create a State</p>

<p>Tractate Kesubos 111a
The Biblical book Song of Songs says: “I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the deer of the field, not to arouse or awaken the love before it is desired.” This oath occurs three times in the Song of Songs (2:7, 3:5 and 8:4). The Talmud interprets this metaphorical language to mean as follows: the speaker here is G-d, and the “daughters of Jerusalem” are the Jewish people and the nations of the world. During the Jewish exile, which began with the destruction of the Temple in the year 69 CE, G-d placed three oaths upon the world, two upon the Jewish people and one upon the nations. The Jewish people were foresworn not to immigrate as a wall (i.e. en masse) to the Holy Land, and not to rebel against the other nations. The nations were foresworn not to afflict the Jews too much.</p>

<p>Midrash Rabbah on Song of Songs 2:7
The reason for the oath against mass immigration is that if the Jews were to do this on their own, why would the messiah have to come to gather in the exiles of Israel?</p>

<p>Midrash Rabbah on Song of Songs 8:14
The redemption of the Jewish people is compared to the grain harvest, the grape harvest, the spice harvest, and to a woman giving birth. The common thread of all these metaphors is that they cannot be done too early. If grain is cut too early, it will not be good even as animal feed. If grapes are cut too early, they will not even be good to make vinegar. If spice is picked too early, it will not have a smell; it must be allowed to dry out on the tree. And if a woman gives birth prematurely, the baby will not live. So too, if the Jewish people hurries the end, they will not be successful, but at the proper time, may it be soon, they will be successful.</p>

<p>Tractate Shabbos 63a
The difference between the present era and the days of messiah is that in the present era Jews are in exile under the nations and in the days of the messiah they will be independent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is incredible bullshit.</p>

<p>One: midrashim (the plural of midrash) aren&#39;t halacha (religious laws), they are fables, stories and allegories meant to illustrate ideas.</p>

<p>Two: Psalm (of which Song of songs is one) are religiously inspired poetry, not halacha (laws)</p>

<p>Basically it is like an archaeologist in 500 years looking back at American society today and try to infer legal principles from Dr Seuss&#39;s &quot;<em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I am comparing his attempt to divine religious prescriptions and prohibitions from Midrashim and Tehillim to attempting to determine what American Legal principles are from &quot;Green eggs and Ham&quot;.</p>

<p>That is specifically retarded because the two have little to nothing in common.</p>

<p>The Talmud is not a compendium of Halacha (religious law) rather it is a collection of arguments made by famous Rabbis that were considered important enough to be written down- and the counter arguments to those arguments.</p>

<p>The Talmud is formated something like this &quot;If X, Y and Z happens, how much does A owe to B? Well, Rav Gamliel says C &amp; D but Rav Hillel says D &amp; E and Rav Shamai says that Gamliel is more correct than Hillel but not completely so we hold that you have to pay 1/2 C + 1/2 E and all of D.</p>

<p>So that applies to civil and religious laws but the laws themselves are in the Tanach, the Talmud for those laws is merely how the judges have ruled in the past when legal questions came up.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Talmud contains a variety of philosophy and thoughts and interpretations of various religious materials like Tehillim and Midrashim from which the rabbis draw from, not as religious law or official policy but as teaching materials and ways to show you things from different perspectives.</p>

<p>These last are what the guy is quoting as support for his claim that Judaism and Zionism are incompatible - and yes - quoting these parts of the Talmud for that purpose has about as much relevance as quoting &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What Jew miss, aren&#39;t taught, or reject entirely, is what ISRAEL <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>Abraham was chosen by God, <em>after testing his faith,</em> to father Yahweh&#39;s <em>church.</em> In those days, immediately after Babel, <em>races and tongues, as well as religion, had been divided amongst the fallen sons.</em> Abraham&#39;s <em>faith in Yahweh</em> is what made his the chosen lineage for carrying God&#39;s theology, and stamping out the Nephilim. </p>

<p>The key point here is that it was Abraham&#39;s <em>faith</em> which got his bloodline selected. Joshua and then David did God&#39;s will (again faith), killing these abominations, and the kingdom prospered incredibly under Solomon at least until his own falling to the influence of another god. <em>At which time Solomon lost his great wisdom.</em> Faith is what makes a person part of God&#39;s church, not blood!</p>

<p>The prophet Elijah had respect for the faith of Gentiles in Yahweh. So did Jesus. </p>

<p>The other part of the reason Jesus is taught this way in Judaism, is that Jesus rebuked the elect at that time for their racial supremacy ideology, <em>even though their own scriptures affirm His bringing Gentiles into the fold,</em> it isn&#39;t taught that way. But it&#39;s there! But the idea of &quot;being special/superior&quot; to all the other races of men is a hard thing to let go, big ego in other words. </p>

<p>The time of the Nephilim had passed, and the &quot;Gentiles&quot; were/are given the chance to come back to God. The prodigal son parable is directly related to this. The farmer is God, the good son Israel, and the prodigal one the Gentiles. </p>

<p>Just like in the parable, the good son got jealous and angry. Rejected that message from God. And have been through a whole lot since then as a result, namely the same generation that crucified Jesus. Interestingly, the horrible racial supremacy ideology of the Nazis towards them has not softened their hearts towards the Gentiles, as they have been empowered by another god (the symbol on the flag of Israel has not a thing to do with David) to perpetuate that <em>same horrible doctrine</em> on the Palestinians. While the Holocaust was indeed a horrible thing, it is exactly the ideology of their own racial supremacy, and is not that of the loving Yahweh.</p>

<p>Many rabbinical hearts still hold that anger, passed down from generation to generation, to today. </p>

<p>Interesting stuff! I&#39;m probably going to get blasted for a couple of these statements, and to those who get angry with them, I&#39;d like to say that nothing I said is out of spite, malice, hate, or anger. Only love, and a desire to see our family united under God!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is illegitimate.</p>

<p>source <a href="https://www.countercurrents.org/hart050410.htm">https://www.countercurrents.org/hart050410.htm</a></p>

<p>Zionism’s assertion that Israel was given its birth certificate and thus legitimacy by the UN General Assembly partition resolution of 29 November 1947 is pure propaganda nonsense, as demonstrated by an honest examination of the record of what actually happened.
Zionism is NOT Judaism.</p>

<p>Jerusalem is NOT a political entity reverberated around the world.
The relatively new concept of Zionism began only about one hundred years ago and since that time Torah-true Jewry has steadfastly opposed the Zionist ideology.</p>

<p>This struggle is rooted in two convictions: Zionism, by advocating a political and military end to the Jewish exile, denies the very essence of our Diaspora existence. We are in exile by Divine Decree and may emerge from exile solely via Divine Redemption. All human efforts to alter a metaphysical reality are doomed to end in failure and bloodshed. History has clearly borne out this teaching.
Zionism has not only denied our fundamental belief in Heavenly Redemption it has also created a pseudo-Judaism which views the essence of our identity to be a secular nationalism. Accordingly, Zionism and the Israeli state have consistently endeavored, via persuasion and coercion, to replace a Divine and Torah-centered understanding of our peoplehood with an armed materialism.</p>

<p>source <a href="http://www.truetorahjews.org/rabbinic-endorsements">http://www.truetorahjews.org/rabbinic-endorsements</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, to call Israel illegitimate is not anti-semite. In fact, it is the opposite. To call Zionism anti-semitism is to promote senseless propaganda. It is used to shut down conversation and criticism of Zionism (apparently the only ideology that cannot be criticized on Reddit or in the public education system).
Israel is being done in the name of the everyday Jew (you know, the reasonable people who make up communities). Zionism is opposed by MANY Jews. Zionism is a tool of geopolitics. It does not represent Jews. It is, in fact, very anti-semite.</p>

<p>I know, you a Black Jew ... If so, then read this:- </p>

<p>The Irony is REAL Jews are mostly still in Africa (The &quot;Elite Fake White Jews&quot; have so far refused to bring them into Israel).</p>

<p>While Israel were forced to fly in Ethiopian Jews, even just a small community, Israel tried whatever they can to suppress reproduction of Black Jews by forced contraceptive etc.</p>

<p>Apparently, many of the &quot;Lost Tribes&quot; can be found all over Africa and the US (some of the slaves). Interestingly, Black Jews do not follow the Talmud, the books that legitimize sins like pedophilia.</p>

<p>The Black Book of Communism claims he killed 20 million but this was a mistranslation from 2 million: all figures were accidentally multiplied by a factor of 10 by the English translator.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one writer&#39;s estimates and 9 million, if accurate, is still a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> less than 20 million, or 50 million, or 100 million. Also why aren&#39;t all the famines of the Russian Empire attributed to each Tsar considering how common famine was in the region? Did they <em>all</em> pay the clouds a regular fee not to rain? Shouldn&#39;t the Tsarist chronic inability to address famine be labeled an ongoing murder campaign? </p>

<p>The 1932 famine was caused by a number of factors such as drought, kulak sabotage (burning crops, slaughtering livestock, agricultural terrorism practically), 17 million people moving into towns, mechanization, Lysenkoism, etc. It was also the fastest industrialization in history and the former USSR hasn&#39;t had a famine since 1947 (itself caused by severe drought and war damage).</p>

<p>There were indeed inefficiencies and a measure of overlooking on the part of the local Ukrainian authorities which Stalin <a href="http://www.stalinsociety.org/2015/10/03/fighting-the-holodomor-myth-archival-evidence-that-stalin-was-unaware-of-conditions-in-the-ukraine-and-tried-to-relieve-the-situation-when-he-was-informed/">reprimanded</a>. He had been trying to prevent famines for years yet they kept occuring when collectivization was ignored. Then after its adoption... no more famines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1927, Stalin declared that the way forward was for people in each village to voluntarily unite their farms into one collective farm. This kolkhoz [Kolkhoz: A collective farm.] would be able to afford machinery, be more efficient, and be able to create a surplus to send to the towns.</p>

<p>After two years, when everyone had ignored his idea and there had been a famine, Stalin made collectivisation compulsory.</p>

<p>The peasants hated the idea, so they burned their crops and killed their animals rather than hand them over to the state. There was another famine in 1930.</p>

<p>Stalin relaxed the rules for a while, but in 1931 he again tried to enforce collectivisation. Again there was the same resistance and another, worse famine.</p>

<p>Stalin blamed the kulaks, and declared war on them. They were executed or sent to the gulag [Gulag: Russian labour-prison camps.].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s from the British government&#39;s high school curric. While I don&#39;t personally or philosophically agree with Stalin&#39;s executions, I can completely understand the reasoning behind it because I see it muttered every single day in America with calls for even more slave labor in prisons and demand for the death penalty that has been proven to kill innocent people but... everybody makes mistakes and these aren&#39;t declared state murders in the public zeitgeist.</p>

<p>To put it another way, how many people died as a direct result of British industrialization as a result of dangerous living and working conditions or basic lack of clean water? That was also influenced by people moving around too much due to appalling rent for capital to accumulate in certain areas. In The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 Friedrich Engels described how untreated sewage created awful odors and turned rivers green in industrial cities and the government even denied cholera could be spread by contaminated water. Are these deaths attributed directly to the British government? Starvation and malnutrition were standard. Not to mention the wholly intentional famines in Ireland and India, I could go on for a while, but relatively few are quick to declare murder.</p>

<p>Personally I just find these death toll attributions to be disingenuous. The USSR can be criticized for many things, such as the rape of Germany after WWII, but critique should be honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to see you going beyond the claim of a typo.    And you are right,  the victors piled up blame on Stalin disproportionately,  taking little blame themselves for hundreds of thousands of German POWs in their care who were virtually murdered.    Probably millions of Native Americans murdered by whites under the first 15 US presidents.    All under the rug.</p>

<p>America needs a Russia or the Muslims or the communists to be at war with,  or they will turn on their own and start killing them.    Oh,  wait,  it looks like that is started now too,  with extreme numbers of police killings,   extreme numbers of inner city violent crime in elite sponsored drug wars,  extreme numbers of imprisoned Americans.   But we give ourselves a pass on all of that.</p>

<p>Stalin executed a lot of people,  almost like Bush and Obama and Trump do with the drone program,  but probably even more,  in the tens or hundreds of thousands.     You don&#39;t want to stand up for the guy too much no matter how much the Soviet Union and its regions might have benefited from industrialization,  education or the advancement of medicine under his rule.   It was a ruthless time.    Russia&#39;s very existence was in doubt.   Drastic measures were taken,  epic,  but often inhumane.   </p>

<p>There was a turning point in the killing of humans by other humans,  when technology provided the means for thousands to be killed in a matter of hours or minutes.     Some of the killing is one by one still,   but most of it is done from a distance now,  and the weapons now are putting all mammals bigger than a rat at risk of extinction.</p>

<p>We need to keep all these deaths in mind and not be minimizing them or exaggerating them.</p>

&quot;You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&#39;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. But, because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is you are not of God.&quot;
Romans 9:6-8 -
&quot;Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.&quot;
Revelation 3:9-
&quot;Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.&quot;</p>

<p>And so on, and so on.. For a &#39;Christian&#39; the only path to the Father is through the Son. Except Jews! 
But to sum up what the Jew&#39;s Talmud  says about Christ. He&#39;s the bastard child of a Roman soldier and  a Jewish whore, who stole and praticed dark Kabbalah magic, and is now burning in hell in a pot of shit. 
And no Christ wasn&#39;t a &#39;Jew&#39;, they hated him then and now. They turned their backs on him. Ridiculed him at ever turn. Caused him to be crucified.<br/>
He is the FIRST CHRISTIAN. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comparing Zionists to nazis is absurd. It&#39;s fair to criticize the Israeli govt even though I think Hamas and hezbolah are worse than Israel. Yes they&#39;re supporting illegal settlements, but If Israel disarmed, there would be another genocide within days, meanwhile Israel and the Saudis are more than capable of killing all the shia in the region. </p>

<p>If Israelis were nazis, they wouldn&#39;t be allowing Muslims in Israel all the same rights as jews. If Israelis were nazis they would have never given back sanai or allow Hamas to run gaza, or allow the west bank anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://ourjewishagenda.weebly.com/the-shoah.html">What do you think of this?</a> Specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The gematria (numerical value) of teshuva is 708 (tav = 400; shin = 300; bet = 2; vav = 6). Therefore the missing vav  in the word תשבה, as written in the Torah (which equals the number 6) was a prophecy that the Jews would be allowed to return to Israel minus 6 million of our people: “You shall return minus 6 million&quot;; while the combined numerical value of the word teshuva = 708, indicates the year of our return </p>

<p>When we write the year, we ignore the millennia. In 1948 on the secular calendar, we witnessed the miracle of the return of the Jewish people to Israel, which occurred in the year 5708 of the Hebrew calendar, the year predicted by the incomplete word teshuva as written in the Torah. We did return, less the missing 6; that is the 6 million of our people who perished in the holocaust. Yet the fulfillment of the prophecy of our return in precisely the year predicted, as implied by the gematria of the word teshuva, gives us hope that the words of the prophets for Final Redemption will come true as well.</p>

<p>Call it what you like.    They think God is for America.    They are treating this country as if it was church.    Thats religion in my book.    Even communism became a religion.    You don&#39;t have to have a metaphysics with Jehovah for it to be a religion.    But the US does have a metaphysics with Jehovah as its guiding principles,  at least today a lot of people claim so.   and &quot;to the point that they take any attempt to criticize anything about the country as a personal afront&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>That’s certainly a justified fear. Far different to be in a war zone and afraid than to be in America petrified that Muslims are going for force them all under shariah. </p>

<p>Those soldiers were in prayer sessions. Sure. Not because the military is a Christian order but because the top brass from generations ago realized that was the best way to their soldiers complacent and ready to do their bidding. </p>

<p>I still think it’s vital that we try to educate people to learn the difference between religion and using religion, though. There are atrocities around us, committed by evil people including ourselves. </p>

<p>And to bring it back on topic, just because Israel is a Jewish state, that does not mean any criticism of its actions or policies are antisemetic. The divestiture campaigns for instance aren’t being done because of there are Jewish people in Israel, they’re done out of concern of the policies done by the state of Israel. Plenty of Jews inside and outside their borders criticize them because they’re able to see the distinction between a country and a religion. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t even know your history,   Isreael was being populated by Europeans starting with the British Mandate of Palestine (1920–1948)  Between 1929 and 1938, 250,000 Jews arrived in Palestine (Fifth Aliyah). 174,000 arrived between 1933 and 1936.    </p>

<p>Oh fuck off with that. Israel is a country, run by a government who make decisions. It is not above judgement, nor does judging it&#39;s actions negatively constitute racism. It&#39;s this backwards thinking that has allowed Israel to act beyond reproach. I can&#39;t believe people in the public eye are forced to apologise for criticising Israel as if they&#39;ve revealed their detestable racist streak. Fuck that. The Jewish church may be tied to the state, but the <em>religion</em> and the state are entirely separate.</p>

<p>One thing I like about modern Jews is that its fine for them to be atheists and still fully accepted as Jews,   that&#39;s real progress.    The jewish community/identity is more than a belief system,  its also a community with deep cultural ties that are mixed with religious symbolism.</p>

<p>When I was a kid,  I knew a few Catholics like that.    They no longer believed,  but they were part of the cultural community,   so they stuck around.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about Israel. I don&#39;t care for your definitions - the actions of Israel&#39;s government, intelligence agencies and military have nothing to do with any religion; they are not dictated by the wishes of the Jewish people of Israel or their religious communities. They are done for the sake of the state itself. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t criticise Israel for its people finding comfort in worship. They do it because the Israeli government engage in some nasty shit that affects a lot of people and then play the anti-Semite card when anyone dares speak out against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are evolutionary penalties for delusion,   and the old religions are long past their expiration dates,  chock full of total BS,   so yes,  I do object to the idiots who continue to take comfort from a bunch of stupid stories,  especially since they band together have the political clout to wreak havok in the world,  as Israel is now an example,  but so is Saudi,  so is America.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is a great place to expose the lies that people conspire to inflict on us.    Religion does not deserve any exception for its nefarious acts,  individually or collectively.     This is not the place to apologize or ignore what is really going on with religion.    Its a sickness,  and their gods are projections of a very conditional love that amounts to the justification of genocide.    Stop the make believe on this subreddit.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a complex problem that has a number of historical and cultural reasons for it. First that I can think of is that the West Bank and Gaza aren&#39;t really Israel proper in a legal sense. The territories of the two were never officially annexed by the government. The Golan and East Jerusalem were. </p>

<p>To offer citizenship to the Palestinians in the occupied territories (yes they are occupied, even Israelis say &quot;occupied&quot;) would be problematic for two reasons. One is that that would be a violation of what the PA (Palestinian Authority) exists for. Also with that, how can Israel offer citizenship to people are under a mostly military occupation. That is pretty immoral as those people would not enjoy the same freedoms as Israeli citizens living in the mainland.</p>

<p>The second reason (I&#39;m sure there are more) is that there is a &quot;Demographic problem&quot; in Israel when it comes to giving non - jews voting power. Here is the wikipedia on it: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 1950s, Shoham Melamad found that the high fertility rate of Arabs was viewed as a demographic threat to the Jewish nation.[15] Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, however, stated that Arabs in Israel should be treated equally to any other Israeli citizens and be allowed to have children just like any other citizen.[16] A 1967 Maariv editorial suggested that Jews should be encouraged to have large families, while Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and in Israel should be encouraged to adopt birth control measures. Schnitzer also advocated for the adoption of an open policy encouraging Arabs to emigrate from Israel.[17]</p>

<p>In 2003, Benjamin Netanyahu opined that if the percentage of Arab citizens of Israel rises above its current level of about 20 percent, Israel would not be able to retain a Jewish demographic majority, the basis of Israel&#39;s self-definition as a &quot;Jewish democratic state&quot;. Netanyahu&#39;s comments were criticized as racist by Arab Knesset members and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.[18][19] In May 2009, Michael Oren wrote an article in Commentary in which he discussed the &quot;Arab Demographic Threat&quot; as one of &quot;Seven Existential Threats&quot; facing Israel.[20] In 2005, Shimon Peres told US officials that Israel had &quot;lost&quot; land in the Negev &quot;to the Bedouin&quot; and would need to take steps to &quot;relieve&quot; the &quot;demographic threat&quot;. In 2010, Netanyahu warned in a government meeting that a Negev &quot;without a Jewish majority&quot; would pose &quot;a palpable threat&quot;.[21] In February 2014, then Israeli finance minister Yair Lapid said failure to establish a Palestinian state would leave Israel facing a demographic threat that could undermine its Jewish and democratic nature.[22]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarize, giving
 so many non - jews citizenship would be adverse to the goals of the Jewish state. It wouldn&#39;t be Jewish anymore. </p>

<p>That is why the two - state solution is the big one for the left, that it leaves the two populations alone to figure things out in their own respective governments. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a liberal Jew who spent some time studying in Israel. Ask away if you have any more questions or wanna debate, I love having discussions like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oy vey! The Holocaust meme has run its course. For older people the movies have lost their effect. For young people it’s like it was the best thing to ever happen to comedy. </p>

<p>Tell me, why we don’t have how horrible the</p>

<p>•Mongol conquests
•Holodomor
•Armenian genocide
•Bosnian genocide
•Stalinist Terror
•Taiping and Boxer rebellions
•Genocide through ongoing Sinicization of Tibet, E. Turkistan, Manchuria, and Inner Mongolia (shoah’d from media, perhaps because this one resembled a currently ongoing genocide too much?)
•Rape of Nanking
•Mao Zedong
•Gulags of Russia (especially this one)
•Other Bolshevik oppression in the 20th Century throughout the planet (ESPECIALLY THIS ONE)</p>

<p>Et. Al. shoved down our fucking throats every day?</p>

<p>Don’t these events have the hallmark characteristics of the Holocaust too? Systematic murder and oppression, precisely targeted killing, and massive, massive death tolls. In fact most of them are way worse than the Holocaust in every perceivable way. And why is something bad suddenly worse when it’s done to another group? Would the Holocaust be viewed the same way if Germans simply did it to German undesirables? </p>

<p>Hell Jews aren’t even saints either, not in any stretch of the imagination. Read about who ran slave ships to America, who was behind Bolshevism, and who funded the European wars. There’s no group in the whole world that doesn’t have blood on their hands, and in the long run it’s a pretty equal amount. From the perspective of a historically literate minority living in America, the amount of blatant bias I see everywhere is sickening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with that, yes. </p>

<p>Saying the country is a shithole is separate from the people within it. Maybe the entire government is corrupt - how is that a reflection of each individual person or the race of those people? Maybe it’s a shithole because of political reasons. Maybe it’s a shithole because a certain foundation is keeping most of the money that was supposed to be given to the country. </p>

<p>A country isn’t always the sum of its parts. You can travel the world now and people will have some opinion of Donald Trump - I’ve heard a lot of negative opinions. Does that mean the people within the country are reflective of that person? I am from Canada - I was in Paris and this older couple spoke highly of Trudeau. Trudeau is a fucking virtue signalling pussy. I personally feel that you should just let everyone be, so long as they’re not hurting anyone. But I’m not reflective of fucking Justin Trudeau. I actually think my opinions are better and more realistic. More pure even. His are so superficial. I’m not not from a shithole because some guy from France said he likes Justin Trudeau.</p>

<p>Don’t be a pussy. Be strong and understand what “shithole” means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is as dumb as the other. People from shit hole countries genealogy ring nothing to the table. They&#39;re under/uneducated. They&#39;re poor and generally have little to not support structure once they get here. It&#39;s the difference between a homeless person moving into your neighborhood and a person moving in and buying a house. </p>

<p>Explain to me what is racist about not wanting homeless people in your neighborhood and I&#39;ll accept your positon s anything but being a mind controlled and indoctrinated sheep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re coming from a place where they were never allowed the incredible opportunity to improve their life like we have in America. They&#39;re born with nothing and to avoid dying with nothing they come here, not because they want handouts, because they want a chance. They&#39;re not here to steal from you or live off your tax dollars, they&#39;re here to work like everyone else to improve their life.</p>

<p>People from &quot;shithole&quot; countries have plenty of value to bring to the table. Just as much as any person, that&#39;s what makes America great. Immigration from any country brings other culture and people who are more patriotic than most lifetime citizens. </p>

<p>The reason many people think that it&#39;s racist to not want these people in our country is because people from these countries are predominantly black. I&#39;m inclined to say that it&#39;s wrong to assume other&#39;s intentions. Everyone has different reasons for wanting/ not wanting immigrants from certain countries. </p>

<p>Friend, after reading what you&#39;ve written here it seems like your main reasoning for not wanting immigrants is their seeming lack of wealth. When you place people&#39;s value on their wallets and characterize &quot;what they bring to the table&quot; by their education or their wealth, you&#39;re not giving them enough credit. Immigrants bring culture, a love of country, a different perspective than that of westerners, and incredible work ethics. Many of these attributes cannot be found in American citizens. America was built on competition, to deny people the right to compete based off where they come from(regardless of skin color) is ungracious, and it disgraces the fundamental ideals of the United States of America.</p>

<p>If your goal is to stop new perspectives from coming to america, to homogenize the country because you think people from poorer nation&#39;s somehow don&#39;t deserve the <strong>unalienable</strong> rights guaranteed by our constitution, then you&#39;re not racist, but you are ignorant and you are not American. A little compassion can go a long way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the long thought out response, because honestly this is a topic I&#39;ve thought a lot about since I&#39;ve seen the News Hour on PBS mention several times  or heavily imply that this was a racist statement. I understood how they got there, but I disagreed the first time I heard it and I disagree now that it&#39;s racist. I think the entire position is based in feelings and not reality.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.
The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.</p>

<p>The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income, to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. Refer to Technical notes for more details.</p>

<p>The HDI simplifies and captures only part of what human development entails. It does not reflect on inequalities, poverty, human security, empowerment, etc. The HDRO offers the other composite indices as broader proxy on some of the key issues of human development, inequality, gender disparity and poverty.</p>

<p>A fuller picture of a country&#39;s level of human development requires analysis of other indicators and information presented in the statistical annex of the report.&quot; </p>

<p>In this index Haiti (one of the countries specifically called out as a shithole) ranks 163rd. Norway (also specifically mentioned as a counter point to the &quot;shithole&quot; countries ranks 1st.</p>

<p>As soon as Israel has been returned to its 1938 borders there can be peace in the middle east.

<p>You really have a silly argument. Land is taken in war time. Welcome to Earth. There is no special circumstances in Israel that can&#39;t also be extended out to every other square inch of land on the planet. </p>

<p>Israel is the only country I know of off the top of my head that has even given land back that was seized in a <strong>defensive</strong> war (the Gaza strip and the Sinai peninsula).

    <div class="md"><p>My argument is that Israel is a new creation, a priduct of western imperialism, and a threat to world peace, and that it&#39;s not too late to right the wrongs done to the Palestinian people.  After a couple hundred years theres nothing that can be realistically done.  After 60 years, when many of the affected people are still alive (and most of their children, those who haven&#39;t been genocided by Israel anyway) there is still time to right the wrongs.</p>

<p>If the Jews want their own country there is lots of uninhabited land on this planet, so give the Palestinians their land back and let the Israels move someplace where they&#39;re not displacing the rightful owners</p>

<p>You&#39;re also ignoring (or probably dont know) the fact that the Jews were totally fine with the 1967 borders. It was the surrounding Arab countries that <strong>invaded</strong> Israel and started this whole mess. </p>

<p>Again, the Jews gave back Sinai and Gaza, only to get inundated by rockets. Still to this day. It&#39;s only their extremely sophisticated missile defense system that stops them. </p>

<p>It’s really not surprising that Israel came to be. The narrative that a culture came in a day and kicked out a country is nonsensical. </p>

<p>There was 100 years of Jewish community funded land buying and negotiations with occupying governments. Built on top of already established Jewish communities living there plus thousands of years of cultural and religious history tied to the land. </p>

<p>The day the Jewish visitors were told how to make falafel by the Ottomans is the day the obvious would happen. </p>

<p>Palestinians are the immigrant Arabs to the region brought in because Jews were arriving. If there were no Israel there would be no Palestinian.

    <div class="md"><p>Israel orchestrated 9/11 and needs to be held accountable. Israel&#39;s backers have completely circumvented US democracy (rr), via AIPAC. Israel routinely uses its influence over the US government and the US MSM to have the US military destroy it enemies, such as Iraq, Syria, Libya and Iran soon. Israel&#39;s representatives in Congress (Cardin, Feinstein, Schumer, etc, etc) have repeatedly attacked the 1st and 2nd Amendments and have pushed legislation designed to weaken the power of the American middle class. </p>

<p>In summary, Israel is a 70 year old cancer that needs to be excised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is illegitimate! Jews and all humans against Zionism!</p>

<p>The question is: How can you de-legitimize something (in this case the Zionist state) when it is NOT legitimate?</p>

<p>Leaving aside the fairy story of God’s promise, (which even if true would have no bearing on the matter because the Jews who “returned” in answer to Zionism’s call had no biological connection to the ancient Hebrews), the Zionist state’s assertion of legitimacy rests on the Balfour Declaration of 1917 and the UN General Assembly’s partition plan resolution of 1947.</p>

<p>source <a href="https://www.countercurrents.org/hart050410.htm">https://www.countercurrents.org/hart050410.htm</a></p>

<p>Zionism’s assertion that Israel was given its birth certificate and thus legitimacy by the UN General Assembly partition resolution of 29 November 1947 is pure propaganda nonsense, as demonstrated by an honest examination of the record of what actually happened.
Zionism is NOT Judaism.</p>

<p>Jerusalem is NOT a political entity reverberated around the world.
The relatively new concept of Zionism began only about one hundred years ago and since that time Torah-true Jewry has steadfastly opposed the Zionist ideology.</p>

<p>This struggle is rooted in two convictions: Zionism, by advocating a political and military end to the Jewish exile, denies the very essence of our Diaspora existence. We are in exile by Divine Decree and may emerge from exile solely via Divine Redemption. All human efforts to alter a metaphysical reality are doomed to end in failure and bloodshed. History has clearly borne out this teaching.
Zionism has not only denied our fundamental belief in Heavenly Redemption it has also created a pseudo-Judaism which views the essence of our identity to be a secular nationalism. Accordingly, Zionism and the Israeli state have consistently endeavored, via persuasion and coercion, to replace a Divine and Torah-centered understanding of our peoplehood with an armed materialism.</p>

<p>source <a href="http://www.truetorahjews.org/rabbinic-endorsements">http://www.truetorahjews.org/rabbinic-endorsements</a></p>

<p>To call Israel illegitimate is not anti-semite. In fact, it is the opposite. To call Zionism anti-semitism is to promote senseless propaganda. It is used to shut down conversation and criticism of Zionism (apparently the only ideology that cannot be criticized on Reddit or in the public education system).</p>

<p>Israel is being done in the name of the everyday Jew (you know, the reasonable people who make up communities). Zionism is opposed by MANY Jews. Zionism is a tool of geopolitics. It does not represent Jews. It is, in fact, very anti-semite.</p>

<p>Jews Against Zionism!</p>

<p>Our mission is to inform the world that the State of Israel does NOT represent Jews or Judaism.</p>

<p>Zionism is NOT Judaism &amp; Jerusalem is NOT a political entity reverberated around the world.</p>

<p>The State of Israel, however, paints a somewhat less cheery scene in terms of overall stability and safety.</p>

<p><em>According to the Global Peace Index (GPI) for 2016, Israel rates at 144 among 163 nations, 1 being the most peaceful country on the planet and 163 being the one with the most endemic violence and social unrest. Iceland is 1st, Syria is 163rd. The GPI calculates scores based on a wide range of actors, including political terror, displaced people, violent crime and perceptions of criminality, amongst close to twenty other influences. To put Israel’s 144 place into perspective, it ranks 29 places behind El Salvador, which has the highest homicide rate in the world.</em></p>

<p>If I were to speak candidly, giving charity to organizations that encourage Jews to move to a nation that is, statistically speaking, the most dangerous place in the world for a Jew, is anti-Semitic. Not intentionally so, there is no malicious intent in it, but the fact remains. It’s an action that’s runs against the best interests of the Jews.</p>

<p>source <a href="http://www.truetorahjews.org/dear-friend-jewish-people">http://www.truetorahjews.org/dear-friend-jewish-people</a></p>

<p>FIRST -- If one contemplates the two thousand years of our exile, take any hundred years even the hardest, one will not find as much suffering, bloodshed, and catastrophes for the People of Israel in the period of the Zionists, and it is known that most of the suffering of this century was caused by the Zionists, as our Rabbis warned us would be the case.</p>

<p>SECOND -- It is openly stated in books written by the founders of Zionism that the means by which they planned to establish a state was by instigating anti-Semitism, and undermining the security of the Jews in all the lands of the world, until they would be forced to flee to their state. And thus they did - They intentionally infuriated the German people and fanned the flames of Nazi hatred, and they helped the Nazis, with trickery and deceit, to take whole Jewish communities off to the concentration camps, and the Zionists themselves admit this. (See the books Perfidy, Min Hameitzor, etc.). The Zionists continue to practice this strategy today. They incite anti-Semitism and then they present themselves as the &quot;saviors&quot;. Here are two replies given by Leaders of the Zionists during World War II, when they were asked for money to help ransom Jews from the Nazis. Greenbaum said &quot;One cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in Poland.&quot; (G-d forbid). Weitzman said, &quot;The most important part of the Jewish people is already in the land (of Israel) and those who are left, are unimportant&quot; (May we be spared).</p>

<p>THIRD -- We see that most of world Jewry lives in security and under good physical conditions, and have no desire to go live in the Zionist State. Whereas many people have left the Zionist State to live under better conditions in other lands.</p>

<p>FOURTH -- The Zionists make a great deal of propaganda to induce people to immigrate to their state. If their state is so beneficial why do they have to make so much propaganda.</p>

<p>FIFTH -- Because nobody wants the Zionists to &quot;save&quot; them. The only way they can get immigrants is by promising poor people material benefits, and even then very few people respond.</p>

<p>SIXTH -- The Zionist State is always threatened by the dangers of war. Whereas the rest of world Jewry live in peace and security, (Except in a few places where the Zionists have undermined their security and fanned the flames of hatred)</p>

<p>SEVENTH -- The Zionist State could not continue to exist without economic support from Jews living outside of the Zionist State.</p>

<p>EIGHTH -- The Zionist State is on the verge of economic collapse, and their money is nearly worthless.</p>

<p>NINTH -- The Zionist State persecute all Jews who are loyal to their Faith.</p>

<p>TENTH -- They start wars that endanger the Jewish People, for the sake of their own political interests.</p>

<p>ELEVENTH - According to the Torah the path of safety is following ways of peace not starting fights with other nations, as the Zionists do.</p>

<p>TWELFTH -- Even if the Zionists could and would provide physical security it would be at the expense of our Faith and Our Torah the true People of Israel prefer death rather than life at such a cost.
It is therefore clear that Zionism is not the savior of the people of Israel. Rather it is their greatest misfortune.</p>

<p>What I said was than anti-semitism is hating jews.
What I implied was that anti-zionism is hating zionism, not necessarily jews. That you can hate one without hating the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews Against Zionism!</p>

<p>Our mission is to inform the world that the State of Israel does NOT represent Jews or Judaism.</p>

<p>Zionism is NOT Judaism &amp; Jerusalem is NOT a political entity reverberated around the world.</p>

<p><strong>The relatively new concept of Zionism began only about one hundred years ago and since that time Torah-true Jewry has steadfastly opposed the Zionist ideology. This struggle is rooted in two convictions:</strong></p>

<p>Zionism, by advocating a political and military end to the Jewish exile, denies the very essence of our Diaspora existence. We are in exile by Divine Decree and may emerge from exile solely via Divine Redemption. All human efforts to alter a metaphysical reality are doomed to end in failure and bloodshed. History has clearly borne out this teaching.</p>

<p>Zionism has not only denied our fundamental belief in Heavenly Redemption it has also created a pseudo-Judaism which views the essence of our identity to be a secular nationalism. Accordingly, Zionism and the Israeli state have consistently endeavored, via persuasion and coercion, to replace a Divine and Torah-centered understanding of our peoplehood with an armed materialism.</p>

<p>source <a href="http://www.truetorahjews.org/rabbinic-endorsements">http://www.truetorahjews.org/rabbinic-endorsements</a></p>

<p>The State of Israel, however, paints a somewhat less cheery scene in terms of overall stability and safety.</p>

<p>According to the Global Peace Index (GPI) for 2016, Israel rates at 144 among 163 nations, 1 being the most peaceful country on the planet and 163 being the one with the most endemic violence and social unrest. Iceland is 1st, Syria is 163rd. The GPI calculates scores based on a wide range of actors, including political terror, displaced people, violent crime and perceptions of criminality, amongst close to twenty other influences. To put Israel’s 144 place into perspective, it ranks 29 places behind El Salvador, which has the highest homicide rate in the world.</p>

<p>If I were to speak candidly, giving charity to organizations that encourage Jews to move to a nation that is, statistically speaking, the most dangerous place in the world for a Jew, is anti-Semitic. Not intentionally so, there is no malicious intent in it, but the fact remains. It’s an action that’s runs against the best interests of the Jews.</p>

<p>source <a href="http://www.truetorahjews.org/dear-friend-jewish-people">http://www.truetorahjews.org/dear-friend-jewish-people</a></p>

<p>FIRST -- If one contemplates the two thousand years of our exile, take any hundred years even the hardest, one will not find as much suffering, bloodshed, and catastrophes for the People of Israel in the period of the Zionists, and it is known that most of the suffering of this century was caused by the Zionists, as our Rabbis warned us would be the case.</p>

<p>SECOND -- It is openly stated in books written by the founders of Zionism that the means by which they planned to establish a state was by instigating anti-Semitism, and undermining the security of the Jews in all the lands of the world, until they would be forced to flee to their state. And thus they did - They intentionally infuriated the German people and fanned the flames of Nazi hatred, and they helped the Nazis, with trickery and deceit, to take whole Jewish communities off to the concentration camps, and the Zionists themselves admit this. (See the books Perfidy, Min Hameitzor, etc.). The Zionists continue to practice this strategy today. They incite anti-Semitism and then they present themselves as the &quot;saviors&quot;. Here are two replies given by Leaders of the Zionists during World War II, when they were asked for money to help ransom Jews from the Nazis. Greenbaum said &quot;One cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in Poland.&quot; (G-d forbid). Weitzman said, &quot;The most important part of the Jewish people is already in the land (of Israel) and those who are left, are unimportant&quot; (May we be spared).</p>

<p>THIRD -- We see that most of world Jewry lives in security and under good physical conditions, and have no desire to go live in the Zionist State. Whereas many people have left the Zionist State to live under better conditions in other lands.</p>

<p>FOURTH -- The Zionists make a great deal of propaganda to induce people to immigrate to their state. If their state is so beneficial why do they have to make so much propaganda.</p>

<p>FIFTH -- Because nobody wants the Zionists to &quot;save&quot; them. The only way they can get immigrants is by promising poor people material benefits, and even then very few people respond.</p>

<p>SIXTH -- The Zionist State is always threatened by the dangers of war. Whereas the rest of world Jewry live in peace and security, (Except in a few places where the Zionists have undermined their security and fanned the flames of hatred)</p>

<p>SEVENTH -- The Zionist State could not continue to exist without economic support from Jews living outside of the Zionist State.</p>

<p>EIGHTH -- The Zionist State is on the verge of economic collapse, and their money is nearly worthless.</p>

<p>NINTH -- The Zionist State persecute all Jews who are loyal to their Faith.</p>

<p>TENTH -- They start wars that endanger the Jewish People, for the sake of their own political interests.</p>

<p>ELEVENTH - According to the Torah the path of safety is following ways of peace not starting fights with other nations, as the Zionists do.</p>

<p>TWELFTH -- Even if the Zionists could and would provide physical security it would be at the expense of our Faith and Our Torah the true People of Israel prefer death rather than life at such a cost.
It is therefore clear that Zionism is not the savior of the people of Israel. Rather it is their greatest misfortune.</p>

<p>You are neglecting to mention the McCarthy era of the late 1940s and early 1950s. That was <em>definitely</em> an &quot;You&#39;re either with us, or against us.&quot; scenario in a big way. Bush II merely copied from the recent past and invented nothing.  </p>

<p>No. This &quot;Fairness Doctrine&quot; you refer to was <em>lip service</em>. That is it was there to con the public into believing media was fair. The medias has always been heavily biased, ever since the mid 1400&#39;s. Those who own the media control the public opinion and always have. I know what <em>you</em> are thinking. But what <em>you</em> are missing is that the era of the 9/11 horror show a lot of things seemed &quot;new&quot;, but in reality were merely brought to the light where they were in darkness in the past. Nothing original. Just a better focus. Nothing &quot;fair&quot;...then or now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about Cheney. Listening to Cathy O’brien’s testimon/speeches on MK Ultra, Clinton, Ford, etc. she kinda describes all the cruel, inhumane, and unthinkable torture and abuses she endured and was exposed to by various famous and powerful people in the government and then she kinda slows down and separates one from all the rest. Cheney. Says he is the purely most evil person she’s ever encountered. She can talk about being mutilated in her private parts and even showed an OBGYN the smiley face scar on camera to prove it. But she can’t talk about what Cheney did to her and others. Chilling IMO - sorry to go off topic </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is exactly dualistic.
The dual mind reinforces the separateness of self and other.
Tribalism Is a collective phenomena of this dualistic mode of mind.
Until we replace this internal conflict of self and drop the identification of &quot;I, me, my&quot; the external world will continue to suffer and push itself into Oblivion.</p>

<p>He was the leader of Palestine? So he was overthrown when Israel was established?
According to the Wikipedia page, he was just a low-level politician who advocated for Syrian control of Palestine. Something&#39;s fishy here. I don&#39;t think this guy was actually the leader. It wouldnt be so vague. For example, we all now who the leader of Iran was before the revolution. Why would leader of Palestine be so unclear?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They pretty much did.  In 1900, The Palestinian people made up over 90% of the population of what is now Israel, the second largest religious group in the area were Christians.  These people descended from the Ottoman empire and lived there in relative peace for over 400 years.  They have been almost entirely displaced in less than a Century.  </p>

<p>Also, the Balfour Declaration was written by Walter Rothschild.  It wasn&#39;t that the Brits were just nice and gave this gift to the Jews, it was that zionist elements of the British Government put the entire plan into place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they didn&#39;t. Terra Nullius is what the British claimed when they arrived in Australia. It means the land is empty with no inhabidents and they are therefore legally allowed to take it.</p>

<p>The jews didn&#39;t seize or take anything. The British had already taken over the area and they gifted it to them. </p>

<p>Notice that the common group here is the British taking land. </p>

<p>Also AFAIK Rothschild wasn&#39;t in the British government, and even if he was it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it was the British government who both took the land initially, and then gave it to the jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Aboriginals had a fascinating culture and the most diverse languages of any peoples on earth. All the different clans had their own launguage. At least they did before most of them were wiped off the planet. If you judge a culture by it&#39;s ability to farm and produce agriculture then yeah, I guess they were pretty terrible people. I would like to see you, or any other race, successfully farm Australia without modern technology though. Going by the same logic, Israel was very bare before the jews returned and developed water conservation and arid farming techniques and built cities where there was just desert. The Arabs who previously lived their weren&#39;t developing the land so what&#39;s the difference?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your speaking to an Autralian. They do not have special status whatsoever. It&#39;s unfortunate you think that. They round them up in police vans in the north and drop them back out in the bush to keep them away from the capitol city there.

<p>There was an extremely recent genocide attempt that was continuing until the 1970&#39;s, making it more recent than the formation of Israel, that was called the Stolen Generation where they were taking all the babies away and giving them to white people to breed out the race. </p>

<p>We didn&#39;t say sorry until like 10 years ago and it was still a big issue with people not wanting to do it.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t say anything about Aboriginals having any sort of treatment in Australia other than a disgusiting inhumane life that has been decimated by the British/Australians. And literally nobody cares. That&#39;s what bothers me. That&#39;s why I&#39;m doing this.</p>

<p>Not at all, I think every human being on earth deserves equal rights. I think there needs to be a solution to the problem because it can&#39;t (shouldn&#39;t) go on like this. I am all for equality and justice.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s why I say this. Partly because I like to draw attention to the Aboriginals, to create awareness, and partly because the hyporcracy bothers me. I hear a lot of Australians talk about how evil Israel is when they have no problem with our treatment of the Aboriginals. </p>

<p>I think what happened to the Aboriginals is disgusting. I think what happened to the Palestinians is terrible but ultimately it has been complicated. In both cases it was British Imperialism that has caused the issue. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not in the same way that American Indians have. They are treated very well by comparison. It is so hard to rectify for the Aboriginals at this point. They are nomadic people by nature so you can&#39;t stick them in some land and say there you go, they need to move around to follow the food and water etc. It&#39;s also a lot of desert and the coast line is the populated part of Australia (by whites) so they aren&#39;t going to give them beach front areas. In the North there are more traditional people who still live a &quot;native&quot; lifestyle but there is still terrible treatment of them. They are not accepted in society properly. Also because of this stolen generation a lot of them are what is reffered to here as &quot;half-caste&quot; meaning mixed race. So they can&#39;t live in the bush because they are lighter skinned and have no knowledge or ability or neccessarily any desire to live like that but they are outcasts in society here. It&#39;s very unspoken but they just aren&#39;t accepted. I don&#39;t ever see them in the capital city I live in except for sometimes squatting in the parklands. These are mostly the mixed ones and they have big problems with alcohol becuase of the desperate situation they are put in. They aren&#39;t living traditionally there, they are just homeless. They might have special areas reserved for them in the middle of nowhere but it&#39;s not like in America, they can&#39;t really live a hybrid lifestyle. But the biggest problem is the Stolen Generation, they have no connection with their Aboriginal heritage and aren&#39;t welcome in regular Australian society. They are just lost. It&#39;s terrible. Also they don&#39;t have a big homogenious culture, they are all seperate clans who speak unique languages so you would need to rebuild these lost clans which you can&#39;t do. </p>

<p>The whole things is a massive black mark on Australia and it gets zero attention.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Nomads doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t deserve an ancestral home, it just means their homes are very big. The Brits did do this to the Aboriginals because they forced them out of all the inhabitable places. And that is just the ones who weren&#39;t killed. Most of them were just murdered. In 1 state (which is an island) they were all marched into the sea and not a single Aboriginal was left. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am sure if the Aussie Aboriginals demanded, their grieves will be treated fairly. Is this the case with Israel?</p>

<p>Definitely not. They have demanded and received nothing. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with a single racist bigot in the world. If that&#39;s what someone is then I simply cannot agree with that. And I don&#39;t agree witht the situation in Israel. I think it&#39;s a terrible situation for the Palestinians and my heart goes out to them. I think they are absoulutely victims. Victims to everyone; Israeli government, circumstance, and their own government as well. They have a rich government who wants them to die for a PR war so they can receive more funding. They are being used as pawns. This is why rockets are fired from schools and hospitals. If Aboriginals fired rockets there wouldn&#39;t be a single one left. Palestinian government wants to provoke Israel into killing it&#39;s civillians. Why send rockets when it will cause disproportional deaths on your side? There is no other logical reason. </p>

<p>So I think Palestinians are very victimised people. I think the British caused an issue first. Then I think their government first should have accepted the orginal 2 state solution instead of getting them into a war they lost. Then I think their governemnt should be working to resovle the issue, not trying to get their citizens killed for money. And I think along the way, while I do beleive the ultimate intentions of Israel is to protect it&#39;s people, they have undoubtedly done the wrong thing to Palestinians which needs to be resolved. But I think from Israeli side, it has just been a series of escalations that have centred around protecting themselves. Not saying that makes everything they did okay, just that I think that is their primary intentions and their hands have been pushed at times. </p>

<p>Palestinians deserve to be free and Israelis deserve to be safe. Both of these things need to happen. </p>

<p>Theodor Herzl, the &quot;founding father&quot; of the political Zionist movement, described Jews as a &quot;race&quot;, and though the perceived definition of that term has morphed over time, it was and is quite accurate, as the primary factor that Jews rely on in determining who is (or is not) Jewish is bloodline heritage.</p>

<p>This is not some wild-eyed theory. It has been proven repeatedly through genetic testing, and has recently been accepted as a valid &quot;litmus test&quot; by rabbinical a authorities in Israel.</p>

<p>Jews are, in fact, an extended family. A &quot;race&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That was the false premise Herzl and friends used to sell Zionism, to Jews and to gentile sympathizers.</p>

<p>Jews, the tribal nation, were facing an existential threat at the turn of the 20th century, but it was not from oppression, as claimed, rather, it was from assimilation. </p>

<p>There was a very real fear that Jews were on the verge of becoming extinct as a unique tribe, race, ethnicity, because emancipation allowed them to interact, intermingle and interbreed with non-Jews as never before, and Europe, especially Germany and France, were at the epicentre of this looming catastrophe.</p>

<p>This was not an easy problem to solve, as most Jews were quite content to merge into the societies where they resided, and their gentile neighbors were increasingly welcoming their presence.</p>

<p>The Zionist solution was to forge a Jewish state, which would serve as a giant Jewish ghetto, where Jews would be prote ted from assimilation by being segregated from non-Jews, just as in the &quot;good old days&quot; before emancipation.</p>

<p>Assimilating Jews would then be convinced, or, if need be, coerced, into relocating to the Jewish homeland. And they were, first from Europe, and then from nearby Arab/Islamic countries.</p>

<p>And it worked. The Jewish ethnostate was founded, and the flames of xenophobic paranoia were rekindled and fanned, thereby stemming the dreaded threat of extinction by assimilation, at least temporarily.</p>

<p>But it isn&#39;t over yet. Nearly half of all Jews in the world live in the USA, and they are &quot;much too comfortable&quot; with their gentile environment; they are intermarrying and interbreeding at a rate that has many Jews, religious and secular, on the verge of panic, fearing the loss of much of the &quot;race&quot; to assimilation, yet again.</p>

<p>What will be done to &quot;save&quot; these assimilating American Jews? </p>

<p>Considering the drastic measures used in Europe, I shudder at the thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews haven’t had a place to live without persecution in hundreds of years. If you’re against jews having a fucking place to build lives for themselves I think that is pretty racist. And the Muslim-dominant countries that completely surround Israel feel that they deserve the land — because they are Arab descendants of the inhabitants of the holy land — and the Jews don’t — because they are Jews, and not Arabs. I think if you are against Israel you are indeed against Jews. Also, how can an average American make statements about a place on the other side of the world, when the statement is not based around freedom and liberty? If we have one international goal I’d assume it’s that, otherwise nobody asked our opinion. </p>

<p>And being against a country’s involvement in international affairs (as you said about Israel) doesn’t automatically mean that you are against the country as an entity — including its people. For example, it sucks that Russia is meddling in foreign governments, but if Russia’s authorities are doing shady things, I’d be against their authorities. I don’t hate Russia or the Russians. This is why I say it is racist to be anti-Israel on that basis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah I see, my bad</p>

<p>First thing that comes to mind is Christians hating Jews for allegedly killing Christ, that was pretty widespread in Christian nations. A bit silly to me because if Jesus never died where would Christianity be?? 
Another more obvious reason is simply that they’re an ethnic and cultural minority that’s very different from Europeans. They basically wandered Europe for years trying to find a living. People don’t like it when outsiders come into their land and start making lives for themselves. Same reason the Roma were always looked down upon in Europe as well. </p>

<p>Ok…fair enough.</p>

<p>But many groups have moved in to (non-christian) areas outside their homeland without facing the continuous persecution and ejections the Jews have. It has to be slightly more complicated than that, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t hate the jews. In fact I am more loathe to Christians who fully support the zionist ideals and there are many of them!  but the jews as a group are very similar to parasites. They leech off of their hosts. They also stick together rather well don’t you think?  So we have a parasitical group which currently controls the monetary system which has polluted all aspects of Christian culture including Christian eschatology. And you certainly cant criticize them right?  As individuals I rarely have a problem with a fake jew. It’s as a group and their belief that they are more special than the boy which creates the greater problems. Many of them don’t realize that they are actually luciferian - another major source of their natural diabolical nature.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great point of view. I have always been let down by all the anti-Jewish comments in a really good videos about such subjects. They always use the term &quot;Jew&quot; instead of &quot;Zionist&quot;. It is not like just some dude with a Jewish name is getting kickbacks from some world conspiracy. It would be like trying to relate world events to the fact most of the people involved have &quot;Biblical&quot; or &quot;Christian&quot; names, when in fact people follow this tradition even if they are not religous. It is just the Lexicon of choices. It&#39;s not like Henry Ford, Tom Ford, Harrison Ford, and some random dude name &quot;Insert Here&quot; Ford, are all working to control the world together. Henry Ford likely was, but his name means nothing when compared to the random Ford dude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that demonizing Israel is the solution either. From a US government perspective, Israel is a beacon of democracy and a key ally in the fight against terror. It&#39;s also not fair to say that Israel has no claim whatsoever to the land they and their ancestors had lived and prospered on for thousands of years. That doesn&#39;t mean we should turn a blind eye when Israel does something wrong, but we should still understand the importance of the state of Israel to the US and the Jewish people. A slant against Israel, in my opinion, is not solidly justified.</p>

You can spend many countless hours thinking about and discussing all these points but no endpoint is ever going to be reached because it&#39;s simply not a black and white situation.</p>

<p>The further conclusion I came up with after all this is that I genuinely don&#39;t give a shit anymore. Israel/ Palestine - it&#39;s not my problem and I&#39;m not going to waste anymore of my time wondering about it. Make peace with each other, kill each other, I couldn&#39;t give a shit.</p>

<p>I actually became a lot happier within myself when I started not giving a shit, and I transferred that attitude to any other situations which are intractable and unsolveable. I recommend it to anyone; stop giving a fuck about all these problems which aren&#39;t yours and the world is instantly a simpler place. Now if the news comes on about something Israel may or may not have done, rather than try work through it and see what&#39;s true and what&#39;s lies and where the agendas are - wow, I&#39;m exhausted just thinking about it. </p>

<p>Instead, just don&#39;t give it another thought and move on with your day. You&#39;ll be so much happier for it.</p>

Or what about the reason that we&#39;ve been continuously attacked since the birth of Israel in 1948? So yes, we may to conscript some of the barely 8 million citizens we have to protect our country. But trust me, having 60% of your governmant&#39;s budget go to military provisions is hardly what anyone wants in Israel, and has been a part of a huge debate for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if you look at history, that&#39;s not how it actually happened with Israel...Before Israel was officially recognized as a country, the UN made a deal that would divide it: half for the Israelis, half for the Palestinians; Israel accepted and the Palestinians rejected and started a war. Then Israel ended up conquering land in a war that they didn&#39;t even start. And this happened again in &#39;67, when every Arab nation around Israel attacked, and Israel ended up on top. Israel&#39;s land as you can see, was not gained through conquest, but rather from wars that were started by other nations that occupied the land.</p>

<p>And anyway, by your logic, if there&#39;s no reason for America to return its land to the native Americans, why would Israel have to return its land that was gained justly (or even if you claim it was unjustly)?</p>

<p>No they don&#39;t. Arab countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan have made peace with Israel but unfortunately Israel is acting like a little child wanting more, more, more! There is no placating this greedy little monster. Israel is like Nazi Germany when Hitler was appeased with the Sudetenland whetting his appetite for more territory. Israel is like a cancer of humanity, the country must be eliminated.   </p>

<p>You could apply this logic to every country in the world. Why haven&#39;t the North Korean people overthrown Kim Jong Un yet?

<p>You want the world to be black and white, and problems to be solved instantly. But that is a naive and unrealistic expectation.</p>

They don&#39;t care about human life and have no concept of non-combatants, only &quot;infidels&quot; and their destruction. Israel is a great way to help keep these animals in check.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After 40 years of Israel not being scared to attack children bc military bases are near, why would they continue to build bases there? Ctfo... Hamas and Hezbollah are corrupt businessmen who get paid to mislead Palestine and Lebanon to further the cause of Israel and Saudi.

<p>Its beyond easy for idf to dress as Arabs and launch rockets at Israel. The American government did this same tactic during manifest destiny so they could attack the natives and take their land. Russia did this in Crimea. Its a tried and true way to discredit your enemy...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for writing this. My hunch, based on everything I read) is that Isreal is a big player in covert operations and intelligence. They do a great job of hiding everything they do. It seems like many things that happen, politically, militarily etc can be traced back to Isreal. </p>

<p>I hate that I cannot talk about this stuff without being labeled as something I&#39;m not. I&#39;m not against any religion on earth... I feel that all of them are practiced in good faith, but there are a few extremists that give every religion a bad name. </p>

<p>I definitely separate the country with any majority religion in that country. Every country has made mistakes and every country is involved in conflict. Even many people in Isreal don&#39;t like It&#39;s leaders and their actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly is the holocaust? Is it the act of rounding up people and putting them into concentration camps? That really happened and no one is denying that it happened. But that is not the holocaust. The holocaust refers to the extermination of six million jews and their disposal by fire. All of the other people who died in the camps have nothing to do with the holocaust, they simply perished in the camps and are of no importance to the exclusivly jewish holocaust. The holocaust even has a jewish name, the Shoah. It is a scam, it never happened. No one was fed into the fires alive in a horrendous act of brutal genocide as the holocaust name and legend suggests. The bodies of people who fell victim to disease and natural causes were cremated for sanitary reasons. There was no plan for the extermination of Europes jews, this is a lie that was conjured up by the zionists to obtain Israel and it was the second time the lie was attempted in a relativly short period of time.</p>

<p>We are not holocaust deniers for questioning the jewish version of the story. The term holocaust denier indicates that we are denying an actual event that took place to the jews with the notion that we are mindless anti semites who wish to soil the memory of all those who died out of shear hatred. They avoid the fact that this alleged event is mired in false reports, fabricated evidence and fiction written for the sole purpose of exploiting human emotion to get the public to accept the myth out of shame, guilt and pity, three very strong emotions that are commonly used as leverage by con artists.</p>

<p>We are not deniers, we are sceptics. The holocaust is an event that seems to have quite a few discrepancies in it&#39;s official version and it is human nature and our right as free thinking individuals to insist on further examination of the evidence surrounding the event. The holocaust industry is up in arms over the increasing questions from the public and they are reacting exactly like con artists who have been found out and are doing everything they can to make their accusers go away. It is because of this suspicious jewish behavior surrounding the holocaust that we have become holocaust sceptics.</p>

<p>No foreign body receives as much foreign aid as Israel and the amount of influence pro-israeli lobbying groups have over American legislation should be cause for concern. Here you have the media loosing their mind over supposed Russian meddling in the elections, a talking point which anyone who has done even a small amount of research knows, as of yet, there is no evidence to support the claim, yet no one seems concerned with the influence another foreign state, Israel has on US policy.</p>

<p>The unabashed support for Israel and the Jewish plight in the middle east is tiresome. So much of their narrative rests on the Holocaust narative, and how once again they are being threatened. Meanwhile, no one seems interested in drawing the comparisons between Hitlers Nazi Germany and the current Zionist Israel. Its an ethnostate that engages in genocide, racial and religious segregation,  and racial supremacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you know absolutely nothing about Israel because all of your allegations are based on nonsense. Have you been to Israel?  Can you say for a fact that it&#39;s segregated? No you cannot. Put your money where your mouth is dumbass. Israel, like any country, has racial issues. In most countries there is a natural racial disparity. However Israel is far more progressive racially than a place like the US. But you wouldn&#39;t care to to know that because it doesn&#39;t fit your picture of what Israel is. Do you know what genocide is? Do you? Because last time I checked, casualties of war and opression from their own (Hamas and West Bank) government doesn&#39;t count. Arabs in Israel however lead perfectly normal lived. They work wherever they want, they learn wherever they want, they go wherever they want. They can even become ministers in parliament. The so called segregation you&#39;re talking about is something natural. A lot of the Arab and Muslim people in Israel tend to want to stick together and form their own communities. Happens all over the world. That&#39;s not segregation. </p>

<p>Israel holds no punches in their effort to create their own ethno state. They told us from day one, and they still tell us.

<p>Tripping over yourselves to say you like Jews while hating Israel is a canard. You’ve never lived in Israel and you don’t know jack shit about it except what the media and some asshat USD Liberty mouth breather says. </p>

<p>Come over here and spend some serious time. Four weeks, minimum. </p>

<p>If you’re religious (in this sub??) head to Jerusalem. If you’re into geeked out conspiracy and technology (in this sub!) come to Tel Aviv. If you like to get high and listen to hippies playing music on ancient instruments, come dwell on the hills of Tzfat. </p>

<p>Until you’ve spent serious time here, shut your ignorant media infested mouth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been to Israel. The minority want to annihilate Palestine and Arabs. Just as the minority in Palestine want the same for Israel. It is usually the uneducated who live in hate. Israel is beautiful cultures and fun. </p>

<p>However, its leadership is as corrupt as all other mega powers that have agenda politics. It must change and accept reconciliation with Palestine. Hezbollah and Hamas need to be eradicated to form a democratic peace zgovernment that allows women and men of all faith to participate. The waring members in Israel and Palestine must be stopped or peace will never happen. </p>

<p>The issue is not that one side is good and one bad. The issue is that both sides refuse to empathise and build a mutual respect for each other. In America, slavery and segregation has been outlawed for almost as long as Israel existed yet we still have issues. It slowly gets better though bc we took the step to change and went through the pain that brought. Many people died and the struggle shaped us. But looking to the future, we are all stronger together. Israel and palestine must do this too.</p>

They have low access to education and the pleasures of western society. They hate being denied. They want peace.

<p>Your prejudice is why the region is as it is. If you could grow as a person and reach out, the people growing hate would have no power. Yes bad things are going to happen but it is the only oath to a future peace. Americas going from segregated to integrated saw a bunch of violence but the more years that pass and the more people live side by side the better it gets.

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense to me.
If someone looked at a map of the Middle East and of all places (mostly horrible places) only picked out the second smallest country to be upset about - which just happens to be the only democratic, secular, science-driven, multicultural, stable  and... Jewish - there is something a little suspicious. Nobody can objectively argue that Israel is even in the top 10 of problematic Middle Eastern countries. Anti semitism is a reasonable explanation of why someone would try </p>

Nobody &quot;approves&quot; who you can vote for in Israel. If that were the case, why on Earth would they approve the Balad party or other parties that actively advocate the destruction of Israel? Did you know the 3rd largest party in Israeli parliament is the Arab party? You obviously have no clue about how the Israeli system works.</p>

<p>There is zero comparison between Netanyahu and Putin. Literally zero. </p>

<p>And please share the &quot;well documented&quot; documentation showing America &quot;drove&quot; Iran to change their system to religious theocracy. Of course, it&#39;s impossible that the Ayatollahs and their interpretation of Islam were responsible. Had to be America. And America also planned for their embassy workers to be held hostage and tortured. Of course. I should&#39;ve realized that. </p>

Dude are you for real. Do you not realize that this is a problem beyond what each respective government does. There will always be Palestinians who will not settle until Israel is destroyed, harming the path to peace. And there will always be Israelis unwilling to share the land, claiming that they alone should have it. A government will not change that, especially given that the West Bank hasn&#39;t had an election in more than a decade and the right wing has a death grip around Israel&#39;s government. However what I especially hate about your conspiracy is that you&#39;re so obviously anti-Israel that there&#39;s no reason to hide it. You pretend like you don&#39;t have a bias but really you&#39;re full of shit. Trying to get back on topic, I think that most of the people who hate Israel are anti-Semitic. Of course not everybody is, but a great majority are. All the BDS-esque groups and their supporters are vehemently anti-Semitic who do not believe that the Jews should have a state. Jews are targeted in Universities even if they have nothing to do with Israel. It&#39;s not just students either. Professors in many notable schools have either said or done anti-Semitic things in an inconspicuous manner. Lastly, the thing that pisses me off the most is the circlejerk going on in the comments. There is nobody giving significant pushback to your nonsense and therefore nobody learns anything. If you don&#39;t argue you don&#39;t learn when it comes to this stuff. Down vote me all you want because I couldn&#39;t care less.</p>

<p>That excuse or &quot;best friends a Jew&quot; excuse card is always conveniently placed on the table by Israel-phobes.

This situation of fake Jew commenter who is israel phobic is seemingly a daily occurrence as I am witnessing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jews support BDS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Martin Luther King exposed these fraudster BDS cults:</p>

<p>“When people criticize Zionists they mean Jews, you are talking anti-Semitism,”</p>

<p>“I can say with absolute certainty that Martin abhorred anti-Semitism in all its forms, including anti-Zionism,”—Clarence B. Jones, personal attorney and close adviser to Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

<p>“Martin… warned repeatedly that anti-Semitism would soon be disguised as anti-Zionism.”—Clarence B. Jones, personal attorney and close adviser to Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

<p>“Peace for Israel means security, and we must stand with all our might to protect its right to exist, its territorial integrity. I see Israel as one of the great outposts of democracy in the world, and a marvelous example of what can be done, how desert land can be transformed into an oasis of brotherhood and democracy. Peace for Israel means security and that security must be a reality.”</p>

<p>“Israel’s right to exist as a state in security is incontestable.”</p>

<p>BDS has three stated goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>An end to the occupation. = That Israel unilaterally and unconditionally completely withdraws to the borders of May 1967, removes all the Jews currently living in that land, and dismantles the wall that has been protecting Israelis from suicide bombers.</li>
<li><p>That everyone inside Israel is treated equally. = That Israel removes the Jewish character of the state from existence. For example the Israeli flag is seen as racist because it contains Jewish symbols (note that the existence of the crosses of St George, St Andrew and St Patrick in the UK flag would also be considered racist and thus turn the UK into an ‘Apartheid state’). The official stamp of Israel contains the Star of David – also seen as a racist law. These symbols of Jewish identification, are the ‘racist’ elements that BDS demands be dismantled.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘right of return’. – That Israel stops accommodating Jewish immigration (it defines this as a racist law) – and in turn is forced to permit millions of Palestinians to move to Israel (rather than to a Palestinian state as would occur in the two-state solution).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Israel&#39;s goals:</p>

<p>Israel&#39;s top priority is its continued existence as a state that is both a national home for the Jewish people and a democratic state for all its citizens, Arab and Jew alike. Israelis want to live in a secure country that exists in peace with its neighbors.</p>

<p>Conclusion: BDS is clearly the same maximalist Arab position as has existed since 1948. A public call for the destruction of Israel. Israel has a moral mission that supports all peoples right to Peace.</p>

I got into a small debate with one in a r/worldnews thread which resulted in me receiving multiple threatening messages from multiple accounts. When responded to I had accounts made to copy my own username and spread pro Israeli bollocks. After getting the Admins involved the issue was sorted, the Israelis really are a delightful bunch of people. Interestingly I have never seen or heard of a pro-palestine user harassing pro Israeli accounts in the same manner.</p>

<p>Here are a few screenshots of what happened to me, all the accounts are suspended now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a religious person, but given the rhetoric coming from the major players in the War on Terror™ which is, at it&#39;s core, being marketed as a religious war, it is surprising to contrast Islam&#39;s view of Jesus vs Judaism&#39;s view of Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>Islam:</strong></p>

<p>Jesus is the penultimate prophet and messenger of God.  </p>

<p>Jesus is a Messiah (Christ), sent to guide the Children of Israel with a new revelation.  </p>

<p>Jesus is the most mentioned person in the Quran.</p>

<p>The Quran teaches Jesus to have been born a &quot;pure boy&quot; (without sin) to Mary as the result of virginal conception, similar to the event of the Annunciation in Christianity.</p>

<p>In Islamic theology, Jesus is believed to have performed many miracles.</p>

<p>Muslim belief is that Jesus did not physically die, but was instead raised alive to heaven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Jewish Eugenics Conspiracy - Nazi&#39;s Science, Zionist&#39;s Belief. Israel&#39;s Forced Eugenics Exposed</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>“Eugenics is Nazi thing; the Zionists totally believe in it as a good science.”</li>
<li>“Eugenics science&quot; is Zionist strategy to fulfil the &quot;Jewish Master Race.&quot;&quot;<br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What’s wrong with Incest and Inbreeding?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Scientifically, The great hazard of inbreeding is that it can result in the unmasking of deleterious recessives, to use the clinical language of geneticists. Each of us carries an unknown number of genes—an individual typically has between five and seven—capable of killing our children or grandchildren. These so-called lethal recessives are associated with diseases like cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia.</li>
<li>Most lethal genes never get expressed unless we inherit the recessive form of the gene from both our mother and father. But when both parents come from the same gene pool, their children are more likely to inherit two recessives.</li>
</ul>

<p>But ... What happens to the <strong>Rothschild Inbreeding</strong>? </p>

<p>So, they didn&#39;t know about Eugenics back then? </p>

<p>Do they still do it till today?</p>

<p>Incidentally also discovered,</p>

<p><strong>The Holocaust Scam - &#39;Compensation Neurosis&#39;</strong></p>

<p>Survivors who were <strong>not former citizens of Germany</strong>, or were not part of the German cultural milieu, were entitled to seek a disability pension.</p>

<p>Psychiatrist Kurt Blumenthal went so far as to claim that many survivors were just <strong>pretending to have mental problems</strong>, when he wrote in 1953 about &quot;compensation neurosis&quot; or &quot;purposeful neurosis,&quot; which was ostensibly characterized by an attempt to portray oneself as having suffered great damage in order to <strong>increase compensation</strong> one would receive... Sigh.</p>

<p>It looks like Zionists need to study <strong>Ethics</strong> more than Eugenics.</p>

<p><strong>Jewish Eugenics And The Master Race</strong> </p>

<p>Still going on in Israel - practice of administering forced birth control on its Ethiopian population.</p>

<p><strong>“Primitive Jews”</strong> Jews of Bukharan, Georgian and Persian descent, whom he referred to as “primitive races.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t hate the jews. In fact I am more loathe to Christians who fully support the zionist ideals and there are many of them!  but the jews as a group are very similar to parasites. They leech off of their hosts. They also stick together rather well don’t you think?  So we have a parasitical group which currently controls the monetary system which has polluted all aspects of Christian culture including Christian eschatology. And you certainly cant criticize them right?  As individuals I rarely have a problem with a fake jew. It’s as a group and their belief that they are more special than the boy which creates the greater problems. Many of them don’t realize that they are actually luciferian - another major source of their natural diabolical nature.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might have agreed with you in the past until Israel built illegal settlements in West Bank totally unprovoked and against international law. Most of the world was against it but they did it anyway. If Israel couldn&#39;t compromise or live within a community of nations then it means then my opinion of their government shouldn&#39;t either. The state of Israel should be wiped off the map like Sodom and Gamorrah.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is exactly dualistic.
The dual mind reinforces the separateness of self and other.
Tribalism Is a collective phenomena of this dualistic mode of mind.
Until we replace this internal conflict of self and drop the identification of &quot;I, me, my&quot; the external world will continue to suffer and push itself into Oblivion.</p>
