    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. </p>

<p>I posted something here about al-Aweed getting released from detention in Saudi Arabia yesterday and it got zero traction and I didn&#39;t notice anybody else post about it either. THAT was the biggest story yesterday. </p>

<p>Shit&#39;s up. I&#39;m wondering if my posts are partially shadow-banned or something. The mods are definitely either compromised or falling down on the job. That recent rah-rah about a mod being attacked by TMOR also smelled like bullshit from a mile away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought you meant that Trump&#39;s support for Israel, and the fact that people tend to force themselves into changing their stance to be something opposite of Trump, will cause people to drop the mental barriers and perceive wrongdoings of the Israeli government just like they can see wrongdoings of the US, the Saudis, etc. </p>

<p>An example would be the Trans Pacific partnership. Before Trump opposed it, most Redditors opposed it. After Trump, most Redditors support the TPP. The same thing is probably true for Israel. Now we don&#39;t have people making up justifications. </p>

<p>Then you&#39;re in the wrong sub, aren&#39;t you? This is one of the few places on reddit which shines a light on the apartheid state that is Israel, on the litany of Israeli crimes and its infiltration of the political/media establishment in other countries. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a taboo subject which is frequently censored in other subs, and that in itself makes it worthy of discussion in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is actual evidence for that. </p>

<p>Joshua Ryne Goldberg is an interesting character. He was a Jewish American who wrote neo-nazi articles, posted anti-semitic stuff to Reddit, and a whole bunch of other things. He wrote an article for the Daily Stormer, a neo nazi website, that claimed &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for recruitment.&quot; His alias was Michael Slay. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On online forums Reddit and 4chan, under the name European88, he uploaded thousands of anti-semitic and racist posts as a neo-Nazi, and on the specialty neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer, he his alter-ego Michael Slay did the same.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/joshua-goldberg-the-fake-aussie-jihadist-had-a-hand-in-every-online-fight-20150913-gjlc30.html">http://www.smh.com.au/national/joshua-goldberg-the-fake-aussie-jihadist-had-a-hand-in-every-online-fight-20150913-gjlc30.html</a></p>

<p>This is the article he wrote for Daily Stormer, which was used by so many people as &quot;proof&quot; this sub is targeted by white supremacists and nazis for recruitment:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/5EBcB">https://archive.is/5EBcB</a></p>

<p>There is another example I am aware of. See <a href="/u/interrogatorybunny">/u/interrogatorybunny</a>. He posted a bunch of obviously racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. But his second post had proof he was actually a former <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> mod &quot;Bipolarbear0.&quot; This is one of his submissions: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/</a></p>

<p>If you see the image he posted, it says right on there &quot;bipolarbear0.&quot; Under his moderator account, he was very anti-conspiracy, but then he posts racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>Also see this post by <a href="/u/Amos_Quito">/u/Amos_Quito</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3klzcr/racist_stormfront_article_declaring_rconspiracy/">&quot;Racist&quot; Stormfront article declaring /r/Conspiracy as a &quot;Fertile Ground for Recruitment&quot; for white supremacists was actually written by Joshua Ryne Goldberg - the Florida Jew recently arrested by the FBI under terrorism-related charges</a></p>

<p>For example, the media yesterday was surrounding Holocaust remembrance. Many comments were made about making sure such racist oppression doesn&#39;t occur again, peace/love for humanity, etc. There has also been news of Trump making concessions to Israel, and the Mossad assassination book.

<p>The Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement. <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/">https://bdsmovement.net/</a></p>

<p>Israel is an apartheid state committing atrocities far worse than South Africa did against blacks in the 1980s. The entire world boycotted South Africa and forced them to end apartheid through economic sanctions, cultural sanctions and general exclusion from the world community.</p>

<p>Israel bombs hospitals, drops white phosphurus, imprisons children for throwing stones at tanks, actively steals and settles land they do not own and breaks every UN law passed against them by the international community.</p>

<p>How is this even possible?</p>

<p>Because of American veto protection at the UN Security Council.</p>

<p>The BDS movement aims to circumvent what our politicians will not. Sanction Israel through the will of the people. If the citizens of the US and Europe refused to buy Israeli products, refused to play concerts there (as Lorde courageously just did despite being called an &quot;antosemite&quot;) the consciience of the planet could force justice onto the Zionists.</p>

<p>This is what terrifies the warmongers of this world.</p>

<p>&quot;While there is no institutional segregation, Jews and Arabs have chosen to live separately in all but a handful of cities. Israelis all recognize that Arab villages have historically received less funding than Jewish areas and this has affected the quality of Arab schools, infrastructure and social services. Arabs are also underrepresented in higher education and most industries.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So draft laws that penalize ostracism, and hold your own dignitaries accountable. They speak a beautiful game, more hot air than action, though. Many of them beholden to belief systems and/or professional liaisons. (I&#39;m in the US, I&#39;m not judging.. I mean who the fuck am I?) Enable differing cultures, differing beliefs within your legislative class. If you speak sincerely, and I hope that you do, you can speak to your fellow Israelis, and show them the inequality they culturally allow. </p>

<p>I worry about civilian Israelis. The Palestinian people are being eradicated, but I am also concerned with the mindset of those on the fairer side of the wall, those that have been born into this war. We have been told you believe all of us inferior, and that we must submit. What are your beliefs regarding this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The international Jewish nation-within-nations, all possess a certain formula or pattern, and it is that pattern that I will teach you to recognize so that these Jewish lies will no longer have any effect on you. In fact, after learning the techniques for identifying these lies, you will find yourself laughing at the absurdity and preposterousness of most of them, and your reason and common sense, which the liars suppress by their insidious techniques, will come to the fore and you will no longer be able to take seriously the fictions that hypnotize so many Americans now. You will smile with wry amusement as the victims genuflect and open their wallets and tear ducts, and you will smile with joy as you spread the cure among your family members and countrymen. </p>

<p>It&#39;s true that during wartime or times of active hostility that all nations -- all governments -- will lie. They will lie to the enemy in order to deceive him. They will lie to the enemy in order to better destroy or to kill him. But there is one nation, one people, which behaves as though a state of war perpetually exists between itself and all other nations of the Earth. There is a nation that regards as its eternal enemies all other peoples of this planet, and whose attitude toward even its nominal allies and greatest benefactors is one of total mistrust to the extent that it continually deceives them. It is a nation which even has a special name for all outsiders, for all Gentiles, for all goyim, for all non-Jews. In their own religious writings, Jews even boast of their superiority over the goyim, which they compare to cattle. Cattle, of course, must be herded, and one of the best ways to herd them is to convince them that they ought to go in the direction that their owners desire. Force can be used as a last resort, of course, but if one can convince the dumb brutes that the slaughterhouse is really paradise, then they&#39;ll gallop over there with much less trouble. </p>

<p>Jewish humor seems universal in this decadent age. It is Jewish humor that dominates our mass media, and perhaps almost all popular humor these days is Jewish humor in the sense that if it not actually written by Jews then it is based on Jewish examples and shares in the Jewish spirit. But there is another Jewish humor, a Jewish humor not intended for gentile eyes, which is found in sources intended to be read only by Jews. In these private jokes, recurrent themes are the intellectual superiority of the Jew, the gullibility of White people and how easily we can be fooled by Jewish deception. As such, Jewish humor is very revealing. One such joke runs as follows:
On a train in czarist Russia, a Jew is eating a whitefish, wrapped in paper. A Gentile, sitting across the aisle, begins to taunt him with various anti-Semitic epithets. Finally, he asks the Jew, &quot;What makes you Jews so smart?&quot; &quot;All right,&quot; replies the Jew, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll have to tell you. It&#39;s because we eat the head of the whitefish.&quot; &quot;Well, if that&#39;s the secret,&quot; says the Gentile, &quot;then I can be as smart as you are.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; says the Jew, &quot;And in fact, I happen to have an extra whitefish head with me. You can have it for five kopecks.&quot; The Gentile pays for the fish head and begins to eat. An hour later the train stops at a station for a few minutes. The Gentile leaves the train and comes back. &#39;Listen, Jew,&quot; he says, &quot;You sold me that whitefish head for five kopecks. But I just saw a whole whitefish at the market for three kopecks.&quot; &quot;See,&quot; replies the Jew, &quot;You&#39;re getting smarter already.&quot;
Jewish psychoanalyst Theodore Reik, in his book Jewish Wit which deals with subliminal psychological meanings of Jewish humor, admits the existence of this Jewish contempt for the easily-fooled non-Jew when he notes: </p>

<p>All kinds of deception and cunning, of fraud and trickery, devised and committed by Jews, either to get money or to avoid paying money, are exposed and candidly revealed by Jewish jokes.</p>

<p>Of course, Reik and the Jewish joke-tellers are wrong if they limit the extent of Jewish lies to tricks that get them money. Far more important than a few kopecks or a few million dollars are the Jewish lies which garner them sympathy and reverence. Yes, I said reverence. For the key to understanding the most dangerous Jewish lies is this: Jews lie to gain sympathy and reverence -- the ideas that they want to plant in our minds are that Jews are terribly persecuted and that Jews are especially holy. </p>

<p>To someone whose eyes are open, the constantly-repeated mantra that the Jews are a persecuted people, a tiny powerless minority deserving of our help and deepest sympathy, is an insanely absurd idea. In reality, the Jews are undoubtedly the most powerful race on this planet. As I showed last week on this program, they are probably the fourth largest nuclear power on Earth via their &quot;home base,&quot; Israel, and through their extremely influential positions in the media and financial institutions of the West, they have effective control of our political system and the armed might of the most powerful nations in the world, particularly via their control of the one remaining superpower, the United States. In the West, virtually no news is broadcast, virtually no feature film is made, virtually no newspaper article is printed which has not first passed the gauntlet of Jewish approval. </p>

<p>Despite this massive power, the Jews paradoxically portray themselves as &quot;persecuted,&quot; and a large amount of their deception and lying efforts are concentrated on maintaining that impression among their subjects. </p>

<p>In the last half-century, the Jews have concentrated on telling lies about how much they were oppressed and how many of them died in the Second World War, and stories of their sufferings at the hands of the Germans in that war are omnipresent in their periodicals and on their television networks. Ask a schoolchild or your neighbor how many Americans or Frenchmen died in the Second World War, and your answer will be a blank stare or a shrug of the shoulders. But ask about how many Jews died, and the magical number &quot;six million&quot; will spring to the lips of even the dullest. The media bosses have done their job very well. The Jews&#39; catch phrase about what they refer to as the &quot;Holocaust&quot; is &quot;never forgive -- never forget&quot; and of course it is they who will never forgive Europeans for the unspeakable crime of wanting nations without Jewish supervisors; and it is we who must never forget the lesson that to question the Jews&#39; right to own our television networks and control our financial and political system is morally equivalent to -- and literally leads to -- throwing innocent Jewish grandmothers into gas chambers. Do you see how the idea that the richest and most powerful clan on Earth is somehow poor and oppressed checkmates any opposition and gives the Jews even more power? </p>

<p>But one weakness that the Jews have is that very contempt for our intelligence, their faith in our infinite gullibility. This weakness leads the Jews to be careless in their lies at times. And that carelessness opens the door to doubt and to reason. This Jewish carelessness causes them to lie in hilariously absurd and contradictory ways. Let&#39;s look at one such lie, one of their &quot;Holocaust&quot; lies which they told during the Second World War. As you will see, they can&#39;t keep their story straight. </p>

<p>In Zurich in 1944, a Jew named Stefan Szende published a book entitled Der letzte Jude aus Polen which was translated into English under the title The Promise Hitler Kept, published by Roy Publishers in New York. I quote Szende&#39;s claims regarding Jewish deaths at the Belzec concentration camp:
The trains coming into Belzec loaded with Jews were driven into a tunnel in the underground premises of the execution building.... Everything was taken away from them. The goods seized in this way were carefully sorted out, listed and ticketed and subsequently used for the benefit of the master race. It was to spare the staff at Belzec this tremendous task, which, of course, hindered them in their real job, that later on all Jews were sent to Belzec naked. </p>

<p>When trainloads of naked Jews arrived they were herded into a great hall capable of holding several thousand people. This hall had no windows and its floor was of metal. Once the Jews were all inside, the floor of this hall sank like a lift into a great tank of water which lay below it until the Jews were up to their waists in water. Then a powerful electrical current was sent into the metal flooring and within a few seconds all the Jews, thousands at a time, were dead. </p>

<p>The metal flooring then rose again and the water drained away. The corpses of the slaughtered Jews were now heaped all over the floor. A different current was then switched on and the metal flooring rapidly became red hot, so that the corpses were incinerated as in a crematorium and only ash was left. 
The floor was then tipped up and the ashes slid out into prepared receptacles. The smoke of the process was carried away by great factory chimneys. </p>

<p>That was the whole procedure. As soon as it was completed, it could start up again. New batches of Jews were constantly being driven into the tunnels. The individual trains brought between 3,000 and 5,000 Jews at a time, and there were days on which the Belzec line saw between twenty and thirty such trains arrive.&quot; 
Now, electrical engineers will be amazed at a &quot;powerful electrical current&quot; that does not obey the normal laws of physics, but then, since Jews don&#39;t lie, we must believe that the evil Germans did develop it and use their amazing discovery only at Belzec in a gigantic facility which was never found or seen by anyone. </p>

<p>Funeral directors will be intrigued by the other magical &quot;electrical current&quot; created by the Germans which can incinerate not just one body (which can take over two hours in the most modern crematoria) but thousands of bodies in a few moments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made the top part bc of this. It is a necessary topic right now as Israel is taking steps the Nazi did in building an ethnic state that attacks others. If you&#39;re not aware, Israel has recently started a plan to kick out all asylum seekers but only if they are black. They are using their secret police to hunt down blacks and arrest them. If they can&#39;t afford to leave, Israel is putting them in labor camps to have free labor to speed up their recent building in the illegally occupied areas. They are also not holding whites who are asylum seekers to the same standard. Israel has started a public campaign to demean blacks as dirty violent with character below whites. This is exactly what Hitler did to keep ethnic purity in Germany. It must be stopped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly is the holocaust? Is it the act of rounding up people and putting them into concentration camps? That really happened and no one is denying that it happened. But that is not the holocaust. The holocaust refers to the extermination of six million jews and their disposal by fire. All of the other people who died in the camps have nothing to do with the holocaust, they simply perished in the camps and are of no importance to the exclusivly jewish holocaust. The holocaust even has a jewish name, the Shoah. It is a scam, it never happened. No one was fed into the fires alive in a horrendous act of brutal genocide as the holocaust name and legend suggests. The bodies of people who fell victim to disease and natural causes were cremated for sanitary reasons. There was no plan for the extermination of Europes jews, this is a lie that was conjured up by the zionists to obtain Israel and it was the second time the lie was attempted in a relativly short period of time.</p>

<p>We are not holocaust deniers for questioning the jewish version of the story. The term holocaust denier indicates that we are denying an actual event that took place to the jews with the notion that we are mindless anti semites who wish to soil the memory of all those who died out of shear hatred. They avoid the fact that this alleged event is mired in false reports, fabricated evidence and fiction written for the sole purpose of exploiting human emotion to get the public to accept the myth out of shame, guilt and pity, three very strong emotions that are commonly used as leverage by con artists.</p>

<p>We are not deniers, we are sceptics. The holocaust is an event that seems to have quite a few discrepancies in it&#39;s official version and it is human nature and our right as free thinking individuals to insist on further examination of the evidence surrounding the event. The holocaust industry is up in arms over the increasing questions from the public and they are reacting exactly like con artists who have been found out and are doing everything they can to make their accusers go away. It is because of this suspicious jewish behavior surrounding the holocaust that we have become holocaust sceptics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is actual evidence for that. </p>

<p>Joshua Ryne Goldberg is an interesting character. He was a Jewish American who wrote neo-nazi articles, posted anti-semitic stuff to Reddit, and a whole bunch of other things. He wrote an article for the Daily Stormer, a neo nazi website, that claimed &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for recruitment.&quot; His alias was Michael Slay. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On online forums Reddit and 4chan, under the name European88, he uploaded thousands of anti-semitic and racist posts as a neo-Nazi, and on the specialty neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer, he his alter-ego Michael Slay did the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/joshua-goldberg-the-fake-aussie-jihadist-had-a-hand-in-every-online-fight-20150913-gjlc30.html">http://www.smh.com.au/national/joshua-goldberg-the-fake-aussie-jihadist-had-a-hand-in-every-online-fight-20150913-gjlc30.html</a></p>

<p>This is the article he wrote for Daily Stormer, which was used by so many people as &quot;proof&quot; this sub is targeted by white supremacists and nazis for recruitment:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/5EBcB">https://archive.is/5EBcB</a></p>

<p>There is another example I am aware of. See <a href="/u/interrogatorybunny">/u/interrogatorybunny</a>. He posted a bunch of obviously racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. But his second post had proof he was actually a former <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> mod &quot;Bipolarbear0.&quot; This is one of his submissions: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/</a></p>

<p>If you see the image he posted, it says right on there &quot;bipolarbear0.&quot; Under his moderator account, he was very anti-conspiracy, but then he posts racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>Also see this post by <a href="/u/Amos_Quito">/u/Amos_Quito</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3klzcr/racist_stormfront_article_declaring_rconspiracy/">&quot;Racist&quot; Stormfront article declaring /r/Conspiracy as a &quot;Fertile Ground for Recruitment&quot; for white supremacists was actually written by Joshua Ryne Goldberg - the Florida Jew recently arrested by the FBI under terrorism-related charges</a></p>

<p>Goldberg had a lot of different Reddit accounts: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/3knaoj/more_of_joshua_goldbergs_bullshit_on_reddit_he/">https://np.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/3knaoj/more_of_joshua_goldbergs_bullshit_on_reddit_he/</a></p>
