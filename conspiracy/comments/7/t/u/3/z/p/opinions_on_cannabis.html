        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’m curious to see how this forum feels about cannabis and its use </p>

<p>I feel that Cannabis allows you to perceive reality from an abstract perspective. </p>

<p>Science (maslow, Freud, and modern counterparts) mostly agrees that There are planes of consciousness. Weed elevated mine. When I’m smoking I have epiphanies that I would never have found sober.</p>

<p>I think a lot of it has to do with losing the burden that daily life adds to our mental capabilities.</p>

<p>When I’m high I don’t stress about bills, job, future, anything. It’s pure relaxation. This allows for unfettered delving into my own consciousness with no distractions. </p>

<p>This is the biggest drawback to cannabis as well. It’s captivating and euphoric, rewarding too. But when you are actually high, you no longer give a shit about “normal life.” This contributes to the “pothead” lifestyle and negativity that surrounds cannabis. </p>

<p>Using it as a crutch to escape reality is just as bad as drinking to do so. It’s easy to do too because it’s so fun. </p>

<p>I used it as an occasional mental and spiritual vacation from this oppressive reality. </p>

<p>Sigh... I wish my job didn’t random. <strong>Fuck</strong> this world and it’s corporatocracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve used cannabis for about 20 years now. However i dont drink alcohol. </p>

<p>Like any drug, the only trick is to quickly ascertain if it suits your lifestyle, or not. </p>

<p>In my work, i can smoke all day if i choose. I work in a creative job and most of my clients are stoners too. </p>

<p>Cannabis also agrees with me mentally. I dont suffer paranoia or psychosis from it. </p>

<p>I also dont use it to get wasted (well, not all the time anyway!). I like average strength and i&#39;ll smoke 1 spliff over an hour or two. </p>

<p>In conclusion: Cannabis is great, for <em>my</em> needs but everyone is different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moderation is key. Otherwise cannabis is a wonderful tool for spiritual exploration and analysis of the universe. It allows you to see through love instead of hate. That&#39;s why they don&#39;t like it. Alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, meth, pharmaceuticals all make you irritable, grumpy, sleep poorly, poor digestion, cancer etc. Cannabis is the cure to all those symptoms! Especially if not smoked as burned carbon is never good for you. But thankful cannabis contains many anti cancer compounds, making it less bad for you than smoking other things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An alcohol binge leaves me anxious and depressed the next day. It feels like it just washes out all the &quot;feel good&quot; chemicals. I&#39;m in my mid twenties and it took me several years of binge drinking every weekend and dealing with episodes of anxiety and depression to finally realize that. A lot can be said for the power of mindfulness meditations to help you get in tune with your body and brain.
When I smoke weed, albeit I&#39;ve been goin for super low THC/high CBD strains, I don&#39;t experience any sort of hangover. I love these type of strains because there&#39;s not so much THC that I get dysfunctional and the cbd gives some good relaxation and I nice body feeling. The small amount of THC that is there is enough to allow me to have different kinds of thoughts than what I normally experience when sober. It&#39;s just a nice thing to do once or twice a week for me on the weekends usually. I love this little weekend habit way more than the drinking I used to engage in.  </p>

He must have had surgery at some point to have the colostomy bag. Such a shame that this is the standard practice. Surely there must be a better option </p>

As for your other point, that’s why you don’t do drugs when you’re broke. If you keep having people front you shit and you promise to pay them back, it’s going to catch up with you when you can’t. The situations you’ve described are results of addictive personalities, foolishness, and poor lifestyle choices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to get too long winded, but for most of my life I had been a skeptic of spiritual and supernatural things.  Although people experiencing drug &quot;trips&quot; reporting things that were profound, I was &quot;sure&quot; that drugs were really just interfering with the conscious mind and making the experience <em>seem</em> profound.  The same way deja vu <em>seems</em> like a recalled experience when it&#39;s not.    </p>

<p>I know people who were all into Terrence McKenna, etc., and I always just felt like they were simply justifying their enjoyment of drugs by making it something more than it was.</p>

<p>However, after certain events (which do not include me trying drugs), I&#39;ve changed that opinion over the past year or so.  Like shamans and native peoples&#39; medicine men, I believe that drugs should be reserved for a reverent experience with the universal consciousness, and not just something to take because your bored and it makes you feel giddy, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gotta be careful and not smoke too much of the military grade indicas. Otherwise I’m borderline retarded the following day even when I’m sober. That’s my only complaint with cannabis and it’s easily avoidable. </p>

<p>Other than that I love it. A nice sativa or a lighter indica is my sweet spot that allows me to relax, take a mental break, and dive into thoughts that I otherwise wouldn’t come back to. I actually started a clothing line that is all about spreading the good news of cannabis and every waking second that I spent designing anything, I was toasted. The creativity and abstract thoughts really flow so if one wanted to harness and expand on those 2 things and more I would absolutely recommend cannabis. </p>

<p>Really like this vape oil called Alien Nightmare and there’s a wax called Death Star I remember being particularly badass. </p>

<p>Any strains I should keep an eye out for? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, man, I dunno. I feel the US has better strains compared to the Netherlands these days. Not saying there isn&#39;t good weed in Holland, but no one is allowed to really push the limits with dabs or edibles over here. It&#39;s a bit disappointing. Right now I&#39;ve got lemon bubble and LA cannalope. Both are definitely nice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weed is one of the most valuable, fun, and important drugs for personal growth- if you use it consciously. I use weed at night and zero alcohol, and I&#39;ve found incredible happiness and life inspiration. I&#39;m lucky to live in Colorado, and use mostly edibles.</p>

<p>In my view weed is also a clue that there&#39;s someone out in the spirit world there looking out for us. It&#39;s too perfect to be random, especially when you consider CBD.</p>

<p>Weed also opens people&#39;s minds enough to consider psychedelics. Psychedelics are the real big tool for personal and collective growth. Check out <a href="/r/psychonaut">/r/psychonaut</a> sometime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with your perception.</p>

<p>When I was young, my mother trained me to meditate, so I could work out my ADHD without drugs. She instilled in me the Eastern belief that, anywhere the mind can get on drugs, it can get there without.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had many inspiring experiences with cannabis and psilocybin, but I&#39;ve always done it with much respect and care.</p>

<p>But honestly, cannabis is a depressants, useful at times, but ultimately limiting your perception to a slower vibration. You want to cleanse yourself of the slower vibrations, and look to light, love, and the pure power of higher vibrations. Which is VERY dangerous to do, when medicated.</p>

<p>Yes it takes longer to get there, but when you do learn how, you have so much more awareness and ability to learn more sacred knowledge(things you can&#39;t really explain, but can only learn through experience, and guidance)</p>

<p>Always start from a place of love, and grounding yourself to the earth, so you have an infinite protector.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I started it removed anxiety and relaxed me.  After 20 years of (too) regular use it started to <em>cause</em> anxiety.  I suspect some of the downsides are the result of your body overcompensating in some respects.  Not dreaming seemed like a blessing but now I think dreaming is probably a healthy thing, even though sometimes they are nightmares. </p>

<p>I do agree it helps more creative thought. </p>

<p>As you say OP, it&#39;s a bit too easy to do regularly.  </p>
