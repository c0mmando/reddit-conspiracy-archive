       I think this would work. Can anyone see a flaws in my logic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Get two stakes and two laser pointers and two bubble levels. Affix lasers to top of stakes and levels atop the lasers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you should be able to point the lasers at one another and they should point directly to each other if the earth is flat since gravity pulls strait down.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might need a piece of paper behind so you have something to shoot the laser at.
      </p>
      <p>
       If earth is round then as you get a couple thousand feet apart gravity should cause the lasers to point slightly up rather than straight at each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way a hill or mountain would maybe block the laser so you need to fin somewhere flat or ideally a canyon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would this work?

       This isn’t about surfaces. The lasers will both be pointing through the open air. This is about gravity being mostly uniform. If the earth is flat and gravity always pulls down then the lasers should point exactly to each other if the stakes are level. If it’s round then they should point slightly up once get far enough apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this would be a way for you to disprove flat earth on your own and you can observe it yourself

       I think he's saying the experiment isn't worth doing, presumably because the only people who remain to be convinced won't be convinced by mere evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see any flaws with the experiment itself, at least in theory. I don't know if it would be feasible to calibrate lasers and levels accurately enough to get a reliable measurement, though.

       Gravity would ensure the lasers are both level. It’s the main thing that matters. You can just rely on a “flat surface” because that wouldn’t prove anything.

       To do this on a "doable" scale, a fine tool for measuring the distance of the two beams divergence would be easier than accurate level bases for the lasers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it could be done at 100' apart. Still would need scientific grade equipment and it gets pricey really fast.

       Technically, the earth is a polygon not a sphere.  It has LOTS of differently shaped surfaces.  It's so large though, perspective from space it is round.  Gravity will bend light, it's how we get the Northern Lights, but a laser, with a source at the surface of the earth, will continue is a straight path until it is interrupted (mountain, wall, cow, tree) the laser would, in theory, consistently travel further off the surface of the earth as it travels in its path. So if you shoot a laser at a barn, laser being level to the ground, and you are 5' away - the laser should be 5' up the barn (off the ground). If you were able to travel 100 miles away and were able to clear a path to the barn and again shot the laser 5' off the ground, the laser should be slightly higher or perhaps above the barn at this point. Take a basketball. Take a peice oof paper. Lay the paper on top the ball, the paper represents the path of the laser if shot level to the earth's surface. Eventually the laser travels AWAY from earth, proving its roundness

       I'm saying it's programmed into our language that the earth is stationary in relation to the sun. Just an observation. But anyway, if the earth were flat, and the sun local, would it not appear to our eyes that the sun is disappearing behind the farthest bit of horizon we can see?

       I’m not really sure what language has to do with this, nor do I agree with your interpretation. The sun setting refers to it movement relative to us, it in no way implies the Earth or Sun itself is permanently fixed in one spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, not in the way that it does. Things getting more distant grow smaller and smaller until they disappear form view, the sun will remain the same size (or even appear larger due to atmospheric conditions) as it moves below the horizon.

       The horizon is in the wrong place if you lived on a ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going by the mathematics of a sphere, when you are standing on the beach on a ball, the horizon would be at the level of your feet in the distance (because that's what a ball looks like),  and NOT at your eye level.

       Because if you are at the beach on a sphere - by the mathematics of a sphere - the surface of the sphere MUST ALWAYS curve down and away from the observer in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not what we observe in real life. In real life the horizon is at your eye level from o feet to 120 000+ feet, which is impossible on a sphere. Mathematically speaking.

       I dont understand the “at the beach”. Because if the earth is a sphere than it wouldnt matter if you were at the beach or in your backyard...but i think youre just not realizing just how large of a ball we live on tbh. The earth is so massive that you wouldnt see curvature like youre assuming you should. Look at video blogs on the ISS and watch when they point the camera outside. Even at hundreds of miles up you dont see the curvature so dramatically, its like being an ant on a ball the size of a major city. Its not like having your fingers stand on a basketball.

       What would be evidence enough to convince you? Im assuming video evidence isnt because all that is CGI right? If youve ever been on an airplane this should help you visualize...
      </p>
      <p>
       so being on a commercial flight takes you up around 30,000 feet, at 30,000 how much of your state (assuming youre in the US) do you see? Surely not everything....so how much higher would you need to go to see across youre whole entire state? Surely at least double right? Now imagine how high up youd need to be to see half the US, or even all of it in just your eyes without moving you head. Now imagine you see all the US, mexico, some of south america, and a huge chunk if the oceans all in one view....that much surely be pretty high up wouldnt you agree? Now thats just one side/face of the earth. Look at countless videos and pictures. I just think youre having trouble wrapping your brain around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can even build your own weather balloon type experiment with a go pro on it and capture curvature yourself. Look those videos up

       Specifically setting below the horizon may not prove the shape of the Earth but the way that it sets and the light that it casts on other areas as it sets does prove a globe.

       There is no other model that would cause the sun to set for you, but rise on the other side of the Earth. If the Earth were flat everyone on Earth would experience the sun set at the same time.

       Flat surfaces still exist, and the earths terrain is not nearly uniform enough for this to really ever be accurate without lab-grade equipment. Theoretically it would work, but it's not something that's at all easy to execute.

       Well you're gonna need to find a very large, flat surface and ensure both lasers are at the exact same altitude. Then you're gonna need something a little better than a bubble level. Then you're gonna need an incredibly expensive laser.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, it would work, but it's not exactly easy and it might be a bit challenging without dropping a lot of cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are plenty of ways to prove the earth isn't flat other than doing something like this.

       Ah ya altitude could be a problem. You wouldn’t need a flat surface though. A canyon would work well since you could see all the way across it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bubble level and a couple $50 lasers would do the trick though. Even if you can’t ensure equal altitude, you could still see that the lasers are not parallel as they would be on a flat earth. They would both point slightly up. Someone standing between them and a ways away perpendicular could see this. A foggy night would be ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don’t have to go super far or be super precise to observe gravity. Curvature of earth is 8 inches per mile. You can stand at two street lights and observe whether the lasers are parallel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure the worlds biggest fountain or swimming pool has to account for this as well. But I can’t find the story on it now.

       You'd want to go out to the ocean or a lake on a supremely calm day, where you know it's completely flat and the surface tracks the curve of the earth.  Shine laser pointers from two boats back at each other and paddle away.  From six feet off the ground the horizon is about three miles, and a laser pointer can go for about 12.  If the lasers are stabilized to be perfectly horizontal, and you stop seeing them after three miles, that's from the curve of the earth.

       Wouldn’t just a road work fine? You wouldn’t need to align the lasers necessarily, just make sure they are both individually level. They will either be parallel or not. You shouldn’t need to get more than a mile away, and even a quarter mile should be enough.

       They'd also have to be at the exact same altitude relative to the center of the earth -- a road that seems perfectly flat to your senses over a quarter mile could easily drop a foot or two, and then your lasers would miss wildly even if they're both flat.

       So you believe that a bullet fired from a rifle is affected by the rotation of earth, but then why does a hot air balloon hover in one area for hours on a calm day? Better yet a weather balloon that goes to 100,000ft and comes down less than 100 miles from its launch location?

       TL;DR: Take your height above the ground, multiply by 2 * PI, then divide by 24.  This will give you the speed the ground will rotate faster than you per hour.  It works for any units (Inches, Meters, Miles, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it does... kinda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you imagine yourself in contact with the earth, you rotate once around the earth every day.  As you travel upward, you keep that horizontal velocity (after all, what would have sped you up or slowed you down), but you're tracing a larger circle.  That means you'll start lagging behind the ground below you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, it's not hard to find out how much you're lagging behind.  Every foot you rise up, you gain 2 * PI feet in the circle you're tracing (about 6.25).  That's the size difference in the circle you trace in 24 hours, which means you'll be that far behind after a day at that altitude.  So, you can divide that amount by 24 to find the difference in speed per hour.

       No because you the plane and everything in it are all moving the exact same speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same when the plane is flying. Its moving the same speed as the planet when its on the ground, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does that speed go when it takes off?&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are suggesting is akin to jumping in the plane aisle and hitting the back wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coriolis isnt just about speed. Its about the speed the object is at at the equator (For example) and then higher or lower than the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are on a merry go round the outside is moving faster than the center, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Same principle with bullets firing north or south.

       What’s the deal with this “level” thing? Someone else made a big deal about having
       <strong>
        a level surface
       </strong>
       , but I thought it was obvious that having a level surface isn’t important. I asked them and they didn’t say why they thought it was important. I even said a canyon would work. Canyons aren’t level at all, in fact being not level is kind of a requirement to have a canyon. Why do you think having a level surface is important? How do you think this experiment is going to work? Maybe my description of the experiment didn’t make much sense or something, because someone else asked this same question.

       Althought I don't believe the earth is a ball Im not sure if its flat, but the moon doesnt stay in this position relative to the sun so the yin yang would only happen every so often.  I think the theory that Sunlight and Daylight are different.  The Sun and the Moon are both Electromagnetic and Emit their own light. Ones Antiseptic and the other is septic. The Suns electromagnetic field charges all of the noble gas that natural separates and condenses at higher altitudes causes the argon etc to make the blue to orange spectrum you see.  I don't believe with the law of perspective that the light generator and emitted from the sun is visibile from infinite distance through the earths atmospehre

       yeah more or less.  the bedford experiment worked as a model also because water would find level.  so if you use that as your ground and square from that you'd have a decent level.  but there are even more basic experiments you can do and that's just go to a body of water a known distance away from a landmark that shouldn't be visible and see if you can see it.  there will be localized refraction along the way but if it's a fairly consistent temp/humidity along the way (and you don't need to go that far out - 3 miles is sufficient) you can estimate that the refraction error that would happen.  this is why there are so many examples of this experimental model being performed that show no curvature.  it took 50+ years for the refraction explanation to arise as a potential reason for error, but even after this there were experiments done demonstrating it was not a reproduceable result.  another test you can do, which is common sense, is to get a theodolite or some other leveled viewing instrument you can rotate on the level plane and see if you see curvature from one side to the other, as you should be able to see the peak in between.  fairly common sense ways to provide smells of validity.  and i reckon you'll find the curvature model doesn't seem to fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       what the actual model is who knows.  all you can do is eliminate the ones that don't work.

       Lol actually I thought this would be an experiment to disprove flat earth theory that flat earth believers could perform themselves and thus might accept.

       As I’ve said a few times now, I am not a flat earth believer.

       When you title it "Test for FLAT EARTH u can perform at home", I'd figure you were assuming this was to confirm the theory seeing as this is a conspiracy subreddit and there are plenty of idiots who would come up with something as retarded to prove their retarded thoughts.

       And again, that’s why you are a dimwit and would never make it as a scientist. Scientists don’t simply appeal to authority, they perform experiments to either prove or disprove hypotheses. And sometimes those experiments come back inconclusive, but that doesn’t make them meaningless. It only shows that further investigation is warranted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, you misunderstood my post as being pro-flat earth, even though it was clearly agnostic to either viewpoint. You proceeded with angry screeching and personal attacks. You’re an idiot. Commence further angry screeeching, I’m sure. Have a nice day.

       Again, you are talking about an experiment to see/CONFIRM if the fucking Earth is flat or not.  Why in the fuck would anyone who isn't a god damned moron waste any time on this when it's just a known fact. 
 Calling me a "dimwit" when you probably spent an unreasonable amount of time thinking of this Grade 2 level "Science Experiment" is absolutely hilarious.

       Lol, do you understand what research is ? Do you think every "Scientist" performs his own experiments to ensure the theories that have been studied to death before becoming known as facts - are legit ?   Having "faith in science" is an oxymoron and such a ridiculous effort to sound smart...when it just did the opposite.

       You think that because I said your Laser-Stick experiment is stupid means that I don't "respect Science" ? lol

       You come off as a 14 year old kid, which I'm pretty sure you are. Have fun in Science class ! Maybe you can think of a cool experiment to show everyone how volcanoes work next week....I'm sure there's no published literature about them, so they are waiting for a boy wonder like you to come along and tell the world about them !

       The thread was a success. Someone explained why it probably wouldn’t work. The downvotes are likely because I didn’t make it clear I am not a flat earther.

       I’m pretty happy with it. Only you and a couple others were rude, and you’re the only one who dug your heels in after feeling dumb for being a prick because you thought I was a flat earther.

       Some peoples just love to mock, even when it's not needed. Your only problem, in this binary world, is that you didn't declare up front, with full disclosure, and absolutely definitely no ambiguity that they could winkle into like a sea snail eating into a mussel, that you are not and never have been a flat earther.

       Yep, it’s pretty sad. Goes to show just how heavily this sub is being brigaded, and that the Dunning Kruger effect is in full swing among those brigades. Without an inkling of consideration for the design of the experiment, they immediately attack and insult without having even read the post, probably.

       Well when you propose a scientific experiment so devoid of science and not even thought out... What would one expect?

       There isn't a laser level on the market that one could line up over that distance. A 10' base slightly adjusted would sent the beam well off its mark.

       I get the impression you're a flat earther making up stupid objections in the form of questions.  I get that impression because your questions started out dumb and are getting dumber as you continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, it should be pretty obvious to everybody that holding the pendulum in your hand would cause it to shake and sway, because nobody can hold their hand steady enough to replace a mechanical support.  That being so extremely obvious has me 99% convinced that you aren't seeking the truth, but just making up strawman bullshit to support a retarded belief system,
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, a Foucault pendulum is usually very massive, hundreds of pounds, because the pivot usually has a lot of friction for the precession force to overcome.  Holding a massive pendulum from your hand isn't practical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might not bother with further strawman arguments poised in the form of stupid questions.  That won't indicate anything wrong with my premise, just that I don't bother with educating the unwilling retard.

       Not such a daft idea, but you would need to scale it up a bit for the curvature to start having a noticeable effect. But it would happen. The beams would begin to point upwards and hit the opposing unit higher up. By scale I mean maybe starting out 1,000 feet up and moving them apart by 20 miles.

       Curvature of the earth is roughly 8 inches per mile. You could perform this experiment in most cities between two street lights.

       Altitude would be the biggest issue which someone mentioned. It would still be possible to observe the lasers though, you’d just have to look for them not being parallel rather than them actually pointing directly at one another but a few inches up.

       If you were to only say one thing about space it better contain how really big it is.

       The instruments you are going to use are too small to be of any use.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use to work on pool tables. For an 8' table we would use a 12" machinists level. A regular carpenters level would not suffice. Or not be the best for the job maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will never get the accuracy you need with a bubble level.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also installed pipe hangars across a mechanical room and industrial warehouse and tried to use a lazer level there and it was to no avail. Couldn't get a true enough reading and that's only at a could hundred feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some YouTube channel has an experiment with a laser across a bay and they have the same issues.

       With simple triangulation from already gathered data you can see the shape of the world through math.

       A machinists level would seem to work, something like this:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you could repeat the experiment at varying distance, which should alleviate the noise due to an inaccurate level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still you’re right preferably you’d want more expensive and sensitive equipment. $1500 would be more than enough for sure

       There are tool grade lasers they use for doing ground leveling and concrete work. But you are getting into the tens of thousands to get set up. And it's not going to work on global scales well.

       500 years ago they used a 66' chain some stakes and a theodolite to measure the world. When the data piled up they crunched the numbers and lo and behold the earth is round.

       Do the math. Try triangulation the nearest mountain to you and say Everest. 0' is a standard around the world. The median tide. Those heights are well documented and from sea level.

       I’m not a flat earther. Usually they only believe proof they can directly observe, so I was proposing something they could try themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding theory vs hypothesis, yes I know this lol. It’s telling that you decided semantics was your best course of action here. And please, say “it’s not semantics they are different”, because at that point I can be certain you have no desire for a real discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And at any rate, what flat earthers call a “theory” wouldn’t fit the scientific definition anyways, would it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you keep talking about this scale, this great unimaginable unfathomable scale. And pool tables! Worked on a pool table once, cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact, though, is that you could get a perfectly suitable level for under $1000:

       If you want to discuss the possibility of theoretical laser levels and what this would be like on paper is a hell of a lot different than attempting to do so in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try all you want it will not work with you kit being under 1000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the tried and true method we did hundre
ds of years ago is adequate.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they build a decent sized bridge they do not use a laser to "see" the marks. It is done on paper with math.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at survey crews one sees about town. They have pricey equipment and only do small bits at a time. The margin of error will grow exponentially when you get further away.

       A theodolite would work fine. I assume most flat earther don’t have one. Your point from the beginning was valid, but it doesn’t invalidate the point of my proposed experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lasers don’t need to be that far away and a mountain wouldn’t be blocking them, or it wouldn’t work. That’s why something like a canyon would be good, but a road would work fine.

       A bubble level works fine on a ball. Gravity pulls everything toward the center of mass, and the air bubble is less dense than the liquid so it floats to the top. A bubble level would work just as well on a flat earth as it does on a spherical earth too

       Ok but only if you promise to either accept it or disprove the math yourself. Deal?

      <p>
       Or, pick a flat earth proof like I just asked you for and I’ll do my best to disprove it. That seems fair to me. Otherwise I don’t think we will get anywhere with this.

       Good choice! Please explain why these links prove a stationary flat earth, and I’ll explain why I think they don’t.

       I think he's saying the experiment isn't worth doing, presumably because the only people who remain to be convinced won't be convinced by mere evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see any flaws with the experiment itself, at least in theory. I don't know if it would be feasible to calibrate lasers and levels accurately enough to get a reliable measurement, though.

       I’m not really sure what language has to do with this, nor do I agree with your interpretation. The sun setting refers to it movement relative to us, it in no way implies the Earth or Sun itself is permanently fixed in one spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, not in the way that it does. Things getting more distant grow smaller and smaller until they disappear form view, the sun will remain the same size (or even appear larger due to atmospheric conditions) as it moves below the horizon.

       I dont follow... Look into "reference Frames"

      <p>
       If you are on a plane and jump in the aisle do you fly to the back of the plane at 600mph??
      </p>
      <p>
       No because you the plane and everything in it are all moving the exact same speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same when the plane is flying. Its moving the same speed as the planet when its on the ground, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does that speed go when it takes off?&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are suggesting is akin to jumping in the plane aisle and hitting the back wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coriolis isnt just about speed. Its about the speed the object is at at the equator (For example) and then higher or lower than the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are on a merry go round the outside is moving faster than the center, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Same principle with bullets firing north or south.
