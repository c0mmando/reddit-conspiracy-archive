<p>Are you sure about that? There&#39;s some anti-Trump stuff, but the Trump shills don&#39;t let it get very far. And there&#39;s just as much anti-Obama, anti-Hillary stuff (not that I have a problem with that) and anti-Left/Democrat stuff that it really drowns out the negative stuff about Trump. </p>

<p>There&#39;s 2 posts about Trump on the front page right now. One has a somewhat misleading title (the &quot;Trump Pardoned 5 Megabanks&quot; thread) and the other is about his former Chief Strategist being  subpoenaed in Mueller&#39;s investigation. I don&#39;t see the problem. But if you&#39;re one of those people who views anything that makes Trump look bad as &quot;FAKE NEWS!&quot;, I can see how this would make you upset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for at least discussing it while only being slightly offensive in your delivery.  And i say that genuinely,  as time of others would have just been far more offensive.   But the 5 megabank post is something that im talking about,  it&#39;s a misleading title.  If you read that and move on, Trump just did something no president had ever done before and just fucked us all.  But if you read the article,  you quickly find that this has happened in the past,  he did NOT pardon literally ANYBODY, and only signed something to allow the 5 &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks (who,  mind you,  are holding a staggering amount of &quot;backed by a promise&quot; US fiat currency hostage). So the title should Have read &quot;trump signed the same shit the lat 3 presidents had to sign,  because if he didn&#39;t,  our economy would be in a death spiral&quot;. </p>

<p>What we should be focusing on in THIS particular sub,  is the fact that our currency is NOT backed by anything other than a promise,  given by an agency IN NO WAY affiliated with our federal government.  And that our banking system not only allows for this &quot;too big to fail&quot; structure,  but ENCOURAGES it to sow dependence on eternal debt.  This is slavery,  and you people are TAKING THE BAIT by constantly posting /politics bullshit.</p>

<p>pfft - you&#39;re just focusing on it so it becomes your &quot;reality&quot;.  It&#39;s like when you want a new type of car and suddenly see it everywhere when you used to only see a few.  Why?  Did they magically just sell a shit ton of them while you weren&#39;t paying attention? NO - obviously that&#39;s not the reason.  The reason is you became attuned to that particular car, you thought about it A LOT and then suddenly you start seeing it everywhere.</p>

<p>Your focus created that reality.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t like your reality, change your focus and what you behold will change accordingly.</p>

<p>But you would rather blame the mods and make some going away post in the hopes that everyone will realize that you aren&#39;t at fault for this perception.  </p>

<p>The truth is - ONLY YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much blame/credit goes to the mods. My opinion that this sub is not policed like other successful subs, where the mods are super strict about abusive language, and will delete shit left and right when people are assholes or post <em>anything</em> that doesn&#39;t meet the standards. The mods here, look the other way ALL the time when assholes are shitting all over somebodies comment, or the &quot;get help&quot; posts, that <em>stay up</em> even when actual mods are posting in the same thread. I&#39;ve seen it many times. The mods themselves post links to MSM articles that are 100% politics, but will demand that it belongs here &quot;cuz politics are one giant conspiracy&quot;, or whatever the excuse is for drowning out sub with endless links back to the left-right paradigm for more shit about Hillary or what have you.</p>

<p>Then. you have mods that create <em>new</em> fucking subs, because they can&#39;t police the one they are supposed to keep real. Not hating on that mod, it&#39;s just the wrong direction to go with that problem. Sounds like the mods don&#39;t agree on what a shitty sub is, and what it takes to make it a great sub again. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Eh, I disagree with this. There is plenty of blame to go around, and many of the mods are admitting there is something wrong and trying to turn the ship around. There are just others that don&#39;t seem to want any of it, for whatever reason (which I do have my personal opinions on, but, I&#39;ll keep them to myself). </p>

<p>Add in the complete shit show that was the &quot;election&quot; and it has turned damn near everyone into online keyboard warrior for &quot;their&quot; side. God damn everything is &quot;politicized&quot; these days, and people are ignorant/stubborn as fuck, not seeing that there is a bigger picture to all of this, and that they are being useful idiots. And that&#39;s not even mentioning the trolls and shills on both &quot;sides&quot;, who stoke these flames for the useful idiots.</p>

<p>Us users here are also, somewhat to blame, as well. If we do not post the conspiracy content we&#39;d like to see, then the sub gets filled with the political garbage. I&#39;m usually on the fringe/far out (you can check my post history), and many of my posts just get lost, and no discussion comes from it. I know there are others here as well, and over time they just stop posting, and leave for other places.</p>

<p>IDK, there are lots of problems, and no clear solutions. The only thing that keeps my hopes high, is that we are in the Great Awakening/Unveiling. We are ship heading into stormy Cosmic waters.</p>

<p>Anyways, just my two cents.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one saying he pardoned 5 mega banks.  He didn&#39;t pardon anyone.  He isn&#39;t the first pres to do what he did do,  and nothing conspiracy about it.  It doesn&#39;t belong here,  the title is misleading (which is why its fake news), and it&#39;s only here because the people here hate trump.  I don&#39;t care your political leanings,  hate trump all you want.  But there was no conspiracy in doing something the last 3 presidents had to do.  The real conspiracy is why even though the others also had to sign these banks off,  trump is the ONLY one who was rewarded with a title that would lead (the 90% Of people who don&#39;t read the article) the majority of us to believe he has made an unprecedented atrocity. </p>

<p>The boards are supposed to be pretty hush hush but you can find them if you&#39;re familiar with the boards.</p>

<p>there&#39;s also the r/cbts_stream sub here, it&#39;s actually really active for a sub that&#39;s been up for like 2 months or something. there&#39;s a youtube account and discord channel too, the last video i saw they had jerome corsi on. </p>

<p>Much blame/credit goes to the mods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eh, I disagree with this. There is plenty of blame to go around, and many of the mods are admitting there is something wrong and trying to turn the ship around. There are just others that don&#39;t seem to want any of it, for whatever reason (which I do have my personal opinions on, but, I&#39;ll keep them to myself). </p>

<p>Add in the complete shit show that was the &quot;election&quot; and it has turned damn near everyone into online keyboard warrior for &quot;their&quot; side. God damn everything is &quot;politicized&quot; these days, and people are ignorant/stubborn as fuck, not seeing that there is a bigger picture to all of this, and that they are being useful idiots. And that&#39;s not even mentioning the trolls and shills on both &quot;sides&quot;, who stoke these flames for the useful idiots.</p>

<p>Us users here are also, somewhat to blame, as well. If we do not post the conspiracy content we&#39;d like to see, then the sub gets filled with the political garbage. I&#39;m usually on the fringe/far out (you can check my post history), and many of my posts just get lost, and no discussion comes from it. I know there are others here as well, and over time they just stop posting, and leave for other places.</p>

<p>IDK, there are lots of problems, and no clear solutions. The only thing that keeps my hopes high, is that we are in the Great Awakening/Unveiling. We are ship heading into stormy Cosmic waters.</p>

<p>Anyways, just my two cents.  </p>
