<p>There is no special bloodline or chosen people.</p>

<p>Fear masquerades as Love&#39;s equal.</p>

<p>Evil is merely an illusion.</p>

<p>All of us have free will.</p>

<p>If you feed your fear you will become like they are, a beast.</p>

<p>Fools fall so that they can stand back up.</p>

<p>If we can learn to put our ego&#39;s aside, we can pick each other up. United we stand, divided we fall.</p>

<p>Or you could become like they are. You could become the beast that preys on fear. You might even make it to the top. Every lion grows old. A new king will take your place. And when you think it could not get any worse you will hear a familiar cackle. Here comes the jackals. Every beast becomes the feast.</p>

<p>Love is truly magical. Only Love will tame the beast.</p>

<p>I happen to know, you reap what you sow.</p>

<p>You do. Likely a different blood type than mine. Perhaps with a rhesus influence. Perhaps a different gender. And race. And a soecial combination of inclination to diseases, physical and mental limitations, and emotional and behavioral characteristics that are extremely different than mine. So many differences.</p>

<p>Yes, you will bleed as I would, and you probably have two legs and one head as I do. But even though we might share some common attributes, we are absolutely <em>not</em> the same.</p>

<p>Leave it to a thin skinned SJW to reduce a conversation on the totality of human diversity to a triggered and narrow consideration of race. Shame on you and the people that taught you this nonsense.</p>

<p>Human diversity encompasses far more than skin color or nation of origin. If you don’t accept this truth before venturing from your safe space, it is certain to shock you when you come out to participate in the real world.</p>

<p>Not with an ‘honest’ thought, no. Honest thinking leads me to conclude that person will never be cognizant of the concept of ‘purpose’, let alone a purpose as noble and unachievable as you suggest.</p>

<p>Honest thinking has me doubting that person would ever be capable of purposeful endeavor to ‘make others’ do <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>Why don’t you take a moment to explain how your <em>”honest thought”</em> leads you to conclude that person’s purpose in life is to ‘make’ other people do anything at all. Then tell us how you honestly think that person will actively engage in cognizant pursuit of fulfillment of that purpose.</p>

That was a solid response to your assertion, and to your suggestion I was being less than honest if I didn’t believe as you.

You claimed this child’s purpose was to <em>”make”</em> other people appreciate  what they have. I disagreed. This child is incapable of making anybody do anything.
<em>Is that not a purpose?</em>
Not in my view.
<em>I then suggested that this could spark gratefulnes for what others have</em>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If you feed your fear you will become like they are, a beast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please clarify, because you&#39;re contradicting yourself. Are we all the same or not? Perhaps you&#39;re onto something, but it seems to me you haven&#39;t yet thought this whole thing through, though I could be wrong.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly we are all connected. Undoubtedly any individual&#39;s action has ripple effects that in some way, shape, or form will affect everything else in the Universe, however big or small. None of that means that we&#39;re all the same? I think precisely the opposite is true. We&#39;re all similar in most ways, but fundamentally different in most aspects that count. And thank God for that!</p>

<p>Good and Evil are very real, and you&#39;re correct that the battle is mostly occurring within the individual. That does not mean that there isn&#39;t a grand chess game playing out in the real world too. It also says nothing about some of those individuals belonging to historically powerful families/bloodlines or believing themselves to be chosen by God to inherit the Earth.</p>

<p>Fear also doesn&#39;t masquerade as Love&#39;s equal, as far as I can tell, though I may be missing your intended meaning. Fear is often the product of love. If I love my children, I&#39;ll fear nothing more than losing them. That fear is what drives parents towards taking on responsibility, though it can always morph into pathological behavior. That is not to say that undue fear isn&#39;t a problem.</p>

<p>Evil is also not an illusion (unless you want to argue that everything is an illusion). It might be relative to some degree, but that doesn&#39;t make it an illusion. What is the killing of innocent individuals if not evil? What do you call someone&#39;s frame of mind who consciously causes others to suffer unduely, if not evil?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of us have free will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do we? Did I have a choice in writing this comment? How could we know? I&#39;d sooner consider free will an illusion than good and evil. Or do we mean something else by the term? If free will exists, then it would seem to me that hardly anyone ever applies it. Do you decide to take a shit or do you go when the urge arises?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you feed your fear you will become like they are, a beast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. That&#39;s fair enough, actually. Fear, however, isn&#39;t useless. Feeding fear means avoiding that which causes the fear, which in turn seems to allow this feeling to spread into other aspects of your life, causing you to retreat ever-further from your own mind. In some sense, that leads to a vanquishing of everything that ever made you human.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fools fall so that they can stand back up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fools fall and remain on the ground. Heroes fall too, but they get the fuck up again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we can learn to put our ego&#39;s aside, we can pick each other up. United we stand, divided we fall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we put our egos aside, we&#39;ll be literally noone. An apathetic blob of flesh without emotions or aspirations. The problem isn&#39;t the ego itself, but the corruption that broke it, be it societal expectations, individual traumata, false or unsustainable ideas, etc. Heal your ego and you&#39;ll be surprised how bright the sun can shine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love is truly magical. Only Love will tame the beast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess, but really? Should we give Podesta a hug? Or is love alone not enough? What about Truth? Cause the truth fucking hurts. Do we even want to tame the beast or do we have to slay the fucker? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I happen to know, you reap what you sow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is undoubtedly true.</p>

<p><em>Perhaps to show his mother her drug use has very real consequences that affect others?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doubtful this child will ever speak a cogent sentence, let alone provide instructive guidance to the needful mother you assume for him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The babies life, while short, will certainly touch the heart of others.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No doubt, but not as a result of some conscious act to fulfill a purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>A purpose does not necessarily mean changing the world, or even effecting visible change you or I can see.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true. Nobody suggested differently. I know I didn’t. Are you trying to build a straw man?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you know this family?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Is that important to you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you know the effects this birth had on loved ones?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not. I assume this birth initiated a very challenging timeline for all involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Perhaps the child turned another&#39;s life around?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guaranteed no. This child never turned a phrase or anything else. Perhaps it managed to turn its head. It definitely did not yurn Nyone’s life around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Value is in the eye of the beholder.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed. Perhaps that’s why nobody suggested differently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Your cynicism and smarm toward the other responder, while cute, is quite worthless.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your ad hominems reveal a mind unable to realize a purposeful goal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>But even you have a purpose here, as you just reminded me that should I ever get to a place where I think like you,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your peculiar perception of my purpose is a reflection of your personal needs and has nothing to do with me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I should just kill myself and save everyone I meet from the agony of my opinions.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t find your limitations to be distasteful to that extreme, but I certainly support your personal decision to realize your purpose in this manner.</p>

<p>Best wishes. Godspeed.</p>
