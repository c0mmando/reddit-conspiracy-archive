       We all know about the missile alert Hawaii got this morning. It took 38 minutes for a second alert through the EAS to announce that it was a false alarm. According to
       <a href="http://theatln.tc/2r2otvt">
        this
       </a>
       article, it takes just under 38 minutes for a missile launched from North Korea to reach Hawaii. Is this just a coincidence? Or was there actually a missile that was intersected?

       as much as id like to believe we would know, it might be in our best interests not know as a general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure when we go to war this time around, it will be a few hours if not days before the general public really knows everything that's going on. At least those who are not in immediate danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasons being are we don't want to set off a chain reaction of mutual destruction by launching our own ICBMs. We also don't want to cause massive riots and looting in the general public. Trying to get water and food supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       We send missiles flying, China might very well retaliate causing them to launch a counter-offensive which in turn would just make Russia angry at everyone and launch there's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first thing that would have to happen is American forces will have to neutralize the immediate threat to Soul and setting up counter operations to insure there safty.

       In the light of MAD, it seems reasonable to hide intercepted missiles from the public and use a more covert method than an invasion to neutralise the threat posed by the attacker.

       There's no motivation to hide
       <strong>
        a
       </strong>
       missile launch by a rogue nation from the public when an alert went out before the supposed missile dropped its payload.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason they wouldn't hide it is that it that it would give the US leverage in the international political sphere to maneuver politically against China and it would certainly take the focus off Trumps gaffs.  If Trump is the warmongering neo-dictator the media wants us to believe he is then he would certainly parade this to his own ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe there was a missile. Though, I'm not convinced the alert was a mistake. More likely it's a stimulus to put people on edge. Pavlov taught us so much about conditioning.

       I would disagree.. usa never responds quickly.  Iraq going into kuwait or after 9/11 etc.  usa has the chess board stacked militarily and despite 'trump being trump' the generals would push back hard on being reactionary as opposed to using their preprepped plans for success.
      </p>
      <p>
       i still think it's really interesting to think that this could be about an intercepted missile.  on the same lines, could it of been a usa missile launched accidentally in a navy exercise?

       I would hope the US military isn't as loose to act as its president on Twitter. For the defense industry at least, war is a business, the contracts need to be in place and everything has to be done to the 1000 page spec to a T. Indiscriminate destruction is relatively cheap, but not conducive to a long-term business strategy. The US will act when there is a scheme in place profitable enough to make lobby congress worth the cost expenditure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's completely possible a missile could be intercepted over the pacific, under strict confidentiality, and no civilian organization will know the better. Paying off a few fishermen is cheap compared to messing up the scheme.

       glassing NK would mean raining fallout all over south korea and japan.
      </p>
      <p>
       not exactly a great way to keep either as allies, not to mention this would also sprinkle radiation/fallout all over far eastern russia.

      <p>
       all of that would trigger a very very shitty chain of events.

       IF a missile was intercepted chances are they will keep it hush until a few hours after every plane in the US took off and had already dropped their payload all over korea.

       From the article you linked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Russian, Chinese, or North Korean intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) could make it to Hawaii in less than 38 minutes, mind you.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       All the source I've seen have said it would be about 15 minutes from people receiving the alert to the missile hitting Hawaii. 38 minutes just seems like a random number after 15 minutes, meaning that if the alert had been real there would have been more than enough time for Hawaii to be hit before the second alert was sent out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since the point is that any time
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       15 minutes would be more than enough time for the missile to hit, I'm not sure why this is any sort of coincidence.

       NK clearly not happy about all the secret space launches lately..I'm kinda sketched myself. Most satellites follow a free floating pattern orbit. It's so predictive places like area 51 know what times they go over. The last missile/satellite had thrusters on it making it seem it was going to be thrown into a very off normal orbit for some reason. It reached space with full fuel too..I think they say we lost com's with it though..maybe that's the emergency alert.
