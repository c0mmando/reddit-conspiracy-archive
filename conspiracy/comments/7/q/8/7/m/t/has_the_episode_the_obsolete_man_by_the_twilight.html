        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I feel like the Twilight Zone: The Obsolete man  Season 2 Episode 29 is being censored online. As every where i watch it at the end. There is flick like the video has been edited and the speech that is  given  at the end feels incomplete. Every video so far that I have watched also have an Example is this at 27:54 on Dailymotion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5c257p">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5c257p</a></p>

<p>But The Comment by Stella Marris fills in what i belive to be censored. I found his comment on a youtube video</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/15c6kS1WFz4">https://youtu.be/15c6kS1WFz4</a></p>

<p>I also have a screenshot as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nE1TxnE.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/nE1TxnE.jpg</a></p>

<p>&quot;The chancellor, the late chancellor, was only partly correct.</p>

<p>He was obsolete.</p>

<p>But so is the State, the entity he worshiped.</p>

<p>Any state, entity, or ideology becomes obsolete when it stockpiles the wrong weapons: when it captures territories, but not minds; when it enslaves millions, but convinces nobody.</p>

<p>When it is naked, yet puts on armor and calls it faith, while in the Eyes of God it has no faith at all.</p>

<p>Any state, any entity, any ideology which fails to recognize the worth, the dignity, the rights of Man... that state is obsolete.</p>

<p>A case to be filed under &quot;M&quot; for &quot;Mankind&quot; - in The Twilight Zone.ï»¿&quot;-Stella Marris</p>

<p>So reddit Am i just being paranoid? as i don&#39;t feel like i am. Everywhere i watch that episode the rest of the speech at the end feels &amp; looks like it hae been edited out and censored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen my friend, anyone that&#39;s ever experienced a Mandela Effect is quite convinced that their reality has been noticeably &quot;edited&quot; by some mysterious or nefarious forces, too. </p>

<p>And there&#39;s always something that indicates that it&#39;s always been the way it presently is, just like the script that seemingly has the missing lines with a corresponding story that they were edited out and never spoken when it was performed or subsequently broadcast.</p>

<p>One of the strangest ones I&#39;ve heard of took place long before we ever heard of the phenomenon at all when a guest on Dick Cavett&#39;s talk show back in the 70&#39;s simply dropped dead during the taping. Everything stopped and that show was never broadcast. </p>

<p>Yet as Cavett himself tells it he later encountered all kinds of people who were never in the studio audience who distinctly remembered and accurately described what happened, the unforgettable look on Cavett&#39;s face and him reaching over to grasp the mans&#39; wrist which they claimed to have watched on TV, and he was absolutely dumbfounded by just how serious and terrible they remembered that incident to be let alone how they could have known that. It&#39;s attributed to false memory but what&#39;s remembered wasn&#39;t false by any means... here&#39;s Cavett on that strange experience...

    <div class="md"><p>Woah Thank you for sharing that story thats crazy. I don&#39;t really buy into a lot of the M.E examples that are like &quot;froot loops=/=fruit loops&quot; and the like, but I find it to be an interesting phenomena that I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve experienced something that could be considered Mandela effect before. </p>

<p>Artie Lange the comedian straight up o.d&#39;d and died in like maybe 06-07, and Comedy Central to commemorate him played his movie &quot;Beer League&quot; on 24 hour loop. I remember it clearly as does a close friend. Come to find out maybe a few years later, dude is alive and kicking. I went online after and it said that he almost od&#39;d and died around the same time (I believe) and it was a turning point in his life and got clean. Only thing is I remember clearly the 24 hour marathon and the R.I.P. artie lange at the bottom of the screen as the movie loop played. </p>
