        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oFHVkdxSzTM">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oFHVkdxSzTM</a></p>

<p>Love. Man I’m drunk right now. And I Just wanna say thank you God and thank you Mother Nature for human life. I love everyone so much. I wish we could all just forget about the past and live in the now. </p>

<p>I will live and die for you. </p>

<p>in my life, I think I have been in love with 4 different women. By love, I mean unconditional, as in, I would have without hesitation, died for them. I would do the same for my family members or really anyone who I deemed worthy or innocent enough to deserve this honor.</p>

<p>Most people deserve this honor. Most people are kind. Most people are loving, they have families, they have something positive to offer the aggregate. </p>

<p>The first girl I fell in love with was my best friend from college. She didn’t truly love me back. She is a vegan, and a radio host in DFW. She’s amazing. She deserved my admiration but not my love, because she didn’t put as much into the relationship as I did. </p>

<p>The second girl I fell in love with was a police officer in training (Mrs Officer- Lil Wayne). She had a fiancée who was in the military the whole time we dated. She didn’t deserve my love or my admiration. I gave it to her anyway because i saw my self in her. </p>

<p>The third girl I fell in love with was a gem. We <em>both</em> loved each other. I can tell you, there is a noticeable difference between being the only one loving, and being part of a loving relationship. I objectively messed this one up, although she broke up with me, I wasn’t ready to get married. </p>

<p>The fourth, most recent girl I fell in love with, was a random girl at a bar, right before I made a move to a new city. I only ever hung out with her a few times, and we never had sex, but the way she looked at me, was like I was looking into my own soul. I laid with her on her couch and she kissed me and looked at me as if I was her hero; as if I was some kind of protector. The feeling was so intoxicating, her green eyes so alluring, it gave me hope for all humanity, that we are all one, and that we all just want to be looked after. </p>

<p>I realized recently that only 1 and a 1/2 of these women ever <em>loved me back</em> and that I was being slanted by myself. I love very deeply. They say you only have 3 loves in this life. Well I’ve still got 1-2 to go if you only count the ones who loved me back. </p>

<p>Women and children should be looked after by strong, willing men. I’m so sad to see so many people in fruitless or unloving relationships, relationships based on necessity, relationships based on sexual needs, relationships based on mutual dissociative tendencies. </p>

<p>YOU are all you need, my friend. </p>

<p>YOU are the <em>it</em> </p>

<p>YOU are the answer to all your questions. </p>

<p>I am honored I have been placed in this body, in this time, with you, in this experience. </p>

<p>I would gladly die alone with all of humanity as my <em>true love</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS: smart person commented this video clip </p>

<p>Thought I would remind everyone that unconditional love is the answer to our problems. </p>

<p>Nevermind the distractions, the nuclear missiles, the plagues, the heartbreak, the failure, etc. </p>

<p>We are all part of a greater whole. </p>

<p>It’s all a ride.</p>

<p>We should have some fun! And live without judgment. I hope I have not been a burden to any real researchers on this site. I just want to tell you how special you are. </p>

<p>The fact that you know of these secret and occult things, alone, makes you a pioneer. </p>

<p>For the future!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so was your psychosis drug infuced? If so, what drugs? Are you certain it wasn&#39;t kundalini or satori?
Did you experience ego death? 
Did you come away &quot;proud&quot; of your experience, as if you had been humbled and somehow it had an paradoxical effect? (Not trying to be a dick with this one) what constitutes a &quot;fake&quot; homeless person? Aren&#39;t there tiers? Weren&#39;t you couch surfing? What&#39;s the difference in couch surfing and beingbottom rung, instead of independent from the system? (Again, not trying to be a dick) spice? You&#39;ve mentioned being abducted; do you feel this contact coorelated with the 13 archeotypes of hallucination or more in line with gnosis? You seem to believe in simulation theory; what do you think of the demiurge?(being a rat in a cage). There are more, but this enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe my psychosis was in part due to drugs (MDMA, LSD, marijuana, and mushrooms, not that drugs are bad but I was abusing them) and my first love, a girl and college, cheating on me. </p>

<p>I think there’s a big difference between being selfish and filling holes in yourself (drugs, sex, etc) and actually rebelling from the system. The months I spent on he road backpacking, I discovered all kinds of people on this spectrum. It’s all about your priorities in my opinion. Some people with nothing will give what little they have to help a stranger and man, that is a powerful gesture. </p>

<p>No matter what anyone says, I know my abduction experience was not a hallucination. I had pain and scars all over my body, and had amnesia for a full 36 hours before, during, and after the initial experience, and was abducted two nights in a row, with the ETs confirming that what I had experienced was in fact real. The experience happened right after I had had my homeless adventures in fact, right afteri had saved enough money to get my own place and go to finish school. </p>

<p>I do believe we live in a “simulation” if you will, but I think that term is open interpretation. For me, all I mean is that all of existence is one. One being. All of our lives are just fun little distractions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, kindness is more common in the real world than we are led to believe. </p>

<p>Yes, distraction is different from proper use and exercise. </p>

<p>As for your abduction, you mentioned on a previous thread that it may have been influenced by substance. I do not believe this invalidates the experience. The opposite actually. Curious what substance, and if it may have led to, or at least been part of the blackout. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a combination of psychosis and necessity lol. And pride. My dad would have helped me but I was more content walking the earth and working odd jobs to eat. I had a lot of friends, so I rarely spent a night on the street but it did happen, probably a few dozen times where I just wa content living, not having own place. I turned things around in 2015 very quickly. Made aaaalot of money randomly. I think it was karma. When I was on the streets I helped a lot people, as much as I could.

<p>Yes, I believe the Mother loves her kids more than the Father. I have dated A LOT, real high numbers, and many I have loved but never any of them have loved me as much back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree. I&#39;m curious if you see any connection between limited amounts of care and allotment based on traditional gender roles. </p>

<p>Seems, to me, to be a continuum which gets ignored. </p>

<p>Also strange to me, depending on when you grew up, that we were raised thinking that all women want is love and all men want is sex. </p>

<p>I THINK, men tend to want a woman&#39;s love more, and women want to procreate to experience that form of love. </p>

<p>Again, I think. I don&#39;t and can&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>heyy thanx . I can empathize with loving a person that dosent love you back its kinda tragic  but still an important to be lesson learned from it. </p>

<p>it&#39;s always nice to read stuff like this sprinkled in with some of that latest doom and gloom. it reminds me that all hope is not lost, we still got each other </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you, but why do you say there were people that didn&#39;t deserve your love?<br/>
They just chose not to accept it for whatever reasons, according to their free will. Everyone deserves love and love is the answer to so many problems in our society.
However if love is not the thing desired by another being, you can love all you want and nothing will happen. This desire has to come from within and can never be forced upon another being from the outside.
Instead you should always look for opportunities where your love is appreciated.</p>

Today was the first day of school for me (again) and I just wanted to thank you for reminding me to laugh :)</p>

<p>Also, do you know if there&#39;s a difference in the unconditional love between men and women for their offspring?</p>
