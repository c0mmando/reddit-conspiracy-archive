       to the GOP, illegals are bad guys, they're taking your jobs and they're soaking up entitlements. to the Democrats, they're unwilling victims of circumstance, they need our help, and we just need to let them have amnesty or citizenship "this one last time" because it's the right thing to do. to the illegal immigrants, i'm sure they see themselves as people who just want a chance to work for a living. they didn't have that opportunity at home, and rather than rob or kill to make a dollar, they've decided that they'd rather take the chance at sneaking into America to find a job for a pay that's high enough to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       unfortunately, we all keep eating the narrative right up. but have you ever stopped to really consider who benefits from that? EVERYONE IN POWER, all of the people who pay anybody a wage that's average or below average. why do they benefit from that? because they're able to keep wages absurdly low in many cases, since Americans have to worry about the fact that somebody will be willing to work for that wage, and that they need to take the jobs they're given instead of set the bar a bit higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       the easiest solution that would end illegal immigration almost immediately would be for the government to pass legislation making it a felony to hire illegal immigrants. if employers have to worry about hiring illegals beyond thinking "well hiring the illegal saves me $XXXX, and if i'm caught, i might have to pay $XXXX, and i'd only have to pay if they don't believe it when i play dumb... then let's go with option A this time" then they won't take the risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       just look at this article from Fox News for example, showing that even in a worst case scenario, if you decided to hire an illegal immigrant full time, you could offset the fine of hiring that person for only $1 an hour. the fine for hiring an illegal, it's less than $5000 per violation. that means you could pay two illegals $5 an hour full time and you'd be saving money compared to paying for a full time, minimum wage employee on the books with benefits for a full year. am i the only person who thinks this is an absurdly lenient punishment for the people who are responsible for creating this problem in the first place?!
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/30/doj-increasing-penalty-for-hiring-illegal-immigrants.html">
        http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/30/doj-increasing-penalty-for-hiring-illegal-immigrants.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       and i'm sure that many people are concerned with the risk for employers who accidentally hire illegals. that's understandable, but consider that eVerify has proven effective. i'm also certain that it could even be improved, but even without that, just think about how much money we've spent dealing with illegal immigration over the past few decades alone. those costs will only go up. even with a POTUS that is pretending to crack down on illegal immigration, he still needs a fortune for the wall. i only say he's pretending because he hasn't once mentioned the people hiring the illegals,
       <strong>
        when they're the whole fucking problem
       </strong>
       . if we spent even a fraction of that money to come up with a better system for employers to be confident that they're not hiring an illegal immigrant, the problem would be solved, and Americans would start making more money almost immediately.

       The consumerism of America is built upon cheap labor. I think it would be quite a shock to our economy and way of life if we were forced to pay the real price for our goods and services, adjusted for legal hiring practices.

       Donald Trump and No Republican ever calls for sanctions against the employers and in fact the Trump administration is deporting fewer illegals than the Obama administration did.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the deportations gets lots of coverage, it works to keep the illegal immigrant workers afraid and submissive and easy to exploit.

       Absolutely true! Remove the underlying incentive and problem solved. Of course the Dems will fight this suggestion/plan tooth &amp; nail, as it would crush their grand scheme to flood the country with new Democratic voter blood.

       unfortunately that's not the only reason why it would be pushed back against. the GOP would also say that you're putting unfair burdens on small business owners, you're adding to regulations, you're doing obamacare for the workplace, yada yada. and dems, assuming you're correct on the motive, they'd just keep pushing the moral / humanitarian / "responsibility as good Americans" aspect of it and highlight cases where people can empathize. shit i mean they could even act like it's a low priority... they're talking about almost everything except for actually solving the problem, and the one advantage that their donors have, which is that they can actually save a few bucks as long as illegals are around to take certain jobs, so they're not going to treat it as a high priority.
      </p>
      <p>
       that doesn't make it any less of a solution to the problem though. and they can't deny the problem unless they repeal the legislation... illegal immigration is illegal, and if we can supplement those laws without invading the rights of ordinary Americans, then we need to push our politicians to do what's right.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's situations like this that piss me off about how much money we have in politics. lobbyists, it's easy for me to say that it's legal bribery, but the fact remains that we should all be able to try and convince politicians to do what we feel will help ourselves or other Americans in our pursuit of happiness. i wish we could crowdfund our own lobbyists to help in situations like this but it's just not feasible for someone to pay a lobbyist unless they're turning a profit. when you have paid lobbyists for years to make politicians force Americans to buy insurance, or to make politicians cut your taxes, you can see the advantages on your bottom line depending on your industry. that's a pay off. and if we crowdfunded our own lobbyists, we don't turn a profit.

       How much of a real burden is checking eVerify BEFORE you hire a new person? Really? 
You just add that one simple step to the remainder of the vetting steps businesses already perform. It's easier than employment background checks, that I can tell you.
      </p>

       Business owners should be willing to be active supporters of their communities &amp; nation. And that begins with obeying the law!

       many companies are ready and willing, and you'll see it on their bulletins, information explaining everify and why they do it. we need to push it harder if we really want to be serious about illegal immigration
      </p>
      <p>
       another problem is that for every company using eVerify, there are countless restaurants / convenience stores / roofers / construction companies / you name it that are saying "well i always hire at least 5 or 6 people off the books to save money, those guys work full time and i don't have to give them benefits. i know they don't speak english but i don't worry if they're illegal, why's that my problem? i pay my other 10 employees on the books, they make min wage and i never give them more than 29 hours because i don't want to give them insurance" and this is exactly what hurts most Americans. the American employees on the books, they can't get full time, and the fact that the manager knows he can hire illegals always makes it difficult for these people to get raises... it's not a level playing field. and meanwhile the guys off the books, there's no way in hell those guys are getting a raise, he's got them by the balls. he's making a killing paying them 30 - 40% the average wage that an American gets, and he's avoiding the benefits and the taxes on those people too.

       Immigrants are doing jobs you don't want to do. Without them cost of living would be much higher. Let me see you go and pick your fruit &amp; veggies. So called "patriots" are all upset about immigrants taking those jobs, but in reality, the jobs have been taken away from you by your own fellow Americans. Immigrants didn't move factories to China, you people did. Immigrants are not to blame for your economic woes, you people are responsible for your own demise.

       While it may be true that fellow American's have been fucking each other over by profiting from importing cheap labor or exporting jobs that means nothing in the sense that if you're here illegally then you need to go back.

       No, people incentivized by bad policy did. "You people" is a term broadly rejected as generally a racist.

       Again with the "you people". It seems that you have removed yourself (clearly into an upper plane of existence) from this country and you won't be sharing our "demise".

       Maybe if people weren't corrupt and keep trying to kill what makes this country great then America would be in much better shape. I agree, the problem isn't immigrants, but the policies that brought them here with the idea that they would always vote Democrat. The people making these decisions don't need to interact with the public nor do they need to be accountable for the outcome. They are protected. So if it helps to stay in power and to keep the public divided, go ahead and start a mass importation of migrants with vastly different values. If you want to keep a box of kittens busy, pour in a box of puppies.

       America almost become the shithole that Sweden is becoming but that didn't happen and so it's time for things to swing back the other way for a while. Sit back and enjoy the ride.

       i'm not trying to make this into a left vs right debate to be quite honest. the politicians on both sides would rather have us argue or debate every single time a topic like immigration is brought up, since it doesn't create a situation where people ask for change, or where the politicians are being held accountable. i would hope you can agree on that much, right? so please, let's not do them any favors... or turn this into a debate about "open borders are better because so and so" or "banning legal immigration AND illegal immigration are the best options because so and so"... instead, please help me  and find some middle ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think that a huge majority of people would agree that we don't want illegal immigration because it is illegal (that's one reason at the very least, there are obv many other reasons, but that one can at least be agreed on universally) and we need to accept that it's the law right now. and on that same token, a huge majority would agree that we want at least SOME legal immigration, for family we all know about the huge number of American companies that moved overseas in the recent past, how much work is done outside of the US for companies inside the US, and now that our corporate tax rate has been reduced so drastically, we want those companies to come back AND we want new companies to move over here. we want to give those companies incentive to come here and help boost our economy, not scare them away by restricting their abilities to bring some of their people over. i work for a company that moved over here from EU and they had to bring four managers / office people along. now we have 110 employees, with 106 of them Americans, hired in the states. that was before the tax cut, imagine how often that can happen after?
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway i'm not trying to get too off topic. my whole point is that if we stop people from moving over here the wrong way, we can help the process of getting people over here the RIGHT WAY, and it'll help our economy and everybody involved except some business owners won't be able to exploit their lowest earning workers by leveraging their ability to hire illegals against the wages of their American employees. and at the very least because illegal immigration is illegal, we should work on those laws to help reduce the illegal behavior, and do what we can to improve them without restricting the individual rights of Americans.

       Illigal immigration is undesirable, but it's happening nevertheless. Tighten the border and overhaul the immigration system, but legalize people who are already in. There are a lot of benefits in doing that.

       Immigration made America what it is, making immigration difficult for people is going to lead to stagnation.

       How do we account for tens of millions of jobs being lost to automation in the next decade or two?
      </p>
      <p>
       We keep importing low skilled workers when homeless and unemployment rates will continue to sky-rocket.. especially on the west coast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most GOP’ers want smart immigration that will fill jobs that we need help with. Like future tech jobs and maybe a system to relocate unemployed people already living in the US to the jobs nobody wants to do. We don’t need to bring more low skilled workers to fill these types of jobs in my opinion. We will have a wave of unemployment and debt hit us eventually..

       Automation in Capitalist society is inevitable, especially in country with almost non-existent workers rights. Getting rid of immigrants would not solve anything. When businesses are forced to hire American people, they are expected to pay more to them, which would result in an increase in prices to the consumers. Increase in prices will result in lower demand, lower demand means less jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Correct way to do it is to impose high import taxes and give tax breaks to businesses opening factories in US. Increase taxes on wealthy and lower them for middle class. Strengthen labor laws and unions.
      </p>
      <p>
       America was in the best shape when unions were strong. Unions drive wages up for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strengthening middle class and helping it grow is the key. Middle class is the engine of the economy, their spending accounts to aprox 70% of total spending.

       you'd be surprised to know that i support immigration, and that i'd go as far as to say that i think that every single person who's been in the country before they pass immigration reform should be given an opportunity to gain citizenship if they're noncriminals. ideally, we'd have a legal path to citizenship for everybody, one that doesn't leave so many people getting paid under the table, creating reduced wages for ordinary taxpaying Americans.

       The thing with this is illegals take jobs Americans don't even want
      </p>
      <p>
       And if course construction stuff but let's be real, it's construction. It shouldn't have a super high wage. Above minimum wage sure but not much higher it's a labor position and rising wages causes rising housing costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general though illegals aren't taking jobs Americans want. Americans don't want to pick fruit or cotton. We had an entire slave industry dedicated to doing menial labor we didn't want to do. Illegal immigrants are just legal slaves that make a few bucks an hour
