       Each account’s top 5 sites are the same, and the frequency with which they are posted matches near perfectly. Outside of the top 5 the other sites they post also match, they share the same active hours and many other behaviours as you can ascertain from SnoopSnoo or visiting the profiles. I nearly forgot the join dates, two joining two days after another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rule 13 has forced them to comment on their posts with submission statements and many of these sound very similar too. Someone with more time than me could check that in more detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a lot of searching, I was able to find a further nineteen shadowbanned or deleted accounts that had the same behaviour as the above five, or which only posted thelastamericanvagabond.com (I have checked scores more Reddit accounts that I am sure belong to someone else, or could not be sure of).

       With these accounts shadowbanned or deleted there isn’t a neat way to present this. I had to find this from Google searches for the usernames plus the previously mentioned domains and more. A lot of the results were cached versions of other peoples profiles showing that they commented on their posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did note that there was always more than one account active, normally 3-4 so this is not new behaviour. I believe there were separate waves of shadowbans.
      </p>
      <p>
       thelastamericanvagabond.com was also shadowbanned by Reddit at some stage as I saw the number of subreddits it was posted to plummet. This means that moderators or AutoModerator have to approve the posts or they will not be visible in a subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy approves these posts with AutoModerator.
      </p>
      <p>
       The owner (/founder/CEO/editor-in-chief) of thelastamericanvagabond.com is one Ryan Cristián (this is all information they freely make public):

       The Facebook and Myspace URLs are “Poetickjuztiz” like one of the accounts, and I found some comments such as this from others:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://archive.is/8OfWZ">
         Check out our website if u ever get time http://new.thelastamericanvagabond.com/
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So there is a clear financial incentive for him to post every accounts most posted website by far, thelastamericanvagabond.com.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look the name up and you’ll see he is a contributor to more “alt-media” blogs than I care to count, and they all seem to share/steal each other’s articles. Some of these he posts to Reddit so there are further publicity and profit motivations there. But it all pales in comparison to the ownership of The Last American Vagabond and the amount it is posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know if the other websites he posts very frequently pay him, if he posts them to disguise his spamming, if he posts them to astroturf his agenda, or a combination.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he is definitely a spammer who is acting with extreme dishonesty by using all these separate accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have given him the opportunity to admit to this and explain themselves three times but they prefer to lie and get angry.

       Nice. I saw a post by mastigia once about Rule 10 and the difference between just calling someone a shill and providing an argument. The other important thing is that discussion of intention is always going to be speculative, but we can definitely point out patterns of behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of those domains are familiar to me b/c they were spammed by MarvinQT, mightbemarvin, and cintabonita. I believe they are all shadowbanned, suspended, or banned from here at least.

      <p>
       Also, what happened to rule 13? A lot of those alts from yesterday and many other people lately seem to be copying their SSs from other users comments, and others have been just repeating the title or copying the source article verbatim.

       Rule 13 is kinda clear so you could report it to see if mods remove them

       The mods decide are balancing cooperation in your traffic analysis driven attack on the monetization of dissident web sites versus the interests of the community. I would send you packing on rule 5--traffic analysis is creepy stalking--but then again I'm pretty biased.

       Your u/Rocksolid1111 wasn't even pinged or commenting in that post. Why didn't you say anything at the time if you saw it? Strange that you wouldn't do so if you saw a false accusation, you don't seem like the type not to.

       Well everyone is free to make their own minds up about whether or not it's you.

       It's just such an amazing coincidence that two accounts with names that correspond to each other behave and sound the same. One gets called out and banned, then all the comments that would help show this get deleted.

       that's a lot of effort.  good job.  also, why did you put in that much effort?  seriously.  are you from eglin afb?  if so, that's pretty cool, you should do an iama.  we should have one of these detente days where all the different spooks get together and do an iama - kinda like those ww1 xmas day soccer matches.  get everyone in.  usaf, navy intelligence, shriners, hwitches, french canadians, the papacy, the chinese, of course the russians.  that shit would be gold.

       Do you have a favourite hangout where other people congregate like a bar or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of r/conspiracy like that. You get to recognise regulars and you also start to notice that some people keep wearing fake noses and introducing themselves with different names, or they keep coming up with tall tales about what they do that aren't very consistent. Maybe some of them are also trying to sell car stereos and fake watches, they get quite aggressive when people say no.

       What's the big deal? Actually all those sites are among the best, hardly spam. Zero Hedge has been a daily read for ten years. I like the others as well. This "spamming" is actually a way for me to keep up with them using r/conspiracy.

       Look at the content of the bots being exposed. It's often decent topics that are of interest to r/conspiracy even if they are bots. They're not exposing the undesirable bots/shills who come from r/politics, link to corporate propaganda with their first post, and then it somehow gets 4k upvotes immediately. They're only exposing Trump shills and bots who actually post content that the community is legitimately interested in.

       Hmm, I wonder where this point of view is coming from, writer from newnationlist.net...
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point is content sites are trying (and succeeding) to game the reddit system for personal profit. This isn't unique
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       in the slightest. But everyone on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       should be concerned that the content we are seeing might not be organically placed there.

       Whoa!! Like I said, put the handcuffs on. What difference does it make? The mods can judge the content by the upvotes and the reception. True spam will tend to be rejected.

       How is that submission of yours "non-organic"? Are you saying the content you post isn't organically upvoted? Or that the comments in reply to your post aren't organic? Because if so, yes you should be banned and your content should be blacklisted from the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suspect you weren't admitting to that. And that you're not understanding what OP is on about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that these accounts are a)controlling what's getting views (via upvotes and content spamming) and controlling the direction the narrative goes (via comments).

       Yea, you really aren't understanding what's going on if you think I'm the one wanting that. The entire point is that these accounts are doing that (at least the cheap tactics/controlling the agenda/narrative, you'll have to ask the mods about their rule enforcement..).

       No, there is zero ability on our end to control the votes and comments. The problem as we see comes from brigades of bots that do that. Who buys the bots, certainly not the little alt media publications OP highlighted.

       I think you're getting confused with me pointing out your biases are obviously going to be in favour of publications here because you yourself work for one and me saying your publication is doing what these people are doing.

       The right way of going about this then is to identify the vote, and comment jammers. What evidence do you have that the publications mentioned in the OP do that? I just spent a few minutes looking at them, and just don't see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be fair, I will say that Zero Hedge, which I rate high as a read, does do that in their own comments section. They are good at it- with very witty remarks for the first 6-8 comments. But I don't think they bother here, as they get 50x the reads on their own site.

       Your example of a downvoted post targetted by "an active effort to brigade and silence anything remotely critical of democrats" is a single post. That post is 52% upvoted with a fuzzed score of 4-7. So one post with 4-7~ downvotes and the same number of upvotes.

       kittypryde123's post got even less attention until it was linked to without griping, and it received more downvotes than yours.

      <p>
       "Targeted harrassment" got about a 1/4 of the upvotes that the 2000+ post did. Also the top comment is telling OP he won't change anything, second top comment is defending top minds, and the rest of the thread is filled with top minds sympathizers. Lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Top minds", even fewer votes, and *literally every single comment that is above +1 is defending top minds. Lol.

        got brigaded
       </a>
       by top minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       "3 years ago obama"- if you read this one, you'll see it's actually an anti-trump post with apologetics for Clinton. The user was also a TMOR guy who
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7kac50/three_years_ago_on_this_sub_obama_and_net/drfao4p/">

       because
       <em>
        the donald does it

      <p>
       Gee, I wonder if a guy who's willing to use puppet accounts and break rules because he perceives the other side is doing it would be capable of? I wonder if that testament to his quality of character is relevant to this discussion. I'd say yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Something has changed" - comments are all shitting on OP or the sub in general
      </p>
      <p>
       "Pressure points" - again, read this and you'll see it's a LARP about how criticism of Trump get you "dogpiled" with a pinch of "I'm getting downvoted so hard! (+170)" and a dash of

       "Why do shills" - OP got absolutely
       <em>
        destroyed
       </em>
       in the comments
      </p>
      <p>
       "Shill and his many alts" - see, now this is exactly what I'm talking about. That post is basically
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       like the post that got 2000+, except it barely broke 100. Why? Cause when it's a Democrat doing it....no one cares. That's perfect, thank you.

       I put it in quotes since it is a quote from you. You used the term, so you obviously had a definition in mind. What is it? Odd that you'd use the term and then out the onus of defining it on me. Personally, I'd say doing well is a post that is 70% upvoted or higher.

       Is that the minimum a post needs to have so you won't whine about it not getting attention, or not? You're linking other posts that &lt;1% of that so I need your definition.

       So this is what it boils down to lol. One post got over 2k points, you've declared it partisan and bad for your team, and you're some sort of SJW who expects other posts to get 2k+ participation points now?

       Lol, no. I think outing bots is fine. What I called partisan, was the fact that this sub only cares about bots
       <em>
        on one side
       </em>
       . This subs attitude towards bots is, as the evidence clearly shows, partisan.

       Lol, the typical deflection of hyperpartisans.

       This is rich. You're right bud... clearly

        I'm the one making it partisan when you have to insist I'm on a "side"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a hyperpartisan, just like the majority of this sub. You'll knee-jerk downvote anything remotely critical of your team and attack those who disagree with you... which is exactly what I've been saying. You've managed to reinforce my point many times over, so thank you for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will repost my post about the copied comments, it will get downvoted again.. further proving this sub is democrat-leaning, further proving the hyperpartisan knee-jerk, further proving youre just a liar.

       You know what I've noticed. There's been a few posts existing bots... But they're NEVER the Democrat shills who troll us. The sockpuppets being exposed seem to exclusive post Trump propaganda or decent conspiracy material. Why are these people with new accounts, like op who is only a month old, working so hard to expose bots but aren't exposing the brigaders who actively troll us? Why only expose the pro Trump propagandists and somehow avoid exposing the "Correct the Record"-like assholes who have stuck around after the election?

       I don't typically see piles of pro-dem stuff posted daily. It does get posted, but typically when there's some big news for the day. Bots swarm this sub then and by the end of the day, they're gone. These accounts posting articles from the sites listed are here all the time. They're spamming the sub daily. If you can point to some Dem shills that do that, have at it.

       If this is a partisan issue for you then make a post about your enemies. Almost daily there is a generic post complaining about 'shills' so you could make today's.

       But accounts posting things you don't like is very different to being able to prove there is a conspiracy or misbehaviour like this post and the comment copying ones do.

       If you have any evidence of Democrats shilling or trolling that is comparable to the evidence posts like this lay out about shill/troll posters who lean more towards the right, I'm sure I don't only speak for myself when I say please,

       How do you know? Maybe they just don't get their news from the CIA sources. I'm just playing devils advocate here.  I really doubt a person makes any real money posting &lt; 100 times in about 6 months. I've seen real blog spammers on here and they are daily.

       "non-mainstream media sources" and "citizen created news" can mean anything from The Intercept to YourNewsWire. It's also relative because those are the mainstream in conspiracy forums and met with very little gatekeeping vs. something like a NYT link.

       I told mods about likemetrue about six months ago after investigating his post history and finding that he would post from two or three sites repetitively, which had earned him thousands of post karma, but he only had 20 comment karma. After making small talk on the article he linked, he got really shitty and gave me a bad feel, which led me to checking out the post history. Mods didn't seem to mind, and even tried to make it seem like this was just some regular dude who likes posting links from two or three sources exclusively. It's good to see that someone took the initiative on this matter. I suspected it was a marketing strategy, as Reddit seems to be inundated with "users" who color things in a Too Good To Be True tinge because they're actually selling a product. The future job market will hinge on these advertising agents selling  yesterday's plastic crap as new and improved tech pf tomorrow.

       I'm glad there's a record of these interactions, but will something actually be done to clean this place up? Is there any incentive in keeping these link spammers around to the mods? To Reddit? More clicks means more money to someone. Are moderators here to stop any posting as long as it isn't vulgar? Ultimately these rabbit holes lead me to the realization that it's nearly time to put technology away for myself personally.

       Your u/Rocksolid1111 wasn't even pinged or commenting in that post. Why didn't you say anything at the time if you saw it? Strange that you wouldn't do so if you saw a false accusation, you don't seem like the type not to.
