<p>Each account’s top 5 sites are the same, and the frequency with which they are posted matches near perfectly. Outside of the top 5 the other sites they post also match, they share the same active hours and many other behaviours as you can ascertain from SnoopSnoo or visiting the profiles. I nearly forgot the join dates, two joining two days after another.</p>

<p>Rule 13 has forced them to comment on their posts with submission statements and many of these sound very similar too. Someone with more time than me could check that in more detail.</p>

<p>With a lot of searching, I was able to find a further nineteen shadowbanned or deleted accounts that had the same behaviour as the above five, or which only posted thelastamericanvagabond.com (I have checked scores more Reddit accounts that I am sure belong to someone else, or could not be sure of).</p>

</ul>

<p>With these accounts shadowbanned or deleted there isn’t a neat way to present this. I had to find this from Google searches for the usernames plus the previously mentioned domains and more. A lot of the results were cached versions of other peoples profiles showing that they commented on their posts.</p>

<p>I did note that there was always more than one account active, normally 3-4 so this is not new behaviour. I believe there were separate waves of shadowbans.</p>

<p>thelastamericanvagabond.com was also shadowbanned by Reddit at some stage as I saw the number of subreddits it was posted to plummet. This means that moderators or AutoModerator have to approve the posts or they will not be visible in a subreddit.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy approves these posts with AutoModerator.</p>

<p>The owner (/founder/CEO/editor-in-chief) of thelastamericanvagabond.com is one Ryan Cristián (this is all information they freely make public):</p>

<li><a href="https://archive.is/dhhwg">https://archive.is/dhhwg</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Facebook and Myspace URLs are “Poetickjuztiz” like one of the accounts, and I found some comments such as this from others:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/8OfWZ">Check out our website if u ever get time http://new.thelastamericanvagabond.com/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there is a clear financial incentive for him to post every accounts most posted website by far, thelastamericanvagabond.com.</p>

<p>Look the name up and you’ll see he is a contributor to more “alt-media” blogs than I care to count, and they all seem to share/steal each other’s articles. Some of these he posts to Reddit so there are further publicity and profit motivations there. But it all pales in comparison to the ownership of The Last American Vagabond and the amount it is posted.</p>

<p>I do not know if the other websites he posts very frequently pay him, if he posts them to disguise his spamming, if he posts them to astroturf his agenda, or a combination.</p>

<p>But he is definitely a spammer who is acting with extreme dishonesty by using all these separate accounts.</p>

<p>I have given him the opportunity to admit to this and explain themselves three times but they prefer to lie and get angry. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7onbl4/the_daily_wrap_up_16_critical_thinking_has_never/dsarto2">First</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7pxrz3/830_million_in_missing_helicopters_21_trillion_in/dsksh09/">second</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7q6f7b/doj_unseals_indictment_involving_uranium_one/dsn15wc">third</a>.</p>

<p>Remember that this is but one person of <strong>MANY</strong> that targets r/conspiracy with spam and/or astroturfing, it’s endemic. A lot of users have seen my comments and send PMs, in our conversations we keep finding more and more usernames and domains doing it, and hearing more about how it’s reported and ignored.</p>

<p><em>And if anyone cares they are also on Voat as <a href="https://voat.co/user/blankfacecriminal">BlankFaceCriminal</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/user/ChangingPerspectives">ChangingPerspectives</a>.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice. I saw a post by mastigia once about Rule 10 and the difference between just calling someone a shill and providing an argument. The other important thing is that discussion of intention is always going to be speculative, but we can definitely point out patterns of behavior.</p>

<p>Some of those domains are familiar to me b/c they were spammed by MarvinQT, mightbemarvin, and cintabonita. I believe they are all shadowbanned, suspended, or banned from here at least.</p>

<p>Also, what happened to rule 13? A lot of those alts from yesterday and many other people lately seem to be copying their SSs from other users comments, and others have been just repeating the title or copying the source article verbatim.</p>

<p>Think of r/conspiracy like that. You get to recognise regulars and you also start to notice that some people keep wearing fake noses and introducing themselves with different names, or they keep coming up with tall tales about what they do that aren&#39;t very consistent. Maybe some of them are also trying to sell car stereos and fake watches, they get quite aggressive when people say no. </p>

<p>But I suspect you weren&#39;t admitting to that. And that you&#39;re not understanding what OP is on about.</p>

<p>The problem is that these accounts are a)controlling what&#39;s getting views (via upvotes and content spamming) and controlling the direction the narrative goes (via comments).</p>

<p>Yea, you really aren&#39;t understanding what&#39;s going on if you think I&#39;m the one wanting that. The entire point is that these accounts are doing that (at least the cheap tactics/controlling the agenda/narrative, you&#39;ll have to ask the mods about their rule enforcement..).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How was my post rude?</p>

<p>Because I was showing that so-called democrats engage in the exact type of behavior being scrutinized in the 2000+ post... that&#39;s rude? Showing that an issue isn&#39;t partisan is rude?</p>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;s because there is an active effort to brigade and silence anything remotely critical of democrats.</p>

<p>Nice buzzword.</p>

<p>Your example of a downvoted post targetted by &quot;an active effort to brigade and silence anything remotely critical of democrats&quot; is a single post. That post is 52% upvoted with a fuzzed score of 4-7. So one post with 4-7~ downvotes and the same number of upvotes.</p>

<p>kittypryde123&#39;s post got even less attention until it was linked to without griping, and it received more downvotes than yours.</p>

<p>What about some of these posts? This is just one keyword the last month.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how vote fuzzing works, and my submission statement, about an hour after I posted, was at -13.

<p>Again, not how vote fuzzing works. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about some of these posts? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, let&#39;s look at them.</p>

<p>&quot;Targeted harrassment&quot; got about a 1/4 of the upvotes that the 2000+ post did. Also the top comment is telling OP he won&#39;t change anything, second top comment is defending top minds, and the rest of the thread is filled with top minds sympathizers. Lol. </p>

<p>&quot;Top minds&quot;, even fewer votes, and *literally every single comment that is above +1 is defending top minds. Lol.</p>

<p>&quot;Paid shills&quot;- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7o4euw/yes_paid_shills_exist_and_here_is_what_you_can_do/ds74jaq/">got brigaded</a> by top minds.</p>

<p>&quot;3 years ago obama&quot;- if you read this one, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s actually an anti-trump post with apologetics for Clinton. The user was also a TMOR guy who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7kac50/three_years_ago_on_this_sub_obama_and_net/drfao4p/">admitted to having multiple accounts and breaking rules</a> because <em>the donald does it</em></p>

<p>Gee, I wonder if a guy who&#39;s willing to use puppet accounts and break rules because he perceives the other side is doing it would be capable of? I wonder if that testament to his quality of character is relevant to this discussion. I&#39;d say yes.</p>

<p>&quot;Something has changed&quot; - comments are all shitting on OP or the sub in general</p>

<p>&quot;Pressure points&quot; - again, read this and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s a LARP about how criticism of Trump get you &quot;dogpiled&quot; with a pinch of &quot;I&#39;m getting downvoted so hard! (+170)&quot; and a dash of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7m5a4e/here_are_the_3_main_pressure_points_ive_found_on/drrivix/">brigsding by top minds</a></p>

<p>&quot;Why do shills&quot; - OP got absolutely <em>destroyed</em> in the comments</p>

<p>&quot;Shill and his many alts&quot; - see, now this is exactly what I&#39;m talking about. That post is basically <em>exactly</em> like the post that got 2000+, except it barely broke 100. Why? Cause when it&#39;s a Democrat doing it....no one cares. That&#39;s perfect, thank you.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;m seeing a pattern, here. What else you got?</p>

<p>Lol, no. I think outing bots is fine. What I called partisan, was the fact that this sub only cares about bots <em>on one side</em>. This subs attitude towards bots is, as the evidence clearly shows, partisan.</p>

<p>And my team?</p>

<p>You&#39;re a hyperpartisan, just like the majority of this sub. You&#39;ll knee-jerk downvote anything remotely critical of your team and attack those who disagree with you... which is exactly what I&#39;ve been saying. You&#39;ve managed to reinforce my point many times over, so thank you for that.</p>

<p>I will repost my post about the copied comments, it will get downvoted again.. further proving this sub is democrat-leaning, further proving the hyperpartisan knee-jerk, further proving youre just a liar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;non-mainstream media sources&quot; and &quot;citizen created news&quot; can mean anything from The Intercept to YourNewsWire. It&#39;s also relative because those are the mainstream in conspiracy forums and met with very little gatekeeping vs. something like a NYT link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I told mods about likemetrue about six months ago after investigating his post history and finding that he would post from two or three sites repetitively, which had earned him thousands of post karma, but he only had 20 comment karma. After making small talk on the article he linked, he got really shitty and gave me a bad feel, which led me to checking out the post history. Mods didn&#39;t seem to mind, and even tried to make it seem like this was just some regular dude who likes posting links from two or three sources exclusively. It&#39;s good to see that someone took the initiative on this matter. I suspected it was a marketing strategy, as Reddit seems to be inundated with &quot;users&quot; who color things in a Too Good To Be True tinge because they&#39;re actually selling a product. The future job market will hinge on these advertising agents selling  yesterday&#39;s plastic crap as new and improved tech pf tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad there&#39;s a record of these interactions, but will something actually be done to clean this place up? Is there any incentive in keeping these link spammers around to the mods? To Reddit? More clicks means more money to someone. Are moderators here to stop any posting as long as it isn&#39;t vulgar? Ultimately these rabbit holes lead me to the realization that it&#39;s nearly time to put technology away for myself personally.</p>

<p>Your u/Rocksolid1111 wasn&#39;t even pinged or commenting in that post. Why didn&#39;t you say anything at the time if you saw it? Strange that you wouldn&#39;t do so if you saw a false accusation, you don&#39;t seem like the type not to.</p>
