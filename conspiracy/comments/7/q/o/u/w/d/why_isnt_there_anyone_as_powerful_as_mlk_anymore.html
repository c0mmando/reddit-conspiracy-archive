        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You don&#39;t see any powerful protestors these days, or even anyone with positive power in the world. Why isn&#39;t there anyone like this anymore? Do you think the government did such a successful job at dividing and conquering that people just don&#39;t care to stand up and be a voice of power, or do you think that everyone is so opinionated that they don&#39;t think anyone else is as smart as them? Why is this? People just don&#39;t seem to care about anything except self image and social media these days, the elites did such a good job of distracting now that no one even seems to want to become smart anymore. Everyone I talk to at my university just wants to go and get a 9-5 and it seems as though no one wants to make a real difference in the world. Am I the only one that really wants to find out the truths, and is trying to get smarter so I can become a voice of power?</p>

<p>EDIT: I truly am worried about the future of humanity, we need more people trying to push humanity forward, make us evolve, and show love and kindness. Instead everyone is out for their own, and greed has taken everybody over. Money is the true evil in the world, and people that think otherwise are just sheep in a herd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That also makes overreliance on individual leaders itself a vulnerability, and activists have learned this. I read a lengthy Black Lives Matter FAQ awhile back, and this was one of the points they made -- they emphasize that they aren&#39;t a &quot;leaderless&quot; movement but a v
&quot;leader<em>ful</em>&quot; movement, because it isn&#39;t about any one person&#39;s vision, but the entire community. They view that as a strength rather than a weakness, and that makes total sense to me in light of some of the tactics that were used against the civil rights movement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s half right, but you need a face or at least a few faces for media and other external forms of communication. Plus BLM got hijacked pretty quickly, seemed to me, or was a shell protest group from the get go.</p>

<p>When you dig into the MLK assassination, it sure looks like Jesse Jackson was positioned by CIA or military intelligence to step in as a controlled asset to lead the civil rights movement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hypothesis. It may be due to the the sheer amount of people willing to publicly agree with a cause. People are scared to stand up for a cause publicly. They virtue signal, but that&#39;s it. And the fact that non-violence was used to attain that goal. Now days, there is no such thing as a peaceful protest. They may say it&#39;s peaceful, but Shit usually pops off less than a hour into it. When violence happens/is used, it instantly turns people off of the cause. Or causes the other side to be violent too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail of 72, Hunter S Thompson makes it pretty clear.</p>

<p>With the GI bill after WWII, and the rise of the hippie movement, they realized that having an educated population was counter to their interests.</p>

<p>The dream of a better world was killed in 1968 with the muders of MLK and RFK, who would have been the next president for sure. Instead we got Nixon, a nail in the coffin and the beginning of dystopian USA we see today.</p>

I don&#39;t even know what to think of our government other than it definitely is not a democracy anymore. </p>

The ones who are uneducated and just full of hate and rage towards others because their parents told them that is the way it is supposed to be. Those people don&#39;t normally vote. Donald trump is a dick but a smart man so he knew to win he would have to act out and target those people to vote for him spreading false lies and saying things like he would build a wall so he could get hated minded people to send their votes his way.

I wouldn’t say I’m either side honestly because I agree with both sides, but socially I’m definitely more liberal. I didn’t vote because I was lazy, I didn’t vote because I truly believe our vote doesn’t matter and I didn’t want either candidate in office. Not that it really matters anyways. </p>

<p>Prevent the RISE OF A “MESSIAH” who could unify, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement. Malcolm X might have been such a “messiah;” he is the martyr of the movement today. Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael and Elijah Muhammed all aspire to this position. Elijah Muhammed is less of a threat because of his age. King could be a very real contender for this position should he abandon his supposed “obedience” to “white, liberal doctrines” (nonviolence) and embrace black nationalism. Carmichael has the necessary charisma to be a real threat in this way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its EGO that destroys the chance of a truly good &#39;messiah of the people.&#39;  I think a lot of people start out as fighting for the little people or one group of people, but once they start gaining followers, power, and force, they become corrupted by their own ego.  They get powerful, so now they need bodyguards, personal assistants, PR people, etc.  Their ego becomes more and more inflated and maybe someone comes along and says, &quot;Hey, comes do this and we&#39;ll give you tickets on the 50 yard line&quot;...it&#39;s a small thing, so they think, what could it hurt this one time.  But then the things other groups want them to do get bigger and the &#39;gifts&#39; get bigger and pretty soon, your just as corrupt as everyone around you.  You are now on a different social level, surrounded by powerful people, you have forgotten the little people you used to stand up for...your small machine that inspired people has become a large machine that needs constantly fed.  Then the drugs and whores come in and it&#39;s all over.</p>

The sealing of his files to prevent any information on the character of MLK (prostitutes as a married man, plagiarism of I Have a Dream speech from Archibald Carey, plagiarism of his doctorate thesis, anti-Christian rhetoric, most of his speeches were plagiarized, communist party meet ups, his innercircle meeting with Mao, etc) from getting out to the public is another point against his actual &#39;power&#39;.  The MLK you are talking about?  He didn&#39;t exist.  He&#39;s literally white washed to make a better, more palpable character for the racial tensions and pushing the civil rights through.  You can argue the merits of such a move in terms of furthering the civil rights movement, but the MLK you are talking about did not exist, which is why there isn&#39;t a &quot;powerful&quot; movement leader like that now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post contains valuable comments that I feel are worth taking time for to reply.</p>

<p>As much as I oppose flocking around a &quot;leader&quot; if there was an individual rising up that is loyal to truth&#39;s positive power I can see myself standing by his or her side (I have yet to see/encounter that person). I won&#39;t ever go as far as glorifying that person or blindly following him or her, though. My support is the most I will give, an endorsement might by in the cards too but that would take a lot of solid material coming from that person i order to earn an endorsement.</p>

<p>Sadly, a caliber like MLK or so doesn&#39;t really come around anymore because the Regime has learned that that is not a good thing for them. The news media spectrum is not allowed to cultivate such a person anymore. Unless it is a controlled asset, like Wikileaks, Snowden etc. (strange that the activist movements have not yet awaken to that reality)</p>

<p>Overall, I do look forward to putting my weight too behind such a strong leader but, being realistic, in today&#39;s information warfare and social engineering climate we are likely better off with multiple smaller calibers than MLK. Independent rebel pockets that make up the real rebellion, even possibly (occasionally) as an alliance.</p>

<p>The fact seemingly few people want to make a difference in the world is because indeed few people want to make a difference in the bigger picture. It is not what education and social interaction is about today. It is about blending in and not getting too creative.</p>

<p>Being different than the bigger group is threatening to those who feel comfortable in the group because you are a variable, a loose cannon, that points out the artificial nature of the group.</p>

<p>To question even your own beliefs is not done in the group, the Regime has taken care of that for you so you have no need to question. Just pay taxes, walk in line and spend you money on whatever buys you happiness for a day or two.</p>

<p>True spirituality, for instance, is being traded for crafted realities that seemingly quench the same thirst. Effectively this brings group members (the general public) closer and closer to being docile AI slaves.</p>

<p>Instead of wanting to walk the path of truth and wanting to live the way of truth people are losing their ability to even understand the need to be inquisitive about every aspect of life.</p>

<p>As for money being evil, no I don&#39;t believe that is true. Money is merely a tool. If money is evil then so is information and knowledge. All of these can be considered &quot;currency&quot; but none are evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with you on money, i mispoke but by you pointing it out that it is just a tool i 100% agree. Human nature just turns the tool into a weapon and really divides people with it. The small leader now a days is a lot more effective than a massive leader because I do not believe people are willing to put the trust in a single individual as much who isnt of authority aka government. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t trust those who aren&#39;t marked or have the specific title to lead. I really dislike the media because it gives us a false sense as to what is happening in the world around us and really brain washes people. Honestly the world around me today gives me anxiety, even typing this out and really thinking about how brainwashed we are and how we are just a pawn in their game. YET no one seems to realize that they are playing this game with us. </p>

<p>I believe anonymous helped people at first but i truly believe anonymous was created as a fake ally by those same elites, because they died off and stopped &#39;helping&#39; out as much as they used to. We need a real group to do some damage such as anonymous did. We need a group of people to band together and really try and start this uprising. </p>

<p>Maybe it is happening right now, before our eyes. I have heard a lot of people on the media (celebrities) talking about how the main power is about to fall and a new day is upon us. I hope they are talking about taking down the elite, Oprah winfrey literally almost said that word for word in her speech at the golden globes. Go and watch this after you read this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The racial divide and civil rights was huge issue at the time where peaceful protesters were met with dogs, mounted police, and out and out brutality by the authorities, particularly in the deep south.</p>

<p>There were also any number of killings of whites and blacks for simply trying to get fair and equal treatment for blacks.</p>

<p>MLK, like Malcolm X who was killed before him were in the eye of that storm &quot;telling it like it is&quot;, a saying that was also part of a far larger movement and social rebellion against bigotry and repression that was resonating all across the country.</p>

<p>Not that it has been entirely fixed since then, but change did come, and it was enough that there isn&#39;t the same kind of impetus or motivation nor issues of such major importance to either give a voice to or project anyone to national or world attention by daring to openly and publicly speak about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might just be that MLK was the byproduct of a unique time.  African Americans represented a unique entity, both a coherent ethnic group and a completely disenfranchised and disorganized political group with few ties to any other parent nationality or political group.  I think this was a unique situation that allowed unique figure to rise up.</p>

<p>I also think that the fact that he was martyred really skews our perception of him.  If King hadn&#39;t been assassinated in 1968 but instead had lived into even the 1980s, would he have maintained his status as a leader?  Would some of the negative information about him (affairs, plagiarism) been exposed and reduced his standing?  Would his lieutenants like Jesse Jackson have usurped him or would King have made bad political alliances (like to Carter) have undermined him?  What about the failures of African American advancement?  Would his own people ultimately see him as a charlatan, a rousing speaker who talks a good game but ultimately cannot deliver on his promises?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe since king was working on anti-economics type speeches and geared more toward anti war and anti money (so to speak) that I truly do believe he would have remained a leader. He already had so many followers that people would have literally done anything to follow him which was crazy at the time. People were in such distraught about the time period that they needed someone to lead them through the darkness and he rose to the light to do so. Now a days every one thinks they are out of the dark but in a more realistic sense the dark has only just begun </p>
