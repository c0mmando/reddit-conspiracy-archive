       If the elites wanted any significant form of socialism (centrist to left wing economics) then they would have allowed Bernie Sanders to win fair and square. 
Instead, they used multiple methods to rig the primaries against him. Corporate media collusion, shredded ballots, switched party registrations, YUGE waiting lines, colluding DNC/Debbie/Clinton, dead people "voting", all of the media shitting on Bernie, etc. (Remember Fox News' bullshit 90% tax rate lie....TOP tax rate was actually 52% or something, look it up. And much lower for working/middle class people like me and you. This is why I don't watch CORPORATE media anymore, it's filthy propaganda.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Crony capitalism (Dems and Repubs BOTH push) is not socialism. It's socialism inverted, aka socialism for the super rich (e.g. our tax money going to big pharma/insurance companies + cronyist favoritist contracts).
The elite never want socialism for the people, only for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The party system is corrupt, both consisting of extreme right NEOliberals and NSA spy state warmonger authoritarians. Socialism has nothing to do with it. We have the very bare minimum of socialism: roads, schools, police, fire brigade, social security, etc.
It's how you use taxes that matters....tax is not the same as socialism. Obamacare is a social program but it's not socialist in any major way, it's crony capitalist and NEOliberal (big companies deregulated enough to raise prices at will without competition, e.g. cheap Canadian medicine.)

       I think that‚Äôs why the thought of her running scares me the most. People will blindly follow her, like she is some messiah! Just like with Obama, but worse, way worse. Look at the damage he was able to do with such a loyal following, now multiple that by 100.

       She is black, and she is a woman. It's different. That is two "get out of jail free" cards she can play at any time, and the media / entertainment industries will help her play those cards at every step.

       Just imagine if Trump was a "person of color", and Russia was a "country of color", you'd be called the biggest racist ever if you were still droning on about alleged Trump / Russia collusion over a year later with no evidence. You would be a "birther".

       Emigrating.  The sitting oresident matters little.  Important decisions are made by people with the most intimate knowledge.  There are thousands of intelligent advisors much smarter than many of the last few presidents.  Its no different than then.

       The DNC preordained her when they shopped around for a Senate seat they could hand to her. That was 2000. And she had never lived in New York before. Her and Bill bought a house the day before she filed the campaign paperwork so that she would qualify.

       Fair enough, they'd been working on it behind the scenes for years. I was specifically thinking of the push from propagandists in the media though. I'm pretty sure that 2014 was when they started the "Clinton is going to be president" push in the media, so I expect similar treatment in the here-and-now for whatever corrupt asshole the Democrats are going to force on us so that the grassroots progressive is blocked from their chance to easily win the general election.

       Actually, Moynihan didn't die until 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was assumed he was pressured to retire because of his health and polling suggested the seat would be the easiest win for Hillary over the other open seats.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recall a Democracy Now program back then discussing how some DNC insiders were livid because Guiliani was showing very strong in the polls and they feared they would lose a Senate seat because Moynihan was a shoe-in, having won reelection 4 times with wide margins.

       Bc you are basically accepting being a serf and bitch to rich people with trump. He is pushing the ceiling knowing that it lowers the floor. This is what Britain did knowing their empire was over. It cemented the rich at the top to survive and forced the people to be soldiers or servants. That is what's going on. The market won't hold, you will get fucked and the rich will stay in power making decisions that guarantee only a .01% of the population escape. Trump is cementing the echelon on your back and bunghole and you're too stupid to see. After this, people will blame the next president for the collapse. The people will revolt and your dumb ass will join bc its against the fall guy and you'll feel empowered and you will never know it was ur jack off material trumps fault.

       You allow this motherfucker I'm responding to to say the same stuff breaking rule 10 in favor of trump then attack me breaking the same rule challenging trumo. Ffs man this isnt a high school chat room. You keep doing this to favor a political bias while over looking the side you prefer. You are promoting idiots and the divide instead of allowing idiots to be bitch slapped into joint the ranks against the rich. I hope you dobt ban me. But looking at your own profile I see many many timea you attack other mods in the same way as my commebt you just censored for personal reasons and nit fair moderation. Am you bitch about narrativea and agendas whikebyou are guilty of the same shit. I was that way then i turned 14.

       The rich rule and got mad they had their freedom taken away through regulation. They couldn't capture all the bodies so They put trump in to g rid of them and to distract they are doing all this bull shit to keep from a class war... Make it race and educated vs non educated in stead of allowing people to see they are living in modern serfdom. The French revolution is about to happen again and its about delaying it and cementing the rich. The same families who survived the revolution still rule areas of France. Trump isn't dumb, but he def isn't honest. The Clinton's already made the purge so it was a favor to trump after trump helped the rich and bill Clinton during the community reinvestment act rewrite in 1996.

       Chelsea Manning is running for Senate in Maryland. Rephrased, WikiLeaks' most prolific source/LGBT community activist/international hard news celebrity is going to try to persuade the federal bureaucracy to elect her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you dismiss it, consider this additional fact. I found out about it from Cassandra Fairbanks, the reporter who broke the story about the Sy Hersh regarding Seth Rich--the one that WikiLeaks retweeted. It was her second post as a moderator to r/WikiLeaks. Meanwhile, the Black Hole of Fuckery that was the 2016 election continues to suck in more and more of DC. Whatever the DNC has planned ... it ain't gonna happen.

       Nothing that I've seen. The story was published. Sy didn't deny it but did express considerable pique at having been recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most interesting subsequent developments are Kim DotCom's claim that Seth Rich was a Mega user. (The story that Sy tells on the tape has room in it for Kim DotCom's earlier claim to have information relevant to Mueller's investigation; Mega would have seemed at the time to be a good choice for communicating big file sets.)

       Looking at it from the outside in. It looks likes Trump was retaliation from the right for electing a lying smooth talking black guy with a muslim name being President Obama. But the MSM brainwashed left wont ever see Obama and Trump as equals. In their minds Obama was a good president and the only answer to Trump is to give the right what they think is their own medicine in Oprah.

       You don't have to be a fan of either Obama or Trump to think they're not equals. Or at least not equal when it comes to the political world. One was a politician who'd gone to Harvard and studied politics with experience working in his community and the other was a reality TV star who built some buildings after daddy handed him a fortune (who went to Penn only after he could transfer in after a few years of another school, where he actually got in...).

       Oprah has never stated her policy positions on many important issues. If someone says that she should be president in spite of this, it's because they want her to be president for another reason, like her race or gender or wealth or celebrity status. Or just because their corporate propaganda told them to think that.

       I'm not defending Oprah and don't want to see her run for presidency, but just because she has never made her overtly political view on certain policies doesn't mean she hasn't made her feelings on those
       <em>
        topics
       </em>
       clear. Especially given that she hosted a talk show almost every day for 22 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because someone has never told you their take on the legal issue of abortion, for instance, if you hang out with the person regularly and see how they live their values and talk with them about their values, you are probably able to at least generally extrapolate what their take on the political policy would be.

       I dont have as much of a problem with Oprah mainly because, like Trump, she isn't a career politician and understands what it means to EARN and PAY taxes...

       Back in the day a rabble with sticks was equal to an organised force in power. Now the rabble would need to be absolutely massive and even then guns/riot control/military will have many many times the power of the common man. It‚Äôs not gonna happen.

       That's horseshit. Revolutions have never worked without enough support that the military begins to join in. The biggest issue faced today isn't asymmetry of force, but weaponized media.

       Yes riot control / military are also people.  I laugh at the notion that a revolution somehow would be untrained citizens versus all the cops and military.

       This definitely comes from "weaponized" media!!! (A false idea that subverts the options and actions of the masses)

       To be fair, a more accurate comparison to Oprah would not be Trump; it would be Reagan. Both Reagan and Oprah were principally in entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, while a self-promoter, had some entertainment aspects to his persona; he was primarily a real estate mogul. A businessman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is vastly closer to FDR than to either Oprah or Reagan. Both Trump and FDR were born rich (unlike Oprah and Reagan). FDR was a businessman first. (He had extensive ties to Wall Street and had eleven directorships at top companies before going into politics. See historian Antony Sutton's meticulous breakdown of his Wall Street ties.) Once IN politics, he engaged in the "newfangled technology of the day," radio, and gave fireside chats. Which at the time was said to be vulgar and beneath the dignity of a President.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the Twitter of its day.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summation: No, Trump was not a movie star. Nor was he someone who made his money in media. He made it selling buildings. The dabbling in commercials and Miss Universe were things to spread and promote his brand.
      </p>
      <p>
       But media was NOT his brand. Real estate was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media was merely a means to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Oprah and Reagan, media was not merely a means to an end. It was their whole job. (They were famous for nothing else).
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Footnote: In the end, Oprah will never run. She has too many complications. Like her awkward spinsterhood and swirling questions about her "celibacy". I mean, who would be the First lady? Her friend Gayle? (Likewise Oprah has too many ties to Hollywood's pedophile rings and that girl school of hers in Africa, where the children were used for sex slaves.) To say nothing of all the racist comments she made about wanting white people to die out etc. Oprah's not as "nice" as the Deep State wants us to think she is. Because of all her skeletons, no: The smart money says that she won't, in the end, want the level of scrutiny that comes with running for President.

       If you think post-truth America was born in November 2016 than I would be careful with accusing people of being brainwashed so verbosely. I mean Obama did win a Nobel Peace Prize.

       And? Who gives a fuck about a Nobel Peace prize?
      </p>
      <p>
       At least he could speak like an adult, and not throw a temper tantrum day after day. At least he didn't lie about shit that anyone can look up in 15 seconds and see being untrue. And at least he tried to work with republicans instead of whining like a spoiled brat every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, he didn't change the war machine, but you'd have to be mentally ill or brainwashed by the Reeetards to think Trump is anything close to respected. The whole world hates him and his fake hair, fake family, fake wealth, and fake tough guy routine.

       Does he even have a policy? Any policy?

       His Nobel Peace Prize was emblematic of the particular strain of brainwashing that had the strongest hold 8 years ago. Thats why fucks are given. History matters. Of course Obama is a better politician than Trump - just surprised a poster in r/conspiracy thinks it wasn't until Trumps election when 'truth' went out the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       Princeton (Gilens and Page) told us in 2014 that the bottom 90% of earners have a near-zero impact on public policy. Comparing Trump to Obama seems a little silly when we actually don't have a functioning representative democracy anymore.

       I think you missed the point. I never said obama was a beacon of truth, just that he acted like an adult, and a president, and not a whiny little bitch, who lies constantly to inflate their own fragile ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       I specifically said he didn't fix many issues and was called out numerous times by his own voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll never hear Trump bootlickers do that because that means admitting they were wrong. Trump is a white trash piece of shit. At least Obama acted like he had been there.

       Gotta remember that the people outside the states are not the same as the media, and don't have the exact opinions about things that the media claim they have, not pc-opinions are either ridiculed or given no media time and attention. So just because european media writes that everyone thinks that Obama shits gold and is the promised one it's probably not what everyone really thinks, but if anyone writes otherwise they're going to lose advertisers and who wants to lose money when thats the reason your making newspapers in the first place.

       How? Because I said one dude was clearly fit for office and the other was clearly fit for reality tv?

       Both sides suck, but it's weak argument to say one is not far worse than the other. Voting records alone show that. The DNC might be a joke, but Trump is the butt of all jokes.

       You literally said "half the voting population," that's how.  Both sides are created to keep us distracted and arguing over which side is better.  Then they actually work together to keep wars going and rob us blind.

       No. One side clearly wants to steal your money for themselves and the other only does that some of the time.

       Ok, bud.  Keep living in your dream world.  They're just trying to keep the rich and middle class happy enough so we don't try to change anything.  That's the point of the two sides.  It gives and "us vs them" mentality instead of everyone trying to work together to get this country running well.

        What makes Oprah running as a celebrity any different than Trump...

       It's the same thing. How so?

       They're supposed to be smart because education right? And they probably are intelligent enough under most circumstances. But there's something that can happen to your intellect that can cancel it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       When these educated women think about Oprah running for President, they get
       <em>
        excited
       </em>
       because it's an educated feminist's dream come true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intellect cancelled, therefore no consideration for little details like zero experience, never run for office, another celebrity that people only know from TV etc.

      <p>
       It should be a huge warning any time you notice a candidate for any office who's using
       <strong>
        strong emotions
       </strong>
       to build up
       <strong>
        support
       </strong>
       for themselves... or any time you see strong emotions being stirred up to create
       <strong>
        opposition
       </strong>
       to a candidate.

       Great truths here.  But just a note.  Any saving grace of our current political state might need an actor that both hasour interests in mind but also stokes the fire using emotional.  Rationality can be dry and slow to stoke the same fire needed for collective action.  Its a technique.  And still a warning sign for sure.

       Trump has been talking about American politics for fucking decades and has, on numerous occasions, hinted himself or has been asked by others about running for President. His campaign wasn't some random occurrence. When was Oprah ever hinted at wanting to become a politician?

         Look at this
         <a href="http://www.macrotrends.net/1358/dow-jones-industrial-average-last-10-years">
          10 year DJIA graph
         </a>
         . The stock market has been climbing steadily since 2009. The 2016 election caused growth suppression due to uncertainty of the political future. The surge since has been a correction back to the original trajectory (if you draw a best-fit line on that graph, it would intersect with exactly where the market is today).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I hope the best for the Korean talks, I don't think anyone would root against this if Trump accomplishes this. What people have a problem with is the reckless means that we've gotten there. Wagering nuclear-war on Black at the roulette table, even if you win on black, doesn't mean it was worth the risk.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump made some good decisions on this. I've give credit where credit is true. I'd argue that ISIS was more an accomplishment of many allies and foes forming a coalition for a common purpose, than a personal victory for Trump. But, his decisions were a part of that so I'm happy to put that one in his win column.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Trump makes a point of anointing himself as the reason anything good happens these days (e.g. when he took credit for jobs coming back to the US -- even when the companies publicly stated that these were plans already underway long before the election). It is wrong to fall for this trick, and take the victories he claims as fact.

       I'd say that building and managing the building of skyscrapers is much more technical than running a talk show.   Sure she started from lower but they are two very different professions and hard to compare. His knowledge of industry and business and construction are arguably far more necessary for the running of a country than knowledge of show business, especially considering how out of touch many hollywood personalities can be.

       Kinda, he was a business man who fronted a TV show about business. But he was already pretty well known before he was on TV. I would say that it was the 'art of the deal' that made Trump as household name, rather than his stint as a TV star. In the UK the Apprentice is fronted by Lord Alan Sugar who most people would agree is a businessman first and a TV star second.

       She is the CEO and chairwoman of Harpo Production and the Oprah Winfrey Network.  Though both those have to do with entertainment, they are still business.  Though I don‚Äôt have an opinion on her running (I don‚Äôt even know where she stands on issues) to say she isn‚Äôt a business women is disingenuous.

       And thats how they continue to get away with it to this day. "Oh lol satanic panic". "No one would ever molest and murder a baby. Its too evil". Look people really do that shit, it exists. Not saying that Oprah is guilty of it, but celebrities take a lot of care to pick out their clothes and accessories and tattoo's. When they consistently wear satanic jewelry and have tattoo's of an upside down pentagram well, you have to start seeing the world for what it is.

       Have you ever looked into Satanism beyond 'muh devil worshiping elites'? It's actually quite a peaceful, rational and loving religion. The 'devil' is admitted Catholic propaganda, and even the the church agrees that taking the idea of 'good vs evil' 'heaven and hell' literally is silly. It's all metaphorical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you ever think these celebrities might be trolling you, with these hand gestures and demonic jewelry? They know people out there froth at the mouth for anything against the norm, so they play it up.

       It's not real, and believing it makes us all look stupider and discredits anything we have to say.

       The nation is run almost entirely by the finance people on wall street.  It's not hyperbole to say they control nearly the entire nation's resources.  What goes on in government is a stage show -- literally.  For the most part, the federal government does not exist anymore... it's only remaining function is to steal money from the electorate and redistribute it to massive corporations (directly and indirectly), and to create an illusion of meaningful political expression and representation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As time goes on, it's been obvious to see political discourse come to reflect reality.  Now our politicians will be 'reality' television stars and we will debate the merits of their personalities (which were crafted for tv).  This is the new political landscape in America, whether anyone likes of or not.

       Nothing that I've seen. The story was published. Sy didn't deny it but did express considerable pique at having been recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most interesting subsequent developments are Kim DotCom's claim that Seth Rich was a Mega user. (The story that Sy tells on the tape has room in it for Kim DotCom's earlier claim to have information relevant to Mueller's investigation; Mega would have seemed at the time to be a good choice for communicating big file sets.)
