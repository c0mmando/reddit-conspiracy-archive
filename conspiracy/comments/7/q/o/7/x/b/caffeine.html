        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just quit drinking caffeine on Christmas. Before I quit I was definitely addicted relying on multiple energy drinks or coffee throughout the day just to be able to function. Now that’s it’s been about 3 weeks I can honestly say I feel amazing. I wake up with tons of energy, where as before it felt impossible to get out of bed. At work I can keep up with a better pace than before, and it’s almost like my stress has diminished significantly. Now I noticed that at my station at work, im literally the only person not consuming any type of caffeine, and I feel the most energized now. Just wondering if anyone’s heard any type of conspiracy about caffeine lol bc how I feel now I never wanna drink caffeine again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say I cut coffee out completely, but I only drink one cup a day now over hours, and quit drinking alcohol at the same time. About 2 years ago now. Only one almost panic attack, with my anxiety almost non existent now. Looking back I know they were the largest contributers, and what finally calmed me down all the way, changing jobs and cutting my commute from 2-4 hours a day to 10 min. Also working nites now helped alot, I sleep in as late as I like, not getting up at 5 in the morning. With everything, feels like a whole new life with no anxiety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can take Coenzyme Q10 and vitamin B12 and you will have plenty of energy. These have been taken from us in that we no longer eat wild meat (through either commercialization of the meat industry, or a push to have people go vegan, both of which deplete energy and brainpower. Gee, why would the corporatists/elites want that?). </p>

<p>Wild meat has lots of CoQ10, and commercial meat has almost none, and red meat is the only true dietary source of B12 (no, brewer&#39;s yeast is NOT a good source, vegans).</p>

<p>But really, you want to rebuild your muscles immediately after a workout and they will be ready for the next one. You do that by taking BCCA (branch chain amino acids) - i.e. clean forms of protein (no coincidence here that this is what you get from clean meats).</p>

<p>D-ribose, a special sugar that aids muscle recovery, also helps. </p>

<p>Oh and broccoli sprouts ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is addiction, and it&#39;s an insidious drug, because of homeostasis. This is where the body will always try to get things back to a &quot;normal&quot; level, as you mentioned. </p>

<p>The reason is that if we constantly ingest a non-essential substance (vitamins don&#39;t have this effect because we don&#39;t make them and must have them to live, so you can&#39;t get &quot;addicted&quot; to vitamin C, or choline, for example, which gives you mental energy) the body lowers levels of other energy production in expectation of getting a &quot;shot&quot; of whatever it is that you&#39;ve been ingesting so you achieve homeostasis, or normality.</p>

<p>This is why such a substance, after a while of taking it constantly, creates addiction because you do indeed need it to feel &quot;normal&quot; due to homeostasis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think theres any conspiracy here</p>

<p>Caffeine is one of the most well-studied drugs out there.  Its a stimulant with known effects.  It can be used safely, and it can be abused.  I think the bigger problem is that its disregarded, or even romanticized in its effects.</p>

<p>Coffee itself is an aquired taste, but its not the only source of caffeine.  Lots of people love it, myself included.  Its part of a morning ritual which gets me ready for the day.  I dont <em>need</em> it to function but I enjoy it.  Plus it helps me take my morning dump.</p>

<p>Personally, I avoid energy drinks unless I&#39;m doing a long nighttime drive or something.  They often make me jittery, but I&#39;d rather be awake than drowsy on a highway at night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Caffeine effects the level of cortisol in the body, the stress hormone. This is also released when faced with fight(adrenaline) or flight(cortisol). So, it does put your body into a stress mode of sorts. Think about how you feel after being under a stressful situation, it’s exhausting. It also has effects on your blood sugar levels, which also yo-yo’s your energy. </p>

<p>So basically it yanks your body around, ultimately stressing your system. </p>

<p>I’m not a Dr. and could have some of these things off, but I am a heavy coffee drinker and have researched a little bit because of the effects it has taken on me. </p>

<p>I love coffee. If I give it up, it will most likely be because I have died. Although you have given me something to think about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found that caffeine does not give me any energy boost and does very little to keep me alert, but at the same time, makes it very difficult for me to fall asleep at night, so I always wake up tired the day after having some. Maybe this is yet another conspiracy to keep us miserable, along with sugar and fast food?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t think this is true if you take your coffee after a decent meal. benefits of taking coffee with a real meal is that it raises stomach acid and stimulates HCl production; this is very useful if you&#39;re over 25. Stomach acid production falls off starting early twenties. So, the older you are, the more benefits coffee has---if you re aware of its pitfalls:
1. spikes cortisol production when used on empty stomach
2. anti thiamine factor of coffee beans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 26 and used to drink 2.5 cups each morning (1 mug). I recently quit just for fun and noticed that when I was a daily morning coffee drinker that I woke up groggy and needed that coffee.. and even then it sometimes wore off fast leaving me tired. Now that ive stopped coffee I find that waking up i feel less groggy (still groggy -its natural) and next thing i know im wide awake and ready for the day. Sure i miss it.. but i think were better without it. Maybe treating it like weed or alcohol is better - an occasional treat in moderation.</p>

Check it out as a habit replacement. If u ever do let me know I have been stewing it for a few years now and I&#39;ll let u know how I do it, getting it &quot;right&quot; took a bit of practice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>coffee drinking has pluses and minuses. </p>

<p>you just have to realise that coffee (decaf incl&#39;d) contains anti-thiamine factors. No problem if you supplement once or twice with a weekly 100mg. </p>

<p>also, on an empty stomach it&#39;s not the best; raises cortisol stress hormone and could in long term lead to adrenal exhaustion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its no conspiracy lmao. Its called addiction. Caffeine, sugar, nicotine, alcohol virtually any substance you consume daily your body will adapt to and become reliant on to feel normal. Basically your body will stop producing as much or any of the things it should normally to function because it is so used to having an execess amount or a synthetic version in its place to do the job.  When you cut down on these substances (everything in moderation ;-)) your body then readapts to functioning normally on its own again. Leaving you feeling healthy and energized without any additives needed to jumpstart it.
And this same thing can be said about any addictive substance you can somehow ingest. From caffeine and sugar all the way to heroine and crack. 
The sluggish feeling from not getting your daily dose of coffee or soda is simply a very mild form of your body going through withdrawal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Caffeine is a massive conspiracy imo. It&#39;s just low-grade enough of a stimulant to not cause any acute effects, but strong enough to slowly destroy you over a long period of time.</p>

<p>I truly believe that most peoples&#39; anxiety and depression is due to long-term (3+ months (also depends on dose)) caffeine use, but there&#39;s no reason for any individual to investigate caffeine as a culprit, since it&#39;s such a social norm and is touted as healthy for you. Thus, they pin their anxiety/depression on something else instead. Job, family, relationship, some phantom stressor that they had to brainstorm to come up with, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a drug that acts like any other stimulant... because it is one. You&#39;ll feel great at first. Then you&#39;ll feel &quot;pretty good.&quot; Then you&#39;ll be back to baseline. Then you need it just to feel normal and get rid of the morning headache. Then it&#39;s low grade anxiety and depression where you start to lose enthusiasm/zest for life. Then, depending on how far you go, it can be this perpetual moderate depression/anxiety, or even start causing very dark thoughts.</p>
