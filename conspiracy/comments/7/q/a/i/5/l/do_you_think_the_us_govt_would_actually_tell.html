    <div class="md"><p>i recall reading it 4 or 5 years ago, the policy may have changed more recently now that they are crowd sourcing some of the detection and people are able to spot these sorts of things on their own now.</p>

<p>i did a bit of searching to find something offical backing it up, but at same time its not exactly a policy they want the public to really know about. iirc it came up a few years back after one of the fairly close flybys and i think there were some references to apophis </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on a lot of factors I&#39;m guessing, most importantly where was the missle when it got shot down? High? Low? Over the ocean? In suborbit? Didn&#39;t the Reagan Era Star Wars program supposedly have lasers fired from satellites to intercept nukes? Is that stuff still in orbit and operational? Doesn&#39;t S. Korea have some sort of mobile &quot;Iron Dome&quot; type surface to air missle intercept system? Do they also have a ground based laser system ? If there was a missle maybe it was cyber hack that disabled it? Emt type weapons? Could it have been sabotaged from the ground before launch? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t shit about the technical aspects of N. Korea&#39;s missle arsenal, what they are really capable of, but I would imagine you need to figure that out first then extrapolate to figure out the rest.</p>
