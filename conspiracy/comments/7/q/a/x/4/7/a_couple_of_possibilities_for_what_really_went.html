        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used to work on the Minutemen 3 ICBMs for a high profile company. Can&#39;t share too many details for obvious reasons. But I think the &quot;mistake&quot; of an employee accidentally pressed the mass alert button is very unlikely. In fact, I can think of a lot of things <em>way</em> more likely. Here&#39;s my two cents, in no particular order:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The threat was real, the missile was shot down.</strong> As others on this subreddit have already pointed out, the amount of time it takes an ICBM to travel from Southeast Asia to Hawaii is approximately 20-30 min ( ~10 min to hit ICBM max speed of 7 km/s, ~7200 km, (7200/7)/(60) = ~17 min for total travel time of ~27 min, not accounting for earth&#39;s rotation in that time period). The amount of time it took for the false alarm to be sent out was 38 min. Now, the way the US&#39;s ABM system works is that they basically launch a giant chunk of metal at the ICBM and hit it really hard. The ABMs have no ordinance or anything, they just destroy the incoming missile through shear impact. However, even though our ABM system is the best in the world, it&#39;s still only successful around 50% of the time. So when the incoming threat was discovered, it would still be protocol to alert the intended target of the threat in the event that the ABM systems fail (and whatever other defenses we have that I don&#39;t know about). I think it&#39;s at least feasible that the threat was real, and the threat was dealt with successfully (and thankfully). The question that tears this theory apart is: <em>why would the US not tell us they shot down an enemy ICBM?</em>
The most likely answer I can come up with is that <em>Trump doesn&#39;t want war.</em> Maybe he just talks a big game. Or perhaps it&#39;s not financially beneficial to start a war when there were no causalities.
Whatever it is, it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t know who launched the missile. When those things take off we pretty much immediately know where it&#39;s going and where it came from. So if there was a real threat, the US Gov is for whatever reason not sharing this information with the public. Maybe they don&#39;t want to cause panic. I don&#39;t know. </li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The EAS was hacked to provoke reaction from Trump.</strong> The EAS has been hacked before, it&#39;s possible that it was hacked again. The person or persons who hacked the system either did so for shits and giggles, which is extremely fucked up considering how many people could have died if we had retaliated, or they did so to <em>intentionally</em> cause a retaliation from Trump in order to make him look bad. See, ICBMs function on something called Mutually Assured Destruction. If someone like Russia launches their full force of ICBMs at us, we have that half hour to retaliate. In a situation like that, both countries lose. Using ICBMs against another country with ICBM&#39;s is essentially committing suicide. If we had launched missiles towards Southeast Asia, they would then have a chance to retaliate against us. I have hard time believing that any hacker would do this, but then, there are some truly crazy people out there. This could also explain why it took so long for them to send out the second alert, because the system was hacked or down and they needed to regain control or reset it. Also, if one of the employees didn&#39;t send the message, they may not have even known about it for several minutes after.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  <a href="/u/SloppyJoeGilly2/">/u/SloppyJoeGilly2/</a> posted below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m military living on Oahu.
I believe it was, at the very least, a hack. I received the alert on my phone and went downstairs to ask my wife if she had gotten it. She had been on the phone at the time and told me that cell service had completely dropped. No service whatsoever. Evidently, this happened to many people here on the island. Also, the narrative being pushed right now is basically a fat finger of a button. This is not possible as an employee of that very station disclosed that the button is under a safety lock with a cover and must be pushed 3 times in a row in order to activate it. So it’s a deliberate act.</p>

<p>Full comment: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7qax47/a_couple_of_possibilities_for_what_really_went/dso7ed0/">Here</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The EAS was commandeered by a disgruntled employee</strong> This is the scenario I find most likely. Trump tends to piss an enormous amount of people off. Perhaps one of the workers manning that operation decided to try and make Trump look bad by sending out a false alert. It certainly is a bit embarrassing to send an entire state into full panic mode on accident. This is going to be a national incident for several days still.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The monitoring system used to look for incoming threats malfunctioned.</strong> This happens more often than you would think. The early alert systems are very sensitive. They&#39;re a lot better than they used to be, but they&#39;ve detected false missiles before. I&#39;ve heard of them being triggered by sunlight reflecting off large pieces of metal. They&#39;re sensitive for a reason, I mean better safe than sorry, right? Somehow, yesterday, the conditions were just right to trigger a false alarm. Instead of sharing with everyone how fallible the system really is, the Gov decided to blame it on a careless employee. It would cause a lot less panic.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The &quot;false alert&quot; was staged.</strong> In an attempt to distract the MSM from some policy he is currently pursuing, Trump ordered the &quot;fake&quot; threat. Now the news cycles will be dominated day and night by this &quot;mistake&quot; allowing him to pursue his true intentions. Or, alternatively, he wanted to demonstrate to the people that the U.S has an early warning system, although I don&#39;t think this is likely as the amount of panic that the alert would have caused (car crashes, heart attacks, etc) would not have been worth it.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The mistake was exactly that; a mistake.</strong> Honestly, I have a hard time believing that any operator could accidentally send out a message like that. These guys are trained for months before they are put at that station, and it seems to me like sending out a state wide alert takes more than just one press of a button. Also, the operator would have immediately noticed that the alert went out, and they would have been able to correct it much faster (not the 38 min that is did).</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever really happened yesterday, I don&#39;t think it was just an errant press of a button. But no matter what the actual cause was, <strong>this event was still a tragedy.</strong> Why? If there ever is a <em>real</em> threat and people get this message, they are now less likely to believe it, and that means they are less likely to seek shelter or prepare in anyway. Remember guys, don&#39;t let this turn into a &quot;the Gov cried wolf&quot; story. If you ever get a notification like this, your first thought should be finding shelter, then questioning. </p>

<p>Good night everyone.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Some additional interesting points some people have made below in the comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the system was hacked, it was likely by a coordinated organization.</li>
<li>Similar to my fourth possibility, the message could have been a (seriously fucked up) social experiment. </li>
<li>NK launched a missile to fall short in order to test our response system. I think this is unlikely considering the threat of our retribution.</li>
<li><a href="/u/Meistermalkav">/u/Meistermalkav</a> had an interesting analysis regarding the possible hacking of the system: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7qax47/a_couple_of_possibilities_for_what_really_went/dso3b0g/">Here</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> In the event of an actual threat like this, these should be your first few steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Seek immediate indoor shelter. The lower the better. Basements are ideal. Don&#39;t worry too much about the structural integrity of the building. If you are in the blast radius or near the shockwave you are basically SOL anyways.</li>
<li>Fill up a bathtub or other containers with water. This can be boiled later for drinking water.</li>
<li>Shut off the building&#39;s air circulation if possible. Assuming you survive the blast and shockwave, your biggest issue is going to be radioactive fallout. That means you want clean water and air for as long as possible.</li>
<li><em>Stay indoors.</em> Waiting even 24hrs after the blast drastically lowers your changes of dying from radiation poisoning. Wait indoors as long as possible. Keep an eyes on the news. But don&#39;t go outside.</li>
</ul>

<p>How does that not make sense?  I&#39;m not claiming to know what the hell happened.  It was obviously a massive fuck up.  However, just in an operational sense, it would of course be easier to send a warning than the retract it.  </p>

<p>Imagine you were told by someone a nuke was coming to your home.  You would hit the alarm without question.  Now imagine after being told that someone else said it was a false alarm.  Would you immediately retract the alarm?  Or, as I would do, and I imagine most people would do, double and triple check to make sure you can retract the alarm?  </p>

<p>Also, yes, I can imagine a bureaucracy taking 12 minutes to confirm things.  How does that not make sense?  12 minutes is goddamn fast for an organization like the military.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They use the same system to retract the message as they use to send it though. By &quot;retract&quot; we are all really just talking about a follow up message. So they shouldn&#39;t need any additional clearance to send a follow up message using the same system they just used. Unless they are only allowed to send one message without clearance, but that doesn&#39;t make sense either. What if they had to warn of a second threat?

<p>I like how you assumed something, and then created scenarios that make it sound ridiculous.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the hell happened.  You don&#39;t either.  The guy above says there were messages within 12 minutes of the initial message.  12 minutes.  That&#39;s pretty damn fast within a bureaucracy  like the military is.  </p>

<p>Also, if this was some grand conspiracy,  to what end?  Hawaii has something like 0.0001% (gustimatting here) of the population.  There has been little coverage of it.  If they wanted to create some sort of panic they would have gone with LA, San Francisco, Seattle, or something.  A place where there are people and commerce going on.  </p>

Issuing one without having to receive clearance is logical, given that every second counts in such a situation - having to wait on clearance would result in massive casualties, so I imagine alerts would be issued almost automatically and without the need for time-wasting red tape to be sliced through.</p>

<p>However to retract an alert would, I imagine, require confirmation, I assume from the military and/or the intelligence services or whoever deals with this kinda thing, that there is absolutely definitely 100% no imminent prospect of everyone being killed in a ball of heat and light. So yea, it kinda does make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d imagine time is of the essence here. You have mere minutes between missile detection and strike, so employees are likely given that power to hear the order to send out the message and hit the button with as little time to waste in between. Retracting it tho could put thousands of lives at risk in a real scenario. Better to risk a false alarm but have people safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q: What really happened?</p>

<p>A: We don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>What we do know is that the alert got splashed all over TV and the internet. We also know that nothing physically happened... no missile strike.</p>

<p>But we also know that the story includes &quot;ballistic missile&quot; and &quot;Hawaii&quot;. So anyone with half a brain is going to start thinking about North Korea.</p>

<p>We also know that the result of an alert like this will be a huge amount of fear. So get people all scared of North Korea, then if/when you take action against them it will seem justified.</p>

<p>Timing is <strong>way</strong> too convenient considering all the trash talk between Trump and Kim over the last few months.</p>

Hell of a weird coincidence. It scares me. Makes me want to make a bug out bag. I travel all over the area for work, on the bus. My family is so spread out. At any given time I could be miles away from my loved ones, and even then I worry for my boyfriend who works in a super metro area that wouldn’t be possible to leave. And he doesn’t know the city like I do, I don’t know if he’d make it to any number of safe places, at least with people he knows and trusts.</p>

<p>God I hate this shit. I have two baby nephews and just want them to live in a world that isn’t dying or under threat of dying. Pisses me off.</p>

<p>I’m grateful that nothing came of it. But t seems so brushed over and that 37 min thing is a hell of a coincidence </p>

You can find the book <em>Nuclear War Survival Skills</em> online if you&#39;re interested in learning about it.  The immediate blast effects of a single warhead are relatively localized.
 Aside from an underground shelter, even just a few miles away, a sturdy building or basement might be enough protection to survive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a fucking tornado warning. It&#39;s a nuke for fuck&#39;s sake. It&#39;s basically a courtesy to warn the civilian population. Estimated time for the missile to travel is about 40 minutes, 20 if they have actually developed the weapons alleged recently. So it&#39;s a safe bet sending the warning out would and should take quite the effort.</p>

<p>More importantly, you also risk retaliation. Which in all likelihood is what this is all about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depending on how many people in the cities left vs stayed, they could work out general stats for death counts in the city, for one example. Or just find out general numbers on general reactions so they can make better plans for potential future outcomes of a genuine event, like if large groups left the city for specific areas then in an actual event you could assume that those particular areas would be where people go to again.

    <div class="md"><p>If someone was going to nuke the US they’d probably care more about destroying a city and infrastructure and/or military bases than hitting where people are going to flee. You’re not going to have 80% of any cities population go to one place for shelter. People are going to scatter to the closest place they can think of. Even if 80% of a cities population fled to the same spot in the countryside (and somehow they were able to make it in the short amount of time with traffic like you’d see in that scenario) I think the enemy would rather wipe out an entire city than bomb some random mountain or forest to kill more people.  </p>

<p>If there’s a country that’s to the point where they’re going to attack the US with nukes they’re just going to launch everything they have at the same time to hit as much as they can. Every major city will get a few nukes at least, as well as the major population centers surrounding them (suburbs and surrounding towns and cities) and there will be at least one nuke headed towards every known military base in the country. This is Mutually Assured Destruction. If they launch they know they’ll get a full retaliation so they’ll send everything they have right at the beginning. Also, if you’re stupid enough to nuke the US then it makes sense to just send everything you have at one time to overwhelm any defenses we’ve developed and ensure bombs get through.   </p>

<p>This is all fucked up to even think or talk about and I’m probably on a list now. But they’re not going to care where people run to. They’re just going to nuke the shit out of major cities and the surrounding areas.  </p>

<p>And if it was NK attacking they wouldn’t want to waste their limited number of nukes trying to bomb where they think people might flee to. They’d just aim for the most densely populated area of the biggest city in Hawaii. Or the biggest cities on each island. And they wouldn’t just send one or two nukes to Hawaii and call it a day. They’d know they’d get leveled the second they’d launch any attack on the US so they’d hit the biggest cities in Hawaii and up and down the West Coast as well as Guam and I’m sure they’re not going to launch an attack until they can reach DC and NYC too. Not to mention they’d nuke SK and shell Seoul as soon as their nuke(s) launched. It would be a suicidal decision and they’d take everything they could with them. It would be stupid for them to fire one missile at Hawaii (or even a few at Hawaii) and do nothing else. Trump wouldn’t try to cover it up. He’d take that as the excuse he needs to turn the whole country to glass. If NK attacks first China won’t defend them. So if they really did launch a nuke at us we’d level the country and China would sit by and shrug and be like “you did it to yourselves”</p>

So if this was indeed a social experiment, that&#39;s a risk our &#39;leaders&#39; were willing to take (along with all the potential looting/murder/innocents being harmed).. I think this tells you exactly how us tax cattle are perceived, our lives are merely a bargaining chip used for power on the global stage.. it&#39;s not good..</p>

<p>It&#39;s Hawaii, how much of an act of preparation could one undertake to assuage an impending missile? If I were to bug out, yet lived in Hawaii under the threat of destruction, I&#39;d still be clueless.</p>

<p>If it was just a mistake, this is the part I cant wrap my head around and the part I don&#39;t know why more people aren&#39;t emphasizing</p>

<p>Thirty-eight minutes is a long, long fucking time for a message like this to go uncorrected, I can&#39;t fathom how this response was so goddamn late</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the recent wildfires in California I&#39;d been getting an alert 2 or 3 times a day as the fires moved and evacuation zones updated. Just looked on my phone, got 8 alerts over the course of a few days.</p>

<p>Power was also intermittent. An alert went off at 2 AM, was woken up by it, power was out, alert simply said &quot;Evacuate Now&quot;. Couldn&#39;t use mobile internet to access anything. They sent the correction 30 minutes (almost to the minute) later which specified that the evacuate now was for a specific area, that the original alert was missing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I don&#39;t find this too strange. I just experienced something very similar a few weeks ago. In fact they messed up a message a day earlier (listed the wrong street names) and they corrected that one, again, 30 minutes later.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s either some limitation in the system, or it takes that long for them to realize the mistake and correct it. I&#39;m leaning towards the former.</p>

<p>As u/showmeurboobsplznthx pointed out, it took 3+ minutes for his various devices to receive the original alert: &quot;my t mobile got the warning at 804 and att got it at 806 while the tv and Wi-Fi connected devices went off at 807.&quot; There&#39;s also reports of some people getting the correction sooner than others by 5-10 mins.</p>

<p>I think the emergency alert system is a lot shittier than a lot of us imagine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a limitation of technology that&#39;s not easily fixed. Cell networks aren&#39;t provisioned with the idea that 100% of cell phones are currently active, so when an alert goes out to all phones, it&#39;s overloading the network momentarily, which is why it takes a couple minutes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the ideal situation, but the only real fix would be overbuilding all the cell networks, and since the cell networks are built by companies, that&#39;s not going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government is full of sociopaths. Sociopaths are the types of people who crave power and influence, have an inflated ego, and also have no empathy and an inability to consider or care about the lives and feelings of others, in many cases actually enjoying causing others pain. These are exactly the type sof people that make it to the top in our current society, in the business and politics world. They&#39;re ruthless, they take risks taht, if they by chance come off well, make them look impressive, they will do anything and trample over anyone to advance their own position and agenda, and they will seek out people they can control and blackmail to surround them, they&#39;ll find ways to manipulate others to do what they want. They think they&#39;re invincible, so they don&#39;t even recognise when risks they&#39;re taking actually put themselves in danger also. They are absolutely the worst type of people to be running the world, yet they do run the world. Our government is utterly, stinking, rotten to the core, corrupt I&#39;m afraid. If you&#39;re a patriot, disentangle that idea firmly from whatever the government says or does and think only about what&#39;s best for the people, and be aware always that the government is very capable and willing to harm its own citizens in order to spark wars for reasons of profit or power.</p>

<p>I always think to myself how these powerful sociopaths wouldn&#39;t be able to fuck everything up if only the people who work behind the scenes, people in the military, the arms industries, the big corporations etc, understood the truth of how things run and refused to carry out orders that were directed by liars and evil doers, if people refused to put their own or anyone&#39;s lives in danger enacting the agendas of people they don&#39;t know, unless they had seen firm hard evidence to back up the action. </p>

<p>A mistake could of happened, these systems are complex and, like everything, are prone to failure. The failure could have been in the code, or a human failure. I think it being a mistake is the most likely scenario.
A hack would not necessarily mean a group would claim responsibility either, in fact if it was a hack I doubt any hacking group that isn&#39;t a terrorist group would claim responsibility </p>

<p>No. If you are trying to incite panic and check response times of potential targets you don&#39;t trip their alert system and then claim responsibility. That would be like a burglar chucking a brick through somebodies window or kicking the door in the middle of the night a few weeks before a planned robbery to see if there are any alarms, dogs, or some other form of security in place and then cycling through the street with a loudspeaker yelling &quot;that was me guys!

    <div class="md"><p>Let me offer another theory.  NK purposely launches a conventional missile on a Hawaii trajectory, but set to splash down midway.  They do this to see if A) it gets shot down shortly after launch and B) to observe the American reactions/timing.</p>

<p>Missile is launched, detected, seen to be on course for Hawaii, alert goes out.  Some time later, it splashed down, US doesn’t know why but hey it is gone, so all clear issued.</p>

<p>What if the system was hacked as a test to see if they could control the EAS with the end goal being that if they could control it they could also shut it down limiting the ability of the government to send a legitimate warning in the case of them firing missiles at the US? </p>

<p>They could effectively stop the chance of the government getting a warning out to people before it was too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a thought exercise. I&#39;m not saying this is what happened but if it did you could most like hack all EAS systems if you can hack one of them since they are all pretty much the same and designed to hit radio, tv, and phones all in one go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>with respect, it was pretty .... far out here. </p>

<p>Basically, if you hack, you try to sneak in, and get controll of the system before you get controll. because the more time you spend in controll of the system without the owner knowing anything, that&#39;s it. You are home free. You basically can put the system in a parked position, and that&#39;s it. If you are lucky, you get in a back door, but nothing major. </p>

<p>Contradicts your natrrative extremely. </p>

<p>Why? because the owner has allways the option to pull the plugs, let the backup come, and reset from backup. </p>

<p>now, just from the options Presented, it is roughly a minute and 180 characters on the keyboard to, instead of sending out one singular message, to launch a script that sends out a message every hour on the hour. Or, every minute on the minute. Or, every second on the second. </p>

<p>What would you do if there was a message every second of the day, right? you would assume the system is broken,you would shut off your cellphonbe, you would be unprepared. </p>

<p>Missle would do maximum ammounts of damage. </p>

<p>Was that what happened? No? </p>

<p>Instead, we saw a single message. One. </p>

<p>Designed to spread the maximum ammount of panic, create the maximum media impact, ect. </p>

<p>So, at the same time, we have the famous schroedingers hacker, who is skilled enough to hack through a layer of security, but weak enough to not know what to do. </p>

<p>But he is from North Korea, he is extremely devious, ...</p>

<p>Counter narrative: </p>

<p>The entire operation, if it was an operation, was extremely senseless and only a non skilled person would even believe for a second it could have succeeded. However, it was designed for maximum publicity. </p>

<p>If I had to solve this. I would go as follows: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take every account that retweeted pictures. 3 month before, till now. Complete profile, i.e., where are they, what did they, what did they do it with. </p></li>
<li><p>Take every news agency that reported on this. Establish a timeline. Any agencies that reported a bit too late, or at the same timne on this? Check their books. Any large ammounts of donnations? </p></li>
<li><p>Check everyone who had access to the messaging system. In a 6 month window, starting with the contractor who installed new floors in the building, and ending with the person who made the purchse decision on the spellcheck. Just look for the irregularrities. </p></li>
<li><p>If any more then 4 people of one person act suspicious, investigate closer. If there were transfers in the same field, but to other organisations, take the timeline, and match it up to the date of trhe computer manipulation that led to this. With a match, send by a swat team to have a talk with this person. </p></li>
<li><p>Pull the paper printouts of the log files. Go over them, line by line. Mark any irregularity. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Because in my mind, the most likely situatiuon is as follows: </p>

<p>someone has triggered this, either legitimately or illegitimately. If we play by the numbers, most hacks and hackers have their origin in disgruntled system operators, or former employees, that let slip a password or two. If not trigger it themself. Squeeze the staff, and the mole will popp up. Then, you can seriously suspect that this person was a terrorist, and straight up ship him to guantanamo to question him. Because that was assisting in a terrorist act, and no, if people are shivering in their bathtubs and afraid to look up, that&#39;s not &quot;rivallry&quot;, that&#39;s an act of terrorism, and if it is linked to a political ideology, it&#39;s politically motivated terrorism. Plus, computer crime. one of those goes away if his cooperation helps us catch the man who performed the hack. </p>

<p>If it was a hack, and not a malfunction a la, press F1 to hand out a prewritten warning to the population, and disable the conform popup, we have to look at the effect. </p>

<p>a terrified population, sudden unwillingness to talk about the war against south east asian countries, massive social media exposure, and a finger at trump. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>suspect: The american left. We spimply apply &quot;qui bono&quot;, and we get the political left. wouldn&#39;t be news to them, with the ammountr of fake news spin they put out. IF it can be used to criticise trump, you can epect them to manifacture it, and to then treat it as secret information that they could impossibly reveal, but that everybody has to follow. #trump dossier, ect. . </p></li>
<li><p>Suspect: american right. Simply put, the population of honolulu is somewhat liberal. to squeeze them for anything defense related would be a hardpress. But after they spend half an hour praying in their bathtubs, you could possibly get by with a 5 % property tax increase to fund bomb shelters on the island. Plus, witrh the ammount of billionaires, it wouldn&#39;t be a stretch. Plus, scared pople have the liberal driven right out of them. </p></li>
<li><p>Suspect: Grey emminence. Let&#39;s simply assume for a second, what we are seeing is not the trick. everybody starts screaming about the message, and responsibility, so that other shit gets talked over. Shit that might massively influence 1 side or the other. and that thusly passes, either driven by the popular voice on one side, or the popular voice on the other side. Things like sorros and such conme to mind, who would not be opposed to manipulating an entire US country. </p></li>
<li><p>Clearing the way. I put this in because I have something that just does not seem to fit right. the consequene is that suddenly, all people sought shelter. all of them. Humans, tourists, ect.... Normally, if it is hawaii, it is ensured there are some eyes on every part of the island, the roads, ect... But due to the alert, we suddenly have fewer people actively looking, filming. Cameras are switched off, as patriotic americans help the person in fear. It smells like something that would have under normal circumstances have been visible, but under the sharpened circumstances, would either be not visible, or would be taken as &quot;hysteria&quot;. The question is, 30 Minutes, that&#39;s enough for a flyby, or a landing, and even then, you never know what&#39;s on the ground. lus, we don&#39;t have the target. Lets say we want a bank to be hacked, and we need 5 minutes alone with the main computer. we fire the hack, we get everybody out, and while we direct people to the nearest shelter, our guy works with the computer. 
This is why I call it, clearing the way. because it may not neccessarily have been the impetus, it may have been part of a larger operation that required lots of people looking away from a particular area. May it be ground based, land based, sea based, air based, or so forth. Call me old fashioned, but my spider senses are tingling. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a Deep State psyop - reinforce the fear of North Korea that&#39;s been subsiding due to Trump&#39;s masterful diplomacy. This fear is itself a longstanding component of the &quot;Asia Rising&quot; control strategy to remove American&#39;s image of themselves as the global leader. This has been in place since the 90s, when Clinton armed China, and hence NK, with the needed technology and resources. </p>

<p>A missile alert reminds people that the Norks can attack us, in a very visual/visceral way, to bolster fear and create uncertainty in Trump&#39;s strategy.</p>

<p>Yes, a missile was launched from North Korea set to destroy Hawaii, however they weren&#39;t shot down. I think it is highly likely the islands of Hawaii are currently wiped out, and the government is covering it up. If what I fear is true, than it is the largest such cover-up since JFK &quot;averted&quot; mass destruction during the Cuban Missile Crisis. </p>

<p>I believe it was, at the very least, a hack. I received the alert on my phone and went downstairs to ask my wife if she had gotten it. She had been on the phone at the time and told me that cell service had completely dropped. No service whatsoever. </p>

<p>Evidently, this happened to many people here on the island. </p>

<p>Also, the narrative being pushed right now is basically a fat finger of a button. This is not possible as an employee of that very station disclosed that the button is under a safety lock with a cover and must be pushed 3 times in a row in order to activate it. So it’s a deliberate act. </p>

<p>This was an attempt to view how we would react to a real scenario. No one was prepared and the media is plastering all of these interviews of those who were here detailing their actions so whoever did this (NK?) knows how much chaos a real middle would create. </p>

<p>This also created a boy-who-cried-wolf scenario. I guarantee that if we had another alert, the vast majority of people would not react as quickly as they did yesterday, if at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shortly after this post yesterday, I found this in the Washington Post. There is no physical button. The alert was triggered by a selection from a drop down menu on a computer program. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Around 8:05 a.m., the Hawaii emergency employee initiated the internal test, according to a timeline released by the state. From a drop-down menu on a computer program, he saw two options: “Test missile alert” and “Missile alert.” He was supposed to choose the former; as much of the world now knows, he chose the latter, an initiation of a real-life missile alert.</p>

<p>“In this case, the operator selected the wrong menu option,” HEMA spokesman Richard Rapoza told The Washington Post on Sunday.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can purchase iodine pills online for that very reason - you need potassium iodine.  Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer from radiation exposure.  As to the vodka?  I don&#39;t know about that but I can tell you we used to use grain alcohol for certain poisons (IV flush) because it would bind with the material and flush it safely out of the body instead of letting it sit in the kidneys, shutting them down.  A body with no working kidneys doesn&#39;t last long.</p>

Look at how many times Trump and his administration have announced something extremely controversial around a holiday or a natural disaster when people are less likely to be paying attention to politics or come out with several controversial statements within a day or two of each other to confuse the public. Certainly took the spotlight off his “shithole countries” comment, didn’t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t stress enough how unlikely it is that there was an actual missile fired. The sheer number of different governments and independent groups that have individual, independent and secure means of detecting such launches is just too large for people to keep quiet. </p>

<p>Sure, the timing works out, but there are too many nations that would have seen a launch and gone to absolute pucker factor 12 for it to stay quiet. </p>

<p>Off the top of my head you have China, Russia, the US, the Japanese and the South Koreans all who would have seen the launch, many of whom would have issues warnings <em>independently</em> of the US if a launch had taken place.</p>

<p>On top of that, the threat of a missile launch or a missile launched and intercepted is enough to trigger a response according to what&#39;s publicly available about the US SIOP. There isn&#39;t a human hand in the decision, the system isn&#39;t designed to allow for it. Humans solely serve to authenticate and validate fire orders, because if the system was designed to allow for humans to sit around going &quot;Hmm, would we shoot back&quot; There&#39;s a good chance the infrastructure needed to do so would be destroyed before the order was finally given.</p>

<p><em>On top of</em> <strong><em>that</em></strong> you have the fact that if it was GMD that was used to intercept the weapon if it had been fired (which is the only viable system we know to have the ability to do so) you would see people reporting on and wondering why Fort Greely decided to launch one or several interceptors at the same time as a report of a nuclear attack was issues to the west-south-west. Fort Greely isn&#39;t in an isolated place, there are dozens of towns and Anchorage itself along the flight path an interceptor would take.</p>

<p>I&#39;d happily entertain the thoughts of it being a hack, it makes sense. A missile launch does not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m inclined to think it was staged.</p>

<p>Think of what this incident does on a subliminal level... It introduces the meme of nuclear war... Of an attack on the American home soil... Into the minds of every American, for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. The threat of &quot;terrorism&quot; has manifested itself for the last two decades, but as far as state actors go we&#39;ve gotten so far into so baby foreign engagements that there isn&#39;t room for this generation&#39;s Saddam. They want to make Putin into that but for now it doesn&#39;t have any weight for our people since every &quot;mad dictator&quot; for the last 40-50 years at least has been an &quot;over there&quot; issue.</p>

<p>This small dose of mental trauma changes that. Americans are now thinking &quot;what if it happened here&quot;... And having had no real education or preparedness, they will be impressionable in regards to what this event means. It any mention of domestic attack will now conjure up real feelings of fear that can be used to ensure our compliance in foreign engagements.</p>

<p>And if you think the Trump Administration is too ham-handed for such a stroke of thought-control finesse, you&#39;re right. It&#39;s almost certainly the action of a covert branch of a three letter agency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Around 8:05 a.m., the Hawaii emergency employee initiated the internal test, according to a timeline released by the state. From a drop-down menu on a computer program, he saw two options: “Test missile alert” and “Missile alert.” He was supposed to choose the former; as much of the world now knows, he chose the latter, an initiation of a real-life missile alert.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, being a developer, I can see this as a real possibility. Government systems tend to not be made with the best resources (bad developers, bad UX designers or no UX designers at all) and it being that easy to send out a real alert instead of a test one with no confirmation or anything would be a possibility. But of course, it still could have been on purpose. </p>
