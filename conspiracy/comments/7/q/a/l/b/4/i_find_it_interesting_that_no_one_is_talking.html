    <div class="md"><p>interesting question yes.  let&#39;s go thru the scenarios.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>NK isn&#39;t a deep state puppet (laughable proposition, really).  launches missile (even though they&#39;ve been trying to negotiate peace).  US stops it.  info gathered:  NK&#39;s tactics.  human response on the ground including where ppl fuck off to.</p></li>
<li><p>deep state NK (the likely case) launches missile.  other actors stop it.  info gathered:  deep state tactics.  human response on the ground including where fancy people fuck off to.</p></li>

<p>well who is in that list?  China.  Russia.  India perhaps.  Japan.  and NATO countries.  of those who would leak it?  hmmm..maybe none.  i don&#39;t think they&#39;d do it without a lot of diligence.  and i don&#39;t think it would be a quick decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you not reading my other comments?</p>

<p>Russia might, but only if they knew exactly what the consequences were.  otherwise they&#39;d keep the data for later use.</p>

<p>China is insular and doesn&#39;t really want to cause problems.  that&#39;s always been their historical stance.</p>

<p>India follows the west because of their economy.</p>

<p>Pakistan..that&#39;s a wild card.  they seem to play both sides..but actors that do that aren&#39;t lead actors.  they follow the leads of others.  so they&#39;d probably wait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dismissive?  it&#39;s just a model.  if you have an alternate one, fire away!</p>

<p>of course there&#39;s a complexity to the situation and not all actors have the same motivations.  but.  if one of them had inside info that was at odds with the US narrative, do you think they&#39;d spread it?  there aren&#39;t that many actors with that capacity, and of them, not many that do that.  and they do it very selectively.  for instance 911.  inside job, of course.  how many countries declared it so?  crickets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there really was a missile launch they probably wouldn&#39;t tell anyone. Less panic. 
I imagine it&#39;s someone who knew of the strike and was trying to get out a message to the world so they could be ready and at least spend their last minutes with loved ones or doing something they have put off.

It seems they have yet to even get their nukes to function reliably, and yet to develop the ICBM to propel it there.
