       Yes. They knew people were calling in and were worried, but they continued on. IMO, it was a mass psychological experiment. Leave it to the spooks to psychologically terrorize the masses.

       Because it was a scheduled event, and I am imagine from their perspective it was obvious it wasn’t really occurring, and thus a few people “overreacting” was likely not an issue for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record the number of people calling in panicked has been greatly exaggerated as well.  Based on available information the program has very few listeners and it was likely no more than a hand full of people calling in with concerns. Not exactly a show stopper.

       It wasn't meant to refute. I certainly hope your reading comprehension is better than you're letting on.

       Clearly my response was a direct answer to the question you asked. Now, if you'd like to actually provide a source for your claim we can examine the possibilities of providing a refutation.

       Are you not capable of scrolling up where I responded to one of your posts asking for a source?
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently that's asking a lot so here you go:
"Yes. They knew people were calling in and were worried, but they continued on. IMO, it was a mass psychological experiment (ie. later Blue Beam). Leave it to the spooks to psychologically terrorize the masses of their own country men and women..."
      </p>
      <p>
       So unless you have some sort of information that actually points to psychological experimentation I think it's safe to say you're just making shit up.

       And you're basing that opinion on....?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either you have a source for the material you're basing that opinion on, or it's unfounded. I'm asking if there is a source so I know if there is something to refute, or to verify whether or not you're just making up whatever story you want to believe in your head irregardless of the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       A claim is an assertion. You asserted your belief, that's what we're discussing. I'm not sure why you chose to take issue with my use of the word, but I think we can both agree that arguing semantics isn't going to get us anywhere productive.

       So a quick search shows no mention of the War of the Worlds broadcast. So... kinda leaves us back where we started.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be clear let's use an example to show why that link is useless for the purposes of this discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say there is a dead body and the cause of death was unknown. If you asserted you think he was shot, and then provided the reasoning that a lot of people die from being shot, that wouldn't actually establish that the man in front of us was shot. I'm asking why you believe what you believe about this specific event, not why you believe conspiracies are real or why you think some other conspiracy is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you can actually show a connection between operation Mockingbird and this event then providing information on Operation Mockingbird is useless. For the record I am familiar with what Operation Mockinbird is, just not how it pertains to this example.

       An opinion can be an assertion. The two are not mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible to assert an opinion. An assertion is merely something that has been asserted. If you assert an opinion it becomes an assertion. Is that clear enough for you?

        The War of the Worlds is an episode of the American radio drama anthology series The Mercury Theatre on the Air. It was performed as a Halloween episode of the series on Sunday, October 30, 1938, and aired over the Columbia Broadcasting System radio network.
       </p>
       <p>
        The network is the oldest unit of the CBS Corporation and traces its roots to CBS's predecessor, United Independent Broadcasters, founded in 1927 with 47 affiliates. The next year, Columbia Records invested in the radio network, which was named the Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System. Eventually, the record company pulled its backing from the struggling web. William S. Paley bought a half-interest in what became the Columbia Broadcasting System in 1928, and became its president.
       </p>
       <p>
        During World War II, Paley served as director of radio operations of the Psychological Warfare branch in the Office of War Information at Allied Force Headquarters in London, where he held the rank of colonel. While based in England during the war, Paley came to know and befriend Edward R. Murrow, CBS's head of European news who expanded the news division's foreign coverage with a team of war correspondents later known as the Murrow Boys. In 1946, Paley promoted Frank Stanton to president of CBS. CBS expanded into TV and rode the post-World War II boom to surpass NBC, which had dominated radio.

       Do we have any reason to believe that the director of the radio network would have been involved with the writing or production of that specific show?
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking further in to the wiki it appears as if Orson Welles was the one calling the shots on what and how things were broadcast for the show.
      </p>

       I'll admit that it's an interesting connection, but based on what I'm looking at right now I'm not sure I see the wires going all the way to this event. However, it does go a good ways to establishing that perhaps some suspicion of CBS at large may be warranted.

       I'm not necessarily looking for hard evidence. Really just anything that would indicate direct involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example let's look at something like Stanley Kubrick's movies. If you were to point out some minor detail in one of his films and explain to me that it was significant and part of some grand sub-plot, I might actually believe (or at the very least entertain the possibility) because it is well documented that Stanley Kubrick was obsessive and detail oriented.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of right now it looks like just a tenuous connection that may or may not lead to something more. Do you want to share some of the other interesting connections?

       Is that what you call people who think the earth is flat? Thinkers?  Plus what I was referring to is the rudeness and how convinced some people are of their own beliefs. The world smartest man once said the more he learned the more he realized how little he know, but we have people on here who are so certain of themselves, that’s the problem with the internet, depending on how you search you can validate ANY opinion and make yourself feel smarter than others.

       I didn't call them thinkers... I said they think something. Unless you're claiming that flat earthers are catatonic I'm not sure why you take issue with that characterization.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were referring to rudeness you might want to actually reference rudeness then. Your comment only seems to reference that some people believe outlandish claims, therefore they shouldn't have an issue with this claim because it's less outlandish. Not exactly a winning argument in my book.

       Yes, he broadcasted it as if it was real, at a historical period information traveled at the speed of a snail.  Now a days, that false alarm affected a lot more people in 38 minutes, than Wells broadcasted did in that same amount of time.  Info is global, people all over the world thought NK just bombed the US.  It's beyond fucked up imo.

       Classically that situation is taught as an example of mass histeria, so historically speaking, the general masses have accept the general story.  Kind of like 9/11, on this sub alone there is probably at the least a 100 different versions of how that played out, but regardless the majority of people think it played out exactly how the 9/11 commision report has it...  Regardless, this mistake, which they are claiming will be more common, has a major impact on society.

       Respectfully, that doesn't matter as far as today's events are concerned. I posted this as (A) a reminder there is a historical precedent for something like this and (B) Wouldn't it be simple to take that concept and put a modern twist on it. Especially considering the MSM has been trying to convince us NK is right around the corner from bomb us.

       The numbers affected were vastly different. The mediums used were vastly different. The causes were different. The response was different.

       Differing numbers affected due to modern mediums of communication. The cause fits the current media narrative of NK being out to get us (and have the capability of doing so). The response is panic and confusion in both instances.

       1) the vastly different numbers leave us with a vastly different situation. Scale matters. If one person gets sick, that routine and not an issue. If a quarter of the country gets sick it’s an epidemic. The radio broadcast resulted in a handful of people panicked, not at all comparable to the current incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) NK was not a factor in the radio broadcast, so again just goes to show how different the two situations are.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Again, scale.

       Not really similar in that it was not widely reported and no panic really took place. The context of what people say happened maybe loosely comparable but the real story isn’t comparable as nobody really got freaked out!

       It was meant to seem real, but Welles was already fairly known as a playwright and along with several disclaimers most people knew it was staged. Also the show it was on was not particularly popular. But being the theatrical fucker that he was, he sold and promoted the shit out of it.

       That whole 1938 panic thing wasn't real, almost nobody was fooled by the broadcast.  It was just a sensationalized article in one paper on a slow news day.  Early example of fake news. That story itself..  The story that Americans naively believe everything they hear on the radio, became the real panic, and it snowballed it's way into American Mythos.
