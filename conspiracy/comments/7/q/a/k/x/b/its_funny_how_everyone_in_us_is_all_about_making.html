       That's the game?  Pick a party, and believe they'll give a shit about you.  NEWS FLASH: They won't. They never have, and they never will.  Lol partisan lines on this sub?  You are in the wrong fucking place.  Try the politics sub.  Conspiracy is getting watered down with this shit and it's getting old.

       Uh, Arnold was the 2-term Republican governor of California from 2003 - 2010. The glimpse of the future of which you speak is what happens when Republicans run our country, into the ground, with their business-first policies. Check your facts, please.

       No, selling online in an oversaturated market doesn't make any money. And selling in the global market online is much more profitable than selling in person.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much area can one person sell to? If this were true, there would be a ton of door to door sales people like back in the day. I don't think you understand global market economies.

       Yeah if you haven't noticed, the system is setup to favor big business.  They aren't about to let you, or anyone stroll in and take a piece of their pie.  That is a problem which will not be solved peacefully.  If you think this is a one party, or another party problem, you're wrong.  Try starting your own ISP.  Try getting a patent.

       You are clearly not American, because if you were you'd know full well that I can do virtually anything I like in my coastal, utopian, Shangri-La. Being peachy and perceived of privilege goes a long way, provided no one is complaining about me.

       Yeah, it is fucking hysterical. I laugh about it all the time. I get a real good kick out of thinking about how I'm going to pay rent and hustle to make money.

       I know right? We are so fucking dumb. We just sit around like pigs rolling in our stupidity. Most of us kind of love it actually. We go to cocktail parties in all our rich clothes and talk to each other about how fun it is to be so fucking stupid.

       In short... stop with the fucking generalizations. I'm going to assume you aren't American since you framed your comment in a way that makes it appear as if you aren't.

       If you met the average American you might think differently about the dumb shit you just posted.
