<p>its funny how everyone in US is all about making money</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, it is fucking hysterical. I laugh about it all the time. I get a real good kick out of thinking about how I&#39;m going to pay rent and hustle to make money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but americans are too fucking stupid to even realize that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know right? We are so fucking dumb. We just sit around like pigs rolling in our stupidity. Most of us kind of love it actually. We go to cocktail parties in all our rich clothes and talk to each other about how fun it is to be so fucking stupid. </p>

<hr/>

<p>In short... stop with the fucking generalizations. I&#39;m going to assume you aren&#39;t American since you framed your comment in a way that makes it appear as if you aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>If you met the average American you might think differently about the dumb shit you just posted.</p>
