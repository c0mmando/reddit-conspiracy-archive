       he's a setup to look like a good guy, to pretend to be going after the pedo/baby eater satanists, who has tried to create the soil for ww3 and failed (witness today's events).  this Q dude is saying all the right things to make it look like there's an effort to take down the satanists, but in reality what's actually happening is the opposite.  a lot of other groups know what he's up to and have deliberately not fallen for his provocations.  there has to be an inside break to take these guys down, and the information regarding that has been put in the public domain (witness my earlier comments about human trafficking locations, for instance).  and if the public (and not the establishment which is so coopted it can't do shit) doesn't do their own diligence on stopping this crowd, it ain't happening.  to enable the elements of the establishment who know what's going on they also need to have the support of the public.  so the infrastructure to enable that has to happen.  it will happen, but it seems like people are really loathe to take tangible steps in enabling an organized takedown of this group.  this group is fundamentally the crown of england crowd.  they're behind all of this. the rest of them are all window dressing and lower level.

       well they can't find someone who is squeaky clean because there aren't any.  trump's the best they have.  note how he came from outside of politics.  he was groomed for this role.

       That would make sense if only *the public spends most of their effort trying to understand him".

       He is literally the opposite of what you are saying.

       I think he is a citizen that has a lot of dirt on a lot of people and truly doesn't like the shit that has been going on and is doing his best to stop it.

       oh come on.  someone writes a storyline.  they do this knowing how people react psychologically.  he's a character in a storyline.  his actions are not at all reformist.  you don't reform by hiding more things.  that's what you don't do.

       I think in such a scenario they picked his character to appeal to the "American Dream" of acquiring wealth by having a "self-made millionarie" type sell the idea of prosperity, and his celebrity status makes him liked. Also his unhinged and non-PC demenaour appeals to the part of the demographic that are fed up with the lack of transparency.

       right, and the whole idiot left deal was all a setup to make him look reformist.  he's not reformed shit.  he's removed checks and balances.  he's instituted military court shit.  there's no transparency except for what he tells us.

       Right, its pretty easy to see they want to use him as the subject of blame for anything or everything.

       Also, what better way to bring your own globalist puppet into power in the future than to get the entire population to hate the guy their canditate would be running against. Basically, in the 2020 election, people will be willing to vote for literally anyone else, like oprah, (wish I was joking here) who conveniently is the exact opposite on the surface of Trump.

       I mean don't forget that any intelligence agency have hundreds of psychologist that measure and predict how the population reacts to everything. Throw meta data in the mix and you can pretty much control the public's opinion and perception. I'm never 100% sure but I have a hunch something is up.

       I don’t think he was well liked. I think he was tolerated and was a spectacle.

       He was better spoken yes, but his idea’s were just as nuts. He was constantly saying things that wouldnt be acceptable from anyone else, it was tolerated because he was rich.

       Spot on dude. At least to my way of thinking. I think they used the same startegy to convince us the CIA are a bunch idiots, and this couldn't be further from the truth. Actually convincing us the CIA is stupid was fecking brilliant.

       I have had similar thoughts as well. It really seems like his whole presidency is a massive Psyops to distract from the globalist agenda cos when you peek behind scenes you see the same shit is happening as Obama drone strikes, the war in Afghanistan AFRICOM operations etc.. Not to mention every time there's a vote on a bill there's a distraction with some bogus thing he did or said.
I have also postulated that he is that outrageous naturally and instead of getting someone to act they just found someone who already fit the part.

       It's called plausible deniability. IMO, Trump is actually trying to shake things up for the better, or he's just another Jesuit/SMOM coadjutor. Who knows, and more importantly, who cares? This is coming from a "US citizen", as well. The system is so far gone, no president or politician can exactly turn the ship around, imo. We're better off just finding an island and creating our own country, imo. Yes, that is how bad things actually are...

       yes it's broken.  i get it.  but you don't remove existing processes.  that makes it even more smokey.  and if you'll notice as broken as the courts are they still, often, do the right thing.  it's just that things never go to court.  these controllerpants types don't let things go to court. that's one of their hacks.

       He has many Jesuit ties, and that troubles me. But, then again, he made some very powerful people nervous at the Catholic dinner him and Hillary went to. He's an enigma, that I'm still trying to figure out. Truly 50/50, not like most people.

       yeah he's backed by the romans.  it's all there.  it's all designed to confuse.  but fundamentally who he's selected for his cabinet, who he's bailed out, all of that is classic swamp.

       JFK came from a rich Roman Catholic family, though. Deep in bed with the Black Nobility. He faced the same forces Trump is facing. If Trump is legit, and trying to change things (like JFK tried to), would you eat your own tongue?

       Trump shares so much in common with JFK, yet gets shat on while JFK is praised. How and why, is beyond me, especially in a "conspiracy sub". I'm no "supporter", but you cannot deny that very powerful people are certainly against him.

       I think in such a scenario they picked his character to appeal to the "American Dream" of acquiring wealth by having a "self-made millionarie" type sell the idea of prosperity, and his celebrity status makes him liked. Also his unhinged and non-PC demenaour appeals to the part of the demographic that are fed up with the lack of transparency.
