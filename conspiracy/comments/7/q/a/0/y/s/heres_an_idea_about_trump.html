    <div class="md"><p>he&#39;s a setup to look like a good guy, to pretend to be going after the pedo/baby eater satanists, who has tried to create the soil for ww3 and failed (witness today&#39;s events).  this Q dude is saying all the right things to make it look like there&#39;s an effort to take down the satanists, but in reality what&#39;s actually happening is the opposite.  a lot of other groups know what he&#39;s up to and have deliberately not fallen for his provocations.  there has to be an inside break to take these guys down, and the information regarding that has been put in the public domain (witness my earlier comments about human trafficking locations, for instance).  and if the public (and not the establishment which is so coopted it can&#39;t do shit) doesn&#39;t do their own diligence on stopping this crowd, it ain&#39;t happening.  to enable the elements of the establishment who know what&#39;s going on they also need to have the support of the public.  so the infrastructure to enable that has to happen.  it will happen, but it seems like people are really loathe to take tangible steps in enabling an organized takedown of this group.  this group is fundamentally the crown of england crowd.  they&#39;re behind all of this. the rest of them are all window dressing and lower level.  </p>

<p>Also, what better way to bring your own globalist puppet into power in the future than to get the entire population to hate the guy their canditate would be running against.

It really seems like his whole presidency is a massive Psyops to distract from the globalist agenda cos when you peek behind scenes you see the same shit is happening as Obama drone strikes, the war in Afghanistan AFRICOM operations etc.. Not to mention every time there&#39;s a vote on a bill there&#39;s a distraction with some bogus thing he did or said.
I have also postulated that he is that outrageous naturally and instead of getting someone to act they just found someone who already fit the part. </p>
