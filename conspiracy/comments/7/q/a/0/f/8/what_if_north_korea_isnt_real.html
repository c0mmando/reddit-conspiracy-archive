       Imagine that North Korea is just an act, that our world leaders secretly enable them to be the brutal communist country that they are but also enable them to become a "nuclear power." This would be a means of justifying the massive military expenditure of the US, Chinese, and Russian governments. After North Korean posturing and nuclear tests, or in this case, an amber alert, you suddenly hear a lot fewer people criticizing defense spending. North Korea could be a means of justifying the military industrial complex.

       Being a 9/11 truther rather than a moon landing conspiracy theorist doesn't make you some intelligent connoisseur of facts.  You're being told what happened by the thousands of journalists, scientists, and eye witnesses and you are ignoring that information because of what you heard on youtube.

       Don't use your bullshit narrative framing to tell me where I get my information, though it's very telling for how YOU see the world.

      <p>
       I don't get all my information from YouTube. I've been researching this for years, I've traveled to meet with people who have been investigating 9/11 since the day it happened, with firefighters and family members.

       My bad, I didn't realize you were so personally invested in this "research".  Clearly, you sound way more reasonable than someone who thinks the earth is flat.  I mean, you already realized I was a shill, there's no way that you're knee deep in confirmation bias ignoring all data that doesn't fit a narrative you have a self image built around.

       North Korea is real, its leadership is real and the United States military industrial complex is in constant need of threats to try and justify its astronomic spending. If it wasn't a threat from North Korea then it would be the threat of China. If it wasn't China it would be Iran. If it's not Iran it's Muslim extremists. The US has a constant revolving door of threats that it will try and use to persuade the people in the US that they need to feed the Military Industrial Complex with billions and billions of dollars from tax payers. It wouldn't matter if Kim and his henchmen suddenly decided to walk away from their nuclear program, the US would just move onto the next perceived threat.

       I was told by someone that is was Bill Clinton who actually gave enriched uranium and the tools necessary to North Korea for nuclear energy and they used it to build weapons instead. Is this true?? Also the part that baffles me is that I was also told the world was aware of at that time of North Korea’s brutality and instability before bill made this trip. So the question is why give a regime like this these kind of resources to begin with???? Obviously this is all predicated on what I was told. With that begin said if this is true, it seems bang out of order. It’s a shame to think our administration is once again response for the own shit show on the planet. I seriously believe the world would be a better place if we never interfered anywhere. Just seems like we’ve made the planet a worse place for everyone else. Sorry about these strong words just my opinion. Hope your all well

       Yeah, I know it’s hard to believe in the atrocity the NK is but God, your post and people agreeing with you, it all comes from a place of your country never being an authoritarian regime. It’s like when Reddit communists say USSR wasn’t that bad, it was demonised by the US because ‘commies’ and imperialism (yeah no, the USSR was even shittier than you all thought).
       <br/>
       The US doesn’t need to manufacture threats, they are there. And while it’s hard to go to NK, it’s possible to go there and verify whether it is a regime or not. Or just ask some Eastern European about how real and unmanufactured regimes are.

       There were actually two weird threads linking NK and SK to Pizzagate, I cannot find them anymore. First when the spirit cooking leaks were being investigated, some coordinates or something were found pointing to places in NK and SK... Then people started saying after the Q shit that NK was Wonderland, weird coincidence, even though Q seems to be full of shit.

       Would you mind explaining how so? Many people view democracy, or republicanism, for that matter but, participation of the masses nonetheless, as one of humanity's great achievements. Sure, Great Britain had that, the Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania, and the Dutch Republic, and the Florentine Republic were all instances of peaceful participation of the people in government before the USA, but none of them stuck or were as free as America ever was. Before those countries I listed, there was Greece and Rome, but they had quite limited democracy and were more than a thousand years before the USA.

       I'm not a fan of what the United States has become, but one of my ideas of a perfect government would look incredibly similar to pre-Federalist America.
