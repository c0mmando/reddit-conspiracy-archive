        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is going to be a somewhat lengthy post. Before I can get into the meat of it, I think I should explain what CD&amp;N is, why they are credible, and the history of these blinds from the last month, so that those who are unaware might be caught up.</p>

<p>Recently, the Hollywood blog site crazydaysandnights.net has been getting more traction here on r/conspiracy, and for good reason. For those of you unfamiliar with the blog- it was founded in 2006 by a user named “Enty” who is, to the best of our knowledge, an entertainment lawyer in LA. </p>

<p>Whatever his occupation, the site has gained steady traction for what is called a “blind item”, which is a HW tradition in which gossip is spread w/ names redacted, but with hints and clues added so that the subject might be surmised by those who pay enough attention. CD&amp;N was calling out people like Spacey and Weinstein <em>years</em> before they were publicly exposed this fall. 
Here are links to these old blinds providing proof that CD&amp;N is legit- </p>

<p>Weinstein in 2016- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2016/04/blind-item-10_7.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2016/04/blind-item-10_7.html</a></p>

<p>Spacey in 2012- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/blind-items-revealed-6-anniversary-month_11.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/blind-items-revealed-6-anniversary-month_11.html</a></p>

<p>James Toback in 2013- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2013/06/blind-item-1_22.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2013/06/blind-item-1_22.html</a></p>

<p>Matt Lauer in 2014- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2014/04/blind-item-1.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2014/04/blind-item-1.html</a></p>

<p>So now to the main thrust of this post. Recently Enty has been writing about a “Church”, based in Northern Arizona. This Church is used as a nexus for child trafficking to the HW Elite with children from Eastern Europe.  Below I will give the links with a summary of each so as to catch everyone up.</p>

<p>First post from 12/12/17 (The Church)- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/12/todays-blind-items-church.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/12/todays-blind-items-church.html</a></p>

<p>This describes the Church, its purpose, and its location in N. Arizona, in a small town which already possesses a cult in which relationships between adults and children is already normalized. This will become important later. It describes how the children are brought in- the Church invites “guest pastors” from Eastern Europe who bring their “families”. These “families” are trafficked children, brought into the country under this cover story. These “pastors” join the Church and become a part of its “community”. Thus they provide the children.</p>

<p>Second post from 1/14/18 (The Church’s New Investment)- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-item-7-churchs-new-investment.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-item-7-churchs-new-investment.html</a></p>

<p>This is where things get even crazier. According to this post, the “Church” and its benefactor, believed by many commenters on the blog to be David Geffen, have funded many “causes” in Africa, including disease research. Apparently some of this research resulted in the creation of a new pathogen, with plague/Ebola like symptoms. It was decided that it would be deployed in a small African nation in order to kill off the parents of the children, who were already separated for one reason or another, and then could be trafficked into the US. This was a test case. Apparently something went wrong, and it spiraled out of control. There are two possible incidents in Africa recently that might fit this bizarre scenario.</p>

<p>One is the 2017 Madagascar Plague outbreak- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Madagascar_plague_outbreak">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Madagascar_plague_outbreak</a></p>

<p>Another, more recent one, is from just this week in Uganda- <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5334346/epidemic-fever-eyes-bleeding-black-death/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5334346/epidemic-fever-eyes-bleeding-black-death/</a></p>

<p>So the “Church” has potentially been experimenting with biological contaminants in an attempt to create situations with which it can feed the demands of its clients for children…</p>

<p>Finally, this post from today describes the supposed funding of this organization.</p>

<p>Third post from 1/15/18 (The Church’s Money)- <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-item-7-churchs-money.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-item-7-churchs-money.html</a></p>

<p>Supposedly, they obtained a “map”, which lead them to the multiple hidden locations of Qaddaffis $2 billion in gold bullion which was to be used to start the pan-African currency. With this money they continue to fund their endeavors, including the research and trafficking. I recommend everyone take the time to read all of the blinds I have just linked if you haven’t already- it will only take about 6 minutes total.</p>

<p>So with CD&amp;N explained, and the story now caught up, we get to what I believe is the most significant question. <em>Where</em> is the Church, and <em>which</em> organization is it? Enty says it’s a small N. AZ town that already has an established cult atmosphere. Pouring back over the comments from last month’s blind (the first linked), I came across a comment which suggested the organization in question was Short Creek Fellowship. It was founded in the town of Colorado City AZ, in the far Northwestern region of the State. Colorado City is home to an FLDS group which broke from the main church in the 50’s and has had its share of scandal. The town population is only 4500. So we have the geography right, the town size right, as well as the “already established church”. What’s more…the fellowship was founded as an “outreach” to FLDS, and specializes in trauma experienced by <em>trafficked children</em>. Yes…this is where things really start to come together.</p>

<p>Colorado City wiki- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_City,_Arizona">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_City,_Arizona</a></p>

<p>Google results for Short Creek Fellowship- <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=short+creek+fellowship&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS516US516&amp;amp;oq=short+creek+fel&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57.3380j0j9&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">https://www.google.com/search?q=short+creek+fellowship&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS516US516&amp;amp;oq=short+creek+fel&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57.3380j0j9&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8</a></p>

<p>I have laid out the posts. I’ve explained their significance, and I have linked what I believe may be the source of this madness…I wanted to throw this out to the community to see what you guys thought. I’m pretty stunned myself, and as I said, I found the link to the Fellowship in a blog comment from last month, but everything seems to fit. If this is true, if the breadcrumbs lead where I think they do…then this may very well be the actual location responsible for trafficking children to the Elite in HW, and possibly even farther afield in DC. There are potentially more connections to the former New Orleans House of Horrors blind which I’ll link below for anyone convinced by this post who wants to look for more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a native friend who told me he once passed through a town in northeastern Arizona where everybody was white and they all were wearing &quot;old-timey&quot; clothing, for example women with full dresses that cover the ankles and neck, etc. He said it was really uncomfortable because as he and his friend were passing through, they were the only non-white people, and almost everybody they passed on the street would watch them.</p>

<p>I wonder if this was the same town, considering these sections in the article:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I&#39;m going to look more into this. I don&#39;t under why CD&amp;N uses blinds though. I mean, other than it draws a ton of traffic to his website and keeps people there. But it&#39;s a pretty sleazy way to present information, IMO. If he really knows there&#39;s a church trafficking children in Arizona, he should say what it is and how he knows.  </p>

<p>But yes, it&#39;s definitely Colorado City he&#39;s talking about. That place is so strange. One of the only places I&#39;ve ever been where everyone in town actually gives you the evil eye when you drive through. And don&#39;t even think about stopping there. I&#39;m not sure how this relates to the Meadows--which is obviously the sex rehabilitation places he&#39;s referring to in the latter part of his post. Women have, in fact, gone there, though obviously less often than men. And there are pictures of men there. It&#39;s a real place. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to figure out what the Church is. Someone else said Dream City Church, but that doesn&#39;t seem to match to me.

<p>Also- if Enty knows, it&#39;s probably dangerous for him to come out and say it w/ names and exact locations. He gets farther by hinting and letting others figure it out and spread info than getting the hammer drawn down on him. That said- I understand your mentality.

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t looked at that group yet, but I&#39;m checking out The Family International, another group. A commentor said they have a facility in Flagstaff. <del>I can&#39;t substantiate that yet</del>, but holy cow they fit the bill. Look at all these pseudonyms and shell companies they operate:  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.exfamily.org/the-family/index-of-pseudonyms.htm">http://www.exfamily.org/the-family/index-of-pseudonyms.htm</a>  </p>

<p>Some people might remember then because the Phoenix brothers were all raised in the group. </p>

<p>Based on my own link, they run a project called &quot;Native American Outreach&quot; in Flagstaff, AZ, and a group called &quot;CVR Ministries&quot; in Glendale, AZ.  </p>

<p>&quot;Another major motivation for using pseudonyms appears to be related to bookkeeping. According to The Family International&#39;s own documents, the testimonies of ex-members and recent eye-witness accounts, The Family International uses a network of non-profit organizations to launder money (redistribute funds internally)—expenses are written off as gifts to each other—in order to benefit from subsidies and tax exemptions designed for bona fide charity work. The Family International&#39;s network of front organizations currently operates under the umbrella of the FCF (Family Care Foundation) which is clearly connected to The Family International.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have a lot of evidence you go to the FBI and the media simultaneously. This has happened many times. You choose a reputable investigative journalist who will take the time and energy to pursue your leads if the FBI doesn&#39;t take the lead. Believe me, if CD&amp;N had reliable information leading to the conclusions he&#39;s drawn, sooooo many good investigative journalists would jump on that story in a heartbeat. It would be a career maker, and it would have the potential to bring justice. Investigative journalists--at least some of them--tend not to fear reprisal either. They&#39;re a somewhat reckless bunch :)  </p>

After that the church turned his family against him, they paid for her divorce lawyer and all legal fees. After that was said and done the church relocated his family and set his wife up with single minister running one of their churches in  Indianapolis. Even to this day he won’t say why he left the church and it was 20 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Playing devil&#39;s advocate on a couple things here...</p>

<p>First of all, UMG and Geffen Records are not the same thing. Geffen Records is just owned by UMG, David Geffen has no ownership with UMG itself. Secondly, I can&#39;t find any evidence that UMG even owns Dream Records. They&#39;ve only done partnerships for certain artists. And no evidence that Geffen&#39;s labels were involved in those partnerships. </p>

<p>I find it kind of odd that CD&amp;N switches between a small-town church to a rehab center. Dream City Church doesn&#39;t operate a church in this town, there&#39;s just this off-shoot Dream Center. He mentions having pastors and everything. It doesn&#39;t seem to fit the description. There&#39;s the &quot;failed attempt&quot; New England one mentioned, but apparently there are Dream Centers all over the country. </p>

<p>If this is real, I don&#39;t think this is what&#39;s being referred to. I&#39;m not sure I believe in this, but I wanna research it anyway for curiousity&#39;s sake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your comments. I agree about the Geffen Records connection--I think that&#39;s weak.  </p>

<p>However, I do believe it&#39;s Dream City Church. The Dream Center operating in Colorado City / Hildale actually does have a pastor who does sermons. The connection is even stronger, I believe, given that the ex-wife of Warren Jeffs runs the place. That fits the blind because she was FLDS (and still lives in Colorado City, where pretty much everyone is FLDS), yet she&#39;s hooked up with Dream City, which is decidedly not Mormon. But it would make sense that FLDS would welcome a massive check from a super rich church like Dream City.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not at all convinced that the super nefarious stuff that CD&amp;N talks about is true. Or, at least, I haven&#39;t seen evidence enough to substantiate it. But I do believe that whether the actual events are true or in his imagination, the Church he&#39;s referring to is Dream City. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One scary implication of this is there may be entire towns that are run by organized crime and have been that way for generations.    One good thing is it’d be relatively easy to spot.    What’s being alleged here is basically another Jonestown within our borders.    If it’s true. it’ll show.</p>

<p>Pro tip - Look to the adult children that were raised in that community and have moved on.    They may have much to say about their hometown and family life.</p>

<p>We&#39;d get a lot further with these investigations if there was a dozen or so armed people going around, asking questions.  You don&#39;t honestly expect the police to do this, do you?  To investigate, you have to ask tough questions.  When you&#39;re asking questions about really disgusting people, odds are good that they will want to have you killed.  Rule #1 in this game should be to protect oneself.</p>

An even more badass investigative reporter could infiltrate the church, find some kid that can attest to abuse and make them go on record.
Hell, I&#39;d do it my damn self if someone was down to finance me.
But have a feeling that&#39;s a sure-fire way to end up suicided. Just sort of shocked at the amount of supporting info on this one...all the articles Schneider linked so, from main-stream sources no less, basically the citations to a ground-breaking scoop. All it would really take is one person to hit the ground and verify locally. We&#39;re all slipping and we don&#39;t really want to stop child abuse if nothing comes of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably not the Fellowship Church. After doing some digging, I find it hard to believe the founding couple would be capable of pulling it off. My gut tells me he broke away from the church bc he saw the horrific issue re trafficking, or maybe his wife introduced him to it since she&#39;s an expert in the field, and they decided to start their own church to help combat it. It&#39;s too small to be running such a high level scheme. </p>

<p>BUT... I think you&#39;re very close. I&#39;m still working on my research, and I&#39;ll probably share that sometime tomorrow if I get a chance, but from what I&#39;ve read, the best explanation is that it&#39;s the Short Creek Dream Center, which is located on the UT/AZ border in Colorado City, AZ/Hilside, UT. They call them twin cities bc they&#39;re only separated by the state lines but the entire area is referred to as Short Creek. Turns out, Short Creek Dream Center was founded by Warren Jeff&#39;s 65th wife and is meant to serve as a refuge for victims. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.phxdreamcenter.org/shortcreekmissions">I found a link on the Phoenix Dream Center about missionary trips to Short Creek, and on that page it says that the youth outnumber adults 100:1.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>For the past six years, The Church has methodically gone to these apartments and found boxes and boxes of cash. Literally rooms filled to the top with boxes of cash. That is a whole lot of money to move even with their connections. They then stumbled upon an idea that until recently has worked very well for them. They loaded cash in boxes belonging to a relief organization that has operations in every country of the world including the US. Those boxes are never checked. What a wonderful way to move the money all over the world. Recently, however, in a raid by a country that actually can&#39;t be bribed police found some of the boxes being readied for shipment. One could hope this would throw a spotlight on to the operation, but they just have so many friends in so many places, it is going to be tough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Have you wondered why every male celebrity over the past couple of years goes to a rehab facility in Arizona, but you never see any photos of the rehab facility or them in the rehab facility? Have you wondered why no female celebrity has ever gone to this facility?&quot;</p>

<p>Even with a cursory glance you can see this isn&#39;t true. </p>

<p>But then I&#39;m sure I&#39;m just a shill who&#39;s bought the propaganda.</p>
