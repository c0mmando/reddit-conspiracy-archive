<p>&quot;LEL 4CH? MORE LIKE POORCHAN YOU STUPID GULLIBLE ASS. LARP&quot;*</p>

<p>Then what follows is that the post ends up getting downvoted to oblivion and sits nicely in controversial. </p>

<p>I just have to roll my eyes every single time this happens. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying 4ch and similar boards are correct all the time, or even some of the time, but crossposting content can generate <em>valid</em> discussion even if the premise is shaky. Even if you think it&#39;s a larp. </p>

<p>Remember we are talking conspiracy <em>THEORY</em> here. </p>

<p>People should be able to throw out a theory for others to parse through, and if it gains traction on its own merit, so be it. </p>

<p>BUT what we&#39;re seeing instead are constant attempts to control the conversation by dismissing the premise because of a &quot;disreputable&quot; source. </p>

<p>Never mind the content, don&#39;t worry about playing devils advocate, and certainly forget about keeping an open mind. If you can&#39;t cite everything like a scientific paper from <em>reputable</em> sources, forget talking about it because you&#39;re living in lala land. </p>

<p>Lastly, what is actually <em>reputable</em> nowadays? </p>

<p>MSM? </p>

<p>The biggest larp of them all ;D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely correct. Now let&#39;s talk about why this happens. Some of the 4chan &quot;larpers&quot; are real insiders. 4chan is anonymous and you can&#39;t hide content with vote bots like reddit, so it&#39;s the perfect place for a leaker to go.</p>

<p>The shills don&#39;t want anyone to read the real insiders, so they attack everyone and convince a few of the gullible users because they can shout louder, and because some users automatically go with whatever they feel the 4chan consensus to be, instead of thinking critically.</p>

<p>I&#39;m quite confident that FBI Anon, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee4wk/updated_for_anyone_interested_in_high_level/?ref=search_posts">High Level Insider</a>, and Q are real insiders, and I am strongly inclined to believe Mega Anon is legitimate. There have also been several low level whistleblowers on groups like Shareblue that appeared to be very credible.</p>

<p>Are you able to elaborate on this? I understand you might not be able to and that&#39;s fine. Although these type of statements are what lead people like me to believe there is no credibility in these &quot;4chan insiders&#39;. Then I&#39;m ultimately considered a shill. </p>

<p>You would have to specify what posts you mean. There were many posts, and most likely also many people signing/posting/tripcoding as &quot;Q&quot;while unironically, the early 10/28 - 10/31 posters didn&#39;t even sign as Q. In other words, Q&#39;s &quot;identity&quot; might have been hijacked/coopted several times. Recently, Q group posted defcon1 which scared many people to death. Are you suggesting that POTUS sent defcon1 code via 8ch? Really?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in the original Q threads from 10/28 - 10/31. Those posts were eerie simply because there was no distraction or derailing posts. Once the tripcode Q came out and started signing their posts, the nonsense went into hyperdrive. I personally don&#39;t believe anything posted by Q past 10/31 is legit. For god sakes, they even switched Trip Codes saying they were &quot;compromised&quot;. I am moving on to focus on #fusioncollusion because this will be the greatest crime story of our time as it unfolds. </p>

<p>You realized that that Q isn&#39;t a LARP but is a group of establishment characters including the president who is playing ball under the establishment&#39;s hand. That gives you confidence? You may as well give up on HLI if that&#39;s the case then dude.</p>

<p>Generating wealth far outdoes &quot;draining the swamp&quot; (which is a con) as the benefits will allow an outright culling rather than the supposed &quot;gutting&quot; the regime is blue pilling you with. Three said: &quot;As everyone knows [...], the government is not on our side. For the same reason that they intentionally destroy the middle class in Europe and America, they do not want projects which open up immense new wealth to be completed.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;With an orbital ring space elevator, global wealth goes up by hundreds of trillions of dollars almost overnight. Near earth asteroids are economical to retrieve, with trillions of dollars of minerals in each one. Each solar panel you place into GEO (simplified way of putting it) pays for itself in about one year, producing income stream afterwards for 20-30 more years. Rather than 2-3% economic growth, we will be looking at 20-30% annual GDP growth and boundless optimism around the world. This is why you, and the evil governments you parrot, hate this idea.&quot;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re still entranced by a golden toilet that the regime is allowing Trump to show when you&#39;ve been redpilled on what can actually be done, then you&#39;re insane. I suggest you give up on HLI if you follow such backward blue pill beta thinking. </p>

<p>Right about what? That Trump is somehow playing 5D chess on TPTB? Is that what MegaRamble is preaching about? TheCIASellsDrugs and you, TW, seem to be salivating for scraps from TPTB. What TheCIASellsDrugs just said:</p>

<p>&quot;But even 2-3% growth, mass pedophile arrests, exposure of Hollywood corruption and tax reform are things to celebrate.&quot; </p>

<p>How can you reach any other conclusion from the available evidence? You know the Clinton Foundation is under investigation, Saudi Arabia has been purged as HLI recommended, Dona Brazile wrote a book dedicated to Seth Rich and hasn&#39;t committed suicide yet, and <em>the President of the United States of America is posting on 4chan.</em> Happenings are definitely happening.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>This is where I disagree. I would be ecstatic (although not satisfied) with a limited hangout that even makes a dent in the systemic rape of children by the oligarchy.</p>

<p>You may want to look at my post history, because I&#39;ve made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7i0eet/lets_talk_about_suppressed_technology/?st=jchyuayg&amp;amp;sh=ca75c8ba">posts</a> about these technologies, and am not going to be satisfied with any less. But even 2-3% growth, mass pedophile arrests, exposure of Hollywood corruption and tax reform are things to celebrate.</p>
