    <div class="md"><p>My personal interpretation is that death is blind to your wealth or social status. I don’t believe in Judgement day and it’s counter-productive to what Jesus taught in the New Testament. Are you truly a good person if you live a virtuous life based off of fear instead of genuine kindness? And do you truly have free will or is big brother forcing you to play nice? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God (to me) is the first uncaused cause, the unexplainable spark that created something from nothing, the intelligence that designed our expansive universe which is houses existence and an answer to the question that we can’t comprehend- why are we here? 
Even if the Christian perception of God truly is our creator,  we could never hope to understand the will of an undefinable power that can create life from nothing. So I say fuck the rapture and hellfire bullshit. 
Also, Jesus was a chill ass dude, why would he die for our sins only to come back later to punish us? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This passage refers to the return of Christ to rapture or catch away His followers. The statement as a thief in a night means that His return will be sudden and unexpected, just as when a thief commits their actions without warning in the dark of night. Of this time, the Bible says, &quot;But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven,[a] but My Father only,&quot; (Matthew 24:36, New King James Version). The rapture is believed to coincide with the end of days. Though Christ&#39;s followers expect His return, they themselves do not know precisely when it will occur. </p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The next verse in I Thessalonians (5:3) says &quot; For when they say &#39;Peace and safety!&#39; then sudden destruction comes upon them ..... and they shall not escape.&quot;
I take that it means that the Day of the Lord will be as a thief in the night for the unbelievers, who will suffer destruction.  For God did not appoint us to wrath (believers will be raptured and not suffer the destruction)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re right and yet you’re wrong. Rapture is from Latin and we both know the Bible wasn’t written in Latin.  But Harpotzo (Greek) IS in the Bible and is used 7 times. Means the same thing, to be snatched up, taken away, almost violently. It’s used when describing the taking of the believers, the bride.  </p>

<p>Does anyone know what this means?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a general sense, yes. It means that Jesus will return to set things right at a time that surprises everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will Jesus literally come and take all the Valuables from the Elite and rule them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Revelation 18 describes the weeping of the usurers when the economic and political system of Mystery Babylon falls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will he come like a thief because they essentially have no choice but to hand over the planet to him by force</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Revelation 19 says they will gather to attack him without any provocation, and he will kill the wicked kings of the earth in a giant, righteous blood bath.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief. For you are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness. So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ</p>
