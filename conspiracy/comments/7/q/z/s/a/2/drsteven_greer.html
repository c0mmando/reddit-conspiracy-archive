<p>It is a simple fact: he exaggerates about his important contacts, he is a name dropper which makes him look important and satisfies his narcissist need for attention, but there is nothing behind the curtain. He&#39;s pretty slick, I&#39;ll give him that, but the longer I watched his videos the more I could see that he&#39;s just really good at lying: in reality he has nothing but some grainy video, and the ability to talk on and on and on and on</p>

<p>I liked both the movies he had, what&#39;s so bad about him? Seems to just call out a lot of the shit the CIA and FBI has done and is trying to get people to connect with aliens through peaceful meditation. Doesn&#39;t seem so bad to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol and notice how all of those opinions are upvoted. Greer for me is what (re)opened me up to the idea of aliens being here. I don&#39;t believe his &quot;all aliens are good&quot; crap but he was the guy that got me started on that rabbit hole in recent years. I&#39;m pretty sure the agents and/or bots in this sub will upvote anything that has a negative tone, it seems to be their modus operandi with conspiracy fora. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just said DeLonge did MORE than Greer ever did (and probably will). Greer is too esoteric and blissed out, also all his claims never came to fruition.</p>

<p>The next piece is fact mixed with my opinion.</p>

<p>It was his “to the stars academy“ that made the DoD reveal their UFO Program in December 2017 as well as the 2 Military UFO Videos with modern equipment. They also said more is to come.</p>

<p>And the biggest one : They produced anti gravity in their lab and are now expanding this research to demonstrate to the public as well as give other researchers the mans to do so.</p>

<p>He said (obv. Not a direct quote) “What do you get when you zap layered bismuth and magnesium with terahertz Frequencys“</p>

<p>Thats their Experiment to produce an anti gravity effect.</p>

<p>The DoD also admitted to have recovered alloys from an unknown object which are made up of bismuth and magnesium. (Thats where the to the stars science staff got the idea from in the first place).</p>

<p>TomDelonge is sanctioned disclosure. Whereas Greer only talked for ages to keep us shut and hopeful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an entire documentary about the situation called Mirage Men where it details the US Government&#39;s involvement in controlling the UFO narrative by feeding false information to select researchers. I would bet money that this exact scenario is playing out again with DeLonge. What&#39;s more likely, that some stoned out guitarist for Blink 182 stumbled upon secrets and &quot;knows things that most people don&#39;t know&quot; so the government invited him in and just started sharing info because he has a larger audience and is a better spokesman? OR that the government saw an easily influenced sucker who would run out and do whatever was asked of him because he thought he was involved in something grand and not just touring playing guitar in a B Level band that fluttered out 20 years ago...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have bad vibes from him. I have listened to many of he talks and he clearly is arrogant with a quick temper. He says things like the, &quot;internet is a garbage dump&quot;, which seems weird for a person wanted the truth out to the public.</p>

<p>He clearly has a disdain for other people and says all abductions are people who want attention/hoaxs or the government did all of them.</p>

<p>He says that there are many types of E.T.s (he hates the term alien) and says they&#39;re all good and anyone who says otherwise is fear mongering. I think anyone who says sweeping things like this has some kind of manipulative agenda.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust him. </p>

<p>He said shit about &quot;greys&quot; and how they&#39;re manufactured and made on this planet as well.  Just a slew of sensational stuff that could not ever be confirmed or proven in any way.</p>

<p>The guy has a racket going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seances and meditation with candles and crystals that you charged a fee for people to attend are entirely different than ritualistic occultism.  Crowley allegedly made contact, assuming you believe it.  Parsons allegedly created the Humonculous and red mercury in his garage too, assuming you believe it.</p>

<p>What really happened and what was alleged to happen can differ wildly.</p>

<p>He was supposed to be bringing these allegedly suppressed technologies to light or to market.  When that failed he started writing and selling books and field trips about how you can meditate and have a direct experience with ET.</p>
