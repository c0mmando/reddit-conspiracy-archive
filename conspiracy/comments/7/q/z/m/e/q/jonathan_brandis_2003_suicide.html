        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Does anyone remember Jonathan Brandis? I do. He was a child actor in the 1990&#39;s. He was featured in movies like Ladybugs, Neverending Story 2, Sidekicks, the original IT and more. Tragically he committed suicide in 2003. When I first heard about it at the time it was written off as &quot;A former child actor who could not get work, became depressed and took his life.&quot; Though now with all this talk of ritual pedophilia in the Entertainment Industry I reconsider things.
Maybe he was a victim of molestation and the trauma lead him to suicide as an adult. Or maybe he threatened to go to the authorities with certain information about abusers in Hollywood and he was murdered and the suicide was a cover up. It&#39;s just something I have been thinking about after I saw An Open Secret.</p>

<p>Any thoughts? Please feel free to share I am interested in what people might think. </p>

Movie too. He had all the trademarks of what the pedos prey on. Away from family, very very good looking, thrilled to be the centre of attention etc. Reminds me of where Mack Culkin could have gone.</p>

<p>Dominic Brascia same guy who has been accused of raping corey haim when he was younger by corey haim&#39;s mother. The same brascia claims that he was good friend&#39;s with Jonathan Brandis during IT. Which Brandis was only 14/15 during filming  IT and Brascia was around 34. What&#39;s a 34 year old man doing hanging out with a 14/15 year old boy?!</p>
