<p>I&#39;d say that&#39;s a problem with almost everybody these days, but not nearly as bad as the disappearance of the word &quot;too.&quot; Nobody says too anymore. Smart people  using big words mispell &quot;too.&quot; It&#39;s annoying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a quick dictionary:  </p>

<p>Perihelion = point of closest approach to the Sun for a body in an elliptical orbit about the Sun. This is the point where the maximum amount of potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy and the point of maximum velocity. The orbiting body spends the least amount of time near perihelion.  </p>

<p>Aphelion = similar to perihelion, but the opposite. The orbiting body is now the farthest it will be from the Sun and the velocity is minimized. The orbiting body spends quite a long time near aphelion.  </p>

<p>Kuiper belt = a belt of leftover proto-planetary material and ice sort of like the asteroid belt but larger and more irregular in shape. Pluto is the largest of these objects.  </p>

<p>Oort cloud = a nebulous cloud of icy bodies so far from the Sun that they are only loosely gravitationally bound to our solar system. This is essentially a spherically symmetric cloud consisting of trillions of potential comets and trillions of tons of smaller debris. It is widely believed that the interface between solar systems throughout the galaxies looks much like the Oort cloud. This is where long-period comets come from. They are essentially drifting about in a gravitational balance between the Sun and the next nearest neighboring star. When they are disturbed, they can fall one way or the other and drop directly towards the Sun or neighboring star, passing closely, and returning out to the distant solar system, sometimes making multiple orbits on highly elliptical paths until they eventually collide with a rocky body or are vaporized by their repeated close passes of the intense heat given off by stars.</p>

The SDI shields may well have defence mechanisms - including public warning overriders - that can be triggered by meteor or other high impact natural occurrences.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is exactly what I mean. It&#39;s entirely possible that the Nemesis theory is true, except rather than a sibling star, it is a planet that was nearly ejected early in the history of the solar system disturbing the Oort cloud.  </p>

<p>It would be quite a big moment in human history to learn that this thing has been out there for all of human history hurtling comets at us once every dozen or so millennia.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only explanation I can think of is that these would have to be cometary debris falling in fresh from the Oort cloud rather than typical asteroids. These would be very fast, dark, and previously uncatalogued objects.  </p>

<p>However, if this is really happening, the gap between the government knowing about it and the rest of the astronomical community knowing about it would be quite short, so we would expect a very short timetable before this story gets hot.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that we know that cometary activity is about to pick up, but it&#39;s impossible to know the details until a few days or weeks out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not about the size of the screen.</p>

<p>TV is broadcast: the same thing is viewed by everyone at the same time - there is typically very little choice. The consumer of TV, although he may change channels - is typically passive. He just sits, and checks “what’s on TV”. His own decision process is greatly minimized (he largely delegates the decison).</p>

<p>Torrent on the other hand is proactive and voluntary. I <em>decide</em> to give something a try, I <em>act unilaterally</em> in downloading it. I have not delegated my mind. I remain a conscious human being.</p>

<p>Note I had not addressed the trivial argument of commercials and otherwise <em>paying</em> for content. Why this is nefarious should be self-evident.</p>

<p>No, that showed up not detected because it&#39;s less than 140m wide, which is what NASA considers a minimum for actual damage. I&#39;m not saying they can see literally everything and nothing will surprise them, but this was literally undetected because science deemed it &quot;not worth the time&quot; to track.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The naked and afraid show has a bit less to work with.  I grew up in the country.  I also know where to get access to an M16 Assault Rifle that&#39;s less than a mile away that only the owner would know about and he&#39;d be with me.  I know how to farm.  I know how to butcher an animal.  I know how to hunt.  Life might be harder without gas and electric though we&#39;ve got solar panels so that would give limited electric for us.  I&#39;d probably put survival to feel similar to the show Revolution.  I guess my house is on city water.  I grew up on tap water where no power wouldn&#39;t mean no water for us.  I&#39;m not saying I&#39;d for sure survive if things went bad but I do give myself better odds than the average person.</p>

<p>A person can entertain an idea, think an idea and even speak it without it being a belief despite what you may believe. And it&#39;s not the subreddit I complain about.</p>

<p>I complain about people like you. The content I have no issue with, it&#39;s clearly you that has an issue with the content.</p>

<p>A discussion does not require black and white &#39;sides&#39;, it&#39;s not even a debate or argument, it&#39;s a fucking theory and does not need to appease your world view for it to be discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, conspiracies very often starts by people speaking out. It doesn&#39;t matter if the source is credible or not. The point is if it interests you you can dig more and find your own links or ways to disprove. If it doesn&#39;t, fuck off somewhere else. This is a CONSPIRACY sub, it&#39;s not supposed to be well sourced, that&#39;s our part. you can go to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> if you want pre-chewed, government approved &quot;well sourced facts&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;For matters of national security we are unable to reveal the technology involved at this time.&quot;</p>

<p>Nobody would accept that. It might literally catalyze a revolution.</p>

<p>The average guy can buy the &#39;mistake&#39; story because it doesn&#39;t threaten his world view. In fact, it confirms the worldview he had before, which is &quot;The government is a bunch of wasteful incompetent boobs-- $700 hammers and whatnot.&quot;. Average guy can go back to work, safe in his worldview. </p>

<p>So with &quot;There were multiple meteor&#39;s inbound that were detected and destoryed. For matters of national security we are unable to reveal the technology involved at this time&quot;, there is now a lot to unpack:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why didn&#39;t NASA publicly disclose that there were killer meteors inbound? </li>
<li>Are there more killer meteors inbound?</li>
<li>What is the nature of this secret meteor killer tech?</li>
<li>Does it change the game in terms of current day technology?</li>
<li>How do we have secret killer meteor detection and shooting down tech but also still have homelessness and starving children? Why doesn&#39;t the government spend some of the secret tech money on solving starving children?</li>
<li>By the way, how much did the secret tech cost?</li>
<li>Which Congressmen authorized the spending?</li>
<li>What exactly is the nature of the threat to national security?</li>
<li>Do other countries possess this seemingly omnipotent technology?</li>
<li>Does Russia have this too?</li>
<li>Seriously, is Russia going to shoot us with the meteor shooting technology?</li>
<li>OMG guys, Russia is TOTALLY going to shoot us with crazy meteor beams! </li>
<li>AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!1one!eleven!!!1</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you haven&#39;t paid attention over the last few years. The answer to every single one of those questions would be &quot;That is a matter of national security.&quot; </p>

<p>For the record I totally think something happened and these weren&#39;t &quot;false alarms&quot; I just don’t  think there is some crazy international cover-up going on to bury the fact that the government saved the world from a meteor attack. If anything, a government that is looked at as corrupt on a world view would be chomping at the bit to tell the rest of the world we stopped a mass event from happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well point is, saying it was a mistake gives nobody anything to latch onto, whereas saying “we dealt with a threat with undisclosed tech” gives a huge entry point for inquisitive minds. </p>

<p>I agree there’s probably no international coverup going on. If anything it’s probably some sort of screwed up psyop on Kim Jong un. </p>

<p>The other thing that has occurred to me re mistake vs. shot-down missile... if it was a shot down missile, wouldn’t Kim Jong un simply launch another? I doubt he had only one....</p>

<p>Most sensible explanation for Hawaii is that a foreign country (most likely China) hacked into the alert system (probably easy) and set it off to probe the US’s actual missile detection/defense systems (probably because they <em>cant</em> acessthem now but watching them come online would help locate and attempt to).  US doesn’t release this info because don’t know exactly what is being done and is trying not to tip off what we do/don’t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. That&#39;s certainly a theory about this I hadn&#39;t seen before.</p>

<p>How far away are they? Days, weeks, months, years?</p>

<p>If we want to spot these meteors, in which direction/towards what coordinates should we point our telescopes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering whether this guy posted before or after the second meteor, so I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g4at9LtEyk">this video</a> of some guy&#39;s timestamped home security footage. It says the meteor lit up the sky Jan. 17th at 5:22 PM in Fort McMurray which has a timezone GMT/UTC - 07:00 hour. According to reddit, OP posted at 06:56 Jan. 17th UTC which would be... 18 hours before the second meteor.</p>

<p>Ok. OP posted before the second meteor came down. That&#39;s indeed very interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a quick dictionary:  </p>

<p>Perihelion = point of closest approach to the Sun for a body in an elliptical orbit about the Sun. This is the point where the maximum amount of potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy and the point of maximum velocity. The orbiting body spends the least amount of time near perihelion.  </p>

<p>Aphelion = similar to perihelion, but the opposite. The orbiting body is now the farthest it will be from the Sun and the velocity is minimized. The orbiting body spends quite a long time near aphelion.  </p>

<p>Kuiper belt = a belt of leftover proto-planetary material and ice sort of like the asteroid belt but larger and more irregular in shape. Pluto is the largest of these objects.  </p>

<p>Oort cloud = a nebulous cloud of icy bodies so far from the Sun that they are only loosely gravitationally bound to our solar system. This is essentially a spherically symmetric cloud consisting of trillions of potential comets and trillions of tons of smaller debris. It is widely believed that the interface between solar systems throughout the galaxies looks much like the Oort cloud. This is where long-period comets come from. They are essentially drifting about in a gravitational balance between the Sun and the next nearest neighboring star. When they are disturbed, they can fall one way or the other and drop directly towards the Sun or neighboring star, passing closely, and returning out to the distant solar system, sometimes making multiple orbits on highly elliptical paths until they eventually collide with a rocky body or are vaporized by their repeated close passes of the intense heat given off by stars.</p>
