       I'm going to view the following government activities as a good thing to protect us.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if, a very big if, there was an asteroid or huge chunk of space rock flying our way and the governments of the world had to launch missiles into space to destroy it before it hit Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       We send up a missle (the mysterious spacex launch) which smashes the asteroid into loads of smaller fragments. Some of the fragments come towards Earth and one of them is larger than it should be. They send up another Spacex missile (the failed launch) but decide to kill it just after take-off because they can't risk the missile doing damage to the atmosphere/Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       They ride out the storm of the larger fragments which causes chunks to splash down in the pacific ocean (Hawaii alert) and the next day/two days another large fragments splashes down in the sea of Japan (the japanese warning).
      </p>
      <p>
       As the smaller fragments come to Earth, some are bound to land near populated areas (Michigan) but are too small to cause any damage. The meteor (due to potential risk to the population and an estimated death toll of approx. 350 million people) is kept hush-hush which is why the early warning detectors took so long to identify the Michigan event as a meteor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the other month we apparently had a cigar shaped asteroid 'come out of nowhere' which caught us off guard. What if it's big brother wasn't too far behind...

       Interesting theory. See the recent TV series “Salvation”, it is pretty much that same exact scenario (don’t want to spoil it for you, but there are interesting twists). It also deals with EM drives (which was long supposed to exist but be classified technology), and is full of esoteric symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
       I killed my TV more than 10 years ago, but I occasionally watch such series (à la Black Mirror) because they tend to be good, and also to try and reverse engineer the propaganda / mind control / predictive programming. Always torrent.

       The Taurid and Gemenid meteor streams are what you're thinking of. Try watching Randall Carlson's YouTube lectures to get more info on the cosmic side of things, it's unbelievable how much modern archaeology has missed.

       Imma guess he means how the Earth's crust or landmasses were formed.  Maybe not by eons of plate tectonics.  Maybe by burst of electrical energy arcing between celestial bodies.  Like... the Grand Canyon isn't erosion, it's the blasted out scar of a huge lightning bolt/storm.
      </p>
      <p>
       These same lightning storms blasted out Mars, throwing masses of rock into space... creating modern-day meteors, etc.

       we understand water erosion pretty well and i literally have never heard any alternative theories to geologic processes. so i hope that’s not what he was referring to but thanks for explaining.

       I'll watch the Randall Carlson lectures today.  It may be a variant on Electric Universe (which is the term for the alternative theories to geologic processes you've not heard of)(YouTube channel Thunderbolts Project, primer is Symbols of an Alien Sky).
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on OP adding the asteroid fields, I'm guessing Carlson will go into planetary impact or how the planets have moved/crashed/torn each other up in past times.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do know water erosion really well.  This is why we know some formations on planets, like Valles Marinarias (sp?) on Mars, was not caused by water erosion.  There had to be a different power at work.  Same with Olympus Mons.

       The thing is, scientists are always saying we're long overdue for something.  We're long overdue for the super volcano in Yellowstone to erupt, we're long overdue for a massive earthquake in California, we're long overdue for a CMP according to the cycle, and on and on. I don't discount anyone's theories, but, we are a planet that is hurling through space with millions of space debris hurling around us...it just seems like a crap shoot in the end.

       I wonder if that cigar shaped asteroid shot down the first space x missle and the N. Korean missiles because they were weaponized against it?  Maybe space x got the message and loaded up the last one with only observation equipment and as such made a successful take-off? I don't know enough about any of it to really open my mouth, but I did anyway cause it's pretty interesting stuff.

       Good catch. this is the pivot to asteroids as existential threat since NK is probably about to climax. it'll come out that, yeah, these asteroids are setting off missile alerts and well, I can only imagine will end with someone 'retaliating' and having a nice fireworks show to get the attention of the herd. all part of the script.

       What's the theory on why they don't just come out and tell people that it's space debris? They just want to avoid panic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like a better way to avoid panic would be to turn off all the early detection systems or just have them on but not actually doing anything.

        Seems like a better way to avoid panic would be to turn off all the early detection systems or just have them on but not actually doing anything.

       One theory is it's all part of the grand plan to bring the world together. We will only unite against a threat that is not human. Remember what Wernher Von Braun said was going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       1st threat will be Russia.
2nd threat will be terrorism.
3rd threat will be asteroids.
4th threat will be Aliens.

       The meteors may have caused the initial warnings. I just doubt that we would have shit shot at them without amateur hams picking up the radio noise. 
Would be interesting to see if we had any squelched comms to verify such an instance.
      </p>

       Kinda hard to fathom that every dedicated amateur and professional astronomer would have missed such an instance?

       I was part of the amateur astronomer scene for a few years and it is a super big scene. From small telescopes to full on home observatory. It would be pretty hard to hide what's going on up there with the amount of people watching.

       The stars are spiritual entities. When Satan's angels are cast down the constellations will not remain. Nibiru is a psyop to make us believe when this happens that it's a massive meteor shower event and to present the fallen angels as aliens.

       3 And there was seen another sign in the heaven, and, lo, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems,
      </p>
      <p>
       4 and his tail doth draw the third of the stars of the heaven, and he did cast them to the earth; and the dragon did stand before the woman who is about to bring forth, that when she may bring forth, her child he may devour;
      </p>
      <p>
       5 and she brought forth a male child, who is about to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, and caught away was her child unto God and His throne,
      </p>
      <p>
       6 and the woman did flee to the wilderness, where she hath a place made ready from God, that there they may nourish her -- days a thousand, two hundred, sixty.
      </p>
      <p>
       7 And there came war in the heaven; Michael and his messengers did war against the dragon, and the dragon did war, and his messengers,
      </p>
      <p>
       8 and they did not prevail, nor was their place found any more in the heaven;
      </p>
      <p>
       9 and the great dragon was cast forth -- the old serpent, who is called
       <code>
        Devil,' and
       </code>
       the Adversary,' who is leading astray the whole world -- he was cast forth to the earth, and his messengers were cast forth with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 And I heard a great voice saying in the heaven, `Now did come the salvation, and the power, and the reign, of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because cast down was the accuser of our brethren, who is accusing them before our God day and night;
      </p>
      <p>
       11 and they did overcome him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life -- unto death;
      </p>
      <p>
       12 because of this be glad, ye heavens, and those in them who do tabernacle; wo to those inhabiting the land and the sea, because the Devil did go down unto you, having great wrath, having known that he hath little time.'

       Doesn't make sense everything leads up to a fantasy story that we know the ending to. I'm sure we could easily differentiate between angels and aliens and they could show us or communicate us so we don't accidentally kill our saviours. How do you know what we know as angels aren't metaphorically aliens and our god also as we are to technology which we are as fast as possible trying to make better than us in every way with all our senses, capacity to learn and in the not to far future 50-70years whatever we know as consciousness. Maybe our biology is their technology, DNA, genes etc are amazingly perfect just like the first conscious robot would seem.

       Actually I can because I've studied that before and I'm an avid photographer, and I've filmed stars before. I've personally seen video of it happening, many of them actually.

       It's caused by Earth's atmosphere and happens when amateur cameras with small (comparable) sensors are zoomed way in (or put in a telescope and zoomed in).
      </p>
      <p>
       Gas clouds in the way and the Earth's own atmosphere cause them to waver and flicker on the camera sensors, especially when zoomed far in and when ISO is used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Launch a sophisticated camera outside of our atmosphere with the best lenses and sensors money can buy and they do not do this.

       I like your theory, and as soon as I read the title I was like "Hey, yeah! That's a good explanation!" but after thinking about it a bit, I have a couple questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious as to what you're calling the "failed" SpaceX launch. The Zuma launch on Jan 18 2018, which I assume you are calling the "mysterious" launch, was livestreamed from (basically) start to finish. It could be a missile, especially since we don't know who, don't know why, and whatever was on it made allegedly a full single orbit before vanishing. This can't be a failure that was killed shortly after takeoff, because you see stage sep and successful booster landing happen on video. I was personally watching this live, as space travel is fascinating to me and it would be hard to fake a live broadcast to happen on schedule with the supposed "real" thing, while somehow Florida misses a rocket flying off later since they're not exactly inconspicuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "failed" launch, which I'm assuming you mean the Jan 16th event, was never a planned launch and would have been too late anyway. It was a test of the engines that was never planned to leave Earth that was canceled. The real launch is later this month. Plus, if the earth were in grave danger would they use an unproven rocket that could easily fail (which even Elon himself has said is a good possibility) or a Delta IV that has similar capacity and is proven to work?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those have been the only two "launches" from SpaceX this year, so it leaves a hole in that aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, pieces of asteroids big enough and close enough to trigger a missile alert to Hawaii should at the very least create a noticeable tsunami effect which people would definitely notice. Plus, if the gov't knew about it and were tracking it, you'd think a gov't agency (HIEMA) would have a heads up not to hit the button.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, and the biggest hole for me, why was this a US event? There are governments that hate us, that would have loved to broadcast this to spread chaos. The asteroid that is believed to have caused the K-Pg event (Dinosaurs) is estimated to have been ~11km wide, which is smaller than most large American metropolitan areas, so it doesn't take much to cause a big deal that would get a worldwide response. NASA tracks objects starting at 140m across as part of their
       <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/faq">
        Planetary Defense System
       </a>
       because anything smaller than that likely would only cause regional effects and isn't worth knowing about in advance. The largest estimated threat to humanity is an object approx 1.61km wide, so that's a pretty small window from "nothing" to "kills us all".
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were big enough the USA was going to spend potentially $200MM to avoid it (Falcon 9 est. $57MM to LEO and Falcon Heavy est $70-135MM with most recent available data) then it would have to be a pretty big deal and aimed directly at the US. But it also can't be too much of a big deal, or the whole world is going to know. Beyond that, it's not just the USA that's watching the skies. Turns out people don't like to die, and really rich people especially don't like to die. The US has NASA, there's the ESA in Europe, both China and Japan have them and there are around 53 other countries that have not only a national space agency, but also active satellites. Among them are Russia, China, N. Korea, and Iran. 8 of them have launch capability, of which the previous 4 are included and not particularly happy with the US, meaning there isn't another country involved in the launch of their satellites that could potentially spy before the launch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given those points, I feel like it's not likely this was a massive gov't conspiracy. There are just too many variables for that. to be a plausible scenario. The tide in Hawaii alone would fully kill this theory. Even a casual observer on the beach would notice.

       There have been alot of countries randomly launching rockets the last few months. NK, China, probably more. They could be launching these asteroid hunters months in advance of impact to try to stop it.

       Again, back to my biggest point, why? If it's an earth-killer, why are they hiding it? Humans in their back yard can see at least vague details of celestial bodies millions of miles away. Surely they could find a mile wide body close enough to impact us, three days before it hit? This was a gag on The Simpsons over a decade ago. You can't really believe something well known enough to be a joke on mass media a decade ago hasn't been improved in that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to my other point, if they did see it and know about it months in advance, as your comment suggests, why would they use an unproven Falcon Heavy or an unreliable Falcon 9 to deliver either of these payloads? They would have used a Delta IV Heavy, because their literal lives depend on it and they can't risk failure. I'm a SpaceX/Tesla/Musk fanboy, and even I would have said "No fuck that use ULA" if presented with those options.

       basically, i like see pieces of different puzzles that don't fit those puzzles then i try and think of what the puzzle would look have to look like to fit the different pieces into one puzzle.

       There wasn't scientific thought or analysis of this theory, i was just throwing it out there. Crowdsourcing.

       That might explain the "meteor" in Michigan if something was used to vaporize it before impact. I watched the dash cam vid of it and it DOES NOT appear to be a rock just burning up. If you go frame by frame, you can see it goes from an asymmetrical fireball in one to a perfectly symmetrical ball of light that doubles in size in the next. If you pause it you could mistake it for the sun during the day. Next frame it's no lower in the sky and holds its position but is now a small faint light. Appears to me that some type of technology was used.

       This is completely possible, and I'm glad there's people in the world that can still use their critical thinking skills..This kind of logical explanation for the crazy events we've been witnessing the past several months is something we should be discussing more..   On a more serious note, I wonder if they will get John McClane and Batfleck to do a blockbuster smash hit movie about this situation?

       Wow I didn't know Syria got that many! It must have been Russian supplied, I'd be impressed if it was part of the Syrian airbase. Either way thanks for the citation.

       Russia/Syria didn't get that many at all. More than 44 out of 59 hit targets at the air base (some hitting the same target twice) and a few more hit close to the air base. This was verified via independent satellite photo analysis.
