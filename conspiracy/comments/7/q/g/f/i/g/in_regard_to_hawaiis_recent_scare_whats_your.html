<p>Prevent what?</p>

<p>Nuclear bombs are comically fake. Go back and look at some of the archive footage of &#39;nuclear tests&#39;. go back and look at footage of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and <strong>think</strong> for yourself.</p>

<p>Why would they lie about nukes? Because it makes everybody dependent on big brother to save them from Eastasia and/or Eurasia (whoever we are &#39;at war with&#39; today). nothing smaller than a national defence force could possibly save you from a nuke attack.</p>

<p>So far as far as I can tell he has esposed:</p>

<ul>
<li>flat earth theories, doesn&#39;t believe dinosaurs exist</li>
<li>does not believe missile most can fly, based on another John Le Bon video that misapplies (or actually just gets it wrong) basic Newtonian physics, flight controls, and principles of flight</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Nuclear power plants and nuclear bombs work under a similar principle. </p>

<p>In splitting an atom energy is released. These large molecular weight atoms were made under high energy conditions and found a local minima where they hold energy. Add enough energy to overcome this local stable state, and as the atom emits particles it releases the energy. </p>

<p>In a dense enriched substrate like a nuclear core of a reactor or the core of a warhead, the atoms and particles shooting off hit other particles, causing them to break apart and release energy. This energy radiates as heat and other radiation. </p>

<p>In a reactor this reaction is controlled, the core is shielded from the radiation and heat from the reaction heats steam to drive large turbines that either generate electrical power or on a carrier drive steam catapults to launch planes.</p>

<p>This reaction is controlled with materials that absorb the high energy particles so you don&#39;t get a runaway chain reaction. If that happens you get a fision bomb.</p>

<p>Now in a bomb, energy is directed at a compact radioactive core causing the particles to bounce around triggering other atoms to break apart, there is no dampner or shield. You get an uncontrolled nuclear reaction that emits heat, radiation and goes until the fuel is used up and dissipated so the reaction runs out of continued atoms to break apart. </p>

<p>In a fusion bomb, and fission explosion creates so much energy in a small space that it recreates the conditions under which hydrogen can fuse to become helium, which is a lower energy state that just hydrogen releasing huge amounts of heat and energy. These bombs are less radioactive than fission bombs and leave less fallout but have much higher output of heat. Their radioactive and fallout potential is largely defined by the size of the fission part of the bomb, which can be quite sizable to further augment yield. </p>

<p>The tzara bomb was only at half at is potential (despite blowing a piece of our atmosphere in space, wiping out an island, and causing continent wide weather disturbances) because they only loaded a small part of its fission core, limiting the size of the explosion and the nuclear fall out.</p>

<p>Now there are all sorts of nuclear warhead designs including boosted fission designs that are between a hydrogen bomb and a fission bomb. </p>

<p>Some types of civilian reactors, including reactors that run on spent fuel from other reactors create byproduct materials that because of the differences between bombs and power plants are suitable for bombs, hence the proliferation concerns. </p>

<p>We have not been able to create a fusion power plan because we have trouble controlling the immense heat created in such a reaction and as such even brief sustained fusion in modern fusion reactors draws more energy than it puts out. </p>

<p>All this can get much more complicated. There are different designs to rectors, heavy water, light water, control rods etc to make different reactors using different fuels with different safety profiles and risks. </p>

<p>Different bomb designs with vary levels of yield, compactness, and fall out...</p>

<p>A nuclear free world would be comforting and scary in many way but unfortunately that particular genie left the bottle long ago. </p>

<p>After getting torn apart on youtube for not understanding the concepts John le Bonn was discussing, and John Le Bonn posted another video, which pretends to appreciate the controversy, goes to admit he wrong, and then... concludes he should just post behind a paywall to his website...</p>

<p>The problem is some concepts are too complex to reduce to simple ideas and some concepts are abstract enough that the proof lies in complex math and experimentation that is hard to distill to simple visual proof and representation to a simple and visible &quot;proof&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, what does he believe? </p>

<p>In that whole post he never explains what he believes, but cites s round table he had that’s not accessible. He has a free video where jokingly proves the earth isn’t flat because mountains.</p>

<p>So if you are John le bon or a rabid follower, can you explain what he does believe with regard to earth’s shape, rotation and orbit because he clearly keeps hinting that the earth is not a spinning ball orbiting g the sun... so then what is it? </p>

<p>Like most John le bonn things not behind paywalls it’s just paragraph after paragraph of nothing but patronizing condescension about both flat earth era and heliocentrist....with promises of explanation if you are a member and watch all his videos.</p>

<p>The only video with substance, the anti missle theory do fails to understand basic physics that one can only wonder what other basic topics he cannot fathom, and his response video is just trolling ehining and condescension about how he hit ripped a new one in the comments and that’s why he should keep to his safe space behind s paywall.</p>

<p>So go ahead, if he is not a flat earther, and doesn’t believe the earth is round and orbits the sun ehike rotating on its axis, then what dies he believe?</p>

<p>Most other states have something that&#39;s a viable nuclear target in multiple areas. Misery has fort Leonard Wood. Other mid West states have our nuke silos. </p>

<p>Im personally going to this building with a huge nuclear fallout shelter. I have talked to the owner of the company in the building and he said they&#39;re actually stocked with enough food for my family and they&#39;re about a 5 minute walk from me. </p>

<p>Then honestly I&#39;ll probably make my way to some wilderness and start a community and regrow the American populace. Here&#39;s to hoping some hot women survive</p>

<p>I have some really good maps I snagged while I was in the army of a bunch of different areas in the us that are wilderness specifically so I could find my way in the woods. Still have my old army compass too. Plus a neat laminated binder with instructions on how to butcher livestock (for hunting deer elk moose etc), it also has instructions on how to make clothes. And a bunch of other stuff. A pistol and about 300 rounds of ammo and some other things are all packed in 2 go bags </p>

<p>It&#39;s not my nuke prep it&#39;s just generic prepping. No reason to be a victim when some simple things will help should the need arise. Figure by the time the binder is destroyed I&#39;ll have memorized what I need lol</p>
