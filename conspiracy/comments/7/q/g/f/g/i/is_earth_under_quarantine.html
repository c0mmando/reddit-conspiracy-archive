    <div class="md"><p>SS: I believe the answer is yes. In some form, whether it be spiritual, physical, or dimensional, we are under some kind of quarantine. If other beings exist, which I believe is more likely than them not existing, then there is no other real explanation to our solitude. If they do exist, in the way the universe would suggest, then there are likely hundreds if not thousands of space faring civilizations in our own galaxy. One of them would have come here by now and made their presence known, if they could. </p>

<p>Really? The human race has not officially made contact with even a single intelligent alien lifeforms (yet). Not even a bacteria or virus. This is how we only have a sample size of one. The Earth and the life that exists there.</p>

<p>If we go beyond that, we leave science behind and we enter personal belief systems which are useless for any sort of logical discussion. If it were then I could say I seen flying Unicorns in my washing machine and you&#39;d have to take that as real, which of course is absurd.</p>

<p>Instead, if we stick with science and proof we&#39;ll get to the truth eventually and will a rock solid base with it. Science with all of it&#39;s faults is still by far the best way to look at this.</p>

<p>Because we have that sample size of 1 and due to statistics, it tells is almost nothing about the rest of the life in the universe. &quot;Educated guesses&quot; means nothing, it&#39;s a very nebulous statement.</p>

<p>Like i said, the universal physics of the universe will set upper and lower bounds, but the area in between is so fast, it will give us infinite variation that our wildest sci-fi writers can&#39;t even imagine.</p>

<p>By speaking on reddit you are trying to prove something to others. That can&#39;t be done with &quot;trust me&quot; or &quot;I believe&quot;. Show us proof else mark your comment as speculation or words to that effect</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they will ever reveal themselves to the masses. It is an individual&#39;s choice whether they want to step out into space civilization, because it&#39;s pretty weird and takes place much more in the mental plane than what most people would imagine. This is why they leave breadcrumbs for you to follow if you choose. You can have direct contact with ETs if you want, but it takes months and years of mental preparation after being raised in an earth-only universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you’re saying. I used to practice black magick.. that’s why I have had these issues with demonic entities. I also was on a paranormal research team for two years. I’ve encountered these entities <em>on the physical plane</em></p>

<p>If you’re so positive, try to not come off as preachy, you’ll never get anywhere with anyone. <em>Lead</em> people. Don’t try to preach them. In my opinion, that’s counterintuitive, going against your first point, that it is within us to access this mental plane <em>for ourselves</em></p>

<p>I’ve had plenty of positive experiences with what I call “god” (nature) and humanity. I don’t really think I need to experience positivity from good ETs. I know they’re there, I know they’re watching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I try to not come off like that - a lot of the time I&#39;m just rambling from a perspective of trying to spread as much knowledge as possible to people with obviously much less of it than you. </p>

<p>That is super interesting that you&#39;ve been able to contact / see beings in the physical plane - I was not sure if that was possible. Are they clearly visible? I&#39;ve mentally cast a positive aura on my home so I don&#39;t have to deal with them, I&#39;ve had enough stress in my life to be honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, I do the same thing. People like us who are aware of these things can’t help ourselves. It’s gotten me into some troubles; most people will think you’re crazy, others will see you as a David Koreah type, and dangerous. I meant no offense. </p>

<p>While sober I have only interacted with negative beings (reptilians according to them) only though auditory means; an electromagnetic device. I never saw them. While tripping (shrooms and LSD) I have become aware of their physical presence and once experienced my own physical body merge with that of a reptilian entity. It was intoxicating. My strength was superhuman; it lasted for days afterwards. I was a much stronger and sexier version of myself temporarily. It was quite frightening.</p>

<p>I also was once (while complelty sober) abducted by what I could only classify as neutral beings. They taught me a lot. It was also quite frightening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dang sounds like some pretty wild experiences. You&#39;re right about people thinking you&#39;re crazy but it&#39;s a risk you take to find other &quot;woke&quot; people, and at the same time talking about it openly will wake some people up - so hopefully we&#39;re doing that now. It is a choice though, literally like taking a red or blue pill I think. You either chase it or you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been practicing astral projection and remote viewing lately (very successfully). I think Hermes is my main guide so far because the first time I pulled it off I mentally asked him for some help right as it happened. </p>

<p>I tend towards more philosophical ways of looking at it from the Greek neoplatonist perspective, most notably Plotinus&#39;. I have been reading the Hermetica lately as well and learning an insane amount, it is along the same lines as Greek neoplatonism.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s simulated and not a &quot;normal&quot; quarantine, we aren&#39;t fighting against it.</p>

<p>I hope that the powers that be allow us the oppertunity to prove our worthiness so that the veil is dropped at some point.</p>
