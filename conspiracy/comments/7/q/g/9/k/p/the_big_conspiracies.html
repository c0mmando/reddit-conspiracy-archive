       The more I look into conspiracy theories the more I come to the realization that the biggest conspiracies out there are actually centered around the belief in events that didn’t even happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not conspiracy expert, I am not even interested in most conspiracies, the daily political crap that is posted here. Yeah well that is just human nature, bad things happen in the world, you get used to it once you are a mature adult. There are many evil people out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest conspiracies are not those, the biggest conspiracies are the ones that create total false realities, sort of a cloud of deception where people are totally engaged in massive debates, arguments and talks about thing that didn’t even happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are the gigantic conspiracies out there, sort of creating fiction within reality, and people can’t tell the fiction apart from the reality, just totally deceiving everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example is the Moon Landing. It couldn’t have happened, there is no way for it to have happened. I mean the Van Allen belt, the moon lander made of tinfoil, the 300,000 km communication problem, the oxygen/fuel problem, and on and on. There is no way it did happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never believed in the Moon Landing, not even as a child, it always looked very weird to me, and the official narrative is just full of holes. Not to mention the footage is a complete joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you have billions of people believing in it. They make movies about it, they made many movies about space, it’s totally fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus you mix in fiction with reality and people can’t tell them apart. They think the Moon Landing happened because they saw a movie on TV that depicted it well and looked cool, but they didn’t even think about the background issues. The TV is totally deceptive. People literally live in fantasy worlds as a result of it, now this is a massive conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way I am not a Flat Earther, since the 2 theories get conflated many times, in fact the Flat Earth movement is also fictitious, sort of like a “poisoning of the well” for the other conspiracies made to discredit people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s not even look that far. I mean we literally have billions of people believing in a magic zombie carpenter named Jesus of Nazareth. I apologize if I make Christians feel unfomfortable, but this is the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way did you know that Nazareth as a town didn’t even exist until 100 AD?  Makes the character of Jesus pretty questionable don’t you think. (Also I don’t even have to reveal how the rest of the story goes: Jesus, the 12 Apostles, all of them, they never existed).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad thing though is the story of Judas Iscariot, whom was the archetype of early antisemitism
making people believe that Jews are “greedy” and “untrustworthy” as a result of the “30 silver piece” event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judas Iscariot never existed, the betrayal event didn’t took place, just as Jesus didn’t exist either. It was all fiction, it never happened. Unfortunately this fictitious story created a lot of antisemitism amongst religious circles, and served as a false justification for the persecution of innocent Jewish people in the middle ages and later, all of it based on a fiction story.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good example why these conspiracies are so dangerous, and why living in a fantasy world is very bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it goes on and on, people literally live in fantasy world, this is the big conspiracy out there, forget about the daily political shenanigans, they have been going on forever. This is the real interesting stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we live in an Orwellian world, literally. People usually compare 1984 with Brave New World.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some say that we live in a Brave New World, due to the voluntary acceptance of enslavement of people, however in the terms of Propaganda &amp; Deception we definitely live in an Orwellian world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orwell saw the 1936 Spanish Revolution and the deception surrounding it from a journalistic point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wrote that newspapers fiercely described and argued about events that didn’t even took place. They literally made stuff up and portrayed the event as something totally different than it was in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s hard to even put it in words when you have a media system constantly feeding you fiction, they just literally make stuff up and people believe in it. Then the lie becomes a tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at how many instances or reference of the Moon Landing you have in popular culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       They make kid’s toy’s space shuttles, they make movies about it, they make cartoons about it, they make video games about it, it’s becomes totally rooted in popular culture, yet it never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the massive conspiracies that we are facing. How do we get people back into reality? How do we stop people from believing in fiction?

       Flat Earth is the truth.  The spinning globe lie is the false reality you are talking about.  The entire point of the fake moon landing was to fake the shots of the ball Earth.  Outer space doesn't even exist.  Once you figure this out all other conspiracies line up and make sense.  It ties them all together.

       Now you see this is the other side of the fence.
      </p>
      <p>
       No the Earth is a globe, this can be easily proven with just 2 sticks in the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       By saying that the Earth is flat you are discrediting the other theories, which are questionable and it makes you look foolish.

       The Earth is a globe, but the other stuff are the lies.

       The Earth is flat and "outer space" is fake.  The entire point is to hide God.  No I didn't believe in God until after I discovered the Earth was flat and space was fake.

       No it's based on basic cartography and geometrics, unless you are trying to ague against that, you should post mathematical counter-evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course you can still argue that the Earth is concave, but that can be debunked too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sorry the Earth is a globe. But you are right about the fact that space travel is heavily hoaxed.

       I don't believe in satellites, ISS, and other fake astronautical fiction.

       So you know they are faking everything and all the pictures of Earth from space are fake but still can't come to see the Flat Earth?  That is quite amazing to me.  I fully belived in the moon landing my entire life.  As soon as I realized that was fake Flat Earth wasn't far behind.

       They are faking the pictures of Earth because satellites don't exist to film the Earth, and not because it's flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe in Flat Earth because it can be debunked very easily and there is overwhelming mathematical, physical and engineering evidence to support a ball Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no evidence however for the existence of satellites, ISS, moon landing, other than the TV.

       There are way more proofs the earth is flat than a ball.  The only thing people have are the pictures from the space agencies.  When you remove them there is no way to logically conclude it's a spinning ball.  You are just bying into a bunch of false history.  Newton was an Occultist.  Pythagoras was hugely into the mystery schools.  They have created a mathemagic illusion that you are living in.

       i don't trust their personality, I trust the math. Thus if you can provide mathematical proof for the flat earth model, then I'm listening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have only seen a buch of youtube videos talking about the horizon and the sun, but no mathematical proof of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas the globe earth can be literally proven in 5 minutes. I am sorry the evidence is just overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of hoax about space, but the shape of the earth is not one of it. Just because they are lying about this, that doesn't mean that all of it is a lie.

       Notice the "missile like" trails emerging from the horizon in pairs, like wings. It's flat, and weird.

       Very weird.  I've seen some videos of people trying to zoom in on those things and they seem like orbs that project an image behind them and they create those trails.  That weird bright object in CA that the media said was a Space X launch also looked like an orb projecting an image behind it.

       It's going to really suck for you when the paradigm shift eventually happens years from now and you realize how you were jerked around by shills on this issue.  It seems very likely TPTB want this issue to come out so it well based on how many shills lead the FE community.  It will likely be their catalyst for a revolution on a global scale to bring in their "light side" one world government.

       It's funny, because even Christian archeologists now admit that many events in the Bible couldn't have happened, but they don't go all the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet other researchers have already went all the way. I mean there was like 20 Jesuses in scriptures, and the same story got recycled in all religions:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Horus, Dionysis, Khrisna, Zoroaster, Mithras, you name it. It's the same fiction story.

       In Ancient Rome, it was known as Sol Invictus, sun worship, then the holy light, of basically the northern star.

       He symbolizes a lot of things. A lot of ideas, rumors and beliefs at that time got merged. The same motifs could have been seen in many other religions, for instance:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Horus was born on Dec 25
       </li>
       <li>
        Horus was born from a virgin (which was a very common paganistic motif in other religions as well)
       </li>
       <li>
        Horus had 12 disciples
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Horus was crucified and resurrected
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mithras was born from a virgin
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mithras was born on Dec 25
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mithras was a wise wandering teacher
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mithras was crucified
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And so on.... It's ridiculous once you research it.

       Of course he never existed. There were like 20 instances of the same story being recycled over and over again: 
* Horus, Dionysis, Khrisna, Zoroaster, Mithras, Buddha, Odysseus, Heracles, Attis of Phrygia, the list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in semitic scriptures, there were multiple Jesuses as well:
* Jesus ben Sirach, Jesus ben Pandira, Jesus ben Ananias, Jesus ben Saphat, Jesus ben Gamala, Jesus ben Thebuth, etc..

       How will it ever change when people still tune in to award shows celebrating fake people for portraying fake situations? Getting paid unbalanced proportions of paper with fake worth and being heralded as what we should strive to become? We have companies whose advertising attracts people to eat fake food and wear fake clothes.if you ask a lot of people, they genuinely believe some of these companies aren't fake, and actually care. its all fake. I can't think of the last time I met someone in person who didn't subscribe to a fake way of life. 
I know I sure do. It's what we're supposed to do. And to seperate from it, is to seperate from modern (lack of) sensibilities.

       the biggest conspiracy is that there's a group of satanic baby eaters (you know them by their use of hierarchy) who want to enslave the rest of us.  their symbols are in plain sight.  their excuses never make any sense (another tip off).  they control (or try to control) all of the developmental sequences of human beings so that they are like programmed machines.  there's an easy way to break their grip - don't act like a careless machine, do not enable hierarchy, ensure children are raised well and protected, and build our systems so that they're understood by everyone, and designed in a way that allows them to mutate in understood and predictable ways.  problem solved.

       I was very aware in my childhood, I still remember. I saw all the BS that adults made up.

      <p>
       My father constantly came up with excuses whenever I asked him about stuff. So I could see that a lot of people pretend things and avoid things.

       I had a dose of religion put into me, but I never really believed in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grown up to be a pretty skeptical person.
      </p>
      <p>
       So naturally my path lead to cryptocurrencies and skeptic places like this.

       I don't want to impose anything on anyone, I am a voluntarist. But I would like if the veil would be pulled from people's eyes so that they can see the real world instead of the fantasy world.

       There are way more proofs the earth is flat than a ball.  The only thing people have are the pictures from the space agencies.  When you remove them there is no way to logically conclude it's a spinning ball.  You are just bying into a bunch of false history.  Newton was an Occultist.  Pythagoras was hugely into the mystery schools.  They have created a mathemagic illusion that you are living in.
