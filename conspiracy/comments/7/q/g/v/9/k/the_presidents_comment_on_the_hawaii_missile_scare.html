      <p>
       The president said that the mistake was “a state thing,” but that “we are going to now get involved in that.” He declined to answer a question about what the federal government would do to try to make sure that a mistaken alert like the one in Hawaii is not sent out again.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I love that they took responsibility,” he said of the state officials in Hawaii. “They took total responsibility. But we are going to get involved. Their attitude and their — I think it is terrific. They took responsibility. They made a mistake.”

       According to the official story a routine internal test during a shift change was initiated and fucked up. They never say it had anything to do with data from the military, but that's the official story.

       I'm sure they work closely with the military, but these sirens and warnings use vastly different platforms than the military. And the military doesn't really have any jurisdiction over civilians.

       Yeah. This is new, only recently had there even been the threat if an ICBM. Emergency Management functions are usually underfunded because 99% of the tine they aren't used until shit hits the fan.

       Ok so help me understand.

      <p>
       What happened to trigger that warning?
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes sense that the actual sirens and warning systems are controlled by the states. Tsunamis and earthquakes in hawaii, tornado warnings in the Midwest, amber alerts etc. But who is in charge of the 'missile attack sensors'? states? That seems like a military function.

       Emergency alert systems are maintained by the states.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's various levels of individuals that have the power to issue alerts for their respective areas
      </p>
      <p>
       Each state has their own system that is all interconnected. The feds have people in multiple departments all tied into the system (weather folks, military, etc). There are requirements the federal government has placed on them
      </p>
      <p>
       The emergency alert system is generally used for impending natural disasters which get handled by state and county emergency Management coordinators.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a special system for missiles. It's a piggy back off the same system that didn't go off on 911
      </p>
      <p>
       The same system that beeps when it's gonna be a bad storm

       I think it was a social experiment. Think about it, Hawaiians are told 40 minutes after the announcement that it’s a false alarm. Why did it take them 40 mins to respond? If that happened really, would it take us 40 mins to retaliate? By then Hawaii would be in the water, if it was a genuine accident why didn’t trump retaliate in minutes

       Wow is that fact? 
Hawaii just let their civilians and tourists hide under palm trees and sand foxholes for 40mins without re-issuing a message using the same emergency system saying it was an accident. 
There is certainly something WAY off about this.

      <p>
       Does anyone have a theory or reason why it took 40mins??

       Well - 40 minutes for another text alert saying false alarm. It took time because they didn’t have a template to send out such an alert and had to put one together .  Now they do, so they can send out false alarm quickly if needed.  This has been widely reported

       People who turned to news find out if this was real figured it out quickly.  Air traffic control quickly disregarded it..

       This had to be a real attack. There's no way Trump would actually act gracefully in response to a blue state fuckup like that. He would be ranting about how incompetent and awful Hawaii politicians are. He isn't because he knows it was a real attack that was averted.
