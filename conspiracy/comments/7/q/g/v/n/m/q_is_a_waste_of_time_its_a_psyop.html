    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough if that bothers you. I have no idea. I think we&#39;re so far into the muck at this point that it&#39;s impossible to truly know who is telling the truth and when, or who is deceitful, deliberately or not. There is so much material, from Hidden Hand to Q and others, much of it so complex and well articulated (or at least timely and relevant, in the case of Megs) that it&#39;s tough to conceive that it might be pulled from thin air, or deliberately crafted to mislead. That, however, is always a real possibility, no matter how &quot;convinced&quot; we are that we&#39;re being told the truth.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t find MegaAnon to be particularly useful in understanding it all at this point, and I feel similarly about Q (though I haven&#39;t been very diligent in my reading of either anon), but I&#39;m open to the possibility that their information is indeed truth (at least as they see it). Whether it is or isn&#39;t, or what elements of it might have been true, I think we&#39;re not gonna know before the dust has settled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An easy way to weed out the phonies - if they reference specific dates where something is supposed to happen, it&#39;s likely not true. Even naming the week is suspect. Things move too fast in Washington and anyone credible would be aware of that.</p>

<p>Also, Q and other anons would have elevated credibility if something MAJOR jumped from conjecture to real life. Something that the MSM would be forced to cover. An indictment, for example, of a person that doesn&#39;t fit the MSM narrative. So far it&#39;s only been dot connecting and straw grasping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s certainly a useful marker, and something MegaAnon has very much shied away from (explaining, as you do, that timelines always shift, and being wrong once would serve to discredit the larger discourse). I&#39;m not sure how reliable it is, though, as some specific predictions seem to have come true, despite being off by a few weeks (LV for instance). It&#39;s also conceivable that some IC unit starts pushing significant misinformation while avoiding specific dates, hoping for &quot;credibility&quot; through vagueness.</p>

<p>I agree that none of these recent anons have provided nearly enough verification to warrant anything close to &quot;trust&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea man, it&#39;s fascinating, to say the least. Check out <a href="https://8ch.net/cbts/res/120902.html#121327">this post</a> from back in December, specifically the last four lines and how it could be interpreted to Assange posting the chessboard at night and the next morning the Hawaii missile alert.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CLAS<em>OP_IAD</em>(future)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Classified Operation Integrated Air Defense will happen in the future and will play out as follows</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about a nice game of chess?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assange tweeted an image of a chessboard with the pieces depicting a moment from a historical chess match from 1918. In the game from 1918, the VERY next move was white Queen to F3.</p>

<p>The Hawaii misssile alert happens the next morning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SPLASH.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Military jargon for &#39;A radio call warning that a salvo or shell will land in ten seconds.&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FOX THREE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jargon for a &#39;launch of an infrared-guided missile.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is it’s only retrofitted to ‘make sense’ in hindsight.</p>

<p>If someone saw these four lines and said, “I see what Q is trying to tell us here — expect an alert about a nuclear launch aimed someone in the U.S. very soon ... it’s a classified air defense operation and we’ll be told later that it was issued mistakenly” ... sure, I’m in.</p>

<p>But posting line after line of gibberish-ish, vague stuff and then trying to say certain words/lines within that were foretelling something after the fact, I’ll put down to confirmation bias.</p>

<p>If “Q” knows what’s going on, an obvious and straightforward tell to something no one but an insider could know — and it doesn’t have to be a major thing, just a finite and specific one — would be a better approach IMHO. Just “hey, sometime in the near future you’re going to hear about something really whacky that’s going to cause a panic in Hawaii” or “on an island tied to the U.S.” even ... like I said, now you’ve got me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I think it’s vague.</p>

<p>First, give me the ENTIRE post by Q ... was this a line or two from a page or two of code and gibberish? What about all the other lines?</p>

<p>I looked at the LDR twitter timeline. I don’t see the “Stop trying to kill me” post. Maybe it was deleted.</p>

<p>But the Q post cited basically seems to say “we know where you are at all times.” And from the LDR timeline, it seems she was in the U.S. at the time, not at the former Rothschild estate (which was the nearest landmark to the crash site, not the actual crash site). </p>

<p>So if you know where someone is at all times, do you arrange for an airplane (with a student pilot and a seemingly revered UK instructor) to suicide into a helicopter near the Rothschild estate half a world away to show them that you know where they are ... when they’re in Dallas at the time?</p>

<p>Nah, I want a post that isn’t an after-the-fact pretzel logic retrofit.</p>

<p>Did anyone see the Q post and predict a helicopter crash? No, I don’t think so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What it is? It is a group of people who have managed to stay alive, active and clear-minded in their efforts to defend truth against the World Regime&#39;s many attacks.</p>

<p>The real rebellion has been able to do what it does because it is loyal to truth, whether that means to go against the stream of either the general public, the activist community or any other force or interest out there.</p>

<p>The reason why the real rebellion has been able to avoid getting sucked into the various ops against the general public and the activist community is because we have capable individuals that have solid track records when it comes to pointing out and guiding around Regime traps and ploys.</p>
