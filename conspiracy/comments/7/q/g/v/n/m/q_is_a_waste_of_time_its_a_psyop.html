       And it is working very well, sadly. The more you feed it the more you sabotage the real rebellion. Don't take my word for it but don't come crying and complaining when this ruse is over and you find yourselves more enslaved then before.

       He seems good at it because he’s just copying the most interesting stuff he sees on pol and rewording it a bit, along with piggybacking off of every Trump tweet and story in the news. Trump tweets something, he asks a vague question about it, and a week or two later something shows up in the news and he takes credit for “hinting at” it, even though his hints could have been about anything that may have happened.

       MegaAnon is currently claiming that she figured out the game and concluded that it's Julian Assange. It's a stretch, but it's certainly one possibility.

       Who else would have a deep enough understanding of global (shadow) politics, knows advanced malware circumvention, and is as deliberately cryptic as J fucking A?

       Fair enough if that bothers you. I have no idea. I think we're so far into the muck at this point that it's impossible to truly know who is telling the truth and when, or who is deceitful, deliberately or not. There is so much material, from Hidden Hand to Q and others, much of it so complex and well articulated (or at least timely and relevant, in the case of Megs) that it's tough to conceive that it might be pulled from thin air, or deliberately crafted to mislead. That, however, is always a real possibility, no matter how "convinced" we are that we're being told the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't find MegaAnon to be particularly useful in understanding it all at this point, and I feel similarly about Q (though I haven't been very diligent in my reading of either anon), but I'm open to the possibility that their information is indeed truth (at least as they see it). Whether it is or isn't, or what elements of it might have been true, I think we're not gonna know before the dust has settled.

       An easy way to weed out the phonies - if they reference specific dates where something is supposed to happen, it's likely not true. Even naming the week is suspect. Things move too fast in Washington and anyone credible would be aware of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Q and other anons would have elevated credibility if something MAJOR jumped from conjecture to real life. Something that the MSM would be forced to cover. An indictment, for example, of a person that doesn't fit the MSM narrative. So far it's only been dot connecting and straw grasping.

       That's certainly a useful marker, and something MegaAnon has very much shied away from (explaining, as you do, that timelines always shift, and being wrong once would serve to discredit the larger discourse). I'm not sure how reliable it is, though, as some specific predictions seem to have come true, despite being off by a few weeks (LV for instance). It's also conceivable that some IC unit starts pushing significant misinformation while avoiding specific dates, hoping for "credibility" through vagueness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that none of these recent anons have provided nearly enough verification to warrant anything close to "trust".

       Seriously, I don't at all care but I'm along for the ride just for shits. No harm in watching something maybe pan out. On the flip side, I also don't see much point in delving too deeply into Q. It's not like he/she's asking anyone to do anything to help the cause. Read, acknowledge, and get on with the day. Worst comes to worst, you read something mildly entertaining.

       The thing is it’s only retrofitted to ‘make sense’ in hindsight.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone saw these four lines and said, “I see what Q is trying to tell us here — expect an alert about a nuclear launch aimed someone in the U.S. very soon ... it’s a classified air defense operation and we’ll be told later that it was issued mistakenly” ... sure, I’m in.
      </p>
      <p>
       But posting line after line of gibberish-ish, vague stuff and then trying to say certain words/lines within that were foretelling something after the fact, I’ll put down to confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       If “Q” knows what’s going on, an obvious and straightforward tell to something no one but an insider could know — and it doesn’t have to be a major thing, just a finite and specific one — would be a better approach IMHO. Just “hey, sometime in the near future you’re going to hear about something really whacky that’s going to cause a panic in Hawaii” or “on an island tied to the U.S.” even ... like I said, now you’ve got me.

       Yes, I think it’s vague.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, give me the ENTIRE post by Q ... was this a line or two from a page or two of code and gibberish? What about all the other lines?
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked at the LDR twitter timeline. I don’t see the “Stop trying to kill me” post. Maybe it was deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Q post cited basically seems to say “we know where you are at all times.” And from the LDR timeline, it seems she was in the U.S. at the time, not at the former Rothschild estate (which was the nearest landmark to the crash site, not the actual crash site).
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you know where someone is at all times, do you arrange for an airplane (with a student pilot and a seemingly revered UK instructor) to suicide into a helicopter near the Rothschild estate half a world away to show them that you know where they are ... when they’re in Dallas at the time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nah, I want a post that isn’t an after-the-fact pretzel logic retrofit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did anyone see the Q post and predict a helicopter crash? No, I don’t think so.

       "stfu " : clearly you are the one trying to make others shut up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pointing out that a force or entity is pacifying and misguiding almost an entire niche market is reason enough to point out the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe in helping others staying loyal to the truth then why are you even on this forum?

       Wonderful to see this get buried on a "truth seeking" forum. It just shows how well the Q psyop is working. It's already a cult, a religion. no better than the UN's "global warming" that they keep rephrasing.

       I'm going to take it one step further and put this Q circus on par with Wikileaks and Snowden... Here, vote this down too.

       Nope, all are psyops. This is very clear. You don't even have to be an expert. Common sense and loyalty to truth will get you there. That's how the true rebellion has managed to stay alive.

       What it is? It is a group of people who have managed to stay alive, active and clear-minded in their efforts to defend truth against the World Regime's many attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real rebellion has been able to do what it does because it is loyal to truth, whether that means to go against the stream of either the general public, the activist community or any other force or interest out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why the real rebellion has been able to avoid getting sucked into the various ops against the general public and the activist community is because we have capable individuals that have solid track records when it comes to pointing out and guiding around Regime traps and ploys.

       The Qillusion cult displays all the features of what a "truth" collective should not be.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Qillusion realm:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         it is not allowed to question alleged "authority" and dictates coming from the Qillusion
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         it is not allowed to point out the cracks in the concept or story lines that the "authority" deems nonexistent
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "heretics" (like me and several others) get attacked, threatened and ridiculed for pointing out the obvious
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         no other authority or force is deemed worthy to listen to or to consider
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         no clear answers are given by the cult leader, just mere phrases that can mean anything at any given time
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         followers become cult assets
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         truth is an enemy
        </p>
