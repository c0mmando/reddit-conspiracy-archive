       Trump signs any damn thing the "deep state" puts in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's "deep state" is a rhetorical device meant to tap into resentment about the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's "deep state" has NOTHING TO DO with actual curtailing of government abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's "deep state" is anything that harms him, not the actual Deep State.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand, beyond a recognition of partisan team-based politics, how people don't get this at this point. We're a year into this clusterfuck of faux-rebellion against the establishment by Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Haven't you been clued in by now? Trump is a mascot for himself, and an autopen for Ryan/McConnell policies. His "deep state" is anything that endangers him, not anything that endangers you.

       Agreed. He lives for praise (mommy issues) &amp; his base drops to their collective knees to praise him when he tosses around their pet buzzwords. The idea that he could somehow identify &amp; dismantle "bad" parts of a government he literally doesn't understand the inner workings of is outright absurd.

       Yeah it must be easy. Walk into the Oval Office and in one year deep state should be crushed!!

       If JFK can do it then... shyt, you Lefties are right again.

       What’s your solution? How should Trump play things to dismantle the deep state?

       Who would you elect to take his place? How would he/she do things better? I’m more of a Rand Paul guy and he seems to get along fine with Trump right now.

       I think the only good thing he can do for our country is to
       <em>
        quietly
       </em>
       do absolutely nothing until his term is up &amp; then slink back to his ego- stroking, gold encrusted former life. The "deep state" can only be dismantled by slowly working to shift the ideals of Americans. Our government is of the people. Just like media: it's a two way mirror.

       So why was the FBI working with Fusion GPS to create a contingency plan if Trump won?  It wouldn't be necessary if Trump was part of the deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the media, which is controlled by the deep state, attacking Trump constantly and with such fervor?  It's the craziest most blatant shit I've ever seen.  There's no way that would happen if Trump was a deep state puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does his own party fight him harder than they ever fought Obama?  Look at GWB's presidency.  Even the Democrats did whatever he wanted.  Then years later they just pretended that the Republicans tricked them into doing it.  Right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary was the deep state's chosen puppet, and she lost.  They did not expect that to happen, but they are determined to make sure that it will not happen again.  That is why we see all of the censorship across social media, and the constant effort to push anti Trump propaganda everywhere on the web and legacy media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the idea that Trump is a deep state puppet because he hasn't managed to single handedly take down the deep state in one year is just absurd.

       I think lefties actually believe that all Trump supporters are Nazis or something.  You guys have repeated that lie so often that you actually believe it now, and you think calling Trump a zionist will cause him to lose support.

       Why isn't Trump calling out the ones trying to sideline him and pull swamp thing bullshit other than the media? He should be calling all those corrupt establishment stooges out. That's what his campaign was.

       It's almost like he lied and was just there to do his part and make Clinton won but it backfired and now he's stuck having to implement the Zionist agenda

       The deep state is definitely a real thing. The shadow government. The powers that be.

       However Trump seems to be doing what they want, more than acting against them.

       I do think that Trump is anti-establishment. He is a nationalist who have American interests in mind. But I don't think that necessarily makes him a "good guy" as he might not care about building up the MIC and allowing them to continue unjust wars in the name of profit and imperialism. But he might be against the pedophilia and trafficking that the previous establishment had their hands all over. So it's not so cut and dry, definitely not a battle between good and evil, but there is clearly a battle going on and if I had to guess, Trump and his allies are not as morally depraved as the ones being replaced. But that doesn't say much because the bar had been set pretty damn low.

       Because of the place where Q puts all their info (8chan, a site with pedo boards) it's best you don't look directly.

       I haven't been following the Q phenomenon, but what is a little telling is the trail of mere crumbs, and the language used.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Ready to play?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting all these cryptic messages, like statues at art galleries and making it look like some sort of puzzle hunt.
I fail to see why this person can't just be blunt about things.
It's like a game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be a good way to waste someones time perhaps, whatever actual Q's position is.
