       For Newtown, there is no proof. No images/videos were ever released. All we got was Obummer on TV crying tears claiming that many lives were lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media never showed us any pictures. There is no photographic evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a false flag operation by the deep state to take away our guns. They do not want us to stay free.
      </p>
      <p>
       More recently, with the LV shooting, Paddock had at least 7 accomplices. Again, photographic evidence of the hotel room has not been released. They have not come forward with any detailed information. How is possible that he got all those weapons up there in that room by himself? It's not possible. He had help. Members of that hotel security were part of a covert group tasked with helping him carry out the assault.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock wasn't supposed to die. Mark my words he had an escape plan ready but things went south because either someone in the deep state turned on him leaving him for dead or something went horribly wrong and they had to cut their losses. Mark my words we weren't supposed to find out his identity. Their plan was for him to shoot everyone and escape, then the media spin would be that it's too easy for criminals to get guns and gun mods and that our government agencies (under Trump) are ineffective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing was to make Trump look bad. It is very disheartening that 500 people were injured and or died.

       It's not working that well, then. The Vegas "take their guns away!" meme didn't get nearly the traction of the CT kids killing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vegas was a big fuckup. Don't know who, how, what or why, but it clearly did not go as planned, because it's been a media clusterfuck since it happened, and usually Deep State's got that shit locked down.

       There is the consideration that Newtown caused people to be skeptical earlier in the game and to be vocal about the idiosyncrasies. I wonder how well SH would've taken hold if it "happened" today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that it was a gun grab- I honestly think both were "warning shots" to anyone that is trustworthy in government to toe the line.

       So like with columbine if you go searching online it'll take a bit of work but you can see pictures of the two shooters dead. You can see pictures of the library with blood all over. You can see the pics, uncensored.

       No offense, but we got the guns and never has this country been less free. We incarcerate the most amount of people for profit, turn them into real wages slaves, we elect a government dictated to us by a powerful few, our homes our being repossessed due to a failed financial system, feeding the homeless is subject to law enforcement, and you can't travel outside the country without someones hands up your ass.

       As a whole, the long-running "conspiracy" to fake mass shootings has only increased gun ownership in this country, increased the stock prices of gun and ammunition manufacturers, and led to an overall net decrease in gun control laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've posited an incredibly powerful government conspiracy against guns, and then relied on a fact-set that shows that same alleged group to have accomplished the exact opposite of their aims.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're going with
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       cause and effect, here, the top-level conspirators are PRO-gun, not anti-gun. But I don't think that can fit within your point of view, can it?

       Ive got no sources to link to back it up.  Just remember reading somewhere that gun sales generally increase after one of these shootings.  I think the more likely conspiracy would be gun manufacturers staging shootings to increase profits.

       I know. The thing is with Newtown for example the goal was that it would generate enough outrage that new legislation would be passed to further restrict the right to bear arms. Thankfully the republicans didn't budge.

       Except they have not taken away any guns.

      <p>
       Nor will they, anytime soon. There is just as much money in the anti-gun lobby as the pro-gun lobby. No one wants that argument to be resolved.

       The newtown thing was hijacked.  The shooting really happened and the fbi/cia stepped in and embelished it for the reasons you stated.  For example, Lanza did not kill 23 people with an assault rifle.  He killed people with a handgun though.
      </p>
      <p>
       the Vegas thing was more of a coverup than a hijack imo.  Some gun deal went wrong and so they spun what happened to avoid admitting what actually went down
