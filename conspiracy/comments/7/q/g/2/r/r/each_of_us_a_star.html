       This event with Hawaii really drove this home for me, reminded me, how fleeting our physical lives can be/are. Every time you speed past another car on a highway, you are in danger of pain or death. I think it is important to be in the
       <em>
        present moment
       </em>
       , always, because we truly don’t know what awaits us in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than thinking about the future or living in the past, we should be present in our lives. We should radiate unconditional love to all beings. Today, I immersed myself in unconditional love. I love each of you, my brothers and sisters. Forgive me for trespasses as I forgive you for your trespasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my students, a kid who just moved here to this small town right after I did, had his entire life uprooted during Hurricane Harvey. His parents are impoverished and he’s been having trouble fitting in. Most of the kids here are white and kind of clique-ish. He doesn’t really fit in with the other black kids because he’s different. He’s a bit awkward, but the sweetest young man. Everyday during lunch, whether I’m in my classroom or in the lunchroom he tries to come and talk to me, we just shoot the shit; we talk about football, Trump, history, things he likes, etc. He told me Friday, that I was his only friend here. He said his parents don’t really care about him, they just care about money and have been really stressed out since the Hurricane. My heart broke for this young man. Why have a child if you’re not willing to make him/her your focus?
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago I was working at a bar and this elderly, overweight gentleman would come in from time to time. He said that his kids had stolen all of his money somehow and he lived on $900 a month, I believe a disability check. This man served in the Navy. He was a hilarious jokester. All of the other servers and bartenders would make fun of him because he never spent a dime in the bar. He couldn’t. When someone else was done with their food, before the busser would buss their table, he would stroll over and grab the remains of their food, trash and everything on the plate. I was enraged to see people mock and tease this man who just needed help.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same bar, had a girl there who was quite homely, and suicidal from time to time; it was almost a joke to her. Several of the servers one day were mocking her
       <em>
        to her face
       </em>
       saying how ugly she was. I was enraged. I was a manager at the time, so what I did could’ve been considered sexual harassment. I walked straight up to the group and in front of all of them, in the most serious tone I could muster I said, “Steph, I would fuck the shit out of you.” Her eyes lit up. The servers around were shocked. I looked at them and told them to go home, they were done for the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this isn’t a conspiracy but I just want to remind you why we’re here, why we’re fighting. We’re fighting for them, for the undesirables, the blacklisted, the distraught, the homeless, the sick, the lonely, the disenfranchised.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the better world that we’re walking (crawling) into, there
       <em>
        will be no victims
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m inspired by what I see here on this site, despite the naysayers, I know the light shines through. Despite the debunkers, I know the truth reigns. It
       <em>
        cannot
       </em>
       be hidden much longer. We are all one being, experiencing itself, experiencing individuality. We must remember to live in the present moment and love one another. I will live and die for you, my people. If you are scared, I will comfort. If you are sad, I will comfort. If you are hurt, I will heal. If you are angry, I will sooth. If you are dying, I will ease.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love you.

       I disagree friend, maybe not a utopia, but we could certainly make a better world, one where people (similar to the old tribal communities) look out for one another.

       I am often more comfortable with the people you describe than the people I work with. They have humility. They have perspective. They don't get high off the smell of their own farts.

       Omg this is PolkaDotGirl. Okay bare with me. I cant believe i didnt realise before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday day she offered to counter an argument i made with a post of hers called We are all made of stars, now here you are today with this post Each of us a star, the old post she mentioned doesnt exist now.
      </p>
      <p>
       She’s a teacher, you are also a teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
       She used to use magik but it had negative effects on her life so she deemed it all selfish and turned to religion. You also used to practice magik, it had a negative effect on your life, you then deemed it was all selfish and turned to religion.
      </p>

       Thats a few too many coincidences for me.

       If we were the same person then why would we be post the same things? That would be illogical. Also, why are you trying to attack my posts? I recognize your name. I’ve done nothing to you. For the record, I’m a man. I’m assuming u/polkadotgirl is a girl. So please, stop assaulting my posts that I have every right to make, and keep to yourself, or better yet contribute something constructive.

       Its possible but i think they’re trying a little too hard to make it seem like I’m the one with 3000 alts. Or maybe Im some jilted ex friend. They’re protesting a little too much. I shouldn’t have posted this, i’ve opened a can of crazy worms i really dont have the patience to deal with

       I didn’t say that exactly, I said something I shouldn’t have said, but I didn’t say it in that way. They was a crass thing for to say. I’m not defending that. I’m just a human being.

       That is a direct quote from you. You didnt apologise. You said kids being exposed to same sex marriages would psychologically damage them. I’m not making this up. You said, made a whole post about how the world was sick and full of degenerates. Thats you, you’re hateful, you’re ignorant. If you still don’t believe me, shall i go find it?

       I did apologize for it in a later OP. I was in a mood and needed to vent my frustrations, and at that moment I felt like I was in the twilight zone. Maybe I’m wrong. I don’t hate hay people, I don’t have anything against them. I’m just hesitant to say that everything that goes on in our culture is okay, particularly the oversexualization.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main point of that post had nothing to do with gay people, your kind (devil’s advocates, SJW’s, what have you) just like to use them as human shields, imho.

       This breaks my heart! I am a very kind and loving person (always have been). Hearing stories like this just tear my heart inside.

       I always practice LOVE. I'm a very loving person. On every account I have (not reddit) where you can put a picture, I always use a heart.

       Living next to Military Bases that have been Nuclear targets for my entire Life, Hawaii is just run of the Mill stuff. We had Bomb drills as a kid. This is just normal life around here. Live your life, be kind, every day can be your last.

       I disagree friend, maybe not a utopia, but we could certainly make a better world, one where people (similar to the old tribal communities) look out for one another.

       If we were the same person then why would we be post the same things? That would be illogical. Also, why are you trying to attack my posts? I recognize your name. I’ve done nothing to you. For the record, I’m a man. I’m assuming u/polkadotgirl is a girl. So please, stop assaulting my posts that I have every right to make, and keep to yourself, or better yet contribute something constructive.

       Too much closeted sexual frustration probably. People who need to get outside more, idk I’m new here lol. So far the spectrum has ranged from prophetic genius to outright degrnerate.

       Yo dude. This is a conspiracy sub, you post nearly everyday about some crazy random theory you’ve come up with that often has nothing to do with conspiracies. And you have every right to do it, just like i have a right to point out if I think something suspicious is going on in this sub.
