       If he would have made contact with the receiver before he touched the ball it’s pass interference, which results in moving the ball to the spot of the penalty, which would have been an easy field goal for the win on the next play. Thus why he went under and hoped someone else would catch him and/or he wouldn’t complete the pass.

       That's not an easy field goal.

       It would've been a 52 yard field goal from there.  Given the alternative, I almost take the PI and dare them to hit it from 52.

       What do morons like you say about the other 59:46 of the game to have it even get to that point. LOL was the whole thing set-up to get to that point? What else looks fishy in the game?

       He's a rookie that made a big interception earlier in the game and a rookie mistake late. He could be seen after the game crying inconsolably. Have you taken a look at any of of that?

       Game's a blowout, then it's not, then the home team makes an incredible comeback win on the last play by an obvious intentional fuckup where instead of tackling the game winning TD, he blocks his own man. Uh-huh.

       Hmm the NFL loves me but the thing is I wasn't watching the play. I was actually tuned into my favorite sport MMA, a UFC card and missed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is there's simps like you as MMA fans too. LOL even years ago when the UFC was a small niche little watched sport. There would be those guys. A fighter is clearly KTFO but because it looked improbable/amazing and/or what they wanted to happen didn't it was clearly a work and scripted. So the losing fighter let his brains be scrambled and  I was playing into their hands by believing it was real.

       Right but I'm not some naive person that doesn't think things like that happen. In the case of this game. A someone here suggested the entire game would have to be rigged with everyone in on it for things to play out the way they dd. If that same player that messed up here. Didn't intercept the ball earlier in the game. Messed up coverage in a less embarrassing to himself manner in other parts of the game the game still would've been close and exciting with his team losing but not him looking the biggest fool ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the very best, money making match-up for the NFC championship game would be Falcons-Saints by far. The most exciting, box office Superbowl match-up would be Saints-Pats followed by Falcons-Pats.

       You really think that the Vikings being the first ever team to play a Super Bowl in their home stadium isn't a
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       story to be hyped by the NFL?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not every play is fixed, and not every game that is fixed necessarily turns out the way the NFL (and TV) wants. But the refs and a few key players and coaches do what they can. Follow the Freemasons, is my guess.

       This isn't the first opportunity that this had chance to happen. Why now? When did THEY decide they wanted this to happen? Did Aaron Rogers get injured  to help the Vikings succeed more this year and win their division?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously how much more interests in the already widely watched Super Bowl is the storyline "the defensive team with  no name QB gets to play in the Superbowl in their hometown"? How is that more exciting than  two legends; Drew Brees and the exciting Saints versus Tom Brady and the Patriots. Or The Falcons get a chance to redeem themselves in rematch from the exciting Superbowl of last year with the amazing comeback?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is this boring team gets to play in their home stadium that much bigger a storyline. Is that seriously going to bring in more money and viewers than the story lines I came up with?
      </p>
      <p>
       And can you admit Falcons with chance for a rematch and a star QB vs Vikings is a more intriguing match-up than Philly. And that Saints vs Falcons &amp; Steelers vs. Patriots would be the most ideal money making conference title games? If it's about money and interesting stories why not Falcons with chance for a rematch vs Vikings and one of the most popular teams in the NFL The Steelers against thier bitter rival of this year, The Patriots?

       But there's more going on than what you cite. Minneapolis and the Vikings get a nice reward for spending a billion bucks on a needless new stadium. Patriots keep winning because of the propagandistic power of their name and the fact Brady/Belichick are repeatedly rewarded for playing their roles to maximize the NFL entertainment value week after week, year after year. Plus Robert Kraft being the most powerful guy in the NFL.

       The reward is having a Superbowl in cold boring Minneapolis in the first place. It's been common knowledge that building a new stadium will most likely reward you a Superbowl and again that's happened before. All new stadiums are needless but people have been talking about how crappy and antiquated that stadium is for like a decade. Still seems like Steelers-Patriots and Falcons-Vikings would also regenerate more interests and money. It would make the powerful Robert Kraft and his team seem even better for them to beat the Steelers in a more legit fashion. Half the fans in the league think the refs helped them beat the Steelers and the Steelers are better why doesn't he want to show once and for all that's wrong?

       Something that's never happened before almost always trumps something that's happened before. Except maybe when the Patriots are involved. And the Falcons blowing key post season games.

       Could be a couple things. Maybe they don't want the Vikings to play at home. Maybe Philadelphia is just the kind of team that might say "Fuck you" to the NFL (like Oakland would). Maybe this wasn't about pushing the "Purple Revolution" but instead getting "Eagles" and "Patriots" playing for the nation's lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe once the game was decided to go the Eagles way, the Vikings just laid down like fish. They sure looked flat as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the NFL is starting to look over its shoulder a bit about the fixes. I've never seen so many people on FB and Twitter suggesting the league is fixed. They might be sweating it.

       Or maybe the Vikings were so emotionally drained from the real not fixed improbable win that they weren't mentally prepared for the real not fixed game they got blown out in.

       So instead they blow them out but on Thursday night the 50+ players and coaches on the Philadelphia Eagles team were ready to somehow rig the game so it looks real but lose to Minnesota? But then on Saturday morning they were given instructions to blow them out instead?

       Right?  How many times you see a safety whiff that bad?  He was off his target point by 12 inches down and 8 inches left.  Plus he had his own hands/arms tucked within the framework of his shoulders.  He wasn't wrapping up OR demolishing.

       LOL so anyone would be perfect. No matter what happens it fits you're narrative. I'd say from the four teams in conference championship It's 40% Saints - star QB, exciting offense, 40% Falcons - star QB/rematch of excintg game last year, 10% Viking and 10% Eagles actually. Two no name QB's with less exciting offensive styles compared to the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of box office The Saints would be even more perfect than the Vikings. The Falcons too for that matter. More popular teams, bigger cities. More exciting offensive teams. And one of the top QB's and faces of the NFL Drew Brees. Drew Brees vs. Tom Brady, Saints vs. Patriots would pump up national and sponsorship interest. But that doesn't fit your narrative. Clearly the entire Saints vs. Viking games was rigged to prevent the true money making marque star QB match-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since you had it "60-40 acutally"..lol you even got it down to a percentage. So what parts of Falcons-Eagles game was rigged. That game was close to and as you say the football loving powers that be only slightly less want Philly over Minnesota. Why was there no posts on the obviously rigged Falcon-Eagles game. The powers that be 40% want them in the Superbowl. Why wasn't this all pointed out earlier?

       By this point in the season, you usually don't get this far unless you are a cog in the final narrative's machine.  And, yes, there has to be an alternate narrative in case one falls through (probably the most prominent example I can think of is the first Patriots-Giants Super Bowl (XLII, I think it was, the one the Patriots were supposed to get 19-0 until
       <em>
        The Boston Globe
       </em>
       came out with Spygate).
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have that many alternates here, because it was clear the moment the NFL bullshitted and rigged Pittsburgh off the map for the Super Bowl four weeks ago that they had one real mission, and that was Brady #6 to tie Michael Jordan.
      </p>
      <p>
       You forget one simple thing as you think of the whole NFC picture here:  The NFC champion, barring some degree of career-ending allegation over the Super Bowl weeks, is doing the fucking job, and the only question of whether the point spread is NE -7 or NE -17 or so is whether the league scripts it like last year or how they really feel about Brady.  So it really doesn't matter that much a whit, in the normal discussion, who faces New England to do the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Saints or Falcons would be more perfect, yes -- but the Falcons would be so obvious that the league would probably lose another five million viewers for this Super Bowl over what the #NFLBoycott is doing.  The Saints?  They probably don't want to revisit BountyGate, or they want a home Super Bowl for the first time to drum up some local interest.

       People honestly forget how rigged the NFL is, and has been (especially for Brady, Belichick, and the Patriots) since 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would it shock me if the leap was designed to take out the last defender and ensure the uncontested touchdown to win the game?  Absolutely not.  And it wouldn't be the first time an intentional act ended a game and ensured an NFL-desirable result.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, though, there are two problems with this situation:
      </p>
      <p>
       First, the NFL usually likes to market quarterbacks.  So much so that when Carson Wentz got injured for the Eagles, linesmakers actually now have made the #1 seed Eagles the underdog in BOTH of their playoff games.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, why would this be relevant anyway if the Patriots are winning it all in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>

       How bout money on the Steeler's game too? I'm a fan and super biased but in what world do you onside kick in a one score game to put them in range of a field goal? I hate our coaching staff and have since Tomlin came in but they can't be that retarded can they?

       If you honestly believe, after that scripted production four weeks ago, that the Steelers were going to be allowed to see Tom Brady and the Patriots again this season, you're a fool.

       But according to you THEY have the power to and did rig the entire Saints-Vikings game. Steelers vs Patriots is by the far the most interesting money making match-up. Why are THEY scared to have that big money making match-up when THEY can easily scripts the Patriots to win in exciting fashion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't THEY have their first match-up end on a exciting last second offensive play without referee clusterfucks that fans talked about and were pissed about for weeks?

       Which makes sense, except you have to consider the rig-job the league pulled four weeks ago against the Steelers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This league was NEVER going to let Tom Brady back on the field against those Steelers just four weeks after fucking the Steelers without lube.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even many Steelers fans understood
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       that the only way the Patriots do not win the championship again is if someone either cripples Brady or comes up with some career-ending allegation against Brady, Belichick, and/or Kraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       This league is as about Tom Brady as a political/propaganda champion as the NBA was about Jordan in the 90's as a corporate one.  Tom Brady might as well BE the NFL right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're scared of that matchup because someone on the Steelers is going to take out Tom Brady's knee.  That's why.

       If the LEAGUE does it or orders the players to do it, it's legal.  If you have the time, read the ruling on the Spygate Lawsuit (
       <em>
        Mayer v. Bill Belichick, New England Patriots, and National Football League
       </em>
       ) and see how the judge makes the truth of the matter irrelevant.  A fan is only entitled to a seat and to speak out against what happened -- no more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the PLAYERS do it THEMSELVES, it's sports bribery under US Federal Law and illegal.

       And why wouldn't that same player drop the interception he made earlier in the game? It would make everything look less suspicious to have it fall on the last play that makes him look really stupid. If he doesn't catch that interception early and/or gives up a more normal looking big play earlier he doesn't look as bad and his team still loses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways you're talking to a guy that says the entire game was scripted. I guess someone has remote control over the ball. Or all the players and coaches on both teams are so perfect it can play out like a real looking hard tackling game that is just a Hollywood production. I wonder if the stadium fans are in on it too. They reacted like they just witness something real play out in front of them for 3 hours and were full of such emotion at the end. Man the Saints/Vikings 100 plus players must not be just great athletes but some of the most convincing, greatest, most disciplined actors in history. And I hear I thought many were just dumb kids form poor backgrounds who only went to school so they could try to make the NFL. Nope they're are not only great athletes but brilliant, highly trained actors.

       Former Vikings fan here....stopped watching about four years ago as I was so tired of how rigged the NFL is in the playoffs every goddamn year with their "amazing stories" like the Pats winning after 9/11 and Saints after Katrina. My parents called me to tell me about the game so I looked up the clip on NFL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being completely honest it doesn't surprise me at all and looks so awkward I put it in the rigged column. Defender puts his head completely down, something I've never seen before in all my life outside of Junior high football and completely misses the tackle. Looking at the ground, really. Easiest thing in the world to do, just whiff on a tackle

       OK, I'm all over every NFL post on this forum making fun of people who mis-interpret and then mis-post sports stuff.

       But not this time!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoa that safety WHIFFED.  WHIFFED.  I have seen that play a gazillion times and either the safety runs through the hips or he goes for the ball.  I have never seen a safety whiff by, what, a foot to the left AND down from the hips?   Dude missed his calf!  Not even close to hips.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly not a league mandate cuz Brees (also long time sports watcher, league mandates are easy to spot).  Vegas?  Personal bet?
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the "He arrived early, avoided DPI" posts... he is the safety.  Last man between WR and end zone.  On the last play of the game.  40 yards from the end zone.

       I think he expected the receiver to turn toward the sideline to get out of bounds, but he wanted to make sure he didn't make it out of bounds. Rather than arm tackle, he just tried to knock him down in bounds, but the receiver turned toward the middle of the field and accidentally missed the hit.

       I played safety and corner.  He did just about exactly what you're supposed to do in that situation.  The only tick is his timing was a half-second off.  Williams clearly saw that he couldn't effect the catch, and promptly attempted to drop Diggs INBOUNDS after the catch.

       The spread was -5 Vikings. Check the score. It’s all fixed by Vegas. If you’re going to tell me that a kid who has played football his entire life, and even made it to the NFL, doesn’t have enough football IQ to make the simple play to end the game- you’re blinded.

       No, he was a rookie playing a certain scheme, who made a mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scheme the saints secondary was in on the game ending play is called a “973,” and it is designed to keep opposing receivers in bounds after a catch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Williams took an angle that eliminated the sideline for Diggs, keeping him in bounds. Where Williams erred, is his belief that he was not deep help on the play, and that another player would clean Diggs up in the open field after Williams cut off the sideline. In reality, He was deep help, and another player had sideline responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short of it: Williams had the right idea, but made a rookie mistake in executing the scheme.

       Hmm the NFL loves me but the thing is I wasn't watching the play. I was actually tuned into my favorite sport MMA, a UFC card and missed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is there's simps like you as MMA fans too. LOL even years ago when the UFC was a small niche little watched sport. There would be those guys. A fighter is clearly KTFO but because it looked improbable/amazing and/or what they wanted to happen didn't it was clearly a work and scripted. So the losing fighter let his brains be scrambled and  I was playing into their hands by believing it was real.

       Here's a case where a guy was paid to throw a fight and didn't. That's the ONLY reason we found out. All the cases where the guy takes a fall--just like boxing--rolled out untouched.

       Right but I'm not some naive person that doesn't think things like that happen. In the case of this game. A someone here suggested the entire game would have to be rigged with everyone in on it for things to play out the way they dd. If that same player that messed up here. Didn't intercept the ball earlier in the game. Messed up coverage in a less embarrassing to himself manner in other parts of the game the game still would've been close and exciting with his team losing but not him looking the biggest fool ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the very best, money making match-up for the NFC championship game would be Falcons-Saints by far. The most exciting, box office Superbowl match-up would be Saints-Pats followed by Falcons-Pats.
