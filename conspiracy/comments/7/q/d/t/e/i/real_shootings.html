<p>BS, no we are not, real tragedy and loss and grief is the same.</p>

I suggest looking him up and listening to his massive list of legitimate red flags regarding the sandy hook event. He also has been an official investigator for other school shootings (I believe he was an investigator for Columbine) and in those instances, everything added up. It’s only this school shooting which he firmly believes things were very off. His list of “red flags” regarding this event is massive and way too long to write up here.

<p>what made me giggle is the male hero teacher from SHES, the one with the Xmas tie, wanted to keep on working with children (4th graders).</p>

<p>trouble is his Linkedin webpage has &quot;Teacher Sandy Hook research&quot; as occupation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, when I first heard about Sandy Hook, I was devastated. Hearing about school shootings always hits me hard as a teacher. I think I even cried. Just terrible.</p>

<p>A year after that, my dad showed me a video of the crying dad. I mean that did not prove Sandy Hook was fake or something to me, but it triggered something.</p>

<p>One day, I decided to search for every news article and video about Sandy Hook I could find. My world crumbled. While I was always somewhat of a conspiracy theorist, this got me down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>1) The dilapidated school and inactive school website were enough to raise my suspicions. No school (even in a terrible area) would be allowed to look or operate like that.</p>

<p>2) I have, unfortnately, have had experiences with the death of students. The parents were distraught beyond measure. While I cannot say how anybody should properly mourn, those parents certainlu raised suspicions in going on live televisjon to discuss the death of their children. I do not even think I could get out of bed if my dog died.</p>

<p>3) There were definitely some more severe gun laws following Sandy Hook, and a few of the parents used their experience to politicize.</p>

<p>4) Gene Rosen. That is all.</p>

<p>5) The guy who dealt with the bodies (medical examiner) was extremely suspicious. They would ask him questions and his answers were inconsistent or he &quot;did not know.&quot;</p>

<p>6) Any talk questioning the narrative was shut down. If you asked questions, you were labeled as crazy and unsympathetic.</p>

<p>Look, in the end we will never really know the truth, but that event just had so many suspicioys things that do not tie together.</p>

<p>Ill update my list as I think of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hope you&#39;re coping well mastigia. Sorry for your loss.
This comment might not be of any help but I found this coping technique (that I&#39;ve used for years) to help significantly (after) the severe mourning period (of letting the sadness out of the system through reflection, crying, stillness, etc.) But after that....</p>

<p>Imagine your lost loved one never actually left but is in a different country, for a reason: e.g. spontaneous roadtrip, business trip, vacation, archaelogical journey in Egypt, touring as a musician (with your blessings), lost their way and finding their way back to you eventually, etc. a positive story helps more. </p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s the spiritual route too, but I&#39;m knowledgable on it.</p>

<p>Just thought I&#39;d share a coping mechanism. 
Hope this helps man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their grieving process was definitely far from the norm. If that was the only info to go on that was out of the norm, I would dismiss the idea of a conspiracy here, but their strange grieving with everything else makes conspiracy look very possible to me.</p>

<p>The one dad during the press conference only hours after his daughter’s death... it just makes no sense. If he here a sociopath/psychopath he might not actually be upset about his daughters death the way a neuro-typical person would be, but he still would want to put on a show for those around him, not just when the cameras come on. Telling jokes and laughing while walking up to the podium hours after his child was shot multiple times resulting in her death is truly a huge red flag. </p>
