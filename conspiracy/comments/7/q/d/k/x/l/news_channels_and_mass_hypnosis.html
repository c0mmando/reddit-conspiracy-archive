       We've likely all seen a hypnotist demonstration at some time or another. What is the point of hypnosis in its most basic explanation?
      </p>
      <p>
       "A waking state in which the subject is tremendously relaxed, so relaxed as to allow an intensity of focus unavailable otherwise, and in which the subject is very suggestible."
      </p>
      <p>
       Emphasis on "very suggestible." As in, we relax our usual instinct to question what we're being told, while still being highly focused on WHAT we're being told.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are covert and overt hypnosis techniques, one the subject is aware they're being hypnotized, in the other they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have probably seen an old school hypnosis wheel. In which moving circles were used as the focus to ease someone into a hypnosis state combined with a countdown. For the purpose of this thread we'll cover this technique.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Have you ever found yourself “zoning out” and staring at an interesting item in the room while someone is talking? Did you completely miss what they’ve said? You may have been in a trance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any object of focus can be used to induce trance. The most famous examples are the “power pendulum” or a “swinging pocket watch” – although these two objects are now associated with hokey stage hypnosis. You’re more likely to fail and encounter resistance using these objects, due to their reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, there are two secrets behind eye fixation. First, the object keeps the conscious mind occupied, opening the subconscious to suggestion. Secondly, your eyes get physically tired when they fixate or move back and forth."
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Now, have you ever wondered why nearly every news station starts out their news segment with very similar intros? Down to the repetitive music? Let's look at a few and let's see what the common theme is: (these clips are all very short.)
      </p>

       CNN:

        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ChkBvDnfXG4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       BBC:
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QzKbzLpoE4c">
        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QzKbzLpoE4c

        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MiJtsRe8MOE
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's just a few examples for the sake of time. Feel free to post your own below as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watched all of those you'll see a very clear pattern, and this is no mistake. The combination of moving patterns combined with a countdown is designed to put you in a more suggestible state that resembles hypnosis. Now the fun part is watching how often that technique is used throughout news segments. Next time you watch the news (if you still do that) see how many you can notice for yourself.

       I would argue most tv is hypnotic on some level. Hypnosis is real and not just some pseudoscience as some assume.

      <p>
       Most Americans are in a hypnotic state.

       I do not watch TV anymore (or very rarely). The agendas are just so obvious. Netflix and stuff still counts as tv.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that it takes away our imagination. People get forced images, which is manipulative, too. At least when a person reads, they can envision things on their own. Freedom of thought?

       The biggest conspiracy of all has something to do with why we care less and less what our politicians do, or what happens in the world. Make us totally apathetic/nihilist. It's possible our entertainment-driven lifestyle did it instead of someone "pulling strings." Either way it's going to work to the benefit of anyone wanting control.

       You know what's great? Being commercial TV free since 2001. Unless the headline has a direct influence upon events, people,, places, or  things inside my circle of influence, it's simply not news. It's noise. I don't listen to noise very much, and when I do catch the News and hear the words "I THINK' coming from an empty suit or a hollow skirt, I know it's not even noise... It's opinion. I have enough of those already.

       And we wonder why people have fallen into such things as Trump Derangement Syndrome. These news casts are drilling it into their heads of how god awful he is, confirming and fueling such hatred. Even if they are not directly calling him names or reporting his latest tweet, they have a thinly veiled snarl even when they speak his name. It’s rather scary to watch this taking over a nation.

       And it also helps make sense of the fact that some people believe every word the MSM  pumps out. Even if you show them evidence about how the story changes, narratives change and conflict, restractions are made, evidence of stories that were utterly falsified. You can link as much evidence as you want, and they still won't believe it.

       You should check out Alan Watt talk about how TV programming is literally designed to program the viewer, hence the name.  Always an interesting theory.

       I could also argue that that 'tell lie vision' programming has influenced you to thinking, and therefore into accepting the political system. Although I agree with you, Trump has very negative press for those who control the media despise him, he truly is a horrible man for things he has done, without media coverage. His moves over Jerusalem, his attack on Syria, his behind the closed doors dealings with multiple cases, his corruption, his scandals, these are all true. Of course what the media focuses on, such as his Russia connection are nothing but lies and propaganda.
It is a double bluff.
Leading people to being either pro trump, or pro media knowing that Trump is a house of cards ready to fall at the sight of pressure. The game is rigged.
The truth is, they are both evil. You must leave the hamster wheel and realize Trump is the enemy of the people, just as the media is.

       His moves over Jerusalem have been promised by every President for the last two decades. His attack on Syria was surgically precise and exactly what was needed to not prolong conflict or draw the US into conflict with Russia. I have no idea what closed door, corruption or scandals you are referring to. You are spouting media narratives yourself.

       I am referring to cases such as a 'secret' dealing Trump made with a former Porn star by giving her $130,000 in exchange for her silence on his affair on his run up to presidency and if it was not for her silence, as is possible, it makes you question, what was it for?
      </p>
      <p>
       And in terms of Trump, surely you must realize by now that no one makes it to President Of The United States without being puppeteer ed, and if you don't believe that, look for example at Trump's rhetoric over Iran, he is setting the stage for a future war with Iran, this is evident, Iran let me remind you was listed under countries to regime change by the Project for the New American Century one month before the 9/11 attacks and all others have been achieved, next on the list is Iran, and then North Korea, both countries Trump is increasing rhetoric over, not to mention that he has alligned himself with Israel much more than other US Presidents; his own son in law has known Netanyahu since he was a child and recieves payments for his businesses indirectly from the Israeli Govt.
Not to mention, Trump's endless meetings with both Israel and Saudi Arabia, the two countries in the Middle East capable and willing to engage in a war with Iran.

       Also, note the use of voice tone, pacing and repetition on youtube videos with a conspiracy theme. Could use half of them as ASMR!

       It's relaxing even to watch lol.
Definite patterns, I'm not going to spoil them, you have to experience them, but they are over the top obvious.
Thanks for this great post, eye-opening!
