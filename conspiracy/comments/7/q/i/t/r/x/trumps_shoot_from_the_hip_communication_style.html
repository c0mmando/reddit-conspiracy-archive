        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump&#39;s &#39;shoot from the hip&#39; communications style is refreshing, although unpresidential.</p>

<p>Even after literally growing up in the limelight, he still just seems to tell it as he sees it in the moment. Im actually starting to respect his stubborn commitment to just being himself. I get the same feeling from watching a bunch of Keanu Reeves movies one after the other. </p>

<p>Edit: not trolling about being a fan of Keanu Reeves for his ability to play himself in every movie.</p>

<p>Its interesting to watch Trumps interview in the 90s  with CNN where he walks away from the interview, basically saying they are fake news. Been sayin it ever since, haha.</p>

<p>Fortunately it seems that there is much more to his tweets and comments than it seems on the surface. At the minimum, they are being used as bait for the media. How many more out of context Trump comment mashups will CNN run before people actually see CNN for what it is?</p>

<p>The day that the world sees CNN as fake news is the day that Trump drops the mic. CNN is to Trump what Saddam Hussein was to George W.</p>

<p>He&#39;ll go after any trafficker, abuser, and corruption at the highest levels in world government as long as it will help bring down CNN and other fake news outlets pushing NWO agendas.</p>

<p>Although I&#39;d prioritize corruption over fake news, the means justify the ends in this case.</p>

<p>mark epstein was supposedly on the plane with Trump. he knows where he himself went, and that was to New York. As they were supposedly on the same plane, they would have gone to the same destination.

    <div class="md"><p>i originally presented a Forbes article that was criticizing snopes, and you said Forbes is not a reliable source.</p>

<p>Now you are presenting a forbes article that rips into food babe, both food babe and forbes write articles exposing snopes.com for the sham it is,, essentially agreeing. </p>

<p>there are three possible outcomes
1. food babe is right and forbes is right
2. food babe is wrong and forbes is right
3. food babe is right and forbes is wrong</p>

<p>In all three above potential outcomes, snopes is bullshit, pure and simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say Forbes wasn&#39;t a reliable source in seriousness wow you genuinely can&#39;t detect blatant sarcasm and mockery. Also your logic that if one story from a source is correct or wrong then everything that that outlet publishes should be judged as such is truly laughable. Foodbabe is bullshit. Forbes is an ok clickbaity website (btw the Forbes article you posted was actually more of an op-ed about a daily mail article). Snopes is a legitimate fact checker despite op-ed hit pieces.</p>

<p>Its evidence that the message wasnt handled and edited by intelligence operatives, although ironically theres open evidence that Pompeo uses  Trump tweets to gather intelligence for ops. Theres def some strategic tweets, but most are done by Trump himself or Hope Hicks.</p>

<p>The other interesting thing is that when trump tweets, the media does a response. The more retarded and inflammatory trumps tweet or comment is, the more the media is forced to focus on the underlying event. The result is that Trump looks like an idiot, maybe losing some credibility, but shifting the collective gaze to whatever issue he wants.</p>

It makes sense Trump would want to get rid of CNN and their bias against him if he wanted to create a cult of personality. heres some of the mist successful cults of personality in modern history.</p>

<p>malevolent ones
-Mao Zedong (chairman Mao)
-Kim Jong il (the original kim)
-Adolph Hitler</p>

<p>undecided ones
-Winston Churchill
-Teddy Roosevelt
- JFK</p>

<p>As for what is a good thing, its a good thing that people embrace open communication, even if it means they get the facts wrong sometimes or accidentally offend somebody. its unsustainable to expect ppl to act perfect all the time. in fact, from my experience people who seem to act perfect tend to be the ones with the most inner darkness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other thing…so the wall. The wall’s never meant to be 2,100 miles long. We have mountains that are far better than a wall, we have violent rivers that nobody goes near, we have areas...</p>

<p>But, you don’t need a wall where you have a natural barrier that’s far greater than any wall you could build, OK? Because somebody said oh, he’s going to make the wall smaller. I’m not going to make it smaller. The wall was always going to be a wall where we needed it. And there are some areas that are far greater than any wall we could build. So, maybe someday somebody could make that clear, Sarah, will you make that clear please?</p>

<p>I saw on television, Donald Trump is going to make the wall smaller; no, the wall’s identical. The other thing about the wall is we’ve spent a great deal of time with the Border Patrol and with the ICE agents and they know this stuff better than anybody, they’re unbelievable.</p>

<p>They both endorsed me, the only time they’ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate, OK? And they endorsed us unanimously. I had meetings with them, they need see-through. So, we need a form of fence or window. I said why you need that—makes so much sense? They said because we have to see who’s on the other side.</p>

<p>If you have a wall this thick and it’s solid concrete from ground to 32 feet high which is a high wall, much higher than people planned. You go 32 feet up and you don’t know who’s over here. You’re here, you’ve got the wall and there’s some other people here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ratings have gone up indeed. This shows a network completely dependent on Trump saying something stupid to make a buck.</p>

<p>I think its worth noting that CNNs dependancy on  Trump reporting can easily be exploited at the opportune time. Maybe it will even be the last move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While in this case it&#39;s tied to Trump, the general trend is beneficial for media not aligned with the president. Fox News had spectacular years coming out as #1 most watched news network at the end of Obama years. It&#39;s ratings have steadily fallen since.</p>

<p>Trump and the stupid shit he does definitely help, but the primary audience grabber is drama and being anti-establishment. However it would be more accurate to paint that a Republican presidency is the key factor for increased CNN viewership.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fox news has had been doing much better since it was announced it is being spun off from the rupert murdoch conglomerate, sleightly better quality news as a result. not sayin they r good, just thats it interesting how news gets better when you remove the puppetmasters.</p>

<p>CNN, however is all puppets, you take away the puppets and you have nothing left. They&#39;d be running around reporting like chickens with their heads cut off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh their both the worst of each side. I&#39;ve seen snippets of both lately and both were telling me how I should should see events rather than report on the events or even give a reason why I should view it this way.</p>

<p>Fox  News and CNN are the bottom barrel for the idiots in my mind. The fact they get so much viewership is a huge distriment to the US people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the alert system is state managed in Hawaii. not his job to respond. </p>

<p>hawaii seems to be corrupt. the alert message didnt reach everybody, only was delivered to some. at the same time, as you mentioned it took 38 minutes to send out a cancel message.</p>

<p>not sure why you dont see that golf is more than just golf, its about getting private time with important ppl in a relaxed environment.</p>

<p>CNN knows this, just look at how many segments and investigations they ran to expose the white unmarked truck that was blocking their good eavesdropping spot next to the golf course.
The unmarked van got more media coverage in a week than haiti has gotten in the last 5 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you&#39;d think that while some of his countrymen were panicking for 38 minutes, he would at least take a mild interest in the matter, even if just to show an ounce of compassion for anybody but himself.  Who knows maybe it was purposeful as an attempt to smear him as unfit for the job.</p>

<p>When CNN blasts stories about the unmarked truck that should tell you to turn off the tv or stop reading.. I don&#39;t blame them,  I bet they&#39;re getting huge ratings for this dumpster fire, but fluff pieces like that do nothing but add more fuel to the fire on all sides, so we dig in deeper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>id argue that &#39;not remembering the facts right&#39;, and &#39;retardation&#39; demonstrate what happens when when a person is &#39;shooting from the hip&#39; when talking or texting.</p>

<p>Its evidence that the message wasnt handled and edited by intelligence operatives, although ironically theres open evidence that Pompeo uses  Trump tweets to gather intelligence for ops. Theres def some strategic tweets, but most are done by Trump himself or Hope Hicks.</p>

<p>The other interesting thing is that when trump tweets, the media does a response. The more retarded and inflammatory trumps tweet or comment is, the more the media is forced to focus on the underlying event. The result is that Trump looks like an idiot, maybe losing some credibility, but shifting the collective gaze to whatever issue he wants.</p>
