<p>If a bomb does hit, those kids will be stuck down there and die of exposure or starvation, far worse deaths than being caught in the blast and dying instantly.</p>

<p>I for one, plan on being like the father who&#39;s son posted their text message to Twitter where his reaction was to notice the buffet at his hotel was cleared out so he stocked up on bacon. You can&#39;t outrun a nuke, so you might as well enjoy your last moments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A single little boy isnt what will likely be used though. Modern nukes contain multiple warheads, so it would be more like 5 little boys going off all at once.</p>

<p>The reasoning behind that is that it&#39;s really hard to shoot down a single warhead, so it&#39;s almost impossible to shoot down 6 of them at the same time. We (or NK, they have similar technology) launch a rocket into the upper atmosphere which  real apart releasing the warheads and those independent warheads fall down on their own like a shotgun going off from space. If even one makes it to the ground, the attack is a success.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US is unlikely to use nuclear weapons in the future, we have better options.</p>

<p>The MOAB can do near equal amounts of damage without radiating areas where us troops may need to operate in the future. The US Air Force is even working on smaller versions that will be easier to use.</p>

<p>We also have precision guided systems that now allow us to hit very specific targets rather than area targets like we were stuck with during WWII.</p>

<p>Current upgrades to m1777 artillery systems allow &quot;shock and awe&quot; at an impressive level. Every artillery piece can be linked together, aimed, and fired by a single control system far from the front lines. Combine this with &quot;time on target&quot; attacks where each gun is capable of firing 3-4 shots which all hit at the same time and we can arrange for hundreds of precision guided shells to strike a target within seconds with very few people.</p>

<p>Kinetic Bombardment (&quot;Rods from the Gods&quot;) have never been proven to exist, but I assume they do. I even believe that the North Korean nuclear test site&#39;s recent earthquake may have been their first real world use.</p>

<p>Railguns are a long ways off (decade or so probably) currently we just can&#39;t power them without power systems larger than the ships we want to put them on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hawaii is made up of mountains. In case of a tsunami, all you would have to do is go uphill. Get 50 feet above sea level and a tsunami is nothing more than a good photo opportunity.</p>

<p>Hiding under desks is just as bad of an idea as getting in sewers during a nuke. We don&#39;t really have much data on how to survive a nuclear blast, but the prevailing theory is that you just don&#39;t. Even of you survive the blast, the shockwave, the heat, and the vacuum left behind; the radiation will kill you within days without imediate care. If you don&#39;t have a bottle of potassium iodine at hand, you will die anyways.</p>

<p>Realistically, the only ones who would survive a blast in the imediate vacinity are those already in a fallout shelter who have supplies at hand. Now, on the mainland that changes. People farther away will have time to get to shelter before the radiation hits (just don&#39;t expect to drive there. Your car won&#39;t start due to the emp.) and aid will arrive much sooner than it would for an island in the middle of an ocean.</p>

<p>Hope that didn&#39;t mess with your head too much, but the truth is that a nuke is gonna ruin everyone&#39;s day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Close, but no.</p>

<p>Nuclear bombs produce all three types of EMPs. The E1 pulse which damages virtually all protected electronics is primarily produced in the upper atmosphere, but does occur at lower altitudes at a lesser degree. These occur so fast that surge protectors cannot usually protect against them.</p>

<p>An E2 pulse can still damage unprotected electronics at all altitudes. These are slower than E1 bursts and surge protectors will usually protect against them unless they were damaged by an E1 pulse. They last longer than an E1 pulse, but are fairly weak.</p>

<p>An E3 pulse can last for minutes after a nuclear explosion and is a much slower pulse which can damage transistors. These are the same types of pulses created by solar flares. Again, these occur at all altitudes.</p>

They would have had fewer injuries had they been warned with enough time to seek cover from debris under a sturdy piece of furniture.

<p>People who have been hit by a drunk driver or those who have lost friends to them rarely drink and drive though. They have been through a trauma that taught them a valuable lesson. The people of Hawaii just went through a similar trauma. They woke up with 10 minutes to live and had to come up with their own plan.</p>

Also possibly developped deep suspicion of government, which is also always a good thing too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah many people don&#39;t realize this because they haven&#39;t been in this situation.</p>

<p>When we all got the text, I seen the faces if my co workers that we were 100% gonna get attacked. I was in disbelief waiting for the sirens at least.</p>

<p>Do people think next time if it&#39;s real, they&#39;re gonna be 100% in fear again? Course not, a lot people will naturally let their guard down. </p>

<p>Do you think the guy in the video will put his kids back into the storm drains? Maybe, maybe not. It&#39;s now less than 100% chance he will.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is majority of us on the island never experienced this kind of scare besides a tsunami or hurricanes, so the next warning may not have the same effect on us as it did at first. They called it a &quot;mistake&quot;, but that was it. We can&#39;t take them serious if they can even do their jobs seriously. If we have people who fuck up that easily, then we&#39;re fucked to begin with.</p>
