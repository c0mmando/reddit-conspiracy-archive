       I try and summarise quick first. Basically there is something in physics whereby if you get particles small enough then the very act of measuring them (with a photon) would change how they act. I believe this is a fundamental fault of surveillance culture in our governments, and is something which the people who work for surveillance do not want anyone to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) So first my thoughts on how this had an effect on the OkC bombing:
      </p>
      <p>
       John Doe No.2 (JD2) was never found. Well who was JD2? I think it's plausible to say that he was a government informant. The FBI, after and around Waco, had a load of informants in far right groups. They were every in any group that could be possibly seditious. From the left to the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now it is my guess that Timothy McVeigh was also some sort of informant, but for the military branch of their domestic surveillance regime. So one was working for the FBI (possibly) and one was working for the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was not supposed to happen, but they met, and they had no clue that the other was an informant. So they were constantly egging each other on, and getting help from other far-right radicals, to do something terrible. By trying to measure how dangerous these groups were they were changing them to be more dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then what could have happened is that McVeigh was slightly less smart than JD2 and literally hit the detonator, that's why he had to be executed. But he was told that he would be fake executed if he kept quiet after he let slip about being sheep-dipped. JD2 on the other hand gave reports to the FBI which weren't taken seriously by the higher ups, and was smart enough not to have literally pushed the button, so he got away with it and was allowed to live quietly away from the public gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Right, so how does this link with the 9/11 attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same kind of deal, except that Osama Bin Laden (OBL) was a double agent. The Saudis were funding OBL's terrorist network (later coined Al Qaeda and for the sake of brevity I will continue calling them such.), with permission of the US Government with the sure knowledge that by funding them they would gain their trust, and thusly they could put in a load of informants that would monitor the situation. I think this explains why so many of the actual perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks were Saudi Arabian nationals. They were meant to gather intelligence on radical islam and possible targets in Kuwait, SA, USA, W. Europe, but instead OBL managed to subvert them for his own uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what was OBL's strategy? He was trying to the lure the last remaining superpower (USA) into a war in Afghanistan. That's why he went hiding there (well that and the mountain cover which has always been an awesome strategic defence since at least the Roman times.) because he had managed to take out the USSR before when they invaded Afghanistan and now he can do the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does Bush Jr. (GWB) fit into all this? Well he, and his dad, had long standing business deals with the Saudis and especially with the Bin Ladens. So what, right? Well GWB was probably the laziest, most goofy, president that America has ever had to suffer. It was his hair-brained scheme to let the Bin Ladens ochestrate a terrorist plot that he would then stop and look amazing. That was the plan, and the Saudis were cool with that, and the Bin Ladens were cool with that. Everyone was happy, apart from OBL being a double agent against all three.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically this explains why GWB was so slow to act against the hijackers on 9/11, because he thought it was all a big show and not real. But unfortunately it was. GWB immediately realised what had happened, sent the Bin Laden family out of the USA and then invaded Afghanistan (but made sure not to send too many troops). After 9/11 he over-compensated becoming the big War-Chief and super tough guy military man, because of the failure he had wrought on his country that he didn't want exposed. He also got a chance to meddle further in his (and Saudi Arabia's) favourite thing, namely the Middle East oil market, with his invasion of Iraq. (And it didn't help that Saddam was a rogue puppet President of the USA that overstepped his mark too often.)
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Conclusion:
      </p>
      <p>
       These events are connected because they show how devastating surveillance culture can be, and there are plenty more ways that this can happen too I am sure. Surveillance goes against our natural rights as humans to have privacy and liberty, and by subverting that you seek out the wrath of God. Innocent people died, and it is a great shame, but the people behind surveillance culture will have their souls judged in the afterlife (if not here in the physical world).

       You are correct, I was just simplifying things. The FBI gives the evidence to the DOJ who then decide if they have enough evidence to present it to a federal grand jury.

       The fall of the Soviet Union touched off a decade where the deep state and its agents collaborated to prepare for a new level of world hegemony/domination/imperialism/colonialsim by the US and US based global corporations.    Part of the plan was to also "adapt" the US middle class and working class to new global realities where manufacturing and technology would be based outside of the US,  and where the global elites would transcend national loyalties,   moving on to a "new world order" where the US territory was just one of many that were dominated by a new ultra wealthy global class.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are doing the right thing,   since the first 9/11,   Oklahoma City,   Waco,  the death of Vince Foster,   the rise of the Clintons and Bushes,  the predatory import of cocaine and heroin into the US by wealthy elites with help of a military that is now their mercenary force,  the transformation of the Democratic Party into a mouthpiece of Wall Street,  the second 9/11 and all the ensuing wars that continue even today are all indeed connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I hear "free market capitalism" and "democracy" being mouthed now in the context of American exceptionalism,   its a sad joke.    At least Putin was willing to move beyond the Cold War dynamics,  at least Russia learned something from the failure of the Soviet Union.    The US only grew more insane than they already were.    It is now the US where the propaganda has become such a toxic lie that the whole society in the US has gone insane.

       That's that I thought, too. But I think this "relocation" is just a story. They might have moved lots of planes out for exercises, but I do not believe that they relocated the emergency planes or mixed emergency real life with exercise. There is one (unfortunately german) interview with Jochen Scholz, a german officer who was involved in german government/NATO planning of the Kosovo war in the end of the ninties. He emphasizes one fact: whatever drills take place - there are
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       interceptor planes available and the launching of these planes has only two command layers (air control + one additional) and works automatically like a 911 call. They go up within, whenever there's a scenario like a highjacking or what he calls a LOSCOM. Once they have gone up they are being guided to their "targets" and then(!) a high-level decision has to be made. But the planes take off by a fixed routine. When the 2nd plane hit even a complete idiot knew what was going on. So: somebody
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       have interrupted the flow of information, must have kept the planes on the ground and must have done so for quite a long time while shit hit the fan. And this person was not OBL.

       This is interesting. I have only read your first paragraph and have already decided to post a comment. 30 minutes ago I have finished reading this article:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://qz.com/1145669/googles-true-origin-partly-lies-in-cia-and-nsa-research-grants-for-mass-surveillance/">
        https://qz.com/1145669/googles-true-origin-partly-lies-in-cia-and-nsa-research-grants-for-mass-surveillance/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And right in the middle I started wondering if one might (even only as thought experiment) assume that the tighter observation gets the easier tweaks and interaction become. There are two books that gave me the impression that intelligence really might work this way and the more int. is computer-aided, the easier is might be. 
The first book is "Secret Team" by Fletcher Prouty. Quite old. The second one is "Dark Alliance" by Gary Webb. The latter finally lead to my conclusion: this works like Wing Chung in-fight. You stick to your opponent, follow its movements just redirect but never oppose. When you do Wing Chun the right way, your opponents kinda knocks out himself. Gary Webb gives the reader the only possible conclusion: CIA was aware of almost all movements and the FBI was in many occations ready to engage and arrest people or intervene. So what I get from Webb's book is: they watched the game so closely that observing became nearly indistinguishable from actually running the game. But from a legal point of view they never did. 
I find the Heisenberg approach you are introducing very interesting.

        OkC bombing and the 9/11 attacks are connected

       In one line:
       <br/>
       Reichstag Fire I = OKC bombings; Reichstag Fire II = 9/11/2001.

        John Doe No.2 ... Timothy McVeigh was also some sort of informant
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The totally controlled mainstream and "alternative" media non-stop presented McVeigh as guilty; attempting to lay a false trail to a foreign party.
       <br/>
       For the people that started suspecting: creating John Does, as if the cover-up was about who helped McVeigh.

      <p>
       How the process of the Oklahoma City Bombing was used to shape law and to destroy justice:
       <br/>
       - Mass media implants in the minds of people that McVeigh confessed;
       <br/>
       - The fact that there aren't any video or even audio tapes of McVeigh confessing is carefully concealed by mass media;
       <br/>
       - All serious studies prove that McVeigh couldn't have done it;
       <br/>
       - The Americans are informed, that Timothy McVeigh will be executed in June, in spite of new revelations, almost in a daily basis, of thousand of documents withheld by the FBI.
