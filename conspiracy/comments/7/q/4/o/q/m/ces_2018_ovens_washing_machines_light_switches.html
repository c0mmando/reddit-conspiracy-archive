        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Journalist Alistair Charlton asks <em><a href="https://www.gearbrain.com/alexa-google-assistant-ai-privacy-2524884961.html">In 2018, AI will be listening and watching us more than ever: Is our privacy under threat?</a></em></p>

<p>He notes that at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2018, held Jan 8 - 12), &quot;The revelation of widespread surveillance efforts by the NSA and Britain&#39;s GCHQ are still a recent memory. Yet the giants of Silicon Valley are fitting microphones and cameras in every room of our house.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;At CES it was in fridges and ovens, washing machines, dryers and even light switches. Yes, we are at a stage where even the most humble of household devices — the light switch — has been given a microphone, speakers, and a blue pulsating light to indicate when it is listening and thinking. Somehow, while our backs were turned, our light switches became intelligent.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not so much worried about the government as much as I am worried about the weird abuses brought on. Government is going after bad guys but with little to know knowledge of what the checks and balances are involved if any.  It is the weird stuff like this that you could do without anyone knowing it. Literally, there could be a literal fan base based off some homeless guy that all the wealthy are fans of but that no one else knows about through this. Even then, I can see people begin to gamble on stuff like this to the point that they interrupt their daily lives to manipulate bets. The infrastructure is there and probably hackable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question. Do people who worry about constant spying lock their phone away, only use old computers with no mic or camera? The people in my house don’t leave their phone out of arms reach for 24 hours a day, yet they cringe at an echo dot commercial for thinking it’ll always be listening. Are all these new gizmos and gadgets just giving people something new to focus on so they remain trustworthy of the “phone” in their pocket that has been around for years ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think it&#39;s pretty cool.  i&#39;m looking for more of a 3rd party vendor right now that has open source.  i think the tech show&#39;s real promise to help out our lives though.  </p>

<p>it sounds weird but for christmas I was able to automate a ton of things my grand mother would otherwise have a hard time doing.  </p>

<p>she can just say alexa wake up.  turns on her lights, starts the coffee, warms up the house.  i mean her old ass that could have taken 15 minutes before.</p>

<p>she just tells it when she wants to change the temp instead of fumbling over to a dial on the wall.</p>

<p>when she says good night it locks her doors, turns on a light outside for security, and dims the house lights.  </p>

<p>i just printed out a big list for her in 16 font.  she doesn&#39;t even nee d it after 4 weeks she&#39;s got it all memorized.  now she is teaching me stuff.</p>

<p>i see huge potential for old people.  all that took me about 3 hours to setup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To what end though? Having just spent a week with my grandma, it is all the little daily tasks that keep her going. If we take those away or automate them....why not just pop in a feeding tube and sedate her, then she doesn&#39;t have to do <em>anything</em></p>
