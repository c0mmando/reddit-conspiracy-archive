I was surprised how many supremacists were coming out of the woodwork, getting emboldened, going &#39;public&#39;, because of the &#39;safety&#39; that having a candidate of their mindset afforded them. </p>

<p>Since becoming president, they&#39;ve only become more emboldened, more public, less secretive and practically gloating at every word that the rest of the country and world cringe at.</p>

<p>Now, understand, I don&#39;t think Trump is an actor. I think he&#39;s every bit the big xenophobic child he appears to be- but I wonder if he wasn&#39;t placed in power as a way to lure out the previously deep-rooted, racist right, so that when the time comes for the gov&#39;t/CIA/FBI to round them up, they&#39;ve already outed and incriminated themselves because they thought it was finally safe to do so. </p>

<p>This hill article backs up the notion that the racist right is far more public now- <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/368807-neo-nazis-celebrate-trump-shithole-comment-hes-on-the-same-page">http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/368807-neo-nazis-celebrate-trump-shithole-comment-hes-on-the-same-page</a></p>

<p>In December 1997, Trump filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. In his suit Trump accused the town of discriminating against Mar-a-Lago for allowing black and Jewish members, groups not typically welcome in the area&#39;s other clubs.[16]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Vanity Fair, &quot;Trump and his attorney had already implied that he and his club had been discriminated against because many of its members were Jewish, and, worse, that the council members who had placed the conditions on him had not placed those restrictions on their own clubs.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago#cite_note-seal201702-16">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago#cite_note-seal201702-16</a></p>

<p>I would like an honest civil conversation with you about this topic. </p>

<p>Th problem with racist thoughts though is that it leads to discrimination against others just due to their skin color or where they were born.</p>

<p>I grew up in the south, and I was a minority where I was born and raised. Except that I’m white. My schools were mostly black. I myself have faced discrimination from other kids because I’m white from other kids that were black. But I also had a ton of friends that were black that treated me equally and fairly, where skin colors was completely ignored except when making harmless jokes against each other.</p>

<p>So I know what it feels like to be discriminated against , because I experienced it on a personal level.</p>

<p>It’s not right when it happens to a white person, and it’s not right when it happens to a black person or any non-white person.</p>

Some people are racist, probably because they&#39;ve been taught that race automatically equals a belief or mindset that they don&#39;t like.
