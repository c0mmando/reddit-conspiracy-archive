       Even in the early stages of the campaign, it was remarkable how many far right, nationalist, xenophobic or racist groups were throwing their support behind Trump because 'he says what he/we think(s)'.
I was surprised how many supremacists were coming out of the woodwork, getting emboldened, going 'public', because of the 'safety' that having a candidate of their mindset afforded them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since becoming president, they've only become more emboldened, more public, less secretive and practically gloating at every word that the rest of the country and world cringe at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, understand, I don't think Trump is an actor. I think he's every bit the big xenophobic child he appears to be- but I wonder if he wasn't placed in power as a way to lure out the previously deep-rooted, racist right, so that when the time comes for the gov't/CIA/FBI to round them up, they've already outed and incriminated themselves because they thought it was finally safe to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       This hill article backs up the notion that the racist right is far more public now-

       Look I dislike hillary more than most, and as someone  who lives a half a world away i do not feel overly invested in the american system... but literally every new critique of trump is accompanied by this just straight up "what if the exact reverse is true" I mean we can question anything, i guess, but still.... sorry if i ruffled feathers, but sometimes it is too much, and I wish there was a uspol-conspiracy reddit or something...

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In December 1997, Trump filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. In his suit Trump accused the town of discriminating against Mar-a-Lago for allowing black and Jewish members, groups not typically welcome in the area's other clubs.[16]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to Vanity Fair, "Trump and his attorney had already implied that he and his club had been discriminated against because many of its members were Jewish, and, worse, that the council members who had placed the conditions on him had not placed those restrictions on their own clubs."

       Your claim wasn't "Trump sued Palm Beach." Your claim was that Trump "single handedly" integrated US country clubs.  You still got a ways to go boss.

       Yeah, I read that article when it came out last year.  It doesn't support your assertion that Trump "single handedly" integrated US country clubs in the slightest -- it actually supports the alternate explanation for his lawsuit, that Trump and Palm Beach fought decades of legal battles and Trump attacking segregated clubs as PR for his own was just one front he leveraged in the fight.

       And the background being that the city of Palm Beach was slow rolling his application to open Mar-a-Lago so he launched a national PR campaign to pressure the city by pointing out that their clubs were exclusionary and promising his new one wouldn't be.  (He knew this was a winning issue because there'd been a huge protest at Augusta a few years earlier and they'd had to capitulate.)

       Th problem with racist thoughts though is that it leads to discrimination against others just due to their skin color or where they were born.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up in the south, and I was a minority where I was born and raised. Except that I’m white. My schools were mostly black. I myself have faced discrimination from other kids because I’m white from other kids that were black. But I also had a ton of friends that were black that treated me equally and fairly, where skin colors was completely ignored except when making harmless jokes against each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I know what it feels like to be discriminated against , because I experienced it on a personal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not right when it happens to a white person, and it’s not right when it happens to a black person or any non-white person.

       Racism has always been considered about the worst thing, not just in 2017/2018. We fought a Second World War that was based in racism (of course our own gov't porch ands was just as racist,
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       ...) - and then there was this big chunk of the sixties dedicated to civil rights, and it's kind of been happening ever since. 
Some people are racist, probably because they've been taught that race automatically equals a belief or mindset that they don't like. But you've got to realize that lazy, ignorant assholes or people with extreme and hateful beliefs exist in every race and don't represent the whole.

       Your thinking about honey pots is too far off. There are also all kinds of promoted Judas Goat operations to snare and misdirect the "far right" as you put it. Daily Stormer and Weev is one -

       If you don't follow these circles, you may not know that Trump is considered a Zionist fake and a traitor by many. Although some were fooled, your assumption about nationalists and Trump now having the same mind set is just not correct.

       But I understand your point. Normally actors have to prepare for the role they have to interpret while with Trump it's the other way round; it is the role that has to change and he just keeps on being himself.

       Nah he’s exhibited these tendencies and actions his entire life. Been sued for how he discriminated in housing, made remarks about who he wanted to work for him or how when he was running casinos, and took out a full page ad regarding the central park five and what he thought was their guilt.

       burning building.

      <p>
       you run in to save one of two children.  no time to get both.
      </p>
      <p>
       one child looks like you in hair color,  eye color, skin color and screams for help in your language.
      </p>
      <p>
       the other child is different in every way and their language, when yelling for help, sounds like they are mad at you.
      </p>
      <p>
       which child do you save?

       Ha, you are reversing the burning lab scenario where  antiabortionists have been asked, you can only rescue a baby or a vial of viable but frozen fetuses ( or something like that, it's been a while since I heard the metaphor)  and this is supposed to be a dilemma for them because they seem to care so much more about unborn children  that aren't to their's than born children that are currently suffering in the world, yet they almost always choose to save the living baby.

       You could put anything in the burning building, a man or a woman, a pizza or a cheeseburger, and people will have instinctual choices.

       Me however I'm not running into a burning building, as a rule.
