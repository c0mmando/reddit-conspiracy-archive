       So since November 2017, 4 pornstars have died.
      </p>
      <p>
       Olivia Nova - found dead in apartment - cause of death unconfirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shyla Stylez - - Died suddenly in her sleep at age 35.
      </p>
      <p>
       August Ames - died from unknown reasons, rumoured suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yuri Beltran - Died from apparent overdose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now at first glance this could be gauged as coincidence but after seeing the narrative of some news articles, its made me think.
      </p>
      <p>
       These articles have been talking about mental health and abuse of women in male led businesses. Now i feel this could be a narrative to appeal to left wings to try and get porn censored or banned altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else have any input on this?

       It's a hard one for me to get behind because while i do sympathize for women who do have to put up with possible abuse and mental health issues in the industry, the other side of me is against the censorship purely just because its censorship and we know how that's going at the moment with things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think the deaths do seem a bit suspicious.

       Everyone can still have sec or go and find a place to watch it. If they really wanted to. It shouldnâ€™t be a business in the first place.

       I hope porn gets banned...
I do not get why porn is not banned in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get into your question, in my opinion most pornstars live a fucked up life. They do a lot of drugs/are addicted and the porn industry is very tough. I think that if you want to be a pornstar yourself, you either are not good in the head or you will get mental issues, because your family &amp; friends most likely won't accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, having sex all the time can not be good for your health.

       Totally understand where your coming from to do with the industry and how people may see you when your in that light. Suppose i am more supportive of these pornstars who make a living through cam shows in their own home. Atleast with this they aren't involved in the big corporation side of things.

       I have the feeling that many people simply downvote my opinion because i'm having a negative opinion about their "precious" porn.
If this applies to you who reads this, please stop telling and feeding yourself lies and read about the side-effects of frequent masturbation.
Thank you.

       This is why I disagree with you even though I didn't down vote because you are entitled to you opinion...
      </p>
      <p>
       For freedom to actually exist than it is necessary that consenting adults can do whatever they want, no matter how taboo or uncomfortable it makes society, porn included.  Unhealthy products and behavior must be protected. Otherwise questionable speech and one day soon, thoughts, will be banned for safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       They simply must not infringe on people's rights to be left alone and not bothered. Just because something is done on poor taste in societies eyes ,it should never give someone else the authority to stop you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not have control over your body or what you decide to consume (drugs) then the hard fact is you are a slave because your freedom can be taken away with you locked in a cage like bad animal for decades simply because your slave master decided you can't do it. It makes a mockery of the "free country" mantra that supposedly exists in the US. Just my .02Â¢

       I quite agree with you actually. You make a very good point.
It should be free, BUT the truth about the effects of watching porn &amp; frequent masturbation must be known to the public. 
At the moment sites &amp; research are only telling us the benefits, which I think is not fair.

       It's literally your life energy. It creates life. Generally speaking after sex men want sleep to revitalize their energy. Women on the other hand receive that energy and a known to be wide awake a feel like they just got an energy boost. Again, this is generally speaking and doesn't apply to everyone.

       It's a bit more alternative, I read about it Buddhist books. It's the reason many are celibate.  I've taken yoga classes and it was mentioned there as well during chakra talks

       Sure thing. I'm not sure if I'll be able to find peer reviews on this topic. Again, I'm aware of it from Eastern religions like Buddhism and Tao and others. I know the ancient Egyptians used to ankh or redirect their sexual energy back into the body so energy wasn't lost.

       There's a bunch of info on how sperm makes women happy and loss of vital energy from men after sex but I don't know what or if anything will satisfy your standards because they all seem like alt based info.  The Egyptian link is interesting. Have a good day too man, thanks!

       Completely agree with ya here. Education about choices that are made and the consequences of those decisions are crucial to understand. That dopamine release is enough for people to chronically masturbate, obsessive behavior is obviously not healthy.

       It is more like their deaths are being exploited to fit an agenda that they are trying to push. August Ames was harassed by people for saying that she wouldn't do porn with a guy who has done gay porn due to diseases. The online harassment was so intense that she took her life (according to news articles). The problem with the internet right now is a self authority/mob rule where everyone thinks they are the police and can act on every emotion online.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think they are trying to ban porn. It is something that could get the religious conservative vote though. But if I was running for congress, I would say that sex should be illegal even in marriage because of how outrageous it is and how everyone would want to listen to it.

       It is a big contributor.  I think 1 hour bans should be allowed ant 30 day bans are kind of ludicrous as it gets the person out of the habit of the product itself and doesn't teach the behavior that it is bad.  People behave like a protestors online and when someone gets violent you pull them away from the group to remove its toxicity.  It is no different when someone sees a sensationalized article or anything else as they might go after the person's career or stuff like that because they believe that they are above the law or think the law won't do anything in those regards.  Online is no different in that they can get very toxic and harassing.  There needs to be the same method used during protests to protect the object of the protest so that there is peaceful assembly which I think may not exist online as I don't see very much a difference between breaking someone's leg and what some people do online.

       This is one of the hardest (no pun intended) questions. I'm all for free speech and free will, but I know personally how corrupting and cancerous pornography is for the user, and can only imagine how horrible it must be for the people making it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The content is getting increasingly deviant and puerile as well, with incest and violence being bigger and bigger themes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the women's deaths, there may be something suspicious about it. Maybe they all hooked up with politicians or other powerful people and knew too much? Or maybe they had horrible lives?

       Porn is spiritual warfare. If tptb are nefarious I doubt they will ever ban it. Porn is an addictive drug that ruins families and lives. I am not a fan of censorship, but I equate porn to cigarettes; If it is so detrimental should it really be made so easily consumable under the guise of freedom of choice or non censorship?
      </p>
      <p>
       You would be hard pressed to find one US male between the ages of 13-20 that does not have a relationship with porn. This is a new development in human evolution and should not be taken lightly or ignored.

       You are correct but the accessibility and prevalence of porn has never been greater. It used to be relegated to magazines hidden between mattresses. Now it's literally accessible on the same instrument that you use to call your mom. This is
a very new development.

       Imo this can't be true, porn is one of their greatest tools in terms of destroying the family unit. Because of porn young men(MGTOW) don't need women and because of feminism women believe they don't need men. I've also read that porn is often on the forefront of technology, with things like VR becoming more and more prevalent on these sites that seems to be true. Degeneracy also seems to be an issue with transgenderism being deliberately pushed on some 4chan boards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they be legalizing marijuana but at the same time be pushing to ban/censor porn? Both serve as opiates for the masses.

       If you're looking for a conspiracy based on these deaths, you could say that maybe there are porn stars who have dirt on certain powerful men and they could be killed to prevent them spilling the beans.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's also worth considering that porn stars are a high risk group of people. There's a lot of drug use and disease and general disfunction. The average lifespan of a porn star won't be as long as that of the general population on average. Sort of like how it's not surprising when you find out a professional wrestler has died at 50 or whatever.

       Late to the party, but yes and no. I used to work for a well known production company as a makeup artist and editorial supervisor. Most of these girls are strippers when they aren't filming and partying on top of it. They see and over hear tons of shit. It's a matter of them remembering and choosing to come forth with the info.

       Porn is one of those things that closes the horseshoe and makes it a ring. The far left believes that porn is inherently violent, misogynistic, and patriarchal. Women could never possibly choose to do it, therefore it is an avatar of victimization. The far right believes that it is evil, and a tool to tear apart families. They unite in their opinions, even though they arrive there on completely different roads.

       I don't know how all the free sites make money. I don't even know IF they are intended to make money.  And i don't know why so many women choose to be in these videos.
