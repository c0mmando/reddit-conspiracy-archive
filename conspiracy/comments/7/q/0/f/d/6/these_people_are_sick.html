       You realize quite quickly they don't want to discuss or debate anything - they just want to insult you and get a rise out of you. The brigaded top comments all have one thing in common - they're incredibly insulting, disgusting, and extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've created a joke out of real criminal conspiracies. We want answers regarding Haiti, human trafficking, state-sponsored terror - they want to talk about a failing Russian lie and piss tapes. They don't have any interest in exposing injustice, they just want political control, they just want to control the narrative no matter how twisted, how bogus.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not mad Trump is being attacked and lied about - I'm mad that you've degraded noble pursuits, the desire to expose injustices, and people with consciences that don't want to see evil people get away with truly heinous crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they can't keep you in line, if they can't keep you under their spell, they'll insult you, harass you, intimidate you, and if all else fails, they will hurt you and eventually kill you.

       And besides, I never said it was real lol, did you even read what I wrote? I just said it was a legit conspiracy with plenty of evidence for it.

       Picking on who? Give me an example.
      </p>

       Nah like I said, I believe people shouldn't get harassed, bullied, and beaten because they voted for Trump, or literally just have any view that doesn't go against the MSM narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I have a side and narrative, and it's pretty clear ours has far more credibility than the shit the other side's pushing. And I'm not talking left vs right (even though a lot of the left is misguided), I'm talking about just good people vs a global, criminal cabal.

       You really need examples of Trump picking on people or groups? Really? REALLY?

       For someone who is trying to come off as a person who is looking for answers, you sure are ignorant if you need examples like you are asking for. Maybe you aren't blinding by your narrative like I was thinking. Seems more like willful ignorance on your part.

       Lol do you actually think we're calling MSM fake news just because? We're saying they're fake news because they publish unverified bullshit all the time, especially about Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, because you literally can't give me an answer, i'll answer for you: Haiti and Trump calling it a shithole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's why it's bullshit: there is no recording, no evidence of him saying that. But you people have no problem with saying he said it 100%, right?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        MSM pushes an unverified story about Trump
       </li>
       <li>
        Everyone says "oh my god he did _____!"
       </li>
       <li>
        No evidence of him doing whatever he did
       </li>

       Nice try, but I never said Haiti and Trump did I? You just made that up like I said that. Know what you would call that? FAKE NEWS. Way to go! For someone who wants to call everything fake news if there isn't a recording of it, you just made up some bullshit without any comment of me saying it. FAKE NEWS.
      </p>

       You just feel into your own bs but it's ok for you to do it cause it fits your ignorant narrative. The fact you wont understand that will only prove my point that giving you examples will be a waste of time.

       ROFL can you really not follow my line of argumentation? I said I'd answer for you, I'm not saying you said that, and it's a legit answer anyways considering it's an example of Trump "picking on" someone.

       And I'll answer for you. Fake news. You even admitted you'd say that ffs. Did you already forget that? You can answer for me, but when I answer for you... it doesn't work that way? Get off your high horse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh so now trump and haiti is an example of trump picking on someone? Make up your damn mind. I didn't mention Haiti and Trump cause I don't consider it and example of picking on someone, but yet there you go insisting it would be an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       and you literally wont answer without fake news. You admitted that already so why bother wasting time with an example? You STILL haven't answered that even though I have mentioned it 2 times, now 3 times. If you can't answer that, why would I answer your questions? Two can play your dumb game of not answering.

       Lol so give me an example so you can expose me and my "fake news argument." I said it's fake news because it's all unverified and relies on anonymous sources.

       Don't bother. The guy is pretty much exactly what his main post is calling out. Doesn't want to discuss or debate anything. Of course he doesn't get it though. Who goes on a r/conspiracy sub to complain about people talking about conspiracies? It's open for all, yet here he is bitching about ones he doesn't agree with as if he is the chosen one who gets to decides what gets discussed between thousands of people.

       Oh you finally responded, wasn't that easy? If you just answered we could've avoided your embarrassing mess of a mind up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, disabled reporter: Trump was mocking his inability to remember what he wrote, implying he is only "mis-remembering" as a way to discredit Trump. He did in fact write what Trump quoted him as writing so his reason for defending himself is justified. He's also mocked himself in the same way, limp-wrists, open mouth, tongue out, on video. Remember, this is why he brought the reporter up, and this is what he says. It's literally unprovable he did it to mock his disability.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he insults you, he's responding to something you did or said. He's justified to defend himself, it's not his fault if you're hurt by your own insecurity. Trump makes fun of Rosie O'Donnel for being a fat pig, Rubio for being short, Jeb for being a cuck. It's like a bee wondering why it got squished when it repeatedly stings a bear.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, the fee-fees, they hurt. It's totally not picking on the president when they call his hands small, his skin orange, his wife a whore, and execute a fake-Trump in a music video, right? Totally no double-standards going on. These are totally the important issues though right, I'm glad that the left can continue to push their phony-outrage so they can look good when virtue-signaling.

       This culture is neck deep in propping up war criminals and corruption.   No politicians are calling for accountability,   but the news cycle needs daily meet,   the circus must go on,  and the only people willing to put their face on this are bad people whose competence has nothing to do with fixing any of this.    Its far beyond fixing at this point,   but what we DO have is a community here on r/conspiracy that is substantially interested in bringing out the truth.    That's not going to win a popularity contest in times like this.    Outside of the small community that want to expose deeper levels of reality,  most people want to grind a particular axe to continue a way of life they hope to preserve or attain.    Which is getting harder and harder.    So,   lots of anger and frustration.

       I agree. They have tried to take over this sub many times over the years that I have been here. But they always failed because the majority of the community put truth above bias and ideology. Every post was thoroughly researched and scrutinized for truthfulness. This made the infiltrators stick out like a sore thumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then this election happened. Millions were spent on propaganda teams, and they finally ran off most of the original community members and seized the mod positions.

      <p>
       Now, I just get instantly hammered to like -20, smart posts get hammered and hidden, even moreso when the posts are detailed and particularly effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just how it'll be for a while, let's hope their funds dry up soon, or better yet, their cultleaders get locked up.

       I predict it will be this way at least until the next election. When the Obamabots tried their take over in around his re-election they pretty much stopped right after the election. This time their person did not win and they will probably be in full propaganda narrative control mode atleast until the election.

       Check this out. I didn't create this graph, I found it in one of the many posts complaining about T_D users brigading, but it actually shows the opposite.  In the plot of T_D vs non-T_D, you will see that future T_D users were here, getting upvoted, before Trump ever decided to run for President, and before T_D was even created.  You will also see that T_D users were not in here downvoting everyone.  There is no divergence.  T_D users spike, and non-T_D users also spike.  That changes after the election.  T_D users scores drop significantly while non-T_D user scores rise.  This is evidence of significant vote brigading.  The index line makes it even more obvious.  After the election there is a massive drop in average comment scores.  Non-stop brigading.

       But something has been happening here, since about mid-December, I'd say. These very antagonistic posters, who will not discuss facts, nor provide any, but will pick one repeated insult, which is never the actual intent of your comment. They're inflammatory and somehow being upvoted for using the buzzwords, despite this place formerly being a forum that upvoted rational discussion, even if folks didn't agree with every point.
      </p>

       These folks have definitely been trained. If they're human and being paid is my question.

       What's been spreading ISN'T that, it's just baseless attacks and insults with no argument being presented, no evidence, and no logic to any of it. It's truly disgusting and the only places I had seen it before this sub was r/politics and top minds.

       Congrats!! The sub has successfully been familiarized to the general public, and unlike during the times of my initial lurking, years ago, up to when I began posting, now you have the dumb public giving you those dumb answers. It would have gained so much steam and traction without the hard work of those who put in the time for the good threads and ideas as well as those who can see two sides of a coin, or care to understand that someone is on a different train of thought.

       There is lots of quality here, but, like in life ... you sometimes have to sift through the crap to find it. Anyone can post here ... it takes the thinkers we have to keep it relevant.

       It is in my humble opinion that you are spot on. I've actually seen the same thing happen to other subs prior including /politics and /sandersforpresident - it was clear as day to me. It was extremely obvious the day the dossier was leaked. There were like 20k upvotes in every sub for that story, including this one. They were too obvious but have gotten smarter IMO.

       I'm arguing with a 2 month old account right now that insists HRC didn't cheat in the primaries and was the better candidate than Trump yet she still lost...LMAO. They crawl all over the place. I'm not a Trump supporter, quite the opposite, which is why it's so funny to read these fools and their pathetic defenses. HRC shouldn't have let Trump get anywhere close and yet she let him
       <em>
        win
       </em>
       ...yet she's somehow the "better" candidate...the one who lost to a reality TV star? Give me a fucking break. And to claim that HRC cheating in the Primaries is fake news? It tips their hand too far...lol...

       Bernie got a great amount of support for someone that switched to Democratic just to run in the party apparatus.  Plus none of this translates to him losing votes.  The purge affected her just as much as him.

       They knew HRC couldn't let Bernie get name recognition. They heavy weighted the worthless Southern primaries in states HRC would never win in the GE regardless, so Bernie couldn't get name recognition in the AA community, and give HRC a lead.

       The Dem Party just mysteriously had tens of thousands of its young voters purged from their rolls the day of the Primary, then their names showed up again in time for the GE? You see how that is bullshit right? You are also aware that NY and especially NYC are parts of a massive Dem Party machine, right? That defense is ridiculous. The Party could do whatever they want in NY, a state the

       It means that the DNC never considered anyone else. It also means that HRC controlled not only the money but the apparatus and the bureaucracy of the DNC from the get go. No challenger ever had a chance. Cheating.

       Bernie got that much support, and would have beater her pathetic campaign if they hadn't slanted the field against him for all the reasons I stated above. The purge didn't effect her, it was a closed Primary and selectively purged voters in Brooklyn, where Bernie was born, and other boroughs he polled well in, were dropped from the rolls. Many of them millennials. It definitely hurt him far, far more than her.

       Every damn time with this shit. Anyone who doesn't blindly support the Corporatists must be Trumpers? Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to change the Party
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       . It doesn't matter if Trump loses and a Corporatist like Kamala or Deval wins. They will continue looting the country but do it under the table, like the rest of the Corporatists have done for decades. The Dems are corrupt, and without seizing the Party and returning it to its New Deal roots we won't save this country. It will continue on its path to destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to destroy the Corporatist choke hold on the Party and make sure it is seized by
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       Progressives. This is the only way we save the Republic. Destroy the donor class, eliminate K street and its hold on the Party, eliminate Citizens United and don't accept Presidential candidates who take donations from the Pharmaceutical, Insurance, and other Corporate industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Party must fight its civil war now, for now is the perfect time. The Corporate faction is weak, and what may be our only window to strike and seize the Party has opened since 2016. We must ensure we utilize this opening. This is how we guarantee Single Payer. This is how we guarantee Nationally funded College Education. This is how we return the Party to its New Deal roots.

       You're dead wrong if you think I'm a Trump supporter.

       There's plenty of information the public knows and there is just no convincing evidence of collusion. You want to claim I'm jumping the gun but big names, political figures said from the beginning it was treason and collusion. All that's come out since then is evidence of criminal conspiracy of framing and spying AGAINST the Trump team and there's evidence of 10x the collusion between HRC and the Dems with Russia.

       If you can believe in the Trump-Russian conspiracy, why can't you believe Dem-Russian conspiracy? Maybe they're the ones lying to cover up their own crimes?

       If Russia acted to help trump was it maybe to ward off WW3 via nukes if Hillary got elected? This explanation was circling for a while, given what we know now about Uranium one, the multiple murdered Russian agents after the election as well as a trove of other happenings since then... would you still consider this collusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you asked yourself what information Russia may have provided the Trump team, what do they currently have that is so damming.

       Then again, I still laugh at anyone caught in the "muh Russia" that refuses to look at any other pieces of information. When you do, you realize that Russia posting on social media in a way that favored Trump may be the least of our worries.

       And some people want answers regarding Trump, Russia and piss tapes. Why do you think what you want answers to is the only thing people should discuss? How does you not believing something make it not conspiracy worthy here? This sub is open to all forms of conspiracy, not just what you want to discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub has major echo chamber qualities to it. Most wont agree, but that's cause they are knee deep in the echo chamber with other accounts they agree with. There are plenty of people here who keep lists of accounts they agree with and disagree with and base their votes on that. Using RES it is easy to label everyone so there is really no effort to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       How often do you see a comment like "3 month old account" and it's cause the person saying it doesn't agree with the comment someone made. Hell, I've actually seen people call it out on accounts that are younger than the account they are saying it to!! Notice how you never see someone go, "Well I agree with you, but your account is only 3 months old..." or they never call out an account age when it's over a few years old, even if they don't agree with it. Comments like that serve no purpose and are this subs easy way out of a discussion with people. If you're all worried about account ages, petition the mods to require accounts to be 1 year old before they can post here. Good luck with that!
