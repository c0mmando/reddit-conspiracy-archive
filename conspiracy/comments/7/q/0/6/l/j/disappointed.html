        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all I should start this post by acknowledging that I lurk on this sub frequently but I have never posted on here before which I know tends to throw up red flags to a lot of people here which is why I want to be transparent. I want to make it clear that I am not a conspiracy theorist. I do not believe in most of the theories that are presented here including the big ones like the JFK and 9/11 conspiracy theories. Even though I disagree with everybody here when it comes to conspiracies I do believe that we share a core belief that there are a small handful of corrupt people at the top that keep everybody below them oppressed to some level while they leech off of humanity as a whole.</p>

<p>The reason I am submitting this post is because I want to express my deep disappointment with how many of the people on this sub handled the President Trump “shithole” comments. For anybody not in the know, it came out yesterday that President Trump had referred to many South American and African countries as “shitholes”. When the news of Trump’s comments hit r/conspiracy there were several people that criticized him for making the comments but it seemed like there were many more people that defended his comments by saying that he was just stating the truth. The problem I have with people defending Trump’s comments and the reason I am disappointed in r/conspiracy today is because it seems to play right into the divide and conquer mentality that many at the top push on us. The divide and conquer tactic has been spoken about many times on r/conspiracy before. The idea is that people at the top manipulate those of us below them into joining groups, whether it’s groups based on religion, race, nationality, politics, etc., and they will pit these groups of people against each other to keep us too distracted and too weak to question or do anything to fix our current situation. Instead of seeing the manipulative people at the top as the true enemy, we are tricked into seeing each other as the enemy. The people in these supposed “shithole” countries aren’t the problem, they are people just like you and me, they are people just trying to get through life without having to take too much shit from the corrupt politicians and businessmen of their respective countries. If humanity is to stand any chance against the corrupt few that poison and leech off of the rest of society then we need to stand together as a whole and not cast out whole groups of people just because they are from a poor country or just because they look different from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m disappointed in all the political posts. I’m getting more and more irritated with the ubiquity of Trump love/hate in all aspects of life. To be blunt, It’s painfully obvious that politics is a giant soap opera with allegations of wrong doing, smear campaigns, shit talking. CNN and FOX are the TMZ that deliver this crap. Stop buying into this “team” mentality with Republicans and Democrats they are both fucking us in the ass while they live it up and play politics during the day. No one of importance ever goes to jail, there’s allegations and evidence and grand juries and probes but no one ever gets canned. Our political system is reality television.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true. People now hate each other because of their political viewpoint, like it is the most important thing in the world. 
America is more divided than ever and this is mostly due to the reach media and social media has nowaday. The extreme left and extreme right is the thing that is shown and being talked about, while this is 1-2% of the people.
Most of the people just want to live peacefully together, but oh! whats that a Trump/Hillary sign in your garden? Now I suddenly hate you and will never talk to you since you are probably the same as that 1% that gets shown on tv.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more disappointed in all of the people who are offended by Trump&#39;s words for the soul purpose of attacking him and not because they care about other nations.  I see the same thing with people who get upset about the Syria Refugees and refuse to acknowledge our Foreign policy under Obama created that situation, or even going further back, Bush &amp; Cheney&#39;s decision to destablize the region.  I get it, Trump is a fucking moron that says dumb shit all the time, and creates distractions from talking about the real issues.  Why does no one talk about the fact we have an 800 Billion military budget to kill brown people in shit hole countries??? How about we spend half that provided clean water and food to people in those countries?  Probably because the Military Industrial Complex isn&#39;t interested in that and doesn&#39;t help to create more terrorists to further their agenda.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way. And the constant attacks on everything trump does is getting pretty old. I did not vote for the guy and I personally cannot stand the guy and worry that his lack of political and foreign policy understanding puts him in a position where he can only rely on the word of people around him... but when he gets criticism for every little thing (like having small hands or the way he drinks water...for fuck sake) the real and important criticism gets lost. I now have a hard time (more closely) following what the man does politically because I have to dig through so much bullshit to see anything of actual importance. </p>

<p>I really wish more people would discuss the absurd defense budget, or the fact that Obama’s and Bush’s foreign defense policy destroyed lives and created quagmire “shit holes”. It’s truly disgusting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s true and it ends up driving people to start sticking up for the guy because the attacks are ridiculous. So when you point out the absurdity of it all, then you get labeled and harassed for being a Trump supporter.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously. It really has me baffled. Also, when the left is constantly attacking him over all this minor inconsequential bs, it downs out actual legitimate issues with the guy... which does not work in the left’s favor. So I’m left wondering, is that an intentional move (for reasons that are currently unclear), or is there just so many liberal persons with a platform obsessed with attacking the guy they don’t even see that they are working against themselves in the long run? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the later of the two honestly. And I say that because most of the people around me IRL are the ones I’m referring to, not just the attacks here on Reddit. I expect that here, you know with the paid trollers and whatnot. But I’m talking grown ass men &amp; women, otherwise sound and logical, losing their collective minds. They don’t see it. They cannot grasp the concept of what they are doing is pushing people away, not drawing them in. </p>

<p>I blame the media, Hollywood and social media for encouraging this behavior, thus setting this mindset in stone. Reinforcing these silly attacks is causing great harm.  </p>

<p>I personally have gone underground since the election. No more FB, no more serving on the neighborhood board, no tv at all, no nothing. I’m surrounded by people that think it’s ok to behave in the manner, and I’m in a red state. I can’t take it and I’ll be damned if I’m going to allow anyone to label me a racist, nazi, alt-right or whatever for pointing out their lunacy. Has it pushed me to defend Trump, yes it has. Has it pushed me from ever voting left again, probably. </p>

Hundreds of millions have died in these places because of the West&#39;s wars, genocides, and (at their best) colonial mismanagement. Next to that, who gives a shit if someone piles on Trump disingenuously? Like good God what a petty thing to care about.

Regardless, I think what has really pissed me off was my hope that with a Trump presidency the antiwar left that we had under Bush would come back, but it hasn&#39;t.  In fact, I see a lot of people who totally ignore our foreign policy and how it creates situations the MSM uses to justify more foreign intervention.

    <div class="md"><p>For all the people here who complain about &quot;The elites screwing us&quot; it&#39;s hilarious how so many have exactly zero sympathy for the entire countries and regions of the world that elites exploited, destroyed, and sucked dry decades or centuries ago. None. They&#39;ll defend Trump calling places like Africa and Haiti shitholes full of undesirable people, both of which have been mercilessly exploited and raided for centuries by the West, because it&#39;s more important to them to defend their fuhrer than <em>actually</em> analyze how the elites destroy this world one people at a time. </p>

<p>Also a bunch of people here are full-on white supremacists, and somehow think everyone who calls them bad words like &quot;racist&quot; are the elitist ones, lol, okay. Suggest to them that <strong>maybe</strong> the multi-century plunder and rape of Africa by Europe (and, more recently, China) might have something to do with the current situation there and they blow a fucking gasket.  Suggest to them that <em>maybe</em>  generations of oppression and shuffling of minorities into lead-painted housing might have more to do with the IQ gap than genetics, and they blow a gasket. They&#39;re more concerned with protecting the reputations of long-dead assholes with the same color skin as them than they are with actually fighting the real elites: the global capitalist class. </p>

<p>They&#39;ll only give a shit about the victims of the elites when it&#39;s their own personal friends and family, and that&#39;s why they&#39;re utterly and completely useless in the fight. Up until then, they&#39;ll just rationalize the suffering of those victims as deserved or a &quot;natural&quot; result of &quot;human biodiversity.&quot; What a crock of shit from a gaggle of charlatans who will never contribute anything to this world except spit-shining their masters&#39; boots right before their own necks finally get stomped on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. These “shit hole” countries have a deep history of being exploited which is a predominant part of what has left them in ruins. Trump routinely speaks without thinking and his sentiment is held by many Americans because they are unaware of the unpleasant history these countries have. It’s a real shame that so many people cannot see the parallels between their own existence and that of others. Th exploitation game is not new; it did not originate here in the US and it definitely exists outside our borders as well. </p>

<p>The good that can come out of his saying this is the conversation that can arise, bringing awareness to the history of exploitation many parts of the world have experienced. Every one of our blunders is an opportunity for better conversation and education if we approach it properly. This one is no exception. (Me trying to be positive). </p>

The words he used stated he did not give a second thought to those actually suffering in those countries, nor the way those countries are in such a state to begin with.

<p>Umm dude your post is instead playing right into it? You are basically saying ‘Why are you all agreeing with the bad man &amp; defending his bad words, when good people, the people in MY group, the right people think what he said is terrible?’ You just drew the line in the sand &amp; divided.</p>

<p>Not that there wasn’t already division sewn by the whole debacle before your post came along, but the only point of your post as I can see it is to once again try to get people to argue about who is right or wrong instead of keeping their eye on the ball, and the irony is that you then claim to be warning people about how these issues lead to division.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to feel ‘disappointed’  or divided then I’d advise you ignore the political opinions posted.</p>

<p>Now if you simply posited that you believed that Trump said such divisive things as part of his role in tptb and ensuring the people are divided then fine, but you didn’t.</p>

<p>Instead you posted ‘your personal disappointment’, you posted ‘your opinion of what is morally right &amp; wrong’ (and I am not saying I think you are wrong in that opinion) and so continued and reproduced the division effect here.</p>

<p>No matter where you go there are assholes &amp; idiots, hell apparently these days half of them are paid to be so.  What was the point of your post? Did you just want to scold? Did you hope some might say hey yeah I’m a Trump supporter but I’m not going to defend him in this case because this person is right about the divide &amp; conquer thing?

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve no problem with the crux of your post and agree with the basic premise (though paragraphs would have been helpful), but tying this too shitholegate is playing into the very manipulation and divisiveness you condemn.</p>

<p>why be disappointed by people disagreeing with you? disagreement is not divisiveness, however, telling people you disagree with that you are &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; in them for doing so, esp given you do not know them and they owe you nothing, is shifting a debate into shaming, and a no true scotsman scenario. </p>

<p>you have created two groups, those on r/conspiracy who are true r/conspiracy members who understand the top/bottom dichotomy and those who are not because they do not, as evinced by agreeing that the countries trump called shitholes are in fact shitholes. all who agree that countries like haiti are shitholes, are, according to you (someone who admittedly does not post here or believe that JFK and 9/11 are conspiracies), are not true members of r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>can you see my problem with that?</p>

<p>i cannot speak to what trump believes in his heart or even what he truely means when he says anything at all (my guess is he means nothing, he just says whatever pops into his head at anygiven moment), however, i personally have not seen anyone equating the citizens of trump&#39;s shithole countries, with being shitholes themselves. i also, coming from a far left, historical materialist perspective, disagree strongly that calling shithole locals, jobs, govts, feeds into the elite&#39;s ploy to break and prevent our solidarity. it creates solidarity. </p>

<p>exploitation only works by blowing smoke up people&#39;s asses about how good they really have it. if you tell someone their life is shitty, their job is shitty, where they live is shitty, their govt is shitty, it wakes them up, opens their eyes, breaks the spell, and motivates them to act to unshithole their circumstances. </p>

<p>haiti is a shithole. it is a god awful place to live, and no one knows that better than haitians themselves. people paid attention to them for a week or two in 2010, but then their shitty state of affairs slipped into oblivion, and the world ceased to care. the president of the united states just confirmed what haitians have been trying to get the world to see for years--haiti is a shithole that is not fit, in its present condition, for human habitation.</p>

<p>the blowback by countries like norway calling us a shithole country may actually resonate with people here and get them off their asses and into the streets with pitchforks to unshithole our own country. prob not, but one can hope.</p>

<p>your view is quite patronizing to poor countries. you demand we take pity on them. it&#39;s not their fault. they are doing the best they can. they are just human beings. they are just poor. here&#39;s the thing, being poor is shitty. poor locals, whether missippi or mosambique, are shitholes. just as was the east end of london in the 19th century, and appalachia since forever. calling spades spades doesn&#39;t demean the people there, it vindicates them. it doesn&#39;t imply it is their fault, it shines light on the fact the problem is structural. shitholedness is always structural.</p>

<p>structural problems are understood to be the result of exploitation.</p>

<p>the only people who can fix haiti are haitians. this is true for everywhere in the world. unfortunately, foriegn aid often only makes things worse, so the options are limited and exceedingly difficult. the most capable of haitians are the ones coming here, syphoning off a vital resource to haiti&#39;s rejuvination. they come here precisely because the feel that haiti is a hopeless cause...and a shithole. i know so, because unlike most, i actually have haitian neighbors and live in the US county with the most haitians of all. </p>

<p>it is one thing to say everyone who wants to come to america should be able to do so, it is another to actually be able to accomodate them when they come without displacing any already here, esp since we do such a piss poor job accomodating people born here. the norwegians rweeting that we are a shithole arent6that far off.</p>

My disapointment does not lie with people disagreeing with me, it lies with many people on r/conspiracy playing right into the manipulation that they claim to fight against. Even though I disagree with most conspiracies I still had optimism for this sub because at our core, me and all the people that post here, seemed to recognize that we were being screwed over by those in power and that we should fight against that.

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s shithole country comments bring to the surface some interesting issues.</p>

<p>Most people feel that that comment is very inapproriate when taken out of context, however people who have come to support Trump because of other much bigger and more important reasons are put in a position where they feel obligated to defend Trump on this specific issue, but in their heafts actually think its an awful comment.</p>

<p>Are there shithole countries where corruption is endemic, citizens fighting other citizens, and ppl prefer to live as uneducated heretics?</p>

<p>Yes there are, but im 100% sure that shithole countries like Chad don&#39;t like to be referred to as shithole countries. Adding insult to injury is the fact that in many instances, US involvment in shithole countries has made shithole countries even shittier.</p>

<p>However...</p>

<p>people just getting warmed up to Trump, but take offense to the &#39;shithole country&#39; comment will do what I call &#39;throwing the baby out with the bath water&#39;. </p>

<p>explanation:
&#39;he said that one mean thing so nothing else he says or does can be good&#39;</p>

<p>There is also a growing body of evidence that Trump uses twitter messages strategically, knowing that messages will be interpreted by one group in one way and another group another way.
There are a lot of psy ops and smokescreens in the media and the whitehouse these day. Most of what MSM pushes these days against Trump is out of context comments and hearsay.</p>

<p>Whats disturbing about MSM is recently they have been putting together out of context statements with lies. This is the partial truth weapon, &#39;we showed that this one quote is irrefutably true so everything else is true&#39;. Wolff&#39;s new  Fire and Fury book is a great example of this</p>

<p>This was never my argument. My argument is simply that his comments are playing into the divide and conquer tactic that many people in power will use to manipulate us and make some of us believe that we are better than others just because of the circumstances of our birth. If you truly believe that you are better than someone than it makes it easier for you to do something bad to someone else and justify it in your own mind. Leaders understand this flaw in human psychology and they exploit it and turn us all into pawns in their own personal chess game.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with you on that.  </p>

<p>Trump just said what many many people have thought for years!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea is that people at the top manipulate those of us below them into joining groups, whether it’s groups based on religion, race, nationality, politics, etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No need for anyone to do that.  We do that ourselves naturally by own free will.  We naturally will gravitate and put ourselves into groups.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of seeing the manipulative people at the top as the true enemy, we are tricked into seeing each other as the enemy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not everyone out there is our friend.  Just because some at the top are not allies, does not mean that everyone down here with us is one.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people in these supposed “shithole” countries aren’t the problem, they are people just like you and me, they are people just trying to get through life without having to take too much shit from the corrupt politicians and businessmen of their respective countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it&#39;s not the responsibility of the Western Nations to fix them.  Not out job to take those people in.  They might come from a shit hole place to live that is shit due to no fault of their own...does not mean the West has to take them in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If humanity is to stand any chance against the corrupt few that poison and leech off of the rest of society then we need to stand together as a whole and not cast out whole groups of people just because they are from a poor country or just because they look different from you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>we are not a whole.  Short of overt Planetary threat Humanity will never stand together, and then only in self preservation...not out of brotherhood.</p>

<p>Humans have always been and for the foreseeable future will continue a tribal species.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, we do. It&#39;s a naturalflaw in human psychology but it&#39;s a flaw that is exploited by those in power to further divide us and keep us fighting a false enemy while they are free to leech off the rest of us.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that we try to fix whole nations, I&#39;m just saying that we don&#39;t have to bad-mouth eachother and that we can still try to help eachother rather than turning our backs on eachother.</p>

Communism calls for complete centralized control of goods and production which I don&#39;t believe in at all. I&#39;m not advocating for the complete takeover of all world governments and the installation of communist regimes. It&#39;s weird to me that you are jumping to this conclusion seeing as I didn&#39;t state anything of sort in our entire discussion. I&#39;m talking about keeping all the world governments but greatly reducing their power and giving that power back to the people of each respective country so that everybody around the world can keep their respective governments in check. I honestly am failing to see how you find this to be a controversial statement on this sub of all places. Isn&#39;t this sub dedicated to keeping an eye on those in power and being skeptical of them and trying to take back control from them. That&#39;s why I&#39;m so confused by your position here because you are on this sub that is dedicated to calling out all the wrongdoings that people perceive their governments or businessess to be carrying out and fighting against those injustices and yet it seems like you are saying that people just need to stay in their place.</p>

<p>You should consider updating your talking points so you don&#39;t sound like you&#39;re spouting off the communist manifesto.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first example I gave shows corruption because It&#39;s Sessions being lobbied by a pharmacuetical company to make synthetic weed while trying to puch for incarceration of weed smokers which is the oppressive part. The second example shows the corruption of  a massive company getting away with underpaying their staff and so their employees are forced to supplement their own wages with food stamps which would be the oppression part. The third shows the corruption of the U.S. government by their unwillingness to provide people with safe drinking water while actively trying to cover it u, the opressive part is that people are being poisoned by the government. See, I know what opression is. I still don&#39;t quite understand your obssession with communism however seeing as it has nothing to do with my origianl post and I didn&#39;t bring up anything even remotely related to communism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the later of the two honestly. And I say that because most of the people around me IRL are the ones I’m referring to, not just the attacks here on Reddit. I expect that here, you know with the paid trollers and whatnot. But I’m talking grown ass men &amp; women, otherwise sound and logical, losing their collective minds. They don’t see it. They cannot grasp the concept of what they are doing is pushing people away, not drawing them in. </p>

<p>I blame the media, Hollywood and social media for encouraging this behavior, thus setting this mindset in stone. Reinforcing these silly attacks is causing great harm.  </p>

<p>I personally have gone underground since the election. No more FB, no more serving on the neighborhood board, no tv at all, no nothing. I’m surrounded by people that think it’s ok to behave in the manner, and I’m in a red state. I can’t take it and I’ll be damned if I’m going to allow anyone to label me a racist, nazi, alt-right or whatever for pointing out their lunacy. Has it pushed me to defend Trump, yes it has. Has it pushed me from ever voting left again, probably. </p>
