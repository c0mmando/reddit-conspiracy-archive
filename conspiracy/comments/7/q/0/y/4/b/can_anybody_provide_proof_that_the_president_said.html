       I have not seen a recording or video provided yet that the president uttered the word "shithole", yet the geniuses on the front page of /all are acting as if it is true. Is there an actual source that provides proof of this latest round of media attacks?

       Is it something that sounds like he might say it? Probably.

       He's said to have said it in front of a fair few people, and of those who haven't said he said it nobody's said he never said it. So, seems safe to say it was said.

       Not a very strong line, this one. Not sure you need much of a line at all tbh, if this is the best they can do they're in big trouble.

       Ah, I was all ready to retract my comment, but sorry have to call a technical. I said nobody said he never said it. That's someone saying they don't recall him saying it, ie he may or may not have said it.

       Take the win, anyway. Defending against 'hur dur he said shithole' is the only way it becomes a real issue. Your line ought to be, look at the saturation, look how homogeneous it is. Look how many primetime news shows it got onto, these people are honestly telling you that one of the most important things that happened on earth recently was the president calling haiti a shithole. What sort of idiots do they think you are? That sort of thing.

       No. Those “that do like him” were very careful with their words. They said they “didn’t recall” him saying it. That is not the same as confirming that he didn’t say it.

       Trump says so.e places are shitholes, Graham calls him out directly in front of everyone and somehow cotton "doesn't recall" the exchange.  So either cotton is ducking the question because it definitely happened and he doesn't want to lie and/or add to the fire.  2. his memory/mind is so poor he probably should probably be removed from office or 3. the president says so much stupid shit and gets called out so often that they all just blend together and he actually doesn't remember this particular bit of dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure it's not #2 and while I'm not ready to eliminate #3 if say the smart no at is on #1

       I think the issue here is that the President makes a lot of statements in passing that can easily be taken out of context and used against him. The strategy of playing to his base is going to cost him as his base dwindles over time (much like most presidents).

       I like it that he's actually doing what he promised folks he would do. Did you know that Fiat Chrysler announced Thursday that it will spend more than $1 billion to revamp its Warren Truck Assembly Plant, which will start making the Ram heavy-duty truck in 2020?The truck is currently made in Saltillo, Mexico.

       Jobs are a big deal. And it was a campaign promise. The economy is a big deal, and it IS improving at rates unthinkable. Furthermore he's getting this shit done with the bulk of MSM nitpicking any and everything he says. I swear to God if I hear that him saying a country that people are trying to flee as a "shithole" is racist again I'm gonna scream. Oh wait. It hasn't stopped. AAAHHHH!!!! Haha. Really though, I'm sick of this narrative. A lot of really good folks I know voted for Trump last election. And they are neither ignorant or a racist/bigots. The media alienated me, and while I'm sure I'm a minority on this, I can't be alone in this thought.

       Jobs are a big deal. Jobs like the ones at Carrier. A company who got incentives from the administration to keeps jobs in the country. Jobs which are now moving to Mexico. 1400 people are losing their jobs. It's great that 6500 people will keep or get jobs. But a few high profile examples is not evidence of Trump's allegedy success.

       A bunch of people got "laid off" where I work, a few weeks ago. The work they were doing is being oursourced overseas. And it's not the first time nor the last time it's going to happen. And I have absolute confidence that this scenario plays out at companies all across the country.

       good points.  I agree that the MSM is collectively acting like a bratty fucking 5 year old that didn't get its way.  I find it unbelievable that people still pay attention to CNN, Fox, etc.  That said, I think Trump himself also acts like a 5 year old.  He says stupid shit pretty much every day. He has carried on with the US imperialist foreign policies without missing a beat.  His tax plan is fucking retarded.  He gives preferential treatment to the banking industries and corporate interests, and I seriously cannot believe anyone voted for him for any reason other than voting against Hillary.  He probably was a better choice than her, which says more about her than him.  To me he is a joke of a leader and has no concern for the majority of the American people. I'm still expecting the ghost of Alan Funt to appear any day now letting us know we are all on Candid Camera. But we all see things from different perspectives so I appreciate your point of view and thank you for the response.

       I don't know if you're a dumb redneck. I do know that you're focused on one particular thing, the economy, which Trump has little control over. While at the same time tacitly dismissing all of the bad shit Trump and the clowns in the GOP are doing.

       And in case it isn't clear:

      <p>
       The President, ANY President has very little to do with the ebbs and flows of the economy. And even if they could, Trump hasn't been in office nearly long enough to make a difference. The effects of executive policy take years to see the effects of.

       He slashed regulations and got a tax cut passed. Those are very real things that he did in his first year of office that encouraged business to reinvest in the US's workforce. Maybe your sitting pretty money/job wise, but a lot of folks are in a very different situation and yes that makes the economy a very important focus. What do you feel like I'm dismissing?

       I don't mean to be dismissive when it comes to the economy. I am genuinely happy for people who can keep their jobs or can get a job. I do, however, doubt, that there is going to be much of a trend where jobs come back to the country. If, year from now, this turns out to be the case, I'll be the first person to admit I was wrong.

       So, pet peeve, people always fuck up what "hearsay" is.  The legal definition is "an out of court statement offered for its truth."
      </p>
      <p>
       Dick Durbin was in the room.  He said Trump said it.  That's not hearsay, that's Durbin's
       <em>
        direct testimony
       </em>
       about an event he personally witnessed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tim Scott talked to Lindsay Graham, who said Trump said it.  That
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       hearsay, because Scott is offering Graham's words for the truth of what they said.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yes there is evidence beyond hearsay: Durbin's eyewitness account.
      </p>
      <p>
       (As a side note, people like to call "hearsay" about facts they don't like, but in reality like 99% of what you know about the world is "hearsay."  Hearsay doesn't mean "false" or "unreliable."  We rely on hearsay all the time. E.g. "Hey, do you know why the train's late?" "Yeah they said there's a switching problem."  That's hearsay, but you credit stuff like that every day.)

       Well, obviously you can't take "out of court" literally when you're not in litigation -- in this case the press scrum is the "court."  And he's providing direct eye-witness testimony of what he saw.  That's not hearsay.  If he were to say that Ghana
       <em>
        is a shithole
       </em>
       based on Trump's statement that it was, that would be hearsay because he's offering Trump's statement for the truth of what it asserted.  But he's instead offering the
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       that the statement was made.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a courtroom setting, say Bill testifies that Joe said that his basement was flooded.  Bill's testimony would be hearsay if offered to show that the basement was flooded, but it's not hearsay if offered to show that Joe
       <em>
        said
       </em>
       the basement was flooded.

        Yellow journalism, or the yellow press, is a US term for a type of journalism that presents little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines to sell more newspapers.

      <p>
