<p>We got the word out- we did that part, now is time to start revolting. We don&#39;t need to continue to point out the strange mishaps happening in our society. We know we&#39;re enslaved and we know we&#39;re being deceived. First step is spreading the word, the next step is taking action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The spying is all part of it. It is building a data base. Imagine if the NSA had everything MLK had ever said, texted, typed, or emailed. They would destroy him before he ever got anywhere. That&#39;s the point. You are safe in obscurity until you become a somebody, then the records will be searched and you will be destroyed or blackmailed with out of context examples from your past. Spying can <em>not</em> be allowed to continue, by the government or by corporations.</p>

<p>We do need to unite and fight back. But Trump and the Corporatists in the DNC are part of this fight. We need to pay attention to the bickering Elites so we know what their talking points are. Also, HW sex scandals aren&#39;t irrelevant, they tie into Pizza/Pedogate which is absolutely essential to taking these fucks down. </p>

<p>You literally admit in this post that the thread is merely an issue, and not a solution. You&#39;re informing about an issue. Okay, so what do we do about it?</p>

<p>I skimmed through the other posts and it&#39;s all the same tone. You are laying out information, and wish to hear a discussion about the information. You don&#39;t offer any new or original ideas- or any ideas for that matter. I won&#39;t waste my time reading all of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is but one of my posts. And merely informing about an issue is an important step- many people don&#39;t realize what is happening, and they don&#39;t have a conceptual understanding of the underlying issues.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;ll copypasta one of the comments I make all the time about what I think we need to do.</p>

<p><strong>begin copypasta</strong></p>

<p>We need to break out of the Corporatist fold, and the only way to do that is to shatter the current Corporate Centrist hold on power in the DNC. This means grassroots activism, to storm the Party from the ground up. It&#39;s the only way we will get a fair Primary come 2020, and the only way Bernie or someone like him can crush Kamala, Deval, Oprah, or any other Corporate whore they inevitably try to run instead of an actual Progressive populist.</p>

<p>We take the Party with grassroots organizing. The smallest organizational unit of the Democratic Party is the Precinct. Any registered Dem can show up to their local Party meetings and vote for their Precinct Chair. Precinct Chairs vote for County Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National Chairs. This is how we take the Party. 8 State Parties have already been taken from the Corporatists- Nebraska, Wyoming, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Kentucky, Missouri, Cali is captured except for the Chairmanship, which the Corporatists literally had to stuff ballots to avoid Kimberly Ellis from defeating their shill Bauman. Massachusetts is also taken in all but the Chairmanship.</p>

<p>Step by step a coalition of citizen activists, consisting of Our Revolution, a grassroots organizing effort founded in the wake of Bernie&#39;s campaign, and regional organizations like the WFP and DSA and more, are taking the fight to the Party. This is the only hope for a political solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ok, now we are getting somewhere. Problem with Communism is it doesn&#39;t work without a post-scarcity society. Russia and their USSR has shown us this. Before Communism can work you&#39;re going to have to have full-automation that can then be owned by the State and thus the People, at least in theory. Without that you simply replace one tyranny with another, because you will still have the corrupt state overseeing production that is owned by bureaucrats instead of oligarchs, and still requires human labor. AI and full automation are required for Communism to work as Marx envisioned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need no rich people, and no poor people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to cut the gap between the two, and make it so that all basic necessities like food, clothing, and housing are provided for. Again, this requires automation on a scale we do not currently posses. Without this Communism devolves into the USSR. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>should I just move to Russia and stop talking shit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t Communist, and never was, even with the USSR. They were a corrupted form of Communism. Their current government is a dictatorship with a feudal-oligarch structure in which the regional governors answer only to Putin but have vast autonomy in their own regions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, you don&#39;t seem to have one yourself. Other than burn everything to the ground in the name of an ideology that wont work without certain technological advancements.</p>

<p>Secondly, I&#39;ve already stated via my comments what the answer is. It begins with inclusive political movements that seize the Democratic Party from the Corporatists. Once we can return the Party to its New Deal roots then we can start real social change. You begin with Nationally funded healthcare and college/trade education. A healthy citizen is a productive citizen, and an educated citizen is an entrepreneur. </p>

<p>This involves a renegotiation of the Social Contract which has been heavily altered since the late 70&#39;s. From there you can start moving towards more radical change. Legislation that encourages worker-cooperatives and workers buying up the shares, en masse, of the corporations that currently own them. Keep technological development on track but plan for AI and full autmoation within the next 30-40 years. This will allow you to prepare for the day when the means of fully automated production will be democratically owned. </p>

<p>The State won&#39;t have to seize this if the corporations are already worker-owned. Ideally you want to keep Capitalism in place, it offers innovation that other systems don&#39;t. You need to make sure that the basic needs of the People are cared for via automation that is Democratically owned, while keeping the Market system intact in other sectors, excepting Health and Education, to further competition and development. </p>

<p>This is just a start. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have anything intelligent to add to your comment here but I have to admit I agree with you.  Recently I&#39;ve been thinking about giving up on this sub because it&#39;s all just constant flow of bad news and the repeat of &quot;THIS IS HAPPENING&quot; but then nothing. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always felt the need to &quot;fold&quot; the conversation to something else with action but .... I feel paralysis at the very thought of what to do next.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen other fellow subs state a call to arms where it is suggested we gather on Washington with firearms and threaten the government with actual harm to stop things like this but the reality is, the military will just send a tank over and do what China did to their citizens in the 80&#39;s.   </p>

<p>So whats left?  Call a senator?  Call the local congressman?  Gimme a break.   </p>

<p>So what else is there to discuss?  Right now we are in Witness Mode. We witness events and break them down as best we can.  Vegas is a good example of that in motion but your point is still valid:  &quot;NOW WHAT&quot;  It&#39;s very clear that something shady happened but what is there to discuss beyond knowing it was shady?  I think we can all agree to agree on that but where is the fold?  Why don&#39;t you tell US what we should do next? </p>

<p>Lack of universal single-payer health care, as I needed health care at a point where it was completely unaffordable and my job did not provide it.</p>

<p>Non-dischargeable student loans, here it&#39;s perhaps a fear/anxiety, rather than something that came about, but it&#39;s so stupid.</p>

<p>TANF&#39;s complete failure to provide relief to stressed mortgage holders, post-2008 collapse, and the subsequent loss of home equity as houses nearby went into foreclosure/eviction, lowering property values.</p>

<p>2003 Iraq War, and it&#39;s fiscal consequences as relates to the raiding of the Social Security &quot;piggybank&quot; -- this will catch up to me eventually.</p>

<p>Look, let me give you an escape hatch on this. You&#39;ve presented a VERY stupid bar to hop over...it&#39;s BENEATH the ground. People can trip over it, and still make it over. Politics doesn&#39;t mean anything to me, to anyone? Good grief! Try again.</p>

<p>Student Loans are imaginary. Many people die owing thousands- nobody gives a shit. The dollar is essentially imaginary.</p>

<p>Nah, of course not. The NSA spends its whole working week making paper darts and flicking them at each other, or looking out the window. All those billions in federal funding? They pump most of it into online roulette, and spend whatever&#39;s left on whoopee cushions and dial-out Chinese.</p>

<p>No, there&#39;s no way that spying on absolutely everyone would produce anything of value. We&#39;re all too boring. Just like, say, absolutely everyone in East Germany was too boring for the Stasi to  bother with. </p>

<p>You might be comfortable with being spied on. Go join an organised activist group, demanding some kind of change that threatens the establishment. I can guarantee you that your opinion will change, if not overnight then certainly within a year.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that I am so focused on bringing down the Elite, that I don&#39;t give a fly fuck if they know I&#39;m after them. Let them all see what we&#39;re doing- If we manipulate the situation correctly, we can deceive them by giving them false information that they only retrieved by &quot;spying on us&quot;.</p>

<p>In other words, we can use the spying to our advantage to lead the Elite in the wrong directions, and then we flank the shit out of them.</p>
