       My fiancé and I were going through Netflix titles the other night and found one about a JANET, the secret government airliner that supposedly travels from Area 51 to other military bases. We thought we saved it to the list so we could go back later and watch it, we do this fairly often without any problems. Well now neither of us can find it. We spent over an hour going through Netflix and Hulu (just to make sure). We’ve tried googling different phrases based on Area 51, government, conspiracy, secret airliners, etc. and it’s like the title never existed. There are a few older titles from the 90’s and early 2000’s but this was a new 2018 title and we can’t find any evidence that it was ever there and that’s really bothering me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone else have any idea of what I’m talking about? If it has been just me that saw it, I would let it go, but both of us watched the trailer about it and then we saved it, so I know I’m not crazy but I’m starting to feel like it.

       It's a maddening thought, that's for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a story for you (no joke): Me and a lady friend (at the time - lets call her - Sophia) some years ago streamed a movie online. We watched it, and thought it was a decent movie and continued on with our lives (like so many times before).
      </p>
      <p>
       I shit you not, ~2 years later (or so), I was just chilling, bored as all hell on a winter's night, looking online for a movie to watch, and I saw the movie. Only this time, it was just being "released" and not available for sometime. I instantly froze. How the hell was that possible? I already saw this movie? I remember me and Sophia curling up in bed watching it together.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was on or around 2012. Something majorly fucky happened that year in the Cosmos and in our collective consciousness. I call it the Great Awakening/Unveiling, others call it a shift in reality (blurring/crossing between two parallel universes). Whatever it is, it's maddening to contemplate.

       Movie studios do this a lot for titled they want to re-launch to get extra milage out of them. Look up the history around Edge of Tomorrow... They Renamed it and re-released it "Live.Die.Repeat" or something, and that was a big movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I saw that when I was overseas and saw that it was "just coming out" when I came home... Threw me for a loop. Stuff like that happens all the time with movies as the ownership gets shuffled around and the new owner wants to get more milage out of their new property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also could have been a remake like inglorious basterds (I accidentally bought the 1960s version by mistake once) or a TV show or something (like Fargo).

       If it wasn't a legit streaming site, there could be very mundane explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes movies go unreleased even though they're finished, or incomplete films (pre-effects) are leaked and that leads to movies being out in the public before any official release.
      </p>
      <p>
       One case in point was the Bulletproof Monk movie. Got a bootleg DVD of it in China and I think it was released to theaters a year or two later.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a pretty terrible movie so I think the studio had sat on it or ended up reshooting/re-editing it, but I never bothered watching the legit releases. And the leaked/stolen version definitely was out for download or on bootlegs well before the official release.

       Most instances of the Mandela effect are actually caused by the Tipping Point or 100th monkey phenomenon. Once a certain percentage of the public knows something, suddenly everyone seems to know it. This includes incorrect memories of past events, which is how you get the Berenstein Bears, which sounds more like other common names than Berenstain Bears, which is what the books actually were called.

       Read Malcolm Gladwell's book on the Tipping Point. There is robust sociological evidence showing that large groups of people act in very predictable ways that can't be explained by conventional theories that everyone is a conscious, individual actor not influenced by the actions of others.

       That statement is a far cry from spooky action at a distance, or paranormal activity, as pertains to consciousness. Not that there's nothing there, I think there is valid evidence for paranormal activity in the realms of science but the tale that if enough monkeys learn to use a tool then all monkeys will share that knowledge is not valid.

       I really am not sure you're being honest here. I just gave you a pretty well-researched book conclusively demonstrating that this is not a nothingburger, and you just went back to your talking points about possible problems with a single study of the phenomenon. From a 1985 article in "The Skeptical Inquirer" and is not peer-reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book I referred you to has lots of evidence from several disciplines demonstrating that there are key saturation points for human knowledge where things suddenly shift.

       Not even...  Use that to explain how I know Proctor and Gamble as Proctor and Gamble, but it's now/always has been Procter and Gamble.  And hey it's not just my "bad memory", but apparently on dozens to hundreds of LEGAL PATENT DOCUMENTS their patent attorney's and the reviewers in the Patent Office all have bad memory too's....   or maybe it's freaky but it's real.   How can you explain this with your monkeys?

       It's not impossible that they did file their patent documents with a mispelling. It's also possible that this was based on shared consciousness effects causing the lawyers to think it was Procter and Gamble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or it could be some totally unexplained phenomenon.

       No the documents are Proctor and Gamble (the way it's "remembered); the actual company's name is Procter and Gamble.
       <br/>
       You are saying that they filed hundreds of legal patent documents with the name of the legal patent holder misspelled (coincidentally spelled the way that many "remember" it always being)... and they they continued misspelling the name of the company across decades, even as the patent system changed?  Each patent document represents a large amount of time and work from many people.  They are binding and an integral part of IP.

       Yes, well you just tell that to all the bookstore people who regularly ordered and stocked what they always thought were the Berenstein Bear books in the children's sections of their stores for years and recommended them to customers or junior grade schoolteachers that read them year after year to their classes until one fine day they simply weren't Berenstein anymore but Berenstain, instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also more than just a little bit passing strange is that the only people called Berenstain at this point in time are the authors of the books and their kids who have no other Berenstain relatives or genealogy while there countless Berensteins who all very much do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also more than passing strange are the number of library boards and library catalogs and their recommended reading lists for primary grade teachers whose listings have gotten completely muddled in ways that would make any librarian worth their salt,(and they all of course are), cringe and jaw-drop like it's the end of the world as we know it with Berenstein books authored by the Berenstains, and Barenstain books authored by the Berensteins and every combination thereof replete with their international book numbers one right after the other in very plain sight that only God knows how many times have been looked-up without a single soul ever noticing or mentioning that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enough to say that something's just not right here... but only the devil knows what it is.

       I think you may be missing my point here. I'm not saying that this didn't happen. I'm saying it absolutely did happen, and I'm giving you an explanation that makes sense. Through the meme magic of "common knowledge" those people really do remember Berenstein bears, just as people really do remember Nelson Mandela dying in the 1980s.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think it's some other phenomenon, I'd love to hear what it is and what evidence supports. I'm just giving you a phenomenon that is confirmed to be real and fits the observations of those experiencing the Mandela Effect.

       Speaking of the Mandela Effect, does anyone else remember Edward Norton as "Edward Norton, Jr."? I watched so many of his movies back in high school and I distinctly remember Jr. always being part of his name.

       Avoid that place like the plague, if you want real discussion, but if you want evidence it’s real, the equation seems to be the heavier the trolling and downvotes the more likely it’s a real change (mandela effect)

       I’m honestly not sure how long it was there. We only noticed it a couple days ago so I assumed it would still be there, especially since I added it to my list.

       The documentary probably disappeared because the agreement between Netflix and the studio that sponsored it was terminated, you just mistaken the release date (we're fifteen days into 2018, after all), or it was taken down to correct the metadata (like inaccurate release dates and/or descriptions). Maybe it was a combination of the three.

       Next time post it to reddit immediately, with a clear picture. Too many people come here with ridiculous claims, no evidence, and then get lots of followers. We have 4k cameras in our pockets, that can upload to multiple cloud services almost immediately, or save it to an SD card and immediately remove it from the phone. There's no way someone can wirelessly delete a MicroSD card that's not in your phone at this point.

       If Snowden can get classified documents out of DC, and Seth Rich can do it again, surely you can get a picture uploaded to the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you don't trust Reddit, imgur or YT because of whatever reason, there are plenty of alternative image hosts, message boards, and video hosts. If Disney can't take a movie down on Pornhub, why would you think the gov't can.

       It's not impossible that they did file their patent documents with a mispelling. It's also possible that this was based on shared consciousness effects causing the lawyers to think it was Procter and Gamble.

       Or it could be some totally unexplained phenomenon.
