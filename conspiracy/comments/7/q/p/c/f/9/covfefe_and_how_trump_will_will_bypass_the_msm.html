       Im sure many of you have wondered about covfefe, if it indeed was just a mistake or another one of trumps chess plays, and it looks like its the latter boys.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2884">
        H.R.2886 Covfefe act
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This bill was introduced early december, and will still have to pass House and senate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically For Engagement, COVFEFE
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: there is one thing, and that is that every co sponsor is a democrat, that is pretty wierd, but if you read the Bill to me at least it looks to be working in favor of President Trump. My take is that they cling to the hope of him saying something really bad on record and in turn use it against him, luckily trump knows exactly what he can and cannot say
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: there is a lot about this bill we don’t know about, but I suggest everyone that find this even remotely interesting read the whole comment section, just to get your own perspective on things! I’m certain when I wake up tomorrow this thread will be as toxic as it possible could be, but try and keep it civil guys! I’m out for the night

       The desired end result is that if trump doesn’t want this bill, there is almost no chance in hell it will ever pass, and the dems have just made fools of themselfs again. I for one think he will welcome this bill, as a ultimate fuck you, and start to deliver daily briefings directly to the people without being filtered through MSM. Everything is just speculations so far, only time will tell! Interesting no matter what, don’t you think??

       He could do that if he wanted, but he doesn't. The major filtering that happens at those briefings is the president's press sec filtering out what the president said for what the actual policy will be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he doesn't own the press Corp, they are reporters for media outlets, not his staff.

       I could be down with that. Say what you want about the stupid shit he says, I still like the fact that the president has a direct line of communication with millions of people for the first time ever. I could see plenty of reasons why TPTB would not want that to be a thing, as the system that's been put in place hasn't really accounted for that level of control yet.

       Beats me. Very likely this is a mock by the democrats, naming a bill after his typo, but it looks like a bill that could easily be used for good, cause he can create a way to directly communicate with the people without going through official channels. My take is that they hope he will say something on the record that will in turn nail him to the cross, but I’m pretty sure he knows exactly what he can and cannot say

       It means they will try and make trump say something on the record, be that on Twitter or any other social media platform that will nail him to the cross. But it also creates a way for him to directly engage with the people in a official capacity that’s never been seen before, and that could be good. Transparency is something we need these days
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: that’s only my take on it, but it’s still early. I just found out about it an hour ago, will probably be weeks until we get some type of official statement on this, and until that all we can do is speculate.

       It's to make his tweets considered of presidential record. When it's considered presidential record it needs to be taken more seriously. They're proposing it, naming it covfefe in a jab at Trump, in an effort to include the definition of social media into the definition of "the president's 'documentary material'".

       I’m positive that it’s a mock by the dems, only I also see this as a great transparency tool, and whatever the case, that is much needed today! Trump can essentially fire the press corps and deliver his statements directly to the people. It’ll backfire on them, I’m certain of it!

       If you had bothered, you will see I’ve already given my take on just that! Read the whole thread again, and don’t be so judgemental. This is conspiracy, and we know about squat shit about this so far. Give it time, for now just speculate, and laugh at the amazing timeline where dems are so unhinged that they would go about their way to make a bill after a typo

       The bill still makes a point. Trump shouldn't be shitposting on Twitter when he's president of the country. If it was illegal for him to delete his tweets then maybe he wouldn't be shitposting from his toilet at three in the morning.

       Of course they are mocking him with the name, I don’t think he cares. If anything he likes shit named after him anyways, so now he has a billed named after his typo. He probably gets a good chuckle out of how easily they get ruffled by his tweets. It’s pretty funny to me.
      </p>

       But I think he will use it to his benefit. Now his words can go directly to the people with out inferred meaning by the press.

       This bill gives him a reason to drop the press entirely, and speak directly to the people. Imagine the outrage from the media then! In the Covfefe tweet, he was talking about the press, also, i find that somewhat wierd but that could just be a wierd coincidence.

       I’m not really saying it will help him absolutely, that’s certainly not the intention of the bill. they want to keep him from deleting, as they should. But I do think he will use it as a means to have direct contact with the people kind of like he already does but now it will be a matter of record.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who knows, it could hurt him as well. Just speculation on my part is all. You’re free to disagree.

       Oh I just saw you already got a pretty similar reply. But that is the essential, if it becomes law, he could in turn just fire the entire White House press corps, and give every news from the white house himself. He isn’t doing so today, what’s said on twitter, and what comes out in the daily briefings cant compare, he only tweets a traction of what is really going on. Now he could make it so every briefing comes directly from the White House, not filtered through main stream media

       He can't fire them because they don't work for him. I suppose he could ban them from the White House. Yeah, stop having them cover him at all because sure, a president blocking the press is a totally normal thing to do and not crazy at all.

       Basically it protects his tweets as a "Presidential" form of communication, same as a State of the Union address.  For instance, whoever took down his Twitter for that day as he left his job at Twitter could be facing serious charges, if he had done it after this bill goes into effect.

       The thing is it can be seen from both angles.  He probably knew about this bill which may have been in talks for at least a month before the tweet "dropped".   But also, it could have been a typo.  Do we really know?

       The bill was clearly a response to the tweet and they fit the acronym to the typo. First of all, Trump can't tell the future. Second of all, the bill isn't going to pass anyway. It would make it illegal for him to delete tweets. The bill is just a response to him being a dumb ass on Twitter. There is no interesting strategy here. It's just democrats making fun of Trump for being an idiot on Twitter.

       I always thought the tweet wasnt only a typo but an incomplete sentence.  I never thought of the word everyone claimed was "coverage" as being an acronym.  If looking at it with that lens, and that these bills are not known to the public immediately, then the other thing is a possibility as well.  Less likely.  Then it's basically saying despite how the press shits on me and my social media, they present you COVFEFE.

       Your take begs the question. First you said he was 4D Chess because it came out later on, then your "take" in response to it actually being a troll by the democrats (and not your first take) was some cockamamie plot of his to unseat the press corps (whom you do not seem to know don't work for him, likely a misunderstanding shared by Drumpf.)
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what happens you're going to believe he had a special plan that lead to this all along, like he was Bobby Fisher dismantling Spassky. It's always some grand scheme that we won't know about until it hits, and yet it never hits.

       This was enacted about a month after the tweet, right?  Wondering if he'd have known before hand.  But true.  It can be seen from that lens as well for sure.

       Yes. But it’s wierd, in his tweet, the covfefe, he was talking about the press, and this bill could essentially make him just circumvent the press and speak directly to the people. It’s seems connected. No matter what, I think it’s pretty funny, and I think trump will welcome this bill

       This isn't "one of trumps chess plays". It was introduced after his typo. This is just him trying to act like it was the plan all along, even though people who think for themselves know that it wasn't. He's just an idiot, stop acting like he's anything other than another puppet like Obama.

       Hahah don’t be so sore, was a hasty post, read my other reply’s here! Frankly, I don’t care, the dems just made every trump supporters day with this bill.. as another great redditors pointed out, covfefe forever etched in stone, how funny isnt that. Seeing as you see him as a puppet there is most likely no way for us to find some middle ground, but you take it as you like, everything is just speculation thus far! Have a good day!

       Thats true! The guy who introduced it have have had another similar bill trying to take a jab at trump, but i see this one backfiring on them. And if not, the bill will just die, and covfefe will forever live on in our memories which is just as fun haha. Time will tell!

        I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!

      <p>
       — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2017
      </p>
      <p>
       there's this one. Which they later said he didn't write.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/4/16730290/trump-tweet-obstruction-justice">
         The issue here
        </a>
        is Trump’s apparent admission that he fired Flynn in part because he “lied to” the FBI — something Trump has not said in the past. Lying to the FBI is a crime, so if Trump knew Flynn had done that before firing him, that would suggest he knew Flynn committed a crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        And if Trump knew Flynn committed a crime, his subsequent urgings to then-FBI Director James Comey to “let” the Flynn investigation “go” look even more like obstruction of justice than they already did.
       </p>
       <p>
        So it’s not surprising that soon enough, Trump’s legal team tried to clean up the mess — by claiming both that Trump didn’t even write the tweet and that the wording in it wasn’t quite right.
       </p>
       <p>
        But this attempted cleanup is only raising more questions about the murky circumstances behind Flynn’s actions during the transition, and his ultimate firing — and just what Donald Trump knew and when he knew it in each case.

       This bill
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       about Trump bypassing the mainstream media. It's about the things he says in tweets being considered as part of the official record. He has been weaseling around the official channels by using twitter and then claiming, when he does something like admitting to obstruction of justice, that it wasn't him that wrote the tweet. This law will make his tweets legally binding public record. It is a "chess play" but it's one made by the opposition.
