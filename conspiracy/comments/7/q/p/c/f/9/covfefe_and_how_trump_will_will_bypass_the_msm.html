<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2884">H.R.2886 Covfefe act</a></p>

<p>This bill was introduced early december, and will still have to pass House and senate.</p>

<p>Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically For Engagement, COVFEFE</p>

<p>Edit: there is one thing, and that is that every co sponsor is a democrat, that is pretty wierd, but if you read the Bill to me at least it looks to be working in favor of President Trump. My take is that they cling to the hope of him saying something really bad on record and in turn use it against him, luckily trump knows exactly what he can and cannot say</p>

<p>Edit: there is a lot about this bill we don’t know about, but I suggest everyone that find this even remotely interesting read the whole comment section, just to get your own perspective on things! I’m certain when I wake up tomorrow this thread will be as toxic as it possible could be, but try and keep it civil guys! I’m out for the night</p>

<p>I could be down with that. Say what you want about the stupid shit he says, I still like the fact that the president has a direct line of communication with millions of people for the first time ever. I could see plenty of reasons why TPTB would not want that to be a thing, as the system that&#39;s been put in place hasn&#39;t really accounted for that level of control yet.</p>

<p>&quot;Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically For Engagement Act of 2017 or the COVFEFE Act of 2017</p>

<p>This bill amends provisions governing presidential records to: (1) revise the definition of &quot;documentary material&quot; to include social media; (2) revise the definition of &quot;presidential records&quot; to include any personal and official social media account; and (3) define &quot;social media&quot; as any form of electronic communication (such as a website for social networking and microblogging) through which users create an online community to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It means they will try and make trump say something on the record, be that on Twitter or any other social media platform that will nail him to the cross. But it also creates a way for him to directly engage with the people in a official capacity that’s never been seen before, and that could be good. Transparency is something we need these days</p>

<p>Edit: that’s only my take on it, but it’s still early. I just found out about it an hour ago, will probably be weeks until we get some type of official statement on this, and until that all we can do is speculate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bill still makes a point. Trump shouldn&#39;t be shitposting on Twitter when he&#39;s president of the country. If it was illegal for him to delete his tweets then maybe he wouldn&#39;t be shitposting from his toilet at three in the morning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they are mocking him with the name, I don’t think he cares. If anything he likes shit named after him anyways, so now he has a billed named after his typo. He probably gets a good chuckle out of how easily they get ruffled by his tweets. It’s pretty funny to me. </p>

<p>But I think he will use it to his benefit. Now his words can go directly to the people with out inferred meaning by the press. </p>

But that is the essential, if it becomes law, he could in turn just fire the entire White House press corps, and give every news from the white house himself. He isn’t doing so today, what’s said on twitter, and what comes out in the daily briefings cant compare, he only tweets a traction of what is really going on. Now he could make it so every briefing comes directly from the White House, not filtered through main stream media</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t &quot;one of trumps chess plays&quot;. It was introduced after his typo.

    <div class="md"><p>Hahah don’t be so sore, was a hasty post, read my other reply’s here! Frankly, I don’t care, the dems just made every trump supporters day with this bill.. as another great redditors pointed out, covfefe forever etched in stone, how funny isnt that. Seeing as you see him as a puppet there is most likely no way for us to find some middle ground, but you take it as you like, everything is just speculation thus far! Have a good day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats true! The guy who introduced it have have had another similar bill trying to take a jab at trump, but i see this one backfiring on them. And if not, the bill will just die, and covfefe will forever live on in our memories which is just as fun haha. Time will tell!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2017  </p>

<p>there&#39;s this one. Which they later said he didn&#39;t write. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/4/16730290/trump-tweet-obstruction-justice">The issue here</a> is Trump’s apparent admission that he fired Flynn in part because he “lied to” the FBI — something Trump has not said in the past. Lying to the FBI is a crime, so if Trump knew Flynn had done that before firing him, that would suggest he knew Flynn committed a crime.</p>

<p>And if Trump knew Flynn committed a crime, his subsequent urgings to then-FBI Director James Comey to “let” the Flynn investigation “go” look even more like obstruction of justice than they already did.</p>

<p>So it’s not surprising that soon enough, Trump’s legal team tried to clean up the mess — by claiming both that Trump didn’t even write the tweet and that the wording in it wasn’t quite right.</p>

<p>But this attempted cleanup is only raising more questions about the murky circumstances behind Flynn’s actions during the transition, and his ultimate firing — and just what Donald Trump knew and when he knew it in each case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This bill <em>is</em> about Trump bypassing the mainstream media. It&#39;s about the things he says in tweets being considered as part of the official record. He has been weaseling around the official channels by using twitter and then claiming, when he does something like admitting to obstruction of justice, that it wasn&#39;t him that wrote the tweet. This law will make his tweets legally binding public record. It is a &quot;chess play&quot; but it&#39;s one made by the opposition.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. But it’s wierd, in his tweet, the covfefe, he was talking about the press, and this bill could essentially make him just circumvent the press and speak directly to the people. It’s seems connected. No matter what, I think it’s pretty funny, and I think trump will welcome this bill</p>
