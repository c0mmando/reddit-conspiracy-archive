        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I went on a bender and read all of Kerth Barker&#39;s books the other weekend. They were way too good to put down, and packed with insider Illuminati information. </p>

<p>Some background: Kerth Barker was going to be bred into the Satanic Elite and was used as a sex slave as a child. He would go to high level Satanist&#39;s homes where they would speak to him about their knowledge and the obsession with rare books. One day he had gone to a home of two sisters (who were incestuous lovers and heirs to a vast fortune). They explained to him that in one book they had in their library, it dates the Sphinx back to 50,000 years old. The sphinx was initially a large lions head, and was later turned into the smaller &quot;human-style&quot; head we see now. They stated that ancient Egyptians idolized the ferociousness of the lions, and their ability to be the killer of man. However, once man learned to hunt and use weapons, they themselves turned into the highest level on the food chain. It also symbolizes cannibalism, as the next Pharaoh would eat the brains of the previously deceased Pharaoh - making it more clear as to why they were obsessed with removing the brains from their mummies. They thought that knowledge was passed down this way. </p>

<p>Interesting hypothesis, and you can read more from his books on Kindle - they are free. I would say it is one of the best books I&#39;ve read in a long time, and literally could not put it down. It is EXACTLY the type of material I know all of you here would enjoy. </p>

<p>Book in discussion is, &quot;Cannibalism, Blood-drinking and High-Adept Satanism&quot; </p>

<p>What pisses me off recently is I saw how big the Vatican library is (photos only). They have 13 trillion dollars in their name, and the largest private library. They are degrading mankind and hiding our history. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not really a new take, tbh. The giant lion would&#39;ve been the age of Leo, whereas the giant dog (ie. Anubis) would&#39;ve been in the age of Sirius (ie. far older - 10k-100k). </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Indeed, and this is what people truly need to unite on, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ever see the documentary &quot;Sex Crimes and the Vatican&quot; - that shit is mind-blowing disturbing. </p>

<p>Manly P. Hall spoke about the pyramids being inductions into the mystery schools. Egypt was called &quot;Khem&quot; for the dark soil, thus coined the term dark occult. And such a gap in Jesus&#39; early childhood to adulthood - could have easily been in these mystery schools, learned their esoteric occulted knowledge, and came back to preach this to the masses and rise up against dogmatic religion/government/money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I have, and yes it was. </p>

<p>As for Jesus, yes, I am of the belief that Jesus was actually Caesarion (Son of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra), the rightful heir to the Roman Empire, who was taught in the mystery schools/occult of the East after he was sent there to avoid assassination. The missing timelines would match this well, also why he was so well received, and why the Romans killed him or tried to, with the help of the Khazars. </p>

<p>The one tidbit that blew my mind was the Fabian Therapy protocol (totally fucking different from normal therapy), the Incarnate of Susan the Poisoner and just the plethora of information on how fucking psychotic Satanists are, and how their demise will be because they turn on each other. </p>

<p>Mark Passio has been a hugely informative influence for me, and I respect him greatly. But I like his earlier work best, when he first rejected satanism and came out to help us. </p>

<p>In recent years, he&#39;s been getting angrier and angrier (not that I blame him in some ways) and tough to listen to. Does he spend a lot of DVD telling us how we&#39;re all falling down on the job and not helping humanity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it was eye opening for sure, but it actually plays off of his street-wise spirituality seminar and the natural law seminar. Kind of getting at how the dogmatic exoteric aspects of Christianity - ie eating kosher foods, dress, holy days were inundated by the roman government, and how true esoteric Christianity is about speaking out against slavery, government, money and organized religion. </p>

<p>All i know from watching the dude over the years is that he can talk, and he gets angry, but rightfully so. I&#39;m just the type of person that&#39;s open to all knowledge, and read a lot. I actually need to stop buying books. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not usually into the cannibalistic satanism stuff, but I love ancient Egypt and Illuminati stuff so thanks for the heads up!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry for the wall of text, but this is the best explanation of what really happened with the Illuminati that I have been able to find:</p>

<p>&quot;In the known history of mankind there have been two major revolutions against freemasonry. The first I covered a bit above, but let me go over the second for you because the methods, motivations, and such are very similar and you will be familiar with the details of the second.</p>

<p>So, the topic is the American revolutionary war. It is often said in conspiracy media and such that this was a fraud perpetrated on the masses by mystery babylon. Freemasons will boast about their role in the revolution and offer that as evidence that they are not such bad people, or that they give people the chance to be free who then squandered and therefore need / deserved to be ruled.</p>

<p>However, nothing could be further from the truth. The revolutionary war was an event where Christians infiltrated the freemasonic cabal in order to turn it against itself and make the revolution possible.</p>

<p>If you read a book like How the Nation Was Won by Lowry you&#39;ll find a mountain of evidence about how a very few families labored intensely to create the conditions that would allow the war to be successfully prosecuted. They retreated to the distant frontier to set up iron foundries that would fuel the war effort decades later. They were set upon over and over again by the crown, the secret societies, and literally did their work in hiding - out in the Appalachian hills, locations and purposes concealed, etc.</p>

<p>When the conditions were ripe for revolution, a psy-op was conducted against freemasonry that you now know as the &quot;Illuminati.&quot; The idea was simple: because freemasons operate under cloak and dagger, deception, and disinformation campaigns, you can insert one of your own into the order. So the psy-op was created as such: the freemasonic society is going to create a &quot;fake&quot; freedom for the masses in order to quell their growing rebellious nature, that the American revolution can be allowed to succeed because it is part of a larger plot towards tyranny. Furthermore, because freemasons are sworn to protect the lives of other freemasons, by inducting much of the revolutionary officer corp into the society you give them protection against assassination (temporarily, until the psy-op is unraveled) and allow the revolution to have a chance to succeed.</p>

<p>You can tell that is actually what happened because leaders of the revolution were killed later on. George Washington was murdered by his doctor. His kin, Meriwether Lewis (Martha Washington&#39;s family, which was the primary source of wealth that funded the revolution) was also assassinated and clearly by what we now know as Skull &amp; Bones (they took part of his skull as a trophy). These sorts of mopping up operations by the masonic cabal in the aftermath of the revolution show you that they realized they had been had by subversion within the ranks and were set out to kill those who had played tricks on them.</p>

<p>You can start to elucidate much about the characters involved in the revolution from that starting point. For example, Thomas Jefferson publicly shilled for the &quot;nothing amiss here&quot; version of Meriwether Lewis&#39;s death and proclaimed it a suicide. This, despite the unassailable forensic evidence to the contrary which was known to him: a large chunk of your skull cannot walk away from the scene of its own volition.</p>

<p>As time passes, the masonic cabal starts to shill publicly that the revolution was their idea all along. They promote the &quot;illuminati&quot; as a real society that is taking over the world (to this day) when in fact it was never more than a psy-op meant to make the revolution possible. So not only can you identify traitors like Thomas Jefferson through this information, you know that controlled opposition media that goes on and on about the &quot;illuminati&quot; are just freemasonic fronts.</p>

<p>In short, faced with a real revolution, the cabal is forced into a big coverup operation lest others get wind of the idea of challenging them. Many more would put to death at the hands of the cabal like the whistleblower Captain William Morgan and those who supported the anti-Masonic party in the wake of an assassination spree by the cabal against Americans in the early 19th century, endorsed by a president (Jefferson).</p>

<p>After the life of Jesus, very similar things happened. The freemasons create an alternative story, go on a murdering spree against the original revolutionaries, and seek to co-opt everything to their own purposes. Rumors abound in conspiracy circles about the original Jesus being a Rothschild plant way back in the day, because this is what they always do: destroy the idea that you can fight, that you can do right, and suck the hope out of mankind.</p>

<p>There is abundant hard, objective scientific evidence against their narrative even for the irreligious though like the fact that an Earthquake really did happen when Jesus was put upon the cross.</p>

<p>This sort of thing they hate the most, because the most carefully concealed secret in freemasonry (by the top of the food chain from their foot soldiers) is that God is real and they will fail.&quot;</p>
