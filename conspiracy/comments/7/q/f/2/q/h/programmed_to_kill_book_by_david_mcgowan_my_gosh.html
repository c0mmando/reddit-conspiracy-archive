        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong><em>While reading McGowan&#39;s book &quot;Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon: Laurel Canyon, Covert Ops &amp; the Dark Heart of the Hippie Dream,&quot; I came across today Donald Hunt&#39;s Amazon review of one of McGowan&#39;s other books called &quot;Programmed to Kill: The Politics of Serial Murder.&quot;  Hunt&#39;s review is found below.  It&#39;s chilling.</em></strong>  </p>

<p>Programmed to Kill: The Politics of Serial Murder, by David McGowan (New York: iUniverse, Inc., 2004) is not just another sensationalized book about serial killers. McGowan, author of <em>Derailing Democracy: The America the Media Don&#39;t Want You to See,</em> and <em>Understanding the F-Word: American Fascism and the Politics of Illusion,</em> ties serial murders, programmed assassins, satanic cults and child pornography and prostitution to a fascist political and military conspiracy of frightening scope.</p>

<p>I normally hate reading about this type of material. Too sickening. But McGowan, unlike most authors who treat this stuff, is not interested in sensationalized accounts that appeal to dark prurient interests. Rather, he wants to sound the alarm about the real methods used in fascist takeovers of societies.</p>

<p>McGowan begins by reviewing the evidence for government sponsored mind control experiments dating back to the Nazis and the OSS (forerunner of the CIA). According to McGowan, these shadowy intelligence agencies, along with the military intelligence units, founded, encouraged, and covered up for Satanic cults, whose systematic abuse of children from very young ages provided a contnuing supply of potential mind-controlled programmed assassins. They supplied not only assassins but also child prostitutes, pornography subects and even sacrificial victims. The more susceptible to dissociated states, the easier to program. Mind control in this context refers to &quot;the process of first enhancing an unwitting subject&#39;s natural ability to dissociate (creating, in essence, the condition of Multiple Personality Disorder), and then controlling that subject&#39;s dissociative states (by creating one or more alter personalities that are effectively under the control of others, and that are unknown to the `core&#39; personality).&quot; (p. xv)</p>

<p>Part I of the book is titled &quot;The Pedophocracy.&quot; Here McGowan takes the reader on a tour of child sex, child porn and child murder rings around the world whose members include many high-ranking political figures. One of the things that tie all these scandals together is the cover-up of participants, destruction of evidence, and lenient sentences to those who have to take the fall by authorities around the world. From the Marc Dutroux scandal in Belgium, to one in Latvia involving the Prime Minister and Justice Minister, to another in Portugal, to the scandal in the United Kingdom that reportedly reached into Tony Blair&#39;s cabinet, to those of Larry King, Michael Aquino and Craig Spence in the United States with many circumstantial connections to high-ranking political and media figures, McGowan shows how the damage control operations, including numerous &quot;suicides&quot; by potential witnesses, work.</p>

<p>McGowan then details the CIA connections of some of the Satanic groups that have been linked to ritual abuse and killing of children, in particular the Finders, described in an article in the Washington Post from 1987 as &quot;a 1960&#39;s style commune ... described in a court document as a &#39;cult&#39; that allegedly conducted &#39;brainwashing&#39; and used children in rituals (p. 59). After some members of the group were arrested for possible kidnapping when found in the possession of several children who they were keeping in a van and who showed signs of neglect, abuse and sexual abuse, homes and warehouses belonging to group members were searched. U.S. Customs found &quot;photos showing children involved in bloodletting ceremonies of animals and one photograph of a child in chains&quot; (pp. 59-60). While memos written by one of the U.S. Customs investigators detailed evidence of much worse actions, nothing was written in the press about the matter until seven years later when the US News and World Report attempted to put it to rest by downplaying the accusations as &quot;rumors&quot; even though they were in the possession of the memos.</p>

<p>McGowan goes on to note that &quot;the firm that supplied training to CIA officers didn&#39;t just employ several members of the Finders, but appears to have in fact been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Finders organization. It should also be noted that the CIA does not, as a general rule-of-thumb, assign the training of its officers to outside contractors, unless, that is, the `private&#39; firm utilized in such a capacity is a CIA front.&quot; (p. 61) The leader of the Finders group, Marion Pettie, in a 1998 interview explained that &quot;Going back to World War II, I kept open house mainly to intelligence people in Washington. OSS people passing through, things like that.&quot; (p. 65) Regarding evidence found regarding international trafficking of children, the US Custom Service investigator in his memo stated that he was advised by a member of the Washington D.C. police that &quot;the investigation into the activity of the Finders had become a CIA internal matter. The MPD [D.C. police] report has been classified SECRET and was not available for review.&quot; (p. 66). No one was indicted.</p>

<p>McGowan concludes Part I by suggesting that &quot;it is certainly in the realm of possibility that the high profile child pornography raids in recent years, which invariably result in relatively few arrests and even fewer prosecutions and convictions, are not intended to punish the victimizers, but to identify and compromise them. And it is not inconceivable that the databases being compiled will be utilized as something of a recruitment list to identify those persons who have been `preconditioned,&#39; so to speak, for future mind control operations.&quot; (p. 68)</p>

<p><strong>McGowan begins Part II with the story of Henry Lee Lucas, a serial killer who confessed to nearly 600 murders, committed &quot;rape, torture, mutilation, dismemberment, necrophilia, cannibalism and pedophilia&quot; (p. 71) and who, oddly enough, was the only death-row inmate in the State of Texas spared death by Governor George Bush. McGowan suggests the reason for this and other odd leniencies enjoyed by Lucas lies in the possibility that he was an MK-Ultra programmed assassin [My Note: Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein for the 21st Century]</strong></p>

<p><strong>By perpetuating the myth of the lone serial killer, authorities can deflect attention away from organized groups, cults or INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. [Emphasis added.] McGowan shows that in nearly all cases, the serial killers most likely had accomplices. The close ties of serial killers, child pimps and pornographers to people in position of authority in politics and law enforcement has also been covered up. Lucas himself is quoted as saying: &quot;No one wants to believe the cult story. The TV people cut it out. The writers don&#39;t write about it.&quot; (p. 88)</strong></p>

<p>Part III looks at some recent scandals as well as historical precedents from the past. Along the way we get a lucid exposition of why the parents of Jon-Benet Ramsey probably killed her and why Charles Lindbergh probably killed his &quot;kidnapped&quot; son.</p>

<p>McGowan concludes that the wave of sensationalized serial killings beginning around 1966 were a domestication of Operation Phoenix, the U.S. program of mass political assassination in Vietnam. The goal was to shock and frighten the public into acceptance of police state measures in the United States and to create a climate of right-wing reaction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. The evidence is out there for anyone who cares to look deep enough. And the CIA is small potatoes compared to what military intelligence agencies are up to. Something like 50 percent of their budget is spent on private contractors. I&#39;d dare say the CIA is a smokescreen and a distraction most of the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish you hadn&#39;t mentioned the &quot;moon&quot; word :-)  Last night I read his first 2 online chapters about the moon landing; I&#39;ll read more later.  I don&#39;t understand why he and the bristling smart Jim Fetzer step into credibility quicksand when they question the moon landings.  Can it be chalked up to a bit of  scientific naivete, a small chink in their knowledge and understanding of things astronomical, or a desire to create more publicity and traffic?  I just don&#39;t know, because much of their other research like Fetzer&#39;s examination of anti-Iraq War Senator Paul Wellstone&#39;s demise is very convincing and firmly planted within the realm of reality.  I&#39;d love to hear others&#39; reaction to this lunar head-scratcher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the stuff on the moon landing. Some of the best stuff out there. I´m obviously not going to be able to convince you that it was a hoax right here and now, but if you have an open mind, Dave´s stuff is a great place to start. And the best part is, he doesn´t rehash a lot of the same stuff we´ve all heard before. He makes new and very convincing cases. Give it a try.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read this book recently, oddly enough, and found it unsatisfying.</p>

<p>McGowan had plainly done a lot of reading, and he uncovered some interesting connections and put some familiar facts in a whole new light. </p>

<p>What he didn&#39;t do, to my way of thinking, was substantiate the bold claim made by his title. There&#39;s a lot of innuendo and nudge-nudge suggestions that the CIA was behind it all, but McGowan never delivers the goods, or anything like the goods.</p>

<p>A hugely intriguing and stimulating read, but in no way a satisfying one. That said, his bibliography alone justifies the cover-price because it contains so many pointers to little-known sources (thanks to him, I have Maury Terry&#39;s <em>The Ultimate Evil</em> sitting temptingly in my to-read pile right now). </p>

<p>I think McGowan&#39;s full text is at archive.org if anyone wants to check it out for the first time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to shit too hard on Maury Terry&#39;s informative book, but Peter Levenda, in one of his &quot;Sinister Forces&quot; books, points out that Terry went to high school and was at least friendly acquaintances with one of the alleged accomplishes of &quot;Son of Sam&quot; serial killer David Berkowitz.

    <div class="md"><p>Fair point that McGowan didn&#39;t find any direct proof of the serial killers being mind controlled, though I can barely imagine how hard it would be to get that kind of smoking-gun evidence from what would be (if it exists) a covert intelligence operation whose records are largely destroyed or never committed to paper in the first place. What his book primarily offers are inexplicable irregularities in how the justice system functioned -- which is rather telling, as a cover-up tends to indicate <em>some</em> crime has occurred -- and valuable leads for a dedicated investigate journalist to follow up on.</p>
