<p>NESARA: &quot;draining the swamp&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I posted this on your last thread about this. </p>

<p>&quot;Draining the Swamp&quot; is not even a 1990s phrase, when the book came out.</p>

<p>The phrase first became popular in 1983 when President Ronald Reagan said he was in Washington &quot;to drain the swamp,&quot; a reference to limiting the reach and growth of government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is one I can think of - QANON.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a tale of a newly appointed president carrying out a counter coup against a deep state that is out to derail his attempts to change anything.</p>

<p>He is winning bigly because he has the backing of the US miltary and will soon bring to justice all of the bad players who have been looting and corrupting the world for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MegaAnon is telling a similar tale that Trump is genuinely trying to drain the swamp. She (MegaAnon is a woman) is predicting that in 6 months to a year we will be living in a completely different world. There are not going to be any big arrests but very slowly the swamp will be drained after a series of sex scandals and resignations will continue throughout the year. Everyone who was part of the swamp will eventually be forced to resign. </p>

<p>Part of me thinks it is psyop though to put 4chan to sleep. She tells them everything is being taken care of and not worry. The message is positive change is coming and is a work in progress behind the scenes. In reality nothing is changing. It is one of those I will believe it when I see it kind of things. In the meantime conspiracy theorists should keep fighting to expose the deep state. The swamp is not going to drain itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to say this same thing: The Q narrative is a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that good guys behind the scene are working to save the country. It&#39;s such a beautiful narrative that Catherine Austin Fitts said it was the antidote to Alex Jones-ian &quot;fear porn&quot;. But she said to be on guard, because it might be &quot;hope porn&quot;. Or, as she called it, &quot;Hopium&quot;. </p>

<p>Thought that was a brilliant term.</p>

<p>Benjamin Fulford&#39;s &quot;White Dragon&quot; narrative is also a positive conspiracy theory: That elements within China are fighting the Rothschild grid and seeking to bring it down. </p>

n.  An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act.
n.  A group of conspirators.
n.  Law An agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime or accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action.</p>

<p>You&#39;d need a new word for &quot;good conspiracy&quot;</p>

<p>But yeah people think aliens are going to save the world.<br/>
People think donald trump is going to save the world.<br/>
People think hallucinogens are going to save the world.<br/>
People think Jesus is going to save the world.</p>

<p>Those would be considered good conspiracies i guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even by your definition of conspiracy it&#39;s possible for a group of people working for good to engage in illegal or subversive acts.  If your country is run by a dictator, everything you do to resist him will be illegal or subversive but still can be judged as good or positive.</p>

<p>I think in America people have historically seen the US as an inherently &quot;good&quot; place that was always under threat of corruption by schemers who wanted to become tyrants or manipulate the democratic process behind the scenes to run the system.  I think this has led most conspiracies to be judged as evil or negative forces.</p>

<p>I wonder if in other countries that have long struggled against despotic governments if they judge conspiracies more neutrally, as being either good or bad depending on whether the goal was undermining the regime or enhancing it. </p>

<p>What would one say this means for someone in a subjective observational experience? Why if this is possible is this something we would want to seek to do? I&#39;m always curious when I see these ideas but haven&#39;t seen any applicable reason to further explore them, not that one that is strictly applicable is explicitly required for me to do so.

    <div class="md"><p>The word conspiracy means &quot;a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.&quot; This is why the things discussed here are so negative, we&#39;re discussing people who get together to do harmful and illegal things. If they were doing good shit, we wouldn&#39;t be talking about it here. </p>

<p>If you want a &quot;good&quot; angle, you could look at the progress that victims to these conspiracies have gained. Consider the victims of conspiracies, those who actively fight back against them. For example, Chelsea Manning leaked cables to Wikileaks that exposed that the Bush administration was doing war crimes in Iraq. She was persecuted for her whistleblowing and was tortured in prison for years. That&#39;s the conspiracy, but on the other hand, pressure from activists got Obama to commute her sentence. Not exactly a pardon, but she​ was released early and she&#39;s free now. That&#39;s good. And now, she&#39;s running for the Senate in Maryland. That&#39;s great. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Off the top of my head?</p>

<p>JFK was possibly killed by his own Secrete Service. The night before they were up all night drinking and partying with hookers. The next day they all felt like crap and were tired.</p>

<p>They then got the new guy (Agent George Hickey) who was originally just the driver of the secrete service security car behind Kennedy&#39;s to man the only AR-15 being carried that day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conducting his own investigation, Donahue eventually decided that the bullet that struck Kennedy in the head had in fact been fired by United States Secret Service Special Agent George Warren Hickey Jr. (March 24, 1923 to February 25, 2005) from an AR-15 rifle carried in the car immediately following the President&#39;s vehicle. The series of events is as follows: After the first shot which hit the street was fired, Hickey turns completely around and acquires Oswald on the sixth floor of the school book depository building. His turned head is documented in an AP photograph by James Altgens. Hickey reaches for the AR-15 under the seat, releases the safety and begins to lift the gun. The second shot is fired by Oswald, hitting the president and Texas Governor John Connally. The president&#39;s car and the follow-up car containing Hickey suddenly speed up. This is attested to by Secret Service agent Clint Hill. Agent Hickey, who is unstable because he is standing on the cushion of the seat, rather than the floor of the car, begins to fall back due to the acceleration of the vehicle, pulling the trigger of the AR-15. The gun is pointed toward Kennedy at that instant, and the bullet strikes him squarely in the back of the head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since a common theme on conspiracy theories is to bring (perceived) order into (perceived) chaos, to give reason to things that seem unreasonable, there seems to be a natural tendency to go into a rather dystopian direction with them. Negativity bias and stuff...</p>

<p>Traffic example:
Would you rather rant and theorise about why on your daily traffic route the green wave changed to randomness, or how the randomness suddenly got changed to a smooth green wave?
And how long would each scenario stay in your head? :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  The Earth is flat and &quot;outer space&quot; is being faked by all the world&#39;s space agencies.  The word is run by a cabal of secret societies that worship Lucifer at the top.  This means that the great deceiver is indeed real but so is God.  God is Jesus Christ who died for our sins and did all the work for us.  Just repent and believe this and you can be saved and have eternal life (and much more)</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>That has to be the best news that comes out of a conspiracy there is!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re in a holy war that&#39;s been going on since the beginning of time. Good Vs Evil. It&#39;s a fight that&#39;s as much a part of who we are as the air in our lungs. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the good news? What&#39;s the Good conspiracy? </p>

<p>Our minds are the most powerful machines in the universe - We can cure our ailments, communicate, even change the world. Just with the power of our minds. </p>

<p>Why do so many religions bless their food? The spoken word with the power of the mind can actually make that food better for you to eat. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard of people lowering the crime rate and even purifying water with their will. </p>

<p>You just gotta understand one basic concept. </p>

<p>Everything is energy, everything is connected, everything is God, God is everything. We live in a consciousness. Whose consciousness? The one that spoke the universe into existence.</p>

<p>A good analogy might be &quot;The Force.&quot; </p>

<p>A good mantra might be &quot;I&#39;m one with the force, the force is with me&quot; </p>

<p>You know - if you&#39;re able to read between the lines a bit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because most of the time, the things that global elites don&#39;t want the public to know, are usually for nefarious and selfish reasons. This isn&#39;t a place for fun fiction or convient truths, it&#39;s a place to gather as much information as you can, and shave it down to powerful knowledge that you can use to hopefully protect yourself.
