    <div class="md"><p>Iirc, a lot of people were under the impression he fell too far into his role as the joker and that’s what ultimately led to his death as a result of his mental state declining as well. He definitely got into character, there’s plenty of info on how he locked himself in a hotel room for extended periods of time (days/weeks) to better get into the mindset to play a manic character. 
Then again, if there was something being covered up that does seem like a perfect fit explanation wise that’s not only believable but tragic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is strange how the masseuse called Mary-Kate instead of 911.</p>

<p>Mary-Kate’s reaction of calling her private security guards instead of 911 is even more strange given her connection with Heath.</p>

<p>Taking a half hour before calling 911 is very fishy.</p>

<p>I thought an argument could have maybe been made that the security guards could help faster but it took them about a half hour to get there too.</p>

<p>Those phone calls seem very suspicious to me.  The police not looking into the phone calls makes me wonder if it was a coverup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The article didn’t mention them living next door to one another.  That would make it all the more suspicious.  If they were both drug addicts, maybe he OD’ed and she didn’t want to get associated, hence the coverup.</p>

<p>The article did say Mary-Kate was in California at the time so unless that is false, it seems that they were not near each other at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow my bad. They didn’t live next to one another. Just a rumor from that time. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.accessonline.com/articles/mary-kate-olsens-connection-to-heath-ledger-death-revealed-62192/">http://www.accessonline.com/articles/mary-kate-olsens-connection-to-heath-ledger-death-revealed-62192/</a></p>

<p>That being said I’ve been in a room when someone od’d. If there are drugs around you still try and cover shit up. I just think people panicked because heath was blowing up at the time. He was separated from his wife and child. Probably depressed. Probably had some voices in his head. Probably saw some shit with how he came into Hollywood. But I don’t really see any suspicious behavior I guess. </p>

<p>But I am no detective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is probably more likely that both Mary-Kate and Heath were addicts together and their collective staff of assistants and whatever knew it. </p>

<p>You have to get inside the head of a person working for a celebrity. Many of these people have big Hollywood ambitions themselves. They don&#39;t want to piss off their super powerful boss who could help catapult their career in the future. </p>

<p>The same goes for someone who is giving you your twice weekly massage. Even they want to make sure that their huge meal ticket is covered so if he is all passed out looking fucked up (<em>which probably wasn&#39;t uncommon</em>) you&#39;d probably call his Hollywood girlfriend up to figure out what private doctor you have come by to stick some drugs into his arms to wake him back up for 10th time in the past 3 months.</p>
