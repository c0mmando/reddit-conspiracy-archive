    <div class="md"><p>No, they&#39;ve never given me the wrong product. They&#39;ve never done me wrong by giving me a fake item or failing to deliver. I don&#39;t consider shipping delays to be &quot;doing me wrong&quot; because that&#39;s usually on the shipping co, and even then if I have to wait one day longer for my item I got free two day shipping on whatever. This is also a rarity, but unavoidable over 10 years of purchasing things online. </p>

<p>And then they give me another month of Prime, so I get even more free two day shipping. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t see your username last night, so I&#39;m not going to continue justifying myself, but I would still like to know what you consider a &quot;more ethical&quot; online retailer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bought some New Balance shoes from Amazon a couple of years ago.  I frequently travel to China and am very familiar with knockoffs available there.  As soon as I received the shoes I could tell they were knockoffs.  They felt way too lightweight. And, the first time I put them on and pulled on the tongue of one of the shoes, it came right off.  I reported it to Amazon as a fake and reported it to New Balance.  I never heard a word back from either one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can explain exactly what&#39;s happening.  It&#39;s kinda Amazon&#39;s fault for creating the system that allows this, but they actually are very hardline about counterfeit stuff.   </p>

<p>Basically, Amazon has become the world&#39;s largest consignment shop.  I don&#39;t know the numbers, but a large % of purchases you make, you&#39;re not buying it from Amazon.    The % goes up to almost 100% it&#39;s not from Amazon if you ever click on &quot;see all offers &quot; or &quot;see all buying choices&quot;.  </p>

<p>Basically Amazon allows people to stock their shelves for them.  They have thousands and thousands and THOUSANDS of &quot;independent contractors&quot; that source the merchandise, package it, and mail it to Amazon warehouses.  Amazon then checks the item into their shelves and holds onto the stuff until you buy it.   Again, don&#39;t know the numbers, but people are willing to pay more to get items on 2 day shipping.   </p>

<p>The seller COULD sell it on the Amazon site as a listing, and ship it themselves, but that&#39;s when you see the 2 day shipping option isn&#39;t available.   When the item sells, Amazon takes a %, then a separate fee if it was shipped to Amazon first and gives the money to the &quot;independent contractor&quot;.   </p>

<p>So this is where the counterfeit comes in.  When these contractors send in the merchandise to Amazon, Amazon doesn&#39;t go through and check the contents to make sure everything is correct.   In fact, the contractors are supposed to have it nicely neatly packaged so when it sells Amazon can just grab it off the shelf, throw it in a box and ship it, easy peasy.    Or you bought it without 2 day shipping, and Amazon never even touched the item at all and the contractor mailed it himself.</p>

<p>So sometimes, you will have shady people who say they are sending in an item, Amazon marks it as having received it, and you get the shoddy item.  I would imagine they are banking on most people not being able to tell the difference?  </p>

<p>So yes, bad Amazon, because they don&#39;t check it up front.  My theory is they&#39;ve done the math and paying a few counterfeit refunds to customers, and then very quickly shutting down that contractor&#39;s selling account is more cost effective than checking every single item that comes into their warehouse to make sure it&#39;s complete/correct/and legitimate.  </p>

<p>From what I understand, it&#39;s VERY easy to get your Amazon selling privileges revoked, especially for something like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bought a laptop charger which was a fake. It got far too hot and buzzed. When I called them up they lied about it. They also deleted my review saying it was fake, but by the time I realised other people had already bought the product and were also reporting it as fake. Liars sold me a fire hazard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re selling a dinosaur toy that has the T-rex from the cartoon film &quot;We&#39;re Back&quot; on the packaging, but the toy itself looks like a more realistic depiction of a t-rex. Bootleg Chinese crap. Not saying Disney or whoever owns the rights to the film need extra royalties, but Am-a-zhan doesn&#39;t need to be sleeping this junk either.</p>
