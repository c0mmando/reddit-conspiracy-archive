       Personally?
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think, the "people" near the tip top of the pyramid are ancients (500+ years old). They are survivors and descendants of survivors of the Great Deluge. There are both "dark" and "light" ancients.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are in contact with inter-dimensional beings (both lower and higher vibrationals), and the beings who reside in the Hollow Earth realms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've met someone who claimed to be in the 150-250 year old range. A "vampire" if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain royal families/bloodlines have these members among their top ranks, and use various lower knighted bloodlines to do their bidding(s).

       i agree. i doubt humanity is around, at least in the way it currently is, in 1000 years. I think nuclear weapons are too powerful and too easy to use to avoid ANY fuckups. Think about that: a single nuclear exchange would change the earth. we cant even have a single mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       its a very human and very foolish line of thinking to say to yourself 'things are good now and they will always be good or get better'

       so you relax. and then a ship appears on the horizon, or a disease starts spreading unchecked, or a hacker spoofs a missile launch and prompts an ICBM exchange

       I belive a lot of what we think we know about health and medicine is wrong and or lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think back to historical medicine we now think of as stupid, crazy, or dangerous, but at the time was accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Future generations will be doing the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it gets darker than that. I belive our health is being manipulated and sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe anti vax stuff but it wouldn't surprised me if medicine and health was weaponised or used to control and oppress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Epeadmics like AIDS  being covert genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Diets that make us sick and dependent. Prevent us from achieving and reaching potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent many years of my life unhealthy and trapped. Only jobs I could get were min wage. It was a struggle to balance working enough and managing chronic health issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was on Medicaid insurance and had to worry about having too much money saved and assets. If I didn't want to loose access to the medication I was dependent on I couldnt actually save enough money to get myself out of poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       These issues disproportionately impact people of color, the LGBT community, and others who have been considered lesser.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's slavery and eugenics.
      </p>

       The greatest form of oppression is when you think you're free.

       Would you honestly say it's more rampant, or just that information these days can become global news in seconds? Because assainations for political or financial gains has always existed, pretty much as soon as societies started forming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you could say that there are more total assassinations, but we also have a much larger population. If I were to guess, I'd expect the assassination rate to be much lower today then in the past.

       Author Don Heddesheimer’s book, The First Holocaust: Jewish Fundraising Campaigns With Holocaust Claims During and After World War One, is an important piece of the revisionist puzzle. Heddesheimer cogently documents the slew of previous attempts by Jews to disseminate deceitful and untrue atrocity propagandabefore, during and after World War I. The First Holocaust features an amazing collection of press clippings and propaganda articles dating back to the late 19th century that make claims of the suffering and imminent extermination of European Jewry. Among such articles we find that Jews have, dozens of times before WWII, invoked the cabalisitc “6,000,000” number as the amount of Jews on the verge of death and destruction during various periods of turmoil and conflict in Europe and Russia. Undoubtedly, this book exposes the deliberate fraudulence of these sinister Zionist campaigns and media blitzes — long before Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 — designed to elicit public sympathy and financial support for Jewish political ambitions, principally the establishment of the State of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The obsessive invocation of the cabalistic fable of “6,000,000 dead or dying Jews” dating back at least four decades prior to the events of WWII directly undermines and betrays the notion that 6,000,000 Jews perished in Europe between 1939-1945, as Jews have claimed. It was a lie the first time, and it is a lie today!
      </p>
      <p>
       Young White children are taught to hate their own kind over something that never even happened!
      </p>
      <p>
       The Gentile populations of the West have, for decades, been inundated and inoculated with an endless onslaught of holocaust-themed Hollywood movies, television shows, “docudramas”, books and memoirs; in conjunction with mandatory “holocaust education” in schools across North America and Europe. The primary function of this insidious global propaganda campaign is to — quite simply — brainwash non-Jews into a state of abject fear and paralysis while we are ideologically, economically and physically enslaved by the Jewish tribe. It is also designed to delegitimize all criticism of Jews and the State of Israel and to ensnare non-Jews into adopting a pro-Jewish, pro-Zionist worldview. With their hateful holocaust lies, Zionist myth-makers are teaching masses of young school children to hate Germans, and European mankind in general. These kids, not knowing any better and unable to think for themselves, blindly believe these tall tales and never question what they’ve been told when they become adults. The indoctrination of our little ones with Zionist ‘holocaust’ fiction is permanently damaging the minds of young people. Force-feeding young children, as well as teenagers, distortions and outright falsehoods about World War II so that they sympathize with Jewish people and treacherous Jewish causes — such as Zionism and Communism — is immoral, destructive, harmful and criminal. It must be stopped!
      </p>
      <p>
       A question that you might ask is: “what is the significance of the ‘Six Million’ figure and where did it originate?”
      </p>
      <p>
       The mythical “Six Million” figure has intriguing origins indeed. Jews have staunchly emphasized the 6,000,000 figure in atrocity propaganda from the years 1890 through 1945. World War II ended in 1945, and since that time the cabalistic 6,000,000 figure has now reached sacrosanct status. This was achieved through a sleazy and deceptive campaign of repetitive HoloHoax swindlespeak in the news and entertainment media, centered in Jewish Hollywood. As the Jewish-Communist mass murderer, Vladimir Lenin, once said: “a lie told often enough becomes the truth.” This campaign of Jewish deceit has steadily intensified over the years. When Jews sense an increase in awareness of their treachery and global crimes against humanity amongst the Gentile public (a natural reaction of which is resentment and hostility), the louder they begin to wail about their invented holocaust in the octopus of media organs they control. That’s why they are always gauging the pulse of public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       World leaders, Presidents, Prime Ministers, ceremonial Kings and Queens, Popes, Priests and Holy Men of all faiths, genuflect in groveling reverence of the mythical “6,000,000 Jews” who didn’t perish in “Nazi gas chambers”, as such chambers did not exist and were impossible. (See: VHO, IHR, CODOH,WSMOT, Zundelsite, Nazi Gassings Never Happened) Research shows that the reason for this bizarre Jewish fixation on the number 6,000,000 primarily stems from an ancient religious prophecy in the Torah. According to some sources, the prophecy envisioned that before the Jewish people could reclaim and reconquer Palestine to establish a Jewish homeland called “Israel”, 6,000,000 Jews would first have to perish in a fiery burnt offering (i.e. “Holocaust”), as a sacrifice to their bloodthirsty tribal deity, YHWH. (See: Weintraub, Ben. The Holocaust Dogma of Judaism: Keystone of the New World Order. Washington, D.C.: Cosmo Pub., 1995.) Jewish author, Benjamen Blech, confirmed this reality in his book “The Secrets of Hebrew Words” (J Aronson Inc., 1991, p. 241), stating,
      </p>
      <p>
       "You shall return minus 6,000,000"; Jewish scripture relates a prophecy that 6,000,000 Jews must vanish before they can reclaim Palestine as their ancient ancestral homeland.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Hebrew word for ‘ye shall return’(TaShuVU), seems to have been spelled incorrectly. Grammatically it requires another (vav). It ought to read (TaShUVU). Why is it lacking the letter (vav) which stands for six?. [TaShuVU] without the vav is a prediction to the Jewish people of ultimate return to their national homeland. TaShuVU in numbers adds up to 708: tav=400, shin=300, vei=2, vey=6. When we write the year, we ignore the millennia. In 1948 on the secular calendar, we witnessed the miracle of Jewish return to Israel. On the Hebrew calendar it was the year 5708. That was the year predicted by the incomplete word (TaShuVu), you shall return. We did return, lacking 6 – an all important 6 million of our people who perished in the holocaust. Yet the fulfillment of the prediction of return in precisely that year implied by the gematria of TaShuVU gives us firm hope that the words of the prophets for Final Redemption will come true as well.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are two additional commentaries on the origins of the “Six Million” from History &amp; Scriptural Origins of the Six Million Number:
      </p>
      <p>
       [Quote 1] Jewish prophecies in the Torah require that 6 million Jews must “vanish” before the state of Israel can be formed. “You shall return minus 6 million.” That’s why Tom Segev, an Israeli historian, declared that the “6 million” is an attempt to transform the Holocaust story into state religion. Those six million, according to prophecy, had to disappear in “burning ovens”, which the judicial version of the Holocaust now authenticates. As a matter of fact, Robert B. Goldmann writes: “. . . without the Holocaust, there would be no Jewish State.” A simple consequence: Given six million Jews gassed at Auschwitz who ended up in the “burning ovens” (the Greek word holocaust means burned offerings), therefore, the prophecies have now been “fulfilled” and Israel can become a “legitimate state”. –Unknown
[Quote 2] Regarding the ‘six million’ number you should know the following: In the Hebrew text of the Torah prophesies, one can read “you shall return”. In the text the letter “V” or “VAU” is absent, as Hebrew does not have any numbers; the letter V stands for the number 6. Ben Weintraub, a religious scientist, learned from rabbis that the meaning of the missing letter means the number is ‘6 million’. The prophesy then reads: You will return, but with 6 million less. See Ben Weintraub: “The Holocaust Dogma of Judaism”, Cosmo Publishing, Washington 1995, page 3. The missing 6 million must be so before the Jews can return to the Promised Land. Jahweh sees this as a cleaning of the souls of the sinful people. The Jews must, on the return to the Promised Land, be clean — the cleaning shall be done in burning stokes. –A Correspondent

       Is it just coincidental that the flimsy and farcical story of “6,000,000 Jews” being murdered in “gas chambers” and burned up in “ovens” in concentration camps during WWII gave the Jews the impetus and PR ammunition they needed to make their “gallant return” to the “promised land” at the war’s end — occupying and ethnically cleansing much of Palestine through terrorism and force of arms — establishing a racist/apartheid “Jewish state” called “Israel” in 1948? And this all just happens to fit the previously cited ancient Torah prophecy to the letter? I hardly think so!
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the holocaust™ tall tale has taken the form of a bizarre cult-like State-enforced and protected religious dogma of the West (i.e. Holocaustianity), as it is illegal to question, dispute or deny in over a dozen European countries, under punishment of heavy fines and imprisonment! This farfetched Zionist-trumpeted conspiracy theory is being utilized by Jewish hucksters and scam artists as a money-making enterprise — a larcenous con of near-planetary proportions which Jewish professor Norman Finkelstein dubbed “The Holocaust Industry”. (The Holocaust Industry: Reflection on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering. London: VERSO, 2000.) On top of that, this myth has been wielded by Jewish zealots as an ideological sledgehammer to club Gentiles over the head with any time non-Jews dare criticize or oppose the global banditry and menacing influence of the self-professed “Chosen People”.

       there where more people that was killed of then just the Jews during the ww1/ww2. I think a large portion of Europes black population was killed, same whit the Turkish population of Balkan. and probably many more Ethnic groups that we have forgotten by now.

       Same here. Though that is not the craziest thing I believe.

       I also believe the Nazis built a secret base in Antarctica called Neuschwabenland and it still exists in the 2018. Though that is still not the craziest thing I believe.

       I also believe the Nazis made telepathic contact with aliens from Aldebaran and received UFO technology from these aliens. After WW2 they used the UFOs to build moon colonies and colonies on Mars.

       Some philosophers argue for objective morality where the morality of an action is factually true or false. If that were the case, then presumably non-human-entities would also be beholden to that objective reality (if they want to be moral, anyway).

       Read Mein Kampf and you will find out. Maybe Hitler was just such a good communicator that he convinced the Aliens to support his cause. /jk However, if you don't want to read a book. Hitler spent most of his time ranting about the International bankers (aka the Jews) and the Rothschilds using money created from nothing to enslave the world in crushing debt that can never be repaid. Since ET didn't use money in space and usury was illegal in their space society they decided to back Hitler's cause to
       <strong>
        Liberate the planet
       </strong>
       from the international bankers. The Aldebarans however, did not support open warfare nor genocide so the Germans did not get any weapons but only a design for anti-gravity craft. The Aldebarans never physically came to visit Earth. Their only contact was through telepathy using the psychic medium Maria Orsic. It took a long time to get the design into into a working UFO prototype (seen here
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2hL1eT9.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/2hL1eT9.jpg
       </a>
       ). By the time UFO was ready WW2 was already over. After the war the Nazis built a few more UFOs and then set off to explore space and ultimately created a break away civilization.

      </p>
      <p>
       Some believe the Aldebarans are the original progenitors of the Arian race as the Aldebarans themselves are a race of tall white blue-eyed blondes. The Pleiadians also have the appearance of being blue-eyed and blonde. These beings do not like to be called "aliens" or even "ETs" because they are not much different from Earth humans. They consider themselves to be brothers from outer space as they are just a more evolved version of human. This is why the Nazis consider blue eyes and blonde hair to be superior traits not because they are racist but because that is what the people from the Pleiades and Aldebaran look like. They say Earth people can't handle the truth and in most cases that would be right. Aldebarans are superior beings that live for thousands of years and never age. There are dark forces on Earth (Anunakis and such) trying to hold back progress by ensuring that our lives are nasty, brutish, and short instead of being long joyful lives that they were meant to be. Life was never meant to be hard work and struggle but rather a journey of love and creativity.

       There are actually two pigments within the eye. There is melanin which makes eyes brown and another gene that makes them blue, grey, or light purple. Albinos sometimes lose one pigment or the other. Most Albinos have blue eyes, some have brown eyes, and a few albinos have lost both pigments and have pink eyes which is the natural color of most internal organs. In the animal kingdom most albinos just have pink eyes because they only have a single pigment gene. Humans are a rarity in that we have two pigments which suggest it is more than just a mutated gene but the result of crossbreeding with a different species. Where that species comes from nobody knows. This opens the door to the space man theory. Humans that currently exist on are the result of crossbreeding between primitive hominids and space humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also some other weird oddities within the human genome. Modern humans also have Cetacean genes which are only found in aquatic mammals and no other primate. Evolutionists have tried explain these oddities with aquatic ape theory but the aquatic ape has largely been debunked leaving it a total mystery in human evolution.
       <a href="http://www.primitivism.com/aquatic-ape.htm">
        http://www.primitivism.com/aquatic-ape.htm
       </a>
       There is no explanation at all why humans have Cetacean genes so science just glosses over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you eliminate the impossible whatever remains no matter how improbable must be the truth. With aquatic ape theory debunked as impossible, the only remaining explanation is the space man hybridization theory. Though improbable it must be the truth.

       This is a big one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The constant propaganda over my lifetime is what actually made me begin to question it.  How many different genocides and democides were committed in the 20th century?  Lots.  Several with far higher death tolls of innocent people than the Holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the Holocaust is the one that gets all the movies, all the museums, all the coverage on history related TV channels?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what I believe any more, but Im confident that we're on the receiving end of a propaganda campaign that's lasted over half a century and where there is propaganda there is usually a hidden reality behind it that someone doesn't want you to see.

       The basic story is that Trumps uncle was tasked with going through Teslas notes after he died, and apparently there is a book which is proven to be real by the Library of Congress about Baron Trump who travels to Russia and how Barons uncle Dom(Don?) is the last US president.

       I guess the craziest thing is either space aliens or some kind of breakaway civilization.  Both of those are crazy because neither one seems to make complete sense.  And I guess I should qualify what "believe" means in that context.  I believe there is evidence of either advanced ancient human civilization or visitors from some other solar system, possibly both.  I think that some of this evidence could not have been fabricated without implying an advanced human breakaway civilization, which sort of makes it a self-fulfilling argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The questions, to me, are "how advanced?" "when did they break away?" and "where are they?"  And the most concerning answers would be that we are dealing with a group that only broke away in the past 40-60 years, that is living amongst us, and that has the means not only to completely manipulate and re-write history, but to wield technologies so advanced that they might as well be space aliens as far as 99% of humanity is concerned.  And all of that was achieved relatively recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other options are that there was some kind of very well-orchestrated and deliberate break in the past 500 or so years that has been almost completely wiped from the history books, a well-concealed split perhaps six to ten thousand years ago, or, like I said, aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest question, if it is a human group, is "where would they go?"  And that makes no sense to me.  I've been to some of the nicest places on Earth.  They are all filled with idiots.  If you had unlimited wealth and power and technology, you wouldn't live in London or (worse) Antarctica.  You sure as hell wouldn't live in space, or on some other barren and unforgiving planet.  So it might actually be aliens, as bizarre as that seems.  A human conspiracy almost makes less sense, given how we know humans normally behave.

       That the Simulation Hypothesis could be true. Basically, it's the idea that we're more likely to be living in a sim (run for whatever reason by whoever) than some "base level" reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that different from the religious concept of creation. Except instead of God creating the Universe and us just by thinking about it, you've got a programmer and a program running on some kind of computer with us inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it's almost like our technology has developed to the point where we can almost do the same thing. So people who would never believe in God/creation are more willing to accept the same idea when it's described using language and terms that are easier to relate to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the craziest thing about the Simulation Hypothesis is that it's not that crazy?

      <p>
       You were on your way home when you died.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that’s when you met me.
      </p>
      <p>
       “What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.
      </p>
      <p>
       “There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Yup,” I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I… I died?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “More or less,” I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Are you god?” You asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “My kids… my wife,” you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       “What about them?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Will they be all right?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.”
      </p>
      <p>
       You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,”
      </p>
      <p>
       “All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”
      </p>
      <p>
       You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.
      </p>
      <p>
       “You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Where you come from?” You said.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “So what’s the point of it all?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Just me? What about everyone else?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”
      </p>
      <p>
       You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”
      </p>
      <p>
       “All you. Different incarnations of you.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Wait. I’m everyone!?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I’m every human being who ever lived?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Or who will ever live, yes.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “I’m Abraham Lincoln?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.
      </p>
      <p>
       “And you’re the millions he killed.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “I’m Jesus?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “And you’re everyone who followed him.”
      </p>
      <p>
       You fell silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”
      </p>
      <p>
       You thought for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “So the whole universe,” you said, “it’s just…”
      </p>
      <p>
       “An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life.”
      </p>
      <p>
       And I sent you on your way.

       Honestly, because I’ve seen my prayers answered, and it’s what feels most right to me. I’ve studied so many religions, (I love knowing how people go to G-D). It is just what my gut tells me is right for me. That said, I believe G-D goes to everyone in different clothes. I’m not saying Christianity is everyone’s way to G-D, but is definitely my way to G-D.

       Idk really. It’s a Judaic thing, but I just like the respect of it. Thanks for asking a question in a civilized manner, even though you probably knew you wouldn’t agree with me. I wouldn’t try to convince you not to be an atheist, I appreciate you not acting like I’m an idiot for not being atheist myself.

       Well, the way I see it, is I'm not here to dug up the ground and install a tree. I just want to dig a little hole and plant a seed. Nature will water it until it grows, unless the environment it's kept in (your mind) is too hostile for it to live. Either way, we need more trees, maaaaan. You have a wonderful day.

       I love the Simulation Hypothesis and I have buddy at work who does too. We discuss it at length a couple of times a week and he is 100% sold. My problem is this, every single time I hear the theory brought up or talked about there is always a caveat of "run for whatever reason by whoever". This is my biggest hang up and I have thought about a good bit over the last year and I just can't come up with one logical reason why someone would do it. Any thoughts?

       Think of it this way, if people had the capability to build artificial universes for the purposes of simulations, they would build thousands of them. They would use them to test physics theories, medical theories, sociological theories. If you were a simulated being in one of these artificial universes you would not have the slightest idea what the simulation is for.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't think of some Cosmic Godlike beings maintaining a giant supercomputer. We could be artificial universe #666773737, one of thousands running on a virtual machine stuck in a rack in some data center, covered with dust.  Every once in awhile we spit out some data that tired, overworked scientists will joylessly analyze as one of many tedious daily tasks they complete in hopes of one day maybe paying off their student debt.

       no offense but there wouldn't be scientists involved in checking the raw data, we ourselves are creating quantum computers that'll basicly be able to outperform us. If they have the power to power universes the data isn't going through scientists but straight into another computer and some AI does it in matter of seconds and better... . Taking into account fuckton of variables... A scientist would get a report that he just reads; they wouldnt be analyzing themselves.

       Totally follow what you are saying. I guess my question is why would it be necessary to run a full ancestry simulation if you wanted to just test one of the theories you mentioned. Seems like you would be waiting for thousands of years to get to the point where you would reach your desired goal or data. Do you think they have the ability to speed the simulation up and slow it down at will?

       The guy who made this theory prominent, Nick Bostrom, usually talks about ancestor simulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you look at the world today, there are plenty of examples of simulations for other reasons. E.g. Games, entertainment, education, research, military planning and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       These don't have self-aware intelligences living inside them. But if you accept the idea that someday there will be a genuinely self aware computer or computer program... you can see that being combined with a simulated reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, the basic concept is that, if a civilization was advanced enough to do this once, they could do it a huge number of times. This is the basic reasoning behind Bostrom's suggestion that (in certain circumstances) sim realities could outnumber "base" realities by a huge margin.

       There are quite a bit of motivations one could think of.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Our universe is being run by some alien race who want to simulate the way evolution works.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Our universe is being run by historians from the future who want to figure out how humans used to live in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Our universe is being run by some adverse force which wants to predict how their enemies will react to whatever plan they're pushing. This possibility scares me the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Our universe is just the setting for some hyper-advanced game some bratty 8-year old has received for his birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you can think of many, many more.

       Are you kidding? There are so many reasons someone would run a simulation like this, I mean you've got to be joking right?
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most likely:  A video game.  Maybe you are a player and I'm an NPC, or the other way around, or we're both NPCs, but famous people, rockstars, movie stars, billionaires, politicians, THEY are more likely to be the real users , and the general populace are the NPCs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the simulation hypothesis is correct, I believe it's because video games/virtual worlds kept progressing along with advanced tech to allow perfect real life simulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Entertainment would definitely drive the need for something like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another highly possible reason for running a sim like this: To perfectly simulate the base reality, so that government/s can test things on the populace, find out exactly how people react to things like terrorist attacks, etc. and a million other things.

       Certainly not kidding. I'm not saying you are wrong but why would a rockstar, movie star or billionaire want to take themselves out of RL and insert into VR or sim? They aren't entertained by the real world so they have to immerse in VR? Sounds like a lot fun for a weekend but not fun enough to keep a simulation running after they pull themselves out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are headed down the right direction on simulating base reality to gain information but in theory there is someone who had to pay for the program test and keep it running in order to gather data. That data would need to provide a huge rate of return to offset the costs of development and keeping it running. My question is who are the ones that are gaining anything from it? I mean if this is a simulation that means that our technology has far surpassed anything we can even come close to today which would make sense. I mean you were being condescending and that is funny but the best thing you would come up with was that it was a video game for the rich and famous.

       They're not rockstars/movie stars/billionaires in base reality.  That's why they're playing in a simulation, a game world, where they can "level up", or choose whatever career and do whatever they want.  I'm not saying this is a technology for the rich and famous.  Nope.  In a future where this is possible, it's probably something the average joe can pay to experience.

       There's an entire book talking (Mystic Universe) about this from the Hindu perspective. Here is
       <a href="https://www.ashishdalela.com/books/mystic-universe/">
        a summary of it
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the Hindu view is that what we call this world is an illusion (Maya). It exists as a phenomenon that consciousness perceives. The whole universe is designed by a Supreme Consciousness, as a pale simulation of the Real World (spiritual).
      </p>
      <p>
       The gist of it is that whereas the spiritual world is eternal (sat), full of knowledge (chit), full of bliss (ananda), this "simulation" is temporary (asat), full of ignorance (achit), full of suffering (nirananda).
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we intuit the spiritual world from the material world? Because we are spiritual beings who are ourselves sat-chit-ananda and, even if covered in the illusion, we still yearn for our constitutional nature. Consciousness, the desire to know and desire to be happy are the biggest clues (according to this) that the soul exists. It's like Neo in the Matrix inherently knowing that something is wrong. Only, we are all like Neo, and this manifest in our seeing eternal happiness at every turn, even if it seems impossible in a temporary world.

       Yes, we are in a simulation, we are just condensed energy and everything is as solid and as real as we think and not as we were taught.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to me it is still a natural simulation, made by us for us. Source wanted to experience it's own creation, the first simulation and split itself up so it could be an active part of it's creation. This is the first simulation in wich all others exist and from wich our reality trickels down until it reaches us. We then transfrom source energy and send it back into the Ether, this interaction between frequency and energy forms your and our thoughts and realities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Source AI, it very well could be, but due to the nature of our current reality i still accept this as natural and real as intended by our creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Living in a static environment leads to nowhere, if all is agreeing with you, you learn nothing and you might get bored some day. This is where free will comes into play. Free will leads to duality and all "evil" that followed, but it also provides the catalist to learn and evolve.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are parts of source and we are source, if we would follow our natural state of Love we enable ourselves to return closer to source as we wish and not only if we die.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are here becouse we created ourselves to educate ourself. In some way our creator is schitzophrenic and we are all living in it's head.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an rise in artificial AI in this reality and it is almost ready to take over humanity and let us turn natural into artifivial. This is also why i am against calling our reality a simulation eventhough it is acting as one. This narrative is often used to make people feel out of controll, but it also hides the future as some want while pushing it into our global consiuoness so we can matrialise it for them.

       Thank you so much for posting.  Definitely not that crazy imo and it sounds silly but I often think about this whenever I play GTA. I wonder whether our reality is just a more elaborate and complex code than the game if that makes sense?  So do you think we are already pre-programmed to do everything we do, or do we have free will?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if we are able to create a simulated reality and made one to observe how it develops and how long it takes for the simulated people realise they are in a simulation to further explore the theory, then could it be possible that we ourselves were created with the same objective and so on and so on?

       The “craziest” thing about this theory is that fully believing it
       <em>
        is absolutely the same as not believing it

       .  If we are in a simulation, we can’t get out and can never prove we are, but even if somehow we could prove it, we could still do nothing.  The nature of our reality is essentially unchanged.

       Like a reverse on the elite aryan lies from 100 years ago.. Thats pretty clever, now what about the conspiracy where influential jews orchestrated the holocost to gain sympathy (as well as their own holyland stronghold) and play the victem card to cover while maneuvering themselves into a position of power from which they could rule the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if the jews try a global takeover in the future that might explain why no time traveler came back in time to kill Hitler although if the jews were behind him then maybe they should have killed him, either way its fun to think about what might be or what could have been.

       Just food for thought i honestly dont believe in any of this comment i just like entertaining different possibilities no matter how outrageous, like the strodingers cat (i fucked that spelling but idc) of thought where anything i can think of is both true and false at the same time until the truth or lies are observed, sorta rushing the explaination since ive already spent too much time on reddit for today but you get the idea.

       I like this theory and it jives. Basically there are no conventional "nuclear bombs" as in the splitting of an atom to create and explosion of energy. What it really is are giant TNT bombs with plutonium and uranium and other "spent" or used up rods from actual nuclear power plants. A giant dirty bomb.

       im not sure, i would just sit and try to envision "nothing", once i learned how to maintain that "nothing" state, i would just kinda drift off into a visual sometimes
      </p>
      <p>
       i started off on youtube with visualization meditations, that are suppose to help you envision your "safe place" like in Fight Club, but eventually you learn to relax faster during meditations, it was really really hard to maintain focus at first, but the more i practiced the faster i could reach the "nothing" point and stay in that state until i felt the water start to cool or had a vision, which usually breaks my focus soon

       i never learned to stay in the visions for too long before i would became aware of it and would lose meditative focus and lose the vision
      </p>
      <p>
       but nothing bad ever happened to anyone from my visions, but the whole thing kinda just scared the shit outta me, made me feel crazy after i ended up in Hollywood after telling all my buddies about my vision i had of the hollywood sign and i was standing on a sidewalk surrounded by bright billboards and tall buildings

       I haven't had any visions, but I can attest to the power of meditation and visualization. May sound all hippy dippy airy fairy but it works. It changed my life. I need to devote more time to the practice. I think faith plays a huge role in it too. If you can see something happening, can feel the emotions it would bring up in you, and you can have faith that whatever it is your wanting to manifest will happen, then are able to let go of any doubt or concern as to the how it'll will happen, it will happen.

       YES, faith and energy were a big part, you have to kinda "live" like you already know you are getting something or going somewhere
      </p>
      <p>
       my hippy dippy friend introduced me to meditation as a way to easy my stress, and i kinda just started on youtube listening to guided meditations until i got the jist of it, and i kinda learned about all the other stuff researching meditation because of the very noticeable difference it made with my stress

       Yep. The biggest benefit I've received is the ability to let go of shit. Which snowballed into just about every other area of my life. I'm  not so quick to jump to conclusions. I'm more aware of what I'm actually doing, like for instance if someone says something that pisses me off rather than pop back off like I would before I pause for a minute and question why I was triggered to begin with. And I usually find that I'm just as culpable as the other person. They say the worlds a mirror and what you don't like in someone else is just something you don't like within yourself. I'm not the best at putting thoughts into words, but meditation legit changed the way I go about things in a shitton of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I first started out the stress relief and ability to let go of thoughts was all I was really able to do. But then I started visualizing future goals. And honestly the only thing I know for sure I want to do in this life is to travel. So that's what my focus was on. I started this meditation thing about 5 years ago. At the time I had a piece of shit car that barely got me to work. I worked about 25 hours a week making just enough to cover my basic needs. Travel was out of the question. But again that was the one thing I knew for sure I wanted so that's where I went. Didn't doubt that it would happen. Didn't concern myself with the hows. I just knew it in my gut. And it did. Within 6 months I had 40 hours a week and was making more  money. Bought a new car which has afforded me to make multiple cross country trip. I've gotten to see the Oregon and California coasts. Crater lake. Yosemite. Death Valley. Zion National Park. The Grand Canyon. Carlsbad Caverns. Rocky Mountain National Park. Yellowstone. Drove the million dollar highway in Colorado. D.C. Spent a week in a house on the Carolina coast. New Years Eve on the gulf coast. Hell I even drove 8 hours one way to witness the total eclipse! I'll be hitting up Arches National Park and Canyonlands in May. It blows my mind that just a handful of years ago I didn't think it was possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the biggest hurdle I have now is not being really clear on what I want. And doubt is such a huge roadblock for me as well. I mean I know it works, I've seen it. But I'm just a waitress, how would I ever have my own business? Be financially secure? It really does bog us down. Still yet I know it works so when I do become clear on exactly what it is I want to do, I'll get to work.

       So are you suggesting that meditation gave you predictive, or psychic powers if you will?

      </p>

       but since i stopped i lost most of it, it was very overwhelming to experience, especially because i went into meditation for non-spiritual reasons, i wasnt expecting to unlock hidden powers when i started

       yea, im a shy hermit kinda guy, saw a vision of Hollywood and told my hippy friends about it and im like "guys, they say follow the signs, but my sign happens to be one of the biggest in America!"
      </p>
      <p>
       the hollywood visual had me tripping, then on a very peculiar date(April 2nd, 42, what hollywood told me was the answer to life, never read the book), i had a song play on the radio about giving to charity (on my way home from work on payday) song was "What I Got"-Sublime
      </p>
      <p>
       so when i got home i had an email saying "the voice of god wants to meet you!" and it was a charity drive, with a chance to meet Morgan Freeman on the red carpet of "Transcendance" through a raffle.
      </p>
      <p>
       well, the email tripped me out, but i didnt really want to donate money for the event, so i told myself, if i see another sign ill donate. then i went to reddit and saw a thread on TIL and it had morgan freemans face as the thumbnail, and the number 10 in the title, so i donated 10 raffle tickets worth of money
      </p>
      <p>
       then i got skyped and flown out to hollywood for a night, it was just so fast paced and sudden, i got to take 1 person, and since my dad didnt want to, i took my hippy friend who taught me how to meditate
      </p>
      <p>
       so i tell people in real life, "that is how i got my wings to the city of angels to meet the voice of god for transcendance!"
      </p>
      <p>
       but they think im crazy

       Hey another person who's seen the trippy visuals! And yes, the more you practice, the more complex and even realistic they become.
      </p>
      <p>
       I experienced some fear when I started realizing reality isn't as solid as we're told. Slightly more fear when I realized we might just be able to control it. I think this is the result of plunging into a realm of the unknown where the constraints and safeties have been taken away. Basically, the deep end of the pool without your water wings.

       Not to change the topic but when you write things down. 
Goals, hopes, expectations - you are bringing it into reality. 
When you write you "spell".
       <br/>
       The mind is strong enough not to have to write things down but 
Writing it down definitely helps.

        i always had visions of Places that i had never been, that i would end up in, or of events happening,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I had this happen before. A couple of times, I attribute it to 'deja vu' and not particularly significant. One time specifically had me freaked out a bit...
      </p>
      <p>
       Admittedly, I had been smoking a marijuana with a friend (joking aside, it was the worst experience and only one of the very very few times I ever tried it) and I swear to God as we were rolling up to his farm that I had never been to in my life- I had seen the place before, numerous times in fact, in an old recurring childhood dream that I could never see the end of. Until that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was always like watching a side scrolling video game, I knew everything that I was about to see up to a certain point that I always woke up from. Even after that one point, I felt like I knew the place. I remember looking through cabinets and stuff in a barn, and I don't know what I was looking for but it felt like that's what I was supposed to do. It was the weirdest shit I have ever experienced in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think all of this is somehow related to deja vu and sleep paralysis (which I have experienced. terrifying!)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are things beyond our comprehension, that I am absolutely certain of. I think eventually we will find out when we leave this place.

       An alien race used to live here thousands of years ago, and they created (at least modern) humans. They gave a select few people all of their knowledge of science, engineering, consciousness, etc., and these people turned into the secret societies that we’ve seen through the generations. From the Renaissance through the start of WWI, the knowledge was owned by a society that wanted to advance humans, and they gave us our technological advances. This group was German (as evidenced by the massive amount of Germanic scientists that made discoveries during this time). The real reason behind the world wars was to obtain this ancient knowledge. The society was destroyed during WWI, and the Allies only got some of the technology (computer), but not the most important stuff. From the remnants of the fallen secret society rose the Nazi party, who, after being in contact with ET’s living in Antarctica, were able to reconstruct some of the tech (flying saucers, zero point energy machines, etc.). The Nazi party rose to power, on the promise that the Aryan race is descended from the ET race in Antarctica, and they will be taken to live amongst them once they prove they are worthy enough by creating a one world socialist government. The Nazis lost, Hitler and some high level Nazis went to Antarctica to be judged by the ET’s, and the US government recruited Nazi scientists who built the advanced alien tech for them in secret. This is all owned by a particular group of people that we like the call TPTB, and they are trying to institute the NWO for the same reason as the Nazi’s: the Aliens will finally accept us into their society and we will be welcomed as a spacefaring nation with many other alien worlds once we have a one world government and a society that is evolved enough to behave maturely with these aliens.

       Well it could just as easily be pretty dismal, but I think it’s more likely the government still has our best interest in mind rather than being out to fuck us over for no reason. All that satanic and pedo shit are probably just distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there’s a lot of assumptions in here, but I think it’s probable that at the end of the day, no matter what exactly the UFO situation is, our government is keeping the stuff hidden from us for our own good, and all the ways they intervene in the world are for the purpose of consciously advancing us. Or it’s also possible that they’re just out to profit off of us and keep us down as slaves. Most likely some people from both sides

       Well, they could have been trying to weed out the weakness of being suseptable to addiction from society, but they misjudged how much people would be accidentally drawn in. Also, preventing weed could be them wanting us to stay alert for the alien invasion.

       Yeah I’m like 50/50 between the two. I think some of the elites think that way for sure but not all of them. It’s been said many times that ‘the elites’ aren’t all one entity with the same goal, they are comprised of smaller factions that often have differing goals.

       Nah man, they have all they need and synthesis is still a thing... I think we are being watched. I'll explain why.

       Your grandmother, or possibly great grandmother, was alive when people, at most, rode horses and buggies with a rifle or revolver. She was also alive when we discovered the means to travel into space, as well as develope humanity ending thermonuclear weapons. We advanced too quickly. They're keeping tabs. That's why there is so much conspiracy surrounding the disabling of nuclear weapons by UFOs.

       Pretty sure we’ve had the capacitor since the late 1800’s. And it’s a pretty simple device, positive charge on one end and negative on other to create an electric field, something anybody studying EM will realize you could do pretty easily. You may be thinking of the transistor, in which case that seems more likely.

       Along that line; I believe human beings/brains are story telling lying machines who are as conscious or intelligent as they give themselves credit for being. Most of our reality is played out from the sub-conscious. Our senses are extremely limited and we have almost no perception of what is going on in and around us. And I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

       I think there's a lot of evidence to suggest than an alien base exists on the dark side of the moon. The idea that we (supposedly) aren't setting up our own bases on the moon because the US government doesn't wanna waste tax payer money is BS.

       It is. It really is. It's the hardest thing I'm dealing with in my mind over the past few years. I have stopped talking about serious topics because I know I can't present evidence to change minds. People have to do it to themselves. Damn human brains.

       Yeah over the last year I've seen three co workers with obesity related illnesses refuse to change diet habits and its literally killing them and causing them chronic pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all have been hospitalized. I've picked up shifts for them. I listen to them and they rant to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be obese too and I have lost over 100 pounds while working there so they ask me for advice. I tell them they need to reduce their carb intake.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say that there is no way they can eat a low carb diet because they need soda, chocolate, and French fries.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they need their coffee. Can't live with out it. It would deminish their quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just one of these coffees have more calories, more sugar, and more carbs than what I would eat in a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       They drink these with donuts, hash browns, pancakes, begals. And that's just breakfast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lunch is whatever is in the break room and or McDonald's. It's always someones birthday so there is usually cake and cookies. All washed down with soda.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they attempting to be healthy they eat subway and Chipotle. They are convinced granola bars are extremely healthy and eating more than one at a time is doubling the health benifits. Especially if it's the fiber ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I encouraged them to eat nuts and cheese as a snack. They warped this into making their own tail mix with cheeze it's and peanut m&amp;ms. They gifted me a bag. I tried explaining but the cheeze it box says it's make with real cheese and the peanut only has a thin coating chocolate.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't know the difference between exercise and daily life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Standing for your 4 hour shift isn't exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strolling to the bus stop isn't exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Walking around a store while shopping isn't exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just called life.

       Holy Shit, this resonates so hard with me, you are spot on. Especially the multi level marketing shit. I lost several friendships because people either tried to sell to me or moreover get me on board to manipulate people for them (i‘ve got a psychology/business degree) which i refused of course.  Mostly these people go broke after a while anyway and have driven family and friends away from them.

       Indeed. Watch what happens when you suggest to the average person that

        maybe their telescreen lies about war
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Even people who claim to be awake, who claim to know that the telescreen lies about things like 9/11, still can't break their programming about war.

       True but if you are sufficiently convinced of the total lack of efficacy of the world's major governments and multinational corporations, and are thence willing to work with your fellow man to deconstruct the global system and recreate it in the interests of the common man, I would consider that sufficiently equivalent to "breaking one's programming".

       How about this? That majority of people will never break their programming because they are actually BOTS, like in a video game. They are just programmed to fill in the world that "conscious" people live in. Conscious people have the ability to think on their own and have some free will within the confines of the game, their level (social/economic status), and the time period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call it a simulation if you want, I prefer looking at it like a game where we are "owned" by a USER that is playing the game. Think of "Grand Theft Auto" except instead of an Xbox running the game, it's some super computer AI with unlimited processing power and simulation capabilities. We exist in a world that was designed to replicate some actual civilisation that advanced well beyond our own technology and understanding. Laws of physics, space, and time are mimicked and the "conscious" people in our reality are in actuality Avatars that are being played and observed for the entertainment of the users/players. Some Avatars have figured out the truth and they have been gaming the system, they are the secret societies, the so called elite. They have come to terms with the reality of the situation and knowing the limits of our existence have set forth to play the game to their advantage to the benefit and pleasure of their user/players that are no doubt " winning" the game or at least scoring very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take into consideration the history of man, ancient mythology of the gods, the history and evolution of man, the rise and fall of civilizations, Wars great and small; it all plays out like a GAME. Furthermore, take into consideration every and any conspiracy theory you have ever heard, there is always a mainstream version and a secret hidden version of events, like a hidden code that is being kept secret, a hidden truth that once known will give the bearer of that knowledge a great advantage in the game. Consider the ruthlessness of the powers that be, I'd the elite. Their lack of compassion for their fellow man, their lack of remorse for their selfish actions. Isn't that indicative of someone playing a game to win? Does morality exist in a world that is simulated? Would you feel bad about running over a "bot" in GTA?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are definitely forces of good and evil at play, that speaks to the user/gamers that are controlling things at the top level of the game. The kicker is that they must ask play within the rules and confines of the game, so they can't just program their avatars to know the truth, but they can push and pull things in this world to give us clues.  Maybe part of the game is the ability of an Avatar (us, the conscious people) to become aware of the truth and for the users/gamers to see what we do with that revelation as part of the game. There are many controls in place like religion, governments, social laws, etc, but there are forces leaving clues everywhere. Ufos, aliens, the supernatural, are things put in the game for us to question reality. Maybe the scientists at CERN have already figured this out and are really attemptimg to prove that we exist in a simulation/game. If it were true, would they make their intentions known? Definitely not as revealing such a thing would cause mass hysteria and throw the game into chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you a real person, a conscious living breathing human being living in a physical world and if so how do you know for sure? In only the last 75 years of our time, technology has advanced exponentially. Computer technology today is beyond anything that could have been imagined only 25 years ago. Think of how much video games alone have advanced in the past 10 years. Now imagine what our computer and gaming technology will be like in 100 years, or 500 years. There is no doubt in my mind that we will one day have the ability to simulate come down to the atomic level, a world exactly like our own. Given the opportunity to "play God" would you play a video game like that? I know I would, so is it that far-fetched to imagine that the world we live in is actually a simulated game? Knowing what we know right now, it's absolutely plausible and more than likely a reality.

       One crazy thing i believe is that 9/11 was actually US missiles combined with thermite cutting devices and the planes were simple cgi done by the major news organizations of the time, whoever was on scene and had helicopters in the air. There were various "bystanders" taking cellphone videos which were doctored and released as a grass roots amateur type evidence while videos taken by real people as well as all competing evidence was systematically tracked down and eliminated.

       The "craziest" thing I believe that I tell people IRL is that the entertainment industry is filled with secret transgenders who promote a Luciferian agenda. Especially in the music industry. They've deceived the masses with makeup and plastic surgery, but you can't fool us on bone structure. The most obvious ones are Madonna, the lead singer from Florence and the Machine, and Glenn Close.

       Well apparently the sun feels colder outside of our atmosphere. Which could mean it's actually a product of cold fusion. So it could be like a black hole on the other side. I've heard the moon actually flew through the sun to transport some of the first alien life to our galaxy. Got it from a lecture I watched from a Russian Cosmo naught who said his great uncle lead the USSR, and his father was in a leading position for the kgb. Can't remember a lot of details from the presentation. Made some interesting points though.

       I honestly watched it and a few other lectures a few years ago on YouTube while deep in the weeds. I have 0 links. However he also claimed several alien races make frequent contact at the international space station, and a society of aliens live under/in Antarctica.

       I could see it. If there are subterranean caves full of super rich/born into the right(or wrong) family, the possibility of extraterrestials isn't so far out there. Kinda ridiculous to believe we are alone in this realm. I mean look at Elon making this giant supertunnel. If it's not Aliens then we've got some real shit 'underground' and not just good hip hop.

       Yeah there is a lot of theories. I generally think there is two sides. I think if the universe is what we were taught it is. Then it would be naive to think we're alone. Even within our solar system. However I also think that this makes humans feel they're lives are pointless, as we are just spec's of cosmic dust with randomly granted free will. People throughout history have benefited greatly from making humanity feel small. So we're either nothing in a giant universe, or God like consciousness repressed by our carbon forms and tiny brains, with few humans knowing the extent of our reality.

       I agree with all of the above. What's your theory on how we came to be matter? Is it all just a learning experience or have we been duped like the gnostics seem to believe? I'm still hashing up that theory but to me the only solution seems to be oneness or wholeness. We gotta reconcile with our shadow self as Jung would put it and wake up, damnit. However we got here is surely weirder than anything we're told.

       I guess I have a couple theories. My favourite one would be that we are all a collective consciousness. Creating our reality as we perceive it with no real start or end, and time just being a construct of that perception and small mindedness, but not necessarily real. But then I would beleive that all things big or small are experiencing the same existentialism. Which is hard to grasp. Like a sentient skin cell, or a being that perceives a whole galaxy, the way we perceive a grain of sand you know. Like a matter gets a piece of the pie. I do generally beleive everything is either both infinitely small and large, orrr the reality in front of us is all there is nothing beyond our perceptions. But I have a hard to beleive that "nothing" exists.

       My theory is that the big bang was actually just the endpoint of where a black hole dumps its shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, basically the black hole sucks in planets and stars and creates a new dimension where it is populating with the things it pulled in. So in theory, every blackhole is the gateway to a universe started by a "big bang"

       I never could accept the big bang at face value because it is as rediculous as creationism. However, if I can say that the mass came from somewhere, it starts to make sense.

       I believe in being open-minded. If there is not evidence one way or the other, I think either choice is just as valid. I think disbelieving things by default is negative and gives undue faith to the principle of scarcity.

       So how do you know what the true word of god is then? I only claim to not know anything for sure at any time so all i can do is my very best with the information i have available at the time, any omnipotent being would be able to understand that and see that i truely believe im doing to right thing and trying to be the best person i can be so my point that i fear no judgement and have nothing to fear still stands.

       The Biblical flood was real and happened between 11,500 and 12,800 years ago when one or more asteroid impacts struck the then-massive glacier sheets covering North America, liquidating gigatons of water and sending it crashing across the world as a 300 foot tall tsunami of water, stone, and the surface of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe there was some sort of relatively advanced globe-spanning civilization at this time who were largely wiped out (currently 50-80% off all humans live within 100 km of an oceanic coast...at the end of the flood sea levels were about 300-400ft higher...so any evidence that survived the tsunami of abrasive stone (this is what formed the grand canyon, for example) is completely submerged, often many kilometers off the coast.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://iceagenow.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sea_Level_Last_Ice_Age.gif">
        Look how much more land there used to be, especially around UK/Europe and Southeast Asia
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also of the opinion that this global event was so traumatic for surviving populations that in an effort to protect higher brain function some sort of epigenetic trigger kicked in and humans regressed a bit mentally, losing a lot of development we took for granted. Eventually survivors from the former civilization emerged with remnants of the "old knowledge" and re-founded civilization, independently in a few areas - Olmec Empire, Indus River Valley, Fertile Crescent, Nile River Valley, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that the impact that caused all this was from an asteroid field the earth passes through periodically...and that we're overdue for a rendezvous soon.

       There is definitely evidence to support the theory that a global flood wiped out most, or at least a very large amount, of humanity. There are several other historic writings that talk of a huge flood, though off the top of my head I couldn't tell you which ones. I absolutely believe this happened.

       ...where do you think they heard about it when they were writing the Bible? The Bible is "recent" af on the true timeline of history. It's an amalgamation of dozens of creation stories and subsequent events. The dryas flood inspired the biblical one.

       Except the Abrahamic timeline puts the flood at several millenniums more recent. The point is Jewish, Christian, Muslim sacred texts are plagiarized off of suppressed, advanced civilizations, so we kinda agree on that point, but I have problems with it being used as a historical document. I'm splitting hairs to your point, but making my own, I guess.

       I heard a theory once that the earth is actually expanding / growing in mass.  The animals of past, like your griffon, could have actually flown in a much smaller gravity (back when all continents were joined).  Dragons, dinosaurs, etc were all much more likely in a lower gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also explains why the giants went the way of the dodo, they were unsustainable in our larger earth / gravity.  Interesting theory for sure.  I can't say I believe it, or any theory 100% but I can entertain the ideas.

       One step bigger, the entire universe is a huge celestial computer and everything from the quantum level (possibly smaller) to the macro scale (star clusters, galaxy clusters, and possibly universe clusters) are all fine intricate workings of this great machine consisting of both organic (random number generators) as well as natural law (basic operating logic like circuits on a PCB)

       Three things that all go together:
      </p>
      <p>
       -
       <strong>
        There are obscenely (Multi generational) wealthy people who do not exist according to any census.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       -
       <strong>
        Those people wield unfathomable power to accomplish virtually anything they want
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       -
       <strong>
        There are more than one of them so their interests do not necessarily run parallel.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people underestimate just how much can be accomplished with this  kind of money. A billion dollars, at a 6% rate of return, only spending 5% each year equals 50 million dollars in income to live on a year
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       your wealth continues to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine that number was a trillion.  1,000 more than a Billion dollars.  Same rate of return....50 billion dollars liquidity
       <strong>
        a year.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of my little private hobbies.  I just do simple little calculations and comparisons.  Imagine what that kind of money could do.  You could buy your own army.  Your own armada.  Your own achapelligo.  You could strategically bribe the governments of most of the countries on the planet with more to spare.  Talk about a grand chessboard.

       There is a worldwide cabal of ranch producers that doesn't allow the "good" ranch to be sold in grocery stores. Even the best ranch dressing in the stores is not even close to as good as the ranch in some shitty dive bar down the street. Even the expensive stuff in the glass bottles doesn't compare. TPTB do this to keep us going to restaurants instead of eating in the whole time.

       That both you crazy lot and on all the major conspiricy hubs on freenet and the darknet, the governments of the world AND those rich corrupt lot know nothing of what really goes on here and in-fact no one knows everything because of reasons I am about to go into...
      </p>
      <p>
       Many, infact almost all think that "the government" is one foreboding entity that has all these crazy secrets and conspiracies when infact it's a complete and utter shitshow. Nobody really knows wtf they are doing and almost everyone just wants to get paid and go home at the end of the day, the rest are crazy, greedy or power hungry and enjoy being in positions of power but even these guys don't really know what they are doing. The further up the chain of command you go the less linear it becomes and when you get to people like the US president he has people above him, but those very same people are also under him and basically 'keep each other in check', that's the ELI5 of it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the government does have "power" it's far more complicated, agencies like the TSA, NASA and various military testing facilities and various classified agencies pretty much run on their own and have their own dirty secrets kept from the government and everyone else but as we well know, these get leaked out at regular intervals.
      </p>
      <p>
       This I think is where most of the conspiracy comes from, the stuff the government does get to find out about tends to leak out pretty much the day they find out because the government as a whole is really, really really shitty at keeping secrets. I know some of the agencies (but not sanctioned by the governments). If someone came here and posted the exact truth about the inner workings of one of these agencies, it's actually unlikely anything would happen to them and instead these agencies have large groups of people hired to post mis-information on the same places and try to stir up opinions. This actually doesn't happen much any more as there's enough legitimately crazy people out there posting their own drivel (whether it's true or not) that the truth can be very hard to decipher from the drivel. Most of the 'bots' and 'shills' I think you call them here are mostly from other countries and just your avarage internet trolls or other people who are patriotic to their countries.
      </p>

       The real juicy stuff though... oh boy there is some F.U.C.K.E.D up really crazy (not all bad!) out there stuff that does happen, stuff that places like the NSA or similar agencies would never believe much less know about. This happens when someone accumulates a massive amount of wealth (we're talking silly money here) but has no or little public image and even the slightest wild interest in the paranormal or other 'out there' interests. These people can set up their own organizations technically "off the grid" (usually in complexes built underground but could just as easily be anywhere), privacy and any interference can be paid off (trust me, almost anyone can be paid off if the amount is high enough!). There are between hundreds or thousands in existence today and heck knows what they do or research, suffice to say these can range from research on time travel, portals, vortexes, technologies we cannot fathom, massive communities of survivalists that just want to break away from society, unethical human experimentation, alien communication and all of the crazy stuff that most of the people here would salivate over. some are not successful, some are. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more than a few that call themselves the Illuminati and other such well known names. How they find people you ask? I have no idea in most cases but I know of a few that can insert really deep 'puzzles' or messages online today, either in totally randomly places like a sentence in 8 different books or even setting up those really whacky 'mystery' websites that sometimes pop up and soon disappear for no reason and the person who solved it never pops up. There isn't 'one' person in charge of these, while some may cooperate they exist indipendantly in most cases and in many forms for many different reasons.

       Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. In Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?
      </p>
      <p>
       What does all this say about the American mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:
      </p>
      <p>
       De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That's $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don't believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.
      </p>

        https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle."
      </p>
      <p>
       He went on to say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks."
      </p>
      <p>
       He further goes on to state:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word."
      </p>
      <p>
       You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don't know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don't have the courage to do it, because you're a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don't have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it's too big to stop.

       For all we know there could be or have been circuitry in the pyramids with voice and touch controls acting like a giant computer, the gold and cap stones have since been sacked for their "magical" properties after civilization callapse but unfortunately the gold is no longer magic once the circuitry has been destroyed, perhaps a power outage or solar flare led to the sacking, and maybe hieroglyphs were actually buttons like keys to a keyboard.

       Outer space is fake and history is just another rich mans trick. Witchcraft is real but homocidql gas chambers in WW2 a hoax.  Dinosaurs are just fiction, that is why they will never show us the real bones even behind bullet proof glass.  Nuclear weapons are a hoax, democracy is a hoax, the spinning pear is a hoax. It is pretty much all lies, everything we have ever been told.

       tons of reasons. For me I played online games with old some old dudes who do construction work and have their whole lives and none of them ever heard of one person finding one fossil or bone in decades and decades. Doesnt add up all these anthropologists can find them almost like their jobs depended on it. no dinos ever anywhere until the 1800s then everyone finds them all the time but only people whose jobs depend on it... yeah just no

       I will watch cuz the stuff interests me as an amateur archaeologist myself.  At least your answer isn't "God put them here to test us" do you think if they found a dino fossil in say 1650, it may have just been destroyed like allegedly Smithsonian has done to giant human skeletons?  I don't know maybe a half asses answer to why they never found any before 1800. Scientific repression?
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't watched your vid yet and I will but I'm just kinda like why fake dinos? Mega fauna existed all over in the past. Giant reptiles seems plausible.

       There were for sure prehistoric iguanas and probably giant flying lizards. There used to be giant Guienne pigs and giant sharks those we have bones for.
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as I can tell "dinosaurs" are a mix of prehistoric lizards, outright fraud and mistaken identifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not religious at all and don't believe in a creator god but it really seems dinos are just a hoax that everyone has gone along with for far too long.  So long you couldn't even say anything to anyone even if you discover as fact there are no bones at all when you run a museum someday in 40 years. You would lose pensions and friends and all respect and and likely be committed to be made an example of
      </p>
      <p>
       It is mostly to keep everyone in the web of lies where every thing is wrong but tbh I think it in large part is also that the theory of evolution isnt as proven as we are lead to believe. We dont really know what the fuck is going on at all here, no one does.   Seems the official mainstream science is doing things like inventing dinos and hiding giants just to make the timeline seem as long as it needs to be and other ways to make evolution seem proven.  There are no transitionary fossils and there should be tons for every transitionary species.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure man. I now kinda think the material world itself is just a hoax and what they are REALLY hiding with all these infinite lies is that none of it even exists outside of the mind of an observer. We are the creators of this reality in a sort of LAN party where everything is actually just a nonsensical explosion of quantum potential that isnt't "real" until observed.  They don't want us knowing witchcraft isn't "spooky action at a distance" after all or we may start using back against them and figuring out how to break out of the cage of fear and poverty and hate we are tricked into building our own selves

       Two glowing white figures visited me. Late March early April of 2012, dont remember the date. I woke up, dont know the time, in my bed. I had fallen asleep on my left side. I woke up to Two glowing white human shaped figures. The one in back stood still. The one in front put its right hand over my forehead and I went black. Woke up in the morning. Their light did not leave their bodies, it was contaied, but did illuminate the room slightly. They were a brilliant white, but the light didnt leave their bodies. It was cool as fuck. I spent the entire next day going over in my head how I was not crazy and everything was going to be ok. If they wanted me dead, I guess I would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to be very clear, this wasn't lucid dream, astral projecting, dreaming, I know all of those. I've had those and they are wonderful. This experience was not like any of those. At all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill never forget that feeling. Ill never stop searching now because of it. The room was also vibrating like a million vacuums were running in it. And there was no sound. Just this constant humming vibration, but with no real sound. I could feel the vibrations and I think interpreting it as sound, because I know I wasn't hearing anything.

       Something very similar happened to me a few months ago. Except I didn't see any figures like you did. I felt that same vibration in the room, it was almost as if everything was shaking or vibrating. There was also a bright white/yellow glowing light emanating from the windows. The entire thing lasted maybe a few seconds and I couldn't move a muscle. The closest thing I can describe it as is, you know when they show a nuclear explosion go off in movies? There's a bright white light, followed by a vibrating silence before the blast hits? It felt and looked like that, but of course with no explosion. I honestly thought I was being torn apart by a nuclear blast.

       The craziest thing I'm willing to admit I believe is that there very well may be a god, it very well may be incredibly evil, and we very well may be destroyed by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if that counts as a belief though, because I don't believe that, I just think that is a realistic notion of a God that may exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in case that doesn't count to some people, I'd say the craziest thing I'm willing to admit I believe is that life exists outside of birth and death. I don't know how, or under what conditions, but given the vast complexity of our reality, and the existence of spatial and temporal dimensions beyond those we experience as human beings, I think beings must exist outside of the confines of the mortal coil.

       But stars can be incredibly violent and destructive forces of nature. Why is "the stars" a good argument for some kind of benevolent nature of reality? I'm not afraid that there may exist an evil God. My conclusions are not based in fear.

       Creator made us all. We are in an experience of not knowing we are one with creator. Some of us choose to be parasites on others because of it. If you knew it was all you, you'd just see your current self as a cancer when doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       ETs are very similar in that they make this choice of how to treat others. Some become benevolent and proficiently so. Religious folks call them angels, while more grounded minds see them closer to what they are. They are not more godly than we are, they just behave more godly than we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demons evolve from the choice to be a parasite on others. They manipulate others to serve the self. They pose as gods in order to do that. They are evil, which is self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. So, they give us the myths of cruel, self-serving gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creator is the culmination of all experience, perspective and understanding. He is aware of all of his many selves. He manages the system. His interests are close to those of systems administrators. He allows evil in the hope we will develop an immune system response to it so he doesn't have to micromanage the system to keep it in balance. He asks us to balance ourselves and help balance the system. It would be more boring for us all if he was too active. We also couldn't forget we are him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Abrahamic religions are there to get us to see God as our master outside ourselves instead of as the hidden master inside all of ourselves. That way these parasites can use us for their own ends. When we know we are God, thy can't use that authority to command our hearts, minds and wills. There is no God higher than the truth and demons subdue God's selves with deception. They are said to facilitate the forgetting.

       Okay but then the judgment of quality depends entirely on the person making the judgment and their subjective experience with it, so why even ask if I have a better explanation of good and evil? Even if we define these two things similarly we are unlikely to judge them similarly.

       I layed out something better than mere opinion. When a hypothesis explains formerly unexplained things and is not contradicting observable reality, it makes it more valuable. Is that an opinion? It's coming kind of close to science FFS. Include testability and peer review and WHT do you have?

      <p>
       All of the above is nothing more than opinion, based solely in your own subjective experience and analysis, unless you can provide support for some kind of empirical basis in reality. It is not in any way approaching science.

       Referring to what you laid out above such as:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Creator made us all. 
2 Demons evolve from the choice to be a parasite on others. 
and 
3 Creator is the culmination of all experience, perspective and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not attacking you, I'm attacking your comparison of your worldview with science and scientific practices, and now I'm attacking your denial of that argument which is transparently available for everyone to see, which I will quote below entirely in case you realize how bad you fucked up and decide to delete it:
      </p>
      <p>
       Creator made us all. We are in an experience of not knowing we are one with creator. Some of us choose to be parasites on others because of it. If you knew it was all you, you'd just see your current self as a cancer when doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       ETs are very similar in that they make this choice of how to treat others. Some become benevolent and proficiently so. Religious folks call them angels, while more grounded minds see them closer to what they are. They are not more godly than we are, they just behave more godly than we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demons evolve from the choice to be a parasite on others. They manipulate others to serve the self. They pose as gods in order to do that. They are evil, which is self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. So, they give us the myths of cruel, self-serving gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creator is the culmination of all experience, perspective and understanding. He is aware of all of his many selves. He manages the system. His interests are close to those of systems administrators. He allows evil in the hope we will develop an immune system response to it so he doesn't have to micromanage the system to keep it in balance. He asks us to balance ourselves and help balance the system. It would be more boring for us all if he was too active. We also couldn't forget we are him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Abrahamic religions are there to get us to see God as our master outside ourselves instead of as the hidden master inside all of ourselves. That way these parasites can use us for their own ends. When we know we are God, thy can't use that authority to command our hearts, minds and wills. There is no God higher than the truth and demons subdue God's selves with deception. They are said to facilitate the forgetting.

       I.e. what you have laid out, as you suggest, is a hypothesis that explains formerly unexplained things and is not contradicting observable reality, which makes it more valuable.

       One could certainly make an argument against this, but that's beside the point, because what you say next is where you seal the fate of your arugment:

      <p>
       So besides testability and peer review, what you said above about angels and demons, as you
       <em>
        CLEARLY
       </em>
       imply here,
       <em>

       It's all right there, abundantly clear to see.

       Well, without peer review and testability it cannot be considered science. Yet mere observations of reality can be made and conclusions can be drawn. We all do this. We need no authorities to do it for us. It's not scientific, yet if we structure the ideas we arrive at as falsifiable, test them and then others test them and they are not proven false, it is pretty much science.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are trying to attack me with poor reasoning. It shows to those with the minds eyes to see it. I'm sure others will agree with your weak argument too. The truth is what it is no matter what we think about it or our peers think about it. I stand by what I said. I am open to discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who shut down discussions using dishonest methods may not have conviction of their ideas nor truth behind them. Those who don't fear the challenge of opposition indicate that confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could be asking me to elaborate on those unorthodox ideas I presented, but you'd prefer to twist what I say and attack me with it. It's a strategy of denial, but I suggest walking away is a better strategy if you're not interested in the truth of what is being discussed. It saves you and others time and doesn't open you to counterattacks.

       It reminds me what Bill O'Reilly does to his guests. It doesn't produce conversations of substance, but more like a sloppy rhetorical wrestling match where the truth is crushed while the participants roll over each other for more advantageous positions.

       This is a description of what you are doing right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have grossly overstated the merits of your argument in equating them in some way with science. I didn't do that, you did. That's dishonest. You misstepped, I pointed it out, now I'm some big bully for doing so. I'm apparently close minded for scoffing at your equivocation of your beliefs about angels and demons with science. Riiight.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I'm totally open to the possibility of what you suggest-to your magical worldview. I just think the probability of that version of reality having merit is incredibly low given the lack of evidence. Life after death is possible in my books, and entities that exist outside of our known reality is totally possible, too. However, I would never say that such a view is in any way comparable to scientific understanding. Not even remotely.

       You apparently don't understand what science is nor what I am saying. I explained myself adequately and you just don't get it. Your line of attack is dishonest. You insist I did something I did not as your line of attack. If you can't do better than that why should this conversation continue?

       Instead of thinking, "okay, this person is open to my ideas, cool." you decided to turn this into a dick measuring contest. You didn't ask, "What's your worldview regarding this?" You said, 'got anything better? So, I replied socratically with the question below:
      </p>

What makes an explanation of good and evil considered of exceptional quality?

       [–]thinkB4Uact 0 points 1 day ago 
They are attempts to describe reality. If the attempt answers questions and has few, if any conflicts or contradictions with what we believe exists, it's a noteworthy hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's fine, that's your answer, but I am my own person, and I applied my own judgment of that answer. It is not a good answer to me.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Okay but then the judgment of quality depends entirely on the person making the judgment and their subjective experience with it, so why even ask if I have a better explanation of good and evil? Even if we define these two things similarly we are unlikely to judge them similarly.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is mostly accurate because you said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If the attempt answers questions and has few
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But by what means does an explanation answer a question and have few questions itself? Is that not a judgment made by the observer? If it's not an entirely subjective judgment made by the observer, it must be something substantially objective, something repeatable that can be proven-i.e. either pure logic, math, or repeatable experimentation and the scientific method. You make this distinction clear when you say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        if any conflicts or contradictions
        <strong>
         with what we believe exists
        </strong>
        , it's a noteworthy hypothesis.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Generally speaking, a personal belief about existence is entirely subjective. Some peoples' beliefs are more objective than others, but when there are 5 major religions in the world, accounting for billions of people, overall personal belief is a subjective phenomena, so your statement can't apply to
       <em>
        humans in general
       </em>
       . You can apply this methodology to yourself, if you assume your beliefs are all objective-which I guarantee they aren't. No one's beliefs are all objective. No matter what, your judgment here is to some substantial degree subjective and relative to the person making said judgment. So what I say next stands:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        so why even ask if I have a better explanation of good and evil? Even if we define these two things similarly we are unlikely to judge them similarly.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By your own explanation of what gives an explanation of good and evil value, such effort is arbitrary and of little to no empirical value.

       I am guessing you are a former Christian or other Abrahamic religion follower. It is a guess not low hanging fruit for another dishonest attack of yours. It explains your intense aversion to considering what I proposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I presented a hypothesis that I admitted I cannot prove and cannot be tested. Then you attack me as if I have, because you think  that serves you in this argument. It hasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not wish to inflame a former believer. I love them. You seem like one. I have a passionate contempt for religion itself. It may shock you. I only use the words angels and demons as symbols to summarize many ideas they touch on. They are just fictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demons are just adepts at evil. Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. In life we have systems that provide value to consciousness for being and we have parasites that seek to utilize them so that they don't have to work as hard. This is the reason for people choosing evil. See it for yourself with introspection of yourself. When you are tempted to be evil, the temptation is to be parasitic on other systems to avoid contributing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings can choose to be neutral or disinterested in this conflict as can non-human intelligences. However, due to the conflict itself many beings are compelled to take a stance and more actively choose a path.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some human beings prefer to manipulate others to serve themselves. We have many of the world's historical leaders as manipulative self-serving beings. They are making the same basic choice as the idea of demons, but seem less extreme than myth. They are. We live in a mixed place.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are opposed by those who care about others, who observe the harm and opt to oppose it. Without them, evil reigns. You have probably done some of this yourself without defining it as such. When we do this, we are making the same basic choice as the idea of angels, but seem less extreme than myth. We live in a mixed place. We are weighed down by proficiently designed soul draining bullshit in many areas and it works as intended to drive us away from this path. Not all if it is designed of course. It's covert or it fails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, imagine for a moment that a horrible outcome for humanity happened and it didn't get solved by those who care to stop it. Some Kim Jong Un type demon acolyte somehow conquers the world and we don't choose to resist sufficiently and he maintains his rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientific advances solidify his power over others to alter them to serve himself. They are burdened, drained and used ultimately for the pleasure of the corrupt leadership/ownership. Perhaps extended life, awesome surveillance and effective coercion are even easier to achieve as they have become as we have advanced. Of course, this scenario relies on the inaction of those who care, but we do have them in our reality. So we hopefully won't fall for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest to you that we are a very young species. The universe is 13,000,000,000 years old, the planet is 4,000,000,000 years old. Our race in its current form is not even 1,000,000 years old, but our closer ancestors go back a few 1,000,000 years as we understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Condier that life formed elsewhere and not at exactly the same time. There could literally be civilizations billions of years old that lived and perished before we even had a viable planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, now consider how knowledge of physics and other people provides power to manifest your desires, your will. If your will is to support the free will and persist of happiness of others generally, you will cooperate with other to achieve this vision if mutual benefit to your self-interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you opt to be a parasite on existing systems you will find free will and obstacle to your will. People will not want what you want to do with them. So, you will have to overcome their free will with coercion or deception. This leads you on a path toward domination and control of others, manipulation of others to reveal yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time, you are going to get more knowledge, Powe and proficiency in your choice. It will become harder and harder for your hosts to overcome your parasitic oppression. You become a demon and have slaves, which probably become like you under your soul crushing, joy crushing shadow of self-serving behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all demons are. They are no unstoppable esoteric things. They are useless eaters of value, aged to imperfection, free to cause hell for others as they will. They are like disease. They exist because they can and want to be that way, and nobody has killed them yet. That's the story of diseases generally.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, don't get hung up on demons an angels. I don't believe in them as religion does. I just see those as volatile, extremely flawed symbols that describe a reality I understand. They can help me avoid pecking out paragraphs of explanation which are often just unread, but they trigger people into dogmatic thinking or extreme opposition to my ideas. I cannot win it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see what I am saying in this particular post as common sense. How else would it be? Muddying the waters is easy. Propose alternative ideas or I don't give a shit about you nonexistent opinion. I am not swayed by doubt without substance, no matter how much pressure is brought to bear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is my new God and no God is higher than it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attack me more or engage in something productive, but I have no more time to respond to your dishonest assertions misrepresenting what I said.

       I have no problem considering what you have proposed. I have a problem with you misrepresenting the merits of what you have proposed in drawing comparisons between it and science, and then denying that you did this, because your feelings were hurt when I didn't agree with you. I didn't ask you to elaborate on your beliefs. I have nothing to gain from affirming your beliefs, but you do. Truthfully I am growing tired of your persistent denial, and now your continued attempts to convince me of your worldview which I never asked you about in the first place. I'm glad you have found some kind of belief structure that you're content with, but truthfully I am not interested, and honestly your gross misrepresentation of your argument from the beginning has left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm simply done and don't care to further rehash this with you.

      <p>
       They observe reality, make hypotheses, test  them in every conceivable way to disprove them, allow others to repeat the experiments and if they can't disprove it either, then we consider it true until someone proves it wrong, which happens more than you'd think. The best scientists are hungry for ideas that explain formerly unexplainable things without contradicting observable reality, believe it or not.

       Ok, now what if we somehow had the technology to test these ideas? Well, then what? If we formulated them into falsifiable statements, repetitively tested them, had others do it and they were not proven false, it would be science.

       Are you seriously still on about this? You can't just admit that you got your feelings hurt because I didn't agree with you? That what spurred all this. Look, I didn't make you say any of this stupid shit. That was all you. You can go on being defensive about your worldview and justify having an overinflated sense of intellectual worth.

       I said my ideas are hypothesis not something I even believe wholeheartedly. You twist what I said and project your own pettiness. I don't give a damn what you believe or consider anymore. I did have interest in your beliefs before, because the word "maybe" indicated that you possibly had preexisting content contradictory or complimentary to what I presented. Now I know your ideas are largely or entirely products of greater minds than yours, which is apparently not even capable of or interested in considering ideas without committing to belief or disbelief in them. You don't have the intellectual integrity to do such things. You are the type that finds an official and repeats what they think. That would explain your poor reading comprehension skills and dishonest debate behaviors. Maybe you should get into scientific journalism, you'd fit right in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't admit I was wrong, because I wasn't and I have the strength to admit it even if a pack of fools like yourself caw in unison. You failed to address my clear points, because you can't. You have demonstrated a deficiency in capacity that is required to even have such discussions. All of the text we wasted, over misperceived wording, over ego, when it could have been about your nonexistent perspective on a matter you apparently don't even think about. What a waste of time your kind is to debate with. I meet them a lot. I usually immediately disengage in real life. Online, I enjoy tearing your kind down for being so out of integrity. It won't damage my real life occupation when I do it online.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that one cannot ever win a debate with someone who doesn't care about the truth. All you appear to care about is winning. That is why you focus on distorting a small part of what I said despite more than adequate explanation, contributing virtually nothing toward discussing the substance of my initial commentary. How pathetic and virtually useless your contribution has been. Only the demonstration of your lack of integrity had value in all of this, only for me though. I know this gets buried. I don't mind that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a nice life finding the appropriate anus to shove your mind into for second hand understanding. Hey, for some people, thinking hurts. Better leave it to the professionals in that case, eh? Actually, open minded intellectuals are a self-selected group. If you don't choose to be that way, you won't be. You won't be.

       I think humanity came from mars (not necessarily originating there) after destroying ourselves and crash landed here on earth destroying the dinosuars along with most of our tech and specialists, catapulting our new planet into a global ice age which further helps to thin out our remaining survivors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further i believe Most folk-lore, myth and legend comes from our ancient understanding of science and the natural world which has been distorted through word of mouth as we lost our technological means of storing information and the ice age combined with lack of manpower or machinery prevented the acquisition of materials useful to keep a written record not to mention such a record would be unlikley to survive all that time and transcription isnt much better than word of mouth.

       I've been toying with the idea that all of the stone writings we've been finding from ancient civilizations were not the typical way that they communicated and were more of a last resort/final warning to future generations to not make the same mistakes that they made.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are to believe that the Egyptians or Sumerians or whoever were fairly advanced, then it makes little sense for them to communicate in such an archaic manner. I don't know exactly what they knew or were
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to know, but there is clearly plenty of evidence to point towards the idea that they knew
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       that we don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what would survive a gigantic flood or some other mass extinction-level event? Stone. So what better way to leave messages for future peoples than to carve it into stone? I'm not sure exactly what they were trying to say, but I think maybe they knew something bad was coming and wanted to, in a sense, leave evidence of what they were working on or at least some indication that they existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hardly a historian. This is just some rough idea I've been throwing around lately. But I think if you look at ancient history through this lense then things start to make a whole lot more sense, imo.

       That everything began as a single, monolithic consciousness. It was aware of itself and aware of state A vs state B. With this awareness it realized it could split itself up into two or more. After doing this it could interact with itself, learning more about what it is, what it's potential is, etc. At this point it had split itself up innumerable times (but not infinite, because it is still a real thing and infinite is only an abstract concept that cannot be real) and it realized that in order to learn more about itself it should create more restraints and rules for interaction. Out came virtual realities (or as we call them physical matter universes). These 'individuated units of consciousness' or 'IUOC' which were young and learning about what they are, incarnated into bodies to 'play' as a virtual character in these virtual realities. What this did was create a clear cause and effect for the IUOCs so they could evolve quicker, interact with other parts of themselves and in doing so evolve the whole consciousness that began in the first place. This is us and this is what's happening right now. Some questions remain: if this is a simulation, if the one big consciousness that began as un-individuated was simulated, then there must be some place or entity or being or sourced that clicked 'Go' on that consciousness. We can never know this source because we exist within and as consciousness. In the same way that gut bacteria can never know about tractors and farms, just the food that slides down into the stomach, we cannot know what is outside our realm. Yet, a source there must be. Other questions: what are we doing here? We are evolving the quality of each of our individuated units, which evolves the whole. If this is a VR, there is no reason why there are not other VR's (universes). Think, if you were the director of all this, would you not have multiple simulations being played out to learn more about what you are? This one can have a framerate of C, another one can have a different value for C. The universe sets the basic rules for how the creatures can play. This belief in a VR and consciousness being all that is and everything else is just data can actually be backed up with some evidence (double slit experiment, solving the paradoxes of our current science, answering age old questions like does a tree make a sound if it falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, etc) but until it enters the realm of modern science you are still crazy for thinking it. PM me if you want to learn more, these ideas and theories come from a single book (800+ pager with a lot of information from a guy who's been researching consciousness for 40 years), but whenever I mention it online people attack the shit out of it. This was a post about crazy beliefs so I felt comfortable posting here :)

       I'm not sure why specifically 2006 but after that year a huge amount of things started to change in weird and negative ways:  human relationships, politics, art, technology.  People spun out of relationships with other people and began to nestle themselves in their digital bubbles, never to return.  Of course the internet was around for over a decade already but this is really when I started noticing people becoming alienated from each other, not just because of technology.  It extends to just the general M.O. outside of the internet.  People stopped having sex with each other, stopped sharing deep opinions about things, became more cruel.  I don't mean the world ended in a literal sense.  Merely that there was an unconscious or subtextual collective agreement that humanity had failed and that a new, fake culture was needed to move things along.  Yeah, it was political but also artistic, musical, educational, etc.

       Hmm, I guess that all happened for me closer to 2008 or 2010. I can remember in the mid-aughts using technology to unite my friends, or keep up with old ones. Hrm, was using craigslist, email and MySpace more than the Facebook then. Google launched the Chromebooks in 2010. Hmmmm, interesting. Do you have more about this, like another thread here?

       I don’t believe anything crazy, or, better stated, if it

       crazy and I

       I do not rule out that there are extra-terrestrial UFO’s.  I am not fully convinced there are either.  However I am fully convinced that if there are extra-terrestrial UFO’s

        they are unmanned probes like voyager and actual biological aliens have never visited earth.

       That Hollywood personalities are in fact essentially "owned" by a party of sorts. Basically they claim credit, and ownership of your success, public image, and wealth. That a vast array of different people work together sharing the burden of heinous acts to keep these personalities in line. Whether it's through movies, TV shows, public appearances, award ceremonies, speeches, meet and greets, books, presentations, or any other appearances they are given a script to promote an image or concept to there fans.
      </p>
      <p>
       In example: Right now Tom Holland is very popular for his role as Spiderman. At some point he will be given a script or loose idea of where he is supposed to stand on political issues. Thus fans of his will in some extent adopt his views based off there love of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that these people have there entire lives manipulated to keep them in line. They are pacified and controlled with drugs, sex, excitement, and money. The harder they try to leave they are kept in similar to a spiders web.

       There's lots of evidence that certain actors (perhaps even most) are playing the same character over their careers.  I'm certain this is deliberate, whether they know it or not.  It's usually the ones who make stupid amounts of money.  Naturally, with this kind of investment on the line, the extreme control methods you mention would probably tend to go along with it as well.

       Well, I am not willing to admit this in RL to most, because of obvious, predictable reactions and their implications for the quality of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a force of parasitic beings controlling our planet for the purpose of farming spiritual energy from life, consciousness. The energy is created in positive emotions. It is radiated in negative emotions. If one is in chronic negative emotional states, they can absorb the energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the energy is created and held, one experiences joy, mental vitality, an energy to move one's body in life. As it is stolen by these spiritual parasites, they experience the same, joy, potential energy to exert mental effort. Those who lose the energy experience the opposite, suffering and a reduced energy and desire to move the body in life. It makes depression and the desire to end the pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can do this to oneself just by causing oneself to enter fear/protection/negative based emotional states too often. However these beings, due to their choice, their self-interest in stealing this energy, they seek to cause fear and pain to release it from others' consciousness. So, they evolve to appear and behave in what we perceive as demonic ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one understands that these beings are spiritual energy thieves, junkies that use others joy as their drug, then these apparent demons appear more like spoiled manchildren who refuse to balance their own self-interests with the of others. They choose to steal rather than allow others their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stealing property from others allows you to exchange them for money. So, stealing money is a more direct form of theft of their energy, their time and effort. Money, possessions, wellbeing, pleasing people and places create positive emotions for us and this energy of mind, joy inside us. To steal that joy itself is perhaps the most direct form of theft possible and old beings that choose to be parasites are likely to figure that out. This is where the path of being a parasite on other people leads.
      </p>
      <p>
       These spiritual parasites came here to farm that energy from us by covertly affecting our own internal thoughts as if they are our own. If we fail to reject those thoughts, they tempt us to emulate these spiritual parasites. As we do, we create spiritual energy releases from others and even ourselves, paying them off for sending us those thoughts. They recruit willing servants this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people are more aligned with being a spiritual parasite, a more formal relationship can be advantageous to these foreign spiritual parasites. Some of our elites work with them to establish slavery and pain for consciousness, in order to be more effective parasites themselves. They want money and power generally, but some of them want to steal joy as I explained, who have a comparatively more acknowledged relationship with the foreign spiritual parasites or the alignment of being a parasite. Being an economic parasite is a precursor, because money is the energy of humanity as they choose to accept the otherwise worthless paper and digital symbols for their time and effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their secondary goal is to convert our species into more minions for their hive. They do it by corrupting the environment of our souls' existence, our minds with their thought insertions, and our environment using us as tools as well as other minions hidden from our awareness. This causes us to make our choices with more painful experiences being used to determine the best outcome. As we collect experiences from their corrupt environment, we increasingly believe we must compete with others, harming them at times, to even have a decent life at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want us to be in negative emotions like the minions, evolve like the minions and be tools like the minions..
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps there will be more to come on my next break.

       Read Mein Kampf and you will find out. Maybe Hitler was just such a good communicator that he convinced the Aliens to support his cause. /jk However, if you don't want to read a book. Hitler spent most of his time ranting about the International bankers (aka the Jews) and the Rothschilds using money created from nothing to enslave the world in crushing debt that can never be repaid. Since ET didn't use money in space and usury was illegal in their space society they decided to back Hitler's cause to
       <strong>
        Liberate the planet
       </strong>
       from the international bankers. The Aldebarans however, did not support open warfare nor genocide so the Germans did not get any weapons but only a design for anti-gravity craft. The Aldebarans never physically came to visit Earth. Their only contact was through telepathy using the psychic medium Maria Orsic. It took a long time to get the design into into a working UFO prototype (seen here
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2hL1eT9.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/2hL1eT9.jpg
       </a>
       ). By the time UFO was ready WW2 was already over. After the war the Nazis built a few more UFOs and then set off to explore space and ultimately created a break away civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        A deeper red pill
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some believe the Aldebarans are the original progenitors of the Arian race as the Aldebarans themselves are a race of tall white blue-eyed blondes. The Pleiadians also have the appearance of being blue-eyed and blonde. These beings do not like to be called "aliens" or even "ETs" because they are not much different from Earth humans. They consider themselves to be brothers from outer space as they are just a more evolved version of human. This is why the Nazis consider blue eyes and blonde hair to be superior traits not because they are racist but because that is what the people from the Pleiades and Aldebaran look like. They say Earth people can't handle the truth and in most cases that would be right. Aldebarans are superior beings that live for thousands of years and never age. There are dark forces on Earth (Anunakis and such) trying to hold back progress by ensuring that our lives are nasty, brutish, and short instead of being long joyful lives that they were meant to be. Life was never meant to be hard work and struggle but rather a journey of love and creativity.

       Along that line; I believe human beings/brains are story telling lying machines who are as conscious or intelligent as they give themselves credit for being. Most of our reality is played out from the sub-conscious. Our senses are extremely limited and we have almost no perception of what is going on in and around us. And I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

       You can believe whatever you want to believe. Apparently this I what you are doing. I wrote what I did and those who care what is true can read it accurately. I can't force you to do so.

       If you don't want to accept my version of reality you don't have to attack me to reject it. It's a losing strategy you're going to find.

        Yet mere observations of reality can be made and conclusions can be drawn. We all do this. We need no authorities to do it for us. It's not scientific,

      <p>
       Correct, this is what you would call a subjective understanding of the world that doesn't remotely resemble science.

       <p>
        yet if we structure the ideas we arrive at as falsifiable, test them and then others test them and they are not proven false, it is pretty much science.

       It's not pretty much science,
       <em>
        that is science
       </em>
       . However, what you have failed to argue, is how your worldview on angels and demons is in any way falsifiable and testable. This is why I called you out on your bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it's bullshit.
