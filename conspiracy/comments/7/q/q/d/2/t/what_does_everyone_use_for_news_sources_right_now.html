    <div class="md"><p>Hannity. Okeefe. Tim Pool. Wikileaks. </p>

<p>also, I use MSM, but assume everything they say is probably a lie. </p>

<p>so like if don sour lemon went on CNN and said some shit was happening with DWS and Brazile or something, I would know there was some DNC happenings, but would ignore his spin on it, and Id start looking for actual details about it elsewhere. </p>

<p>Okeefe basically said they do this too, they have dozens of TVs with news on, and they watch it all, but trust none of it. you have to see what people are saying, but then ask questions, keep track of who is credible, who tells the truth and who lies about what, then put the pieces together yourself. you cant really just tune in the TV and then tune out your brain. you cant just expect someone to give you the straight honest news and think you can take that for granted. yea, some of the people ive mentioned are legit, but you can never be lazy. we honestly dont know if/when or how any of these people could be bribed, blackmailed, or replaced with CGI or look-a-like actors. </p>

<p>my advice is keep a simple news journal yourself. no need to write tons of notes every day...just the main stories, and if you catch someone in a lie, keep a note of it and why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i also check out hannity and some of the CNN blowhards about once a day.  and, because im not stupid enough to believe any of the shit they spew, i then go online and search for any pieces of truth that might have slipped out about whatever it is im interested in. finding real information is quite difficult, especially with hannity et al. always muddying the waters.  but if i want to hear someone else&#39;s opinion and interpretation of whats going on i usually check out jimmy dore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can give you the whole list of the dozens of outlets that I go to almost every day but that would still not help you on its own.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the way you compare notes and filter out the deception, noise and  (dis)infotainment.</p>

<p>I have no favorite sources since none can provide a decent track record. However, there are a few sources that stand out of the rest because they see the reality as far as it is possible based on the information that can be found.</p>

<p>Therefore, &quot;news sources&quot; is very broad for me because reading comment sections is also part of the news sources.</p>

<p>It is a daily training that I put myself through and I encourage you to do the same.</p>

<p>I can guide you on the way I am working but that requires commitment and dedication from both our sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the news I see comes from three independent social media platforms, from many different individuals. There are some subreddits I like on this site, notably this one and r/wayofthebern, and I sometimes check out r/all to get a sense of what mainstream media is pushing. I&#39;m also subscribed to many different channels on YouTube, more than a few of which are dedicated to news and politics, channels like Jimmy Dore or Tim Black. Finally, I&#39;m also following a few public figures on Facebook that help me stay informed too, not to mention seeing what friends and family are talking about.</p>

<p>I avoid most other outlets for news. Print publications are always a day behind and always pushing corporate and state propaganda. TV pushes the same shit, so I avoid that too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one site that is bias free. I think you have to be aware that everyone is spinning. And once your aware of that and are aware of a particular organizations leanings, you can seek out information from another site that leans the opposite way. The truth I believe lies somewhere in the middle. It&#39;s unfortunate because it does take a little work and you have to be diligent to avoid buying into things playing on your own biases.

<p>I subscribe to <em>New York</em> magazine, because it makes for excellent toilet reading. Can&#39;t do <em>Time</em>, <em>Newsweek</em>, or <em>Rolling Stone</em> anymore. I literally start arguing with the reporter while I&#39;m reading. <em>The Atlantic</em> seems to be worth the money. I&#39;m gonna read a few issues at the library and see if it&#39;s worth it. I worked for a small, independent paper in my previous location, I miss the shit outta that. Extremely local news and I personally mailed the 300 subscribers.
