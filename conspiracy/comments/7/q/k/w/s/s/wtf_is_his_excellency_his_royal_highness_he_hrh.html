       To the best of what I gather, the filer believes themselves to be part of a “royal” lineage, and has applied to the ICJ for return of family assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       the ICJ has a history of holding tribunals to return stolen/confiscated property to individuals after wartime seizures. The puzzling aspect is this “royal lineage” that the filer claims has been a secret keeper since ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t think it’s deep state simply because no way they would use traditional channels, especially those as ineffective and expensive as the international criminal court, to get what they want.

       Some quick googling tells me that on that day (July 16 1778), the French Navy started helping the US colonies in their war. I'll bet it's related to that and a loan. 
Edit: I must not be able to read... the date says 1782. But still. Same idea: it's a loan from the French to aid the Americans. Nothing major. 
Unless I'm missing something.

       It was indeed a loan from the King of France to the United States:

       It was eventually repaid to the revolutionary government of France.

       White Spiritual Boy is one of the many entities that certain factions of the cabal have used to try and gain access to the World Trust accounts, also called the Global Collateral Accounts and other names.  This is some of the documents they've tried to use in the past. Mostly it seems efforts like this are carried out by rogue groups from within the factions because they would be lacking the proper connections but have an understanding of how to get access so they use these docs to try and go around the usual process which is  normally done by high level dudes with access codes on what's called the "black screens". That's code for the terminals that are connected to the hidden economy of moving monies around from the Trust.
      </p>

       This is bad guys trying to steal from other bad guys.

       Last time there was an counting, the World Trust was estimated at around 90,000 trillion dollars, that's 90 quadrillion, in hard assets. On top of that is untold amounts of paper currencies from all over that have been paid as collateral for using the accounts for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, nobody should own the accounts, it should be shared by all.

       While there are no doubt real stockpiles of hidden wealth held by the elite, this claim is simply preposterous. That's thousands of times the "on the book" physical assets that exist, and would require some sort of secret wealth generation engine of vast power that is essentially impossible to achieve without broad participation of scientists, investors, and even maintenance people. Essentially hundreds of thousands of people would have to be involved and no one has said a word. That doesn't happen.

       Yeah, a Reddit post seems like the right level of citation for this nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just another variation of the Winston Shrout-style ramblings about imaginary economic structures. That somehow no actual professionals or experts have ever heard of, cannot be substantiated, and are completely inconsistent with observable facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's absurd to pretend that there are
       <em>
        hundreds
       </em>
       of times the globe's total wealth in
       <em>
        hard assets
       </em>
       in secret accounts. It's like saying there are 500 billion people in the world, not 8 billion, and oh you just don't see those extra people because they're "off the books" and living in secret hotels. All the extra people (or assets) would have ripple effects that would be completely obvious to observers, and you'd be able to point to authoritative sources rather than a Reddit thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just another variety of LARPing.

       This isn't the kind of thing your going to stumble upon a single internet page and suddenly find out its real.  You're gonna have to put it the effort. Its like 9/11 or JFK or any other massive conspiracy. There's no smoking gun, but a thousand data points that make a compelling case.

       Look into the Chiasso Incident and then look up what Neil Keenan has to say about, he was involved.  You won't find the names of the two Japanese diplomats involved anywhere in any news reports. But I happen to have a photo of the gentleman before they boarded the train and know their names.

       Related to this last one, all those stupid bond boxes with the fake billion dollar notes. There's lots of those fraud cases out there to look up.  What would anybody go through the trouble and spend the money on making fake bonds in denominations that don't exist?  And do it decades in the past then try to use them now?

       Yeah, I'm familiar with much of this stuff from following the misadventures of Winston Shrout and the whole Dragon Society jibber-jabber.

       When someone points out the inherent silliness of pretending there's
       <em>
        hundreds of times
       </em>
       the world's total wealth in
       <em>
        hard assets
       </em>
       lying around in secret accounts, it's not very persuasive to say, "look at the timeline on this guy's blog!"
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, with the thousands of people around the world who make careers out of studying and writing about the global economy, we're supposed to ignore
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of those books and treatises and instead put our faith in the blog of the guy photoshopping himself into Indiana Jones posters? Please tell me you aren't investing money with these bozos.

       Oh, got it. Didn't know you were already aware if of these fools and their shenanigans.  And no, I wouldn't get involved with any of these con men or their schemes. They're just trying to get piece of the pie. My point was, there is pie to be gotten.

       What I was getting at is there is indeed a gigantic hidden economy that has been used by the bad guys for a very long time.

       I love the amount of work they put into it seems like a sophisticated troll job. Great use of the hand of the king from Game of thrones. Who would put this much effort into this though and for what purpose is beyond me.
