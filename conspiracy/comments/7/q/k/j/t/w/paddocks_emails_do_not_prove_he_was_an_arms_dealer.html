<p>Paddock used to live in the Central Park Apartments in Mesquite, Texas. The address of these apartments is <strong>4804</strong> Via Ventura. Paddock sending emails to <a href="mailto:centralpark4804@gmail.com">centralpark4804@gmail.com</a> does not prove he was selling guns. <em>His</em> email is <a href="mailto:centralpark1@live.com">centralpark1@live.com</a>.</p>

Send emails back and forth to email addresses that can&#39;t be traced to other people, but other people can log in and read them and even send and respond to emails.

I was about to use a colloquial term that would besmudge one of the armed forces. Steve was a standalone guy, Ok. </p>

<p>Quite clearly he was going to say arms dealer. Use Ctrl-F and you will also find instances of the phrase: terrorist, 9/11, UFO, Hillary Clinton, pedo, cheese pizza, loliberals, Seth Rich, DNC, Obummer, Awan brothers, Saudi Arabia, MSM, CIA, FBI, deep state, ShariaBlue, JFK, Israel, globalist, Aaron Swartz, Anthony Weiner, Rothschild, Q, 4Chan, Anon, peyote, coyotes and shills.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t agree with this. </p>

<p>(A) What would be the purpose of sending such inconsequential snippets to himself? And </p>

<p>(B) Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to infer that he was sending those emails to someone else who now (or previously) lived in the same apartment block that he (Paddock) lived in?</p>

<p>To my eye, this has the look of a private way of identifying someone that Paddock knew, that would be indecipherable to anyone else. And that someone was someone who had lived in close proximity to Paddock, which would make sense if it was someone Paddock is meant to have known.</p>

<p>Could be wrong of course, but if Paddock were laying a false trail, then why didn&#39;t he reply to his own emailing to establish a credible sockpuppet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have been accusations made on other listings that innocent people who aren’t gonna cooperate with the desires of government or big business may have false charges levied against them. Nothing  - 1)discredited  2) removes entirely from the situation - like kiddy porn. Any chance paddocks brother could be innocent of these charges?  After this close call, Perhaps they were worried he would talk?  If drugs like coke come into play, as has been suggested, then they would have to be worried about paddock keeping a secret when the drugs are prone to contribute to spontaneous, irrational, and unpredictable behavior. What do ya all think?</p>
