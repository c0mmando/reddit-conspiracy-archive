       naw, because you made the assumption that just because the message is carried by multi-national news agencies that it is cosmopolitan in nature - which is complete and utter bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you are carrying information from other countries it doesn't mean that you are actually well versed in the culture and tradition of these countries and it certainly doesn't mean that you carry a global agenda.

       Cosmopolitan means
       <em>
        being everywhere at home
       </em>
       not just being a f**** billionaire. Your basic hobo is more of a cosmopolitan than a guy who forces his own traditions down everyones throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are actually very few newspapers which at least try to be cosmopolitan, which try to adept to local tarditions, culture and language.

       The dictionary definition of cosmopolitan is a place where multiple cultures are living. Major cities, where these multi national news corporations are, are the most cosmopolitan areas in the western world. A person who travels between these multi cultural metropolises would be called a cosmopolitan. Do you disagree?

      <p>
       Only and only if said person (or city) promotes an exchange between the cultures.  A conservative nationalist (regardless of political affiliation, religion or skin colour) which avoids the cultural exchange might live in a cosmopolitan city but is certainly no cosmopolitan.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g. FOX news is certainly no cosmopolitan news outlet altough they have headquaters in cosmopolitan cities.

       Well meant advice: Leave your home town, leave your country for a year. See the world, talk with other people. Worst think that could happen is that you get a broader view.

       Seeing the world outside of tourist and safe areas  shows you that much of the world is a grim place and not somewhere you'd want to live. Moreover, it shows you that Western culture and civilization is an amazing gift to humanity, and should be promoted all over the world.

       It also shows you the damage that a narrow understanding of "Western culture and civilization" did to the world. We are probably on the same page that lack of law, genocide complete lack of social security and rigid racial and social borders are
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to be proud of. But we are probably also on the same page when we cite the belief in
       <em>
        inherent
       </em>
       human rights and a
       <em>
        state of law
       </em>
       as the best things the western civilization has to provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationalism stands against the first principle by simply building arbitary borders and promoting a divide which has only arbitary roots in the real world. You don't promote principle by breaking them. You don't promote social equality (at least before the law) by looking down on homeless and minorities. You don't promote a
       <em>
        state of law
       </em>
       by having secret tribunals which hand out death sentences..

       Just change the subject to one discussing actual, relevant information. A lot of threads tend to quickly switch to jokes and off-topic discussion. We need to be more careful about that, so here is some information.
      </p>
      <p>
       This topic can be divisive, but it shouldn't be. Both sides submit false police reports. People from both sides have decided that they really wanted to feel like victims, and creating a fake story would help "spread the word" about their oppression. We should all be against fake "victims," no matter where they come from, because it takes away from the true hate crime stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a huge list somewhere out there of tons of these, but here is a list of the ones I found interesting and which had a decent news article to go with it. Oftentimes these are reported in the national media and the article is then later corrected, which means there are more people who see the initial allegation than the correction, which makes it seem like there are a lot more hate crimes than there really are. Sometimes the biggest stories that go viral in the media are the ones that turn out to be false.

Eleesha Long said she was assaulted and called a racial slur, but BG police said she made the story up. Long wrote a police complaint on November 9th that reads in part, "while walking down Crim St to ask for yard signs, three boys began to throw rocks at me." Long continued to write the white males shouted profanity at her while wearing Trump shirts. She described how all three young men looked and what they were wearing.

According to prosecutors, the 25-year-old McKelvey tweeted threats from a campus library because she wanted more people to attend the November 17, 2015, rally on racial issues. She then returned to the rally to tell people about the threats.

       Openly-gay Pastor admits he lied about a Whole Foods incident that caused a public outcry, claiming that a cake he bought at Whole Foods was decorated with a homophobic slur.  The company also released a statement saying that it reviewed security footage and determined that Brown had tampered with the cake.  He later said "The company did nothing wrong. I was wrong to pursue this matter and use the media to perpetuate this story.  I want to apologize to Whole Foods and its team members for questioning the company's commitment to its values, and especially the bakery associate who I understand was put in a terrible position because of my actions."

       That one was one of the sickest examples. The article doesn't say she is a white supremacist and mentions motives are unclear, but it wouldn't surprise me. Is there evidence of her motives? If so, I'll edit that in when I get back online.

       Did that article blame jews for pop and rap music? That article was cancerous to even skim through, all it tried to do was justify blaming all of jews for a bunch of bunk shit. It even acts like calling them more specific things isnt fair, you would think calling them the "elite" would make more sense then something as broad as "jew"

       The "last nigh in Sweden" quote was completely taken out of context. As usual. He was talking about a program on television about crime in Sweden that he watched the night before. And then Sweden had a major riot a month later anyway, after the international media blasted him for pointing out a "false narrative".

       Keep in mind that it is almost the year anniversary of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City_mosque_shooting">
        terrorist attack
       </a>
       that occurred against Muslims in Canada. It's not really surprising Canadians are still shook up and sensitive to anti-muslim bigotry after those 6 people were killed. I know I am.

       I agree that ethnicity doesn't matter. I think any human with a conscience would be upset by any senseless murdering, and would seek to end whatever root causes lead to the murder in the first place. In the muslim mosque attack, it was bigotry/alt-right ideology.

       No, that's far too general.  I am saying we should stand against violent, bigoted ideologies like the fascist alt-right, radical fundamentalist islamism, nazism,  etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said, it doesn't matter what ethnicity they are. Murdering innocent people should never be acceptable and we have to stand against ideologies that promote bigotry and violence, and defend the most vulnerable groups. Unfortunately, innocent muslims are a popular target in the current political climate. Even in this thread, someone was defending this anti-muslim terrorist attack.

       Correct - not hoaxes but an attempt to shape public opinion with false claims if racism to shift policy and law in favour of regressive Islamists. This was no doubt planned by the kidâs parents or some other influential adult. I am sure there were many Christians who pulled similar stunts over the years.

       No big conspiracy other than marching orders from the CAIR or MB playbook. International news?

Its fucking pathetic.

       All this said was "We really don't think this happened. We just don't think so." Then later: "We are just so glad this didn't happen. Thank god this didn't happen." Hmm. Sounds super solid there. Great digging, Top Mind.

        The
        <strong>
         non-binding motion
        </strong>
        , which condemns "Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination", passed on Thursday among a divided parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        It asks a parliamentary committee to launch a study on how the government could address the issue, with recommendations due in mid-November.
       </p>
       <p>
        The study should look at how to "develop a whole-of-government approach to reducing or eliminating systemic racism and religious discrimination, including Islamophobia,"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm still against this type of thing because it seems like a ridiculous overreaction on the part of the government in the face of how common actual violence targeting Muslims is in Canada (i.e. not very much at all), but you're equally overreacting here.

       With the exception of the word 'islamophobia', the motion looks at ALL forms, not just islam. So I suppose you could equally say that it is an anti-catholicism motion too.

       Not really. Its already illegal in Germany and U.K. and considering Trudeau is also a Globalist Puppet and agrees with those 2 Governments, we will soon see the same deal in Canada.

       Really? Give me one example of someone in the United Kingdom or Germany being put in jail or fined for giving an honest critique of Islam. I'm well aware that those countries are more strict in their interpretation of 'hate speech', and as an American I've found myself inclined to disagree with their policies that limit the expression of ideas (though I also totally understand them), but I've yet to hear of anyone actually receive criminal punishment for "criticising Islam" in particular.

      <p>
       Except, he even says "Thereâs a range of experiences when people come home. We know that actually someone who has engaged and turned away from that hateful ideology can be an extraordinarily powerful voice for preventing radicalization in future generations and younger people within the community."
      </p>
      <p>
       Trudeau specifically says that the people he's talking about are ones that have turned away from ISIL's extremist ideology, and that they can be useful in teaching and preventing other people from making the same decision, much in the same way that people who had their lives ruined by drug use or committed grievous crimes (i.e. sexual assault, murder, etc.) are often some of the most prolific in speaking out against those things, including to youth. Nowhere in there is it apparent that he wants to bring ISIS fighters that still pose a danger back into the country, or that they should get away with any crimes they may have committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And "taxpayer-funded social programs" for rehabilitating former jihadists is just the same as having "taxpayer-funded social programs" for rehabilitating drug addicts or criminals in prisons. It's part of a much larger political argument in general and not really relevant.

       He's saying that because there are zero laws preventing Islamic Immigrant radicalized Terrorist ISIS fighters from returning to Canada, Sweden, Germany and England, so of course he has to say some shit to cover his ass.

       The people indicted as per this article were from countries like Egypt, not Germany or the UK. In fact, the article even mentions the Venice Commission's 2008 decision to remove "blasphemy" from its list of hate crimes, indicating a step opposite the direction you seem to be implying.

       This is in line with existing laws. You can't just hurl religiously motivated insults at people in public and expect to get away with it in the U.K. This is not some woman giving an honest critique of Islam in the slightest.

       Again, this is part of the same debate as "should business owners be allowed to decide not to serve people for discriminatory reasons?" argument. The same could be made for any ethnic minority (or the majority), or homosexuals, or whatever. There are laws against this in Canada and the US. If you think that the right of a business owner to decide who and who not to serve (regardless of reason) trumps the right of individuals to have equal access to things in the market, that's fine, but that's a totally separate argument and isn't indicative of some "conspiracy to illegalize the criticism of Islam."
      </p>
      <p>
       You seemed to have missed my point. I already acknowledged that European laws restricting what they define as "hate speech" are considerably strong.
       <em>
        However
       </em>
       you've provided no evidence that people are actually being indicted for
       <em>
        legitimate
       </em>
       criticisms of Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Get these sandnigger rapefugees out of my country" is not a legitimate criticism of Islam, it's blatant hatred. Do I think it should be criminalized? No. But we're talking about productive criticisms, i.e. someone in
       <em>
        Western Europe
       </em>
       (not
       <em>
        Egypt
       </em>
       ) being imprisoned for giving an academic critique arguing that verses in the Quran are too suggestive of violence, or even just citing criminal statistics among groups of immigrants or migrants, which doesn't seem to have happened. Based on the way the law is written, I'm inclined to believe that the people getting arrested are actually inciting violence in their social media and not providing anything productive. You've yet to prove otherwise. When people in the US or Canada can be sent into jail for giving actual, honest critiques of Islam, like the man in Egypt, then we'll talk.

       Sensationalist headlines. Have you actually read the text of the motion? And you do understand what a motion is, right? It's not a law, or a bill...it's an opinion expressed by an MP. That's it. No law, no bills...no action on the part of government at all.

       So yes....nonsense. Sensationalistic nonsense, but nonsense nonetheless.

       Edit: And yes, even if the motion is passed, all it does is ensure that the topic will be included in discussion. There is no obligation on any part to actually do anything or take any stance.

       It's called " public incitement of hatred" " , even tho you are telling the truth, if it involves Islam and is negative in any way it's considered hate speech.

       It was false. A motion. Not a law. I'm 100% sure what you're saying is from some hyperbolized headline from a right wing media source. Always stretching the truth because you people don't seek the truth. You week reinforcement of your perspective.

       Lol ok dude. Keep playing into the elites hand and keep shooting down any idea that questions your own. Its not about right or left it's about what's going wrong and what we need to fix so our children can be protected and empowered. Fuck me tho right?

      <p>
       Edit: If the fact that this was a motion isn't concerning to you, you're a lazy thinker. Laws don't matter as much as culture, and Canadian culture has been pushing for censorship and protection of "minorities". Why can't you have a discussion without bringing right/left into it?

       Quebec is interesting when it comes to immigrants and cultural integration.   The Qubecois stridently defend French-Canadian culture from English language erosion but are also mindful of the reverse threat of being eroded from the bottom up.

       I really hope we don't re elect Trudau... unfortunately I don't see any really good options for us. I've been liking what I see out of Jahgmeet Singh as a person for the NDP (but they are a joke) and I can't realistically see us electing a visible minority (at lease not an Indian) yet. The conservatives are bad the Liberals are worse :-(

       Honestly it strikes me as foolish as someone attacking Trump for not denouncing the

        Benevolent Congregation Temple bombing
       </a>
       that occurred when he was twelve.

       The relation between these people to these events is just... It's virtually nonexistent. It's nothing more than sharing a race and a religion.

       Scheer is being completely ignored by the mainstream media. They spin Trudeau positive and conservatives negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NDP is not a factor. Trudeau is a predictable disaster. Even seeing the right and nationalist resurgence in the US, Trudeau is still repeating Obama's globalist mistakes. On purpose. He is actively making these bad decisions knowing that they are bad decisions. Which leads me to believe that he, like obama, are getting their marching orders from the globalists overseas.

       Really really canât stand Trudeau but this is the problem with the party system and no fixed length terms. Trudeau is in power because we voted Harper out, now we need to vote Trudeau out before this country becomes an extension of the Middle East, but look at who we might be voting in

       Yup that and Harperâs conservative government was a big reason he won. As a young voter myself in college at the time it was hard pressed to talk to anyone of my peers that werenât on the Trudeau train either against Harper, for the legislation of marijuana, or because of his âgood looksâ.

       Dude, the Islam one passed a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just haven't heard anything about it, because it wasn't actually a bill forbidding the criticism of Islam. It was a nonbinding motion calling on Parliament to condemn discrimination against Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've passed the same thing for Jews on multiple occasions, doesn't mean you can't criticize Judaism to your hearts content.

      <p>
       Hell, we even had one passed which explicitly denounced the whole BDS movement. It just wasn't a big deal, because nonbinding motions don't mean shit.

       He creates an us vs them mentality for minoritieis.

       Honestly its funny in this day and age though I was just thinking this the other day. We have more "information" now a days but less insight I feel. Maybe I was just too young to figure it out but 20 years ago when I was growing up I felt like the news (in whatever format) gave you the news. Now I feel like news is more like opinion peices on everything. But maybe thats just growing up and seeing the man behind the curtain.

       That is step one, yes. To make a law like this you need massive public outcry (look at the Patriot Act). Consistent attacks on Muslims would give the government an excuse to pass an actual law.

       pretty much this. A lot of what we see is virtue signaling for political gain. I can't say it's necessarily evil... both "sides" do it. It's just the way the game is played, and a lot of people aren't aware of that fact.

       Rofl. Lying "MSM" due to him not assembling the entire clock? He changed the assembly of the unit, therefore making it non-standard and "homemade".

       Or did you actually think he made the silicon wafers for the circuit boards himself? Fuck off with that bullshit and think critically for two goddamned seconds.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The episode arose when Mohamed reassembled the parts of a digital clock in an 8-inch (20 cm) pencil container, and brought it to school to show his teachers. His English teacher thought the clock resembled a bomb, confiscated it, and reported Mohamed to the school's principal. Local law enforcement was called and Mohamed was questioned by police for an hour and a half. After being handcuffed and taken into custody without being permitted to see his parents, he was transported to a juvenile detention facility where he was fingerprinted and his mug shot photograph was taken. He was then released to his parents. It was alleged that the reason for his arrest was for purposely trying to cause a bomb scare. The case was not pursued further by juvenile justice authorities; however, Mohamed was suspended from school.

       What he's referring to is that it became apparent the kid knew exactly what he was doing by rigging up something that looked like a cartoon bomb and disingenuously calling it a science project or whatever. It also turned out the family had a history of playing the Muslim card and demanding restitution over alleged slights. They're known scammers.

       The only difference between a DIY electronic clock and a bomb of this type is that the latter contains explosive. If the maker's really trying to hide the explosive(possible in small amount), then not even an engineer can tell the difference without decontructing it.

       Because all that matters is what people remember. Once they hear from an "expert" or someone in a place of power, they file it away and move on to the next thing. By the time the truth comes out, most people have forgotten the story and just don't care anymore, and they go on remembering whatever was initially told to them.

       There is mass coverage of these events when they take place, say 50% of mass media consumers read of the story or are informed indirectly. Politicians grand stand and get point. The media then quietly retracts and corrects days or weeks later, then say 5% of mass media consumers read of the correction or are informed indirectly.
      </p>

       It's just a numbers game and a narrative to the politicians, the truth doesn't matter. The same can be said for the "journalists".

       The girl is 11 years old. I suspect her. Kids are fucking stupid and will make up all sorts of retarded stories for retarded reasons.

       Girl probably took it off but didn't want to get in trouble so made up some story about what happened to it.

       They had sources in the form of police releases. I agree that news organizations will jump at anything that will rile up the masses and turn it into a way bigger story than it should be. However, that does not equal a conspiracy in my mind. It speaks more to the state of society and discourse right now than anything.

       What doesn't make sense though is that there is no report of it coming off, only being cut.

       Who knows.  Maybe she took it off and it dropped into some dogshit.  So she cut the dogshit stain out and invented a story as to why the hijab has got a whole in it.  Better somebody cut a hole in it than she dropped it into dogshit.

       I doubt it. In another sub I put out a potential explanation: let's say she doesn't want to wear the hijab, so she takes it off when she leaves home. Maybe it gets dragged on the ground and winds up with salt stains - can't explain that to mom and dad if you were wearing the thing on your head all day - so you cut off the stained part and make up a story.
      </p>
      <p>
       To assume that the news has a responsibility to say "we don't believe her story, and
       <em>
        this is what really happened
       </em>
       " is a bit much. Maybe her dad is a raging asshole and they don't want to print that. Maybe she personally doesn't believe in the religion but is terrified of her parents finding out. The cops would have known that and they would protect her above giving the public a few meaningless details.

       The media is hard to blame, because they only go after what the public will pay attention to. I generally tend to blame the people who pay attention to this garbage before it's investigated because they are creating the market for it.

       This. We don't know why she made up this story but it's far more likely that her dumb 11 year old brain thought that making up a story about being attacked could accomplish her end goal. She probably just doesn't want to wear a hijab anymore. Or maybe she has some social situation going on at school and wanted her friends to pay more attention to her. I don't know. But that is a far more likely explanation than some sort of wide ranging international conspiracy involving government organizations.

       I don't know the story but why on earth is an 11 year old wearing a hijab in the first place? It's to stop temptation in men.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore there are women right now fighting against this crap in their religion obsessed countries, yet the west seems to pander to the oppressors by letting even kids cover their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many of them don't want to wear this and hope that going to a western country, someone will help because it isn't mandatory there. And when they get there they are surprised that the old ways are nurtured under the guise of political correctness and there is no way out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That must suck.

       A lot of women and men want to wear their traditional headdress, but they also are given the freedom to not wear it if they want. I'm sure there are some in oppressive families where the father or husband demands they still wear it, but if they chose not to the law is on their side. Nobody can force them to wear it or take it off, at least for everyday use.

       You'd be otracized from the "Muslim community" for exercising the right to not wear it in Canada. Which is totally fine considering you live in Canada and can make new friends that aren't strict muslims, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is hardcore Muslims refuse to make friends with atheiests or christians,  we are infidels to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why people need to assimilate when they come to Canada, fuck these outdated religious practices.

       the freedom to not wear it but then the judgement of the whole community (which will be predominantly negative).

       toning down the headgear to whatever level won't make life easier for those unfortunate souls born into that system.

       for those people, leaving/living less in line with that system costs a great deal and can be very painful.

       Because religions are fucking stupid. In the 5th grade I gave a girl a teddy bear on the last day of school. She went to her parents as they were picking her up... they made her come back and return it to me because "Jehovah's Witnesses only date for the purpose of marriage".
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF? Did those idiots think that me, a 10 - 11 year old, had intentions with their daughter? No, they're just fucking morons that blindly believe a religion, because they're too stupid to think for themselves.

       As an American I'm hoping my Canadian neighbors are seeing what Trudeau really stands for. Just like the case with Obama, many people were fed up, sick of the status quo and him saying all the things he thought the people expected him too, while doing a whole lot of nothing to improve our country. Since your next election is approaching soon, do you see many other Canadians ready for something new? Are their any potential candidates that have a chance to get elected and straighten things out? As someone who lives only 10 miles from Ontario and visits quite often, I sure hope the people see the damage that's being done and vote to change it.

       Trudeau is pretty low on the polls, he's at the same popularity level than Harper was before getting kicked out. But Scheer (conservative party leader) is not higher either, probably because the media isn't showing him. I'm sure it will get better as 2019 elections approach. Trudeau can't seem to stop messing up.

       âI felt really scared and confusedâ â girl attacked twice by man who cut her hijab in Scarborough
      </p>
      <p>
       11-year-old Khawlah Noman says she was walking to school with her younger brother when the man approached and cut her hijab. Police say they are treating the attack as a hate crime. They are seeking one suspect described as an Asian man in his 20s.
      </p>
      <p>
       When her attacker pulled her hood down, she said he cut her hijab from the bottom up. Terrified, she turned to face him â a young Asian male, roughly 5-foot-8 to six feet tall, wearing black pants, a black hoodie and brown gloves. He had a moustache, the girl told police, and glasses, too. He was smiling at her.
      </p>
      <p>
       The assault against Khawlah, a student at Pauline Johnson Junior Public School in Scarborough, is being condemned by leaders from all three levels of government as unrepresentative of Canadian values.
      </p>
      <p>
       âI canât imagine how afraid she must have been,â said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in an unprompted statement of support for Khawlah at a news conference in London, Ont.

       When a polish man was stabbed in London shortly after brexit the Polish PM came to the spot to blame brexit voters. It was just local youths who harassed everyone. So now nobody cares.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       When Grenfell happened the PM was criticised for saying nothing, there was a London Bridge terror attack shortly afterward, she said nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       then man from wales crashed his car into people leaving a jihadi mosque and the PM immediately gave a press conference claiming his actions were antithetical to British values and said his hatred and evil would never be tolerated.

       to the people who say that the sub blasts hoax claims all over everything, obviously we will hit something true.... search the sub using the keyword hoax, its usually pretty defined in its range and not "shotgun blast" or "everything"

       also theres precedent for these kinds of things being false reports, jews have scribbled swastikas on their own doors, fake gay slurs, etc. its a common move and its not unfair to speculate that this one in particular would have been as well. turns out it follows the pattern. its not chance that people recognize this pattern.

       If anyone has actually bothered to read  that shit hole of a book called the 'Quran', it states that Muslims can lie to non believes if it furthers the growth of their religion. Hmmm... so could this possibly mean they can actively perpetuate lies as long as it helps only them? Yes, yes it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what the fuck do you think that opens the door to? 95% of anything out of a dirty muzzies mouth is a lie. They ultimately want to trash your religion &amp; replace it with their own, because they are too stupid to take care of their own country so they claim racism &amp; refugee then come fuck up everything your ancestors built. If you can't see that, you are part of the problem.

       Why is this such a big deal that it's got four or five stories on the front page? If there is any "conspiracy" here that would be it, but that's not really it. The problem is that people place their agendas above the truth. "Muslim girl lied! Racism does not exist! Who is lying and saying people don't like Muslims!?"
       <br/>
       That's the real message that people are putting across with posts like this. Why is it a conspiracy? Without knowing what happened to speculate is a waste of time and just provides a breeding ground for hysteria and ignorance. Maybe the girl lied to get attention. Maybe the "attack" really happened and it's being covered up. Maybe it was Hillary! She was going to #pizzagate this girl but she got away and Soros paid off the cops! Who knows? Why does it matter?

       It was a little girl at the heart of this. I imagine she wanted attention, or had something else going on in her life, that prompted her to make up a story without realizing that it would escalate to become this huge news story. Many children make up stories for a variety of reasons; they don't normally become international news sensations.

       The fact that she claimed the suspect was Asian is sinister in itself. Why? Because the area where she's from (Agincourt) is a home to a lot of Chinese families. In fact, the MP, the MPP and the Councillor are all Chinese.

       I doubt she made it up all by herself. It was most likely the work of her parents who have a narrative to push.

       We have potential laws upcoming in Canada to make it illegal to question Islam. Just Islam and not other religions. It is conspiracy. Itâs sad and pathetic and it is being used as a wedge issue to blind us to what the government is doing at the behest of their globalist backers.

       Sadly I think this one falls in the realm of clock boy; a seemingly innocent child whose father was then exposed as an anti Western,  pro Sharia law advocate who also condones terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really is a shame that parents can do this to their children to create conflict in a continent that celebrates diversity, the one thing these radicals are trying to exploit. This is of course my view of clock boy but I won't be surprised if this gets exposed as an extremist family member/parent trying to stir a pot.

       I read an article this morning saying even though this was a hoax, there are plenty of muslim haters out there to be afraid of...as if anyone believes there are no racists out there. How is that news? This just in, some people can be jerks.

       I mean, itâs a little different to dislike someone because of a philosophy that they espouse and implicitly support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Race is an immutable characteristic, hating someone for an immutable characteristic is always wrong.
      </p>

       Disliking or being wary of someone who thinks a pedophile warlord is the perfect example of human behavior is pretty normal.

       ok...I think my point was lost somewhere in here.

      <p>
       My point was, take the Hawaii missle incident for example, while not a hoax it was a false alarm. Do we really need to be reminded that a hostile country could fire a missle at us at anytime even though they didn't do it yet? Stating the obvious.

       I understand what you meant, but in your original comment you implied that Islam is a race, or people who dislike the religion are racists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thereâs over a billion Muslims on the planet, from all sorts of different races. I was just trying to clarify that people who dislike Islam arenât necessarily racists. Thereâs plenty of reasons from a secular humanist perspective to dislike Islam.

       If I'm not mistaken this exact same thing happened two days after the election.  A woman claimed her hijab was ripped off by a guy in a MAGA hat and the police later determined she was lying.

       Never any calm rational souls among the politicians simply saying that the report is being looked into and advising everyone not to jump to any conclusions until the police have done their job and thoroughly investigated the incident, not even among the police themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't expect any of them to apologise anytime soon for being the blubbering idiots they all happen to be but who knows maybe they'll try to act a little bit more like the reasonable and responsible officials we're paying for them to be a little more often after this complete farce and how utterly ridiculous they've made themselves look.

       No question in some thirty million Canadian minds about what was genuinely un-Canadian about this event and it wasn't the incident but how it wasn't rather than was handled right from the get-go.

        Really? Give me one example of someone in the United Kingdom or Germany being put in jail or fined for giving an honest critique of Islam. I'm well aware that those countries are more strict in their interpretation of 'hate speech', and as an American I've found myself inclined to disagree with their policies that limit the expression of ideas (though I also totally understand them), but I've yet to hear of anyone actually receive criminal punishment for "criticising Islam" in particular.

       Scheer is being completely ignored by the mainstream media. They spin Trudeau positive and conservatives negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NDP is not a factor. Trudeau is a predictable disaster. Even seeing the right and nationalist resurgence in the US, Trudeau is still repeating Obama's globalist mistakes. On purpose. He is actively making these bad decisions knowing that they are bad decisions. Which leads me to believe that he, like obama, are getting their marching orders from the globalists overseas.

       I actually think this is an alt of a user who has been banned on several accounts here. Gibberish name, use of text speak, typos, and use of âr subredditâ rather than
       <a href="/r/subreddit">
        /r/subreddit
       </a>
       , likes to stir up shit and call people shills. A previous post I made about the accounts

       Exactly. Banning opinions should tell you all you need to know about their veracity.

       Sorry I'm not fluent in antisemitic code. I asked someone to clarify their vague comment and in response got someone else changing the subject to a random list of hate crimes and I mistakenly thought they were the same person.

       The fact that she claimed the suspect was Asian is sinister in itself. Why? Because the area where she's from (Agincourt) is a home to a lot of Chinese families. In fact, the MP, the MPP and the Councillor are all Chinese.

       I doubt she made it up all by herself. It was most likely the work of her parents who have a narrative to push.

       It's pretty pathetic they locked the thread and claimed "brigading" when there was no evidence of that whatsoever.  Then they locked another thread that started.  I wish we could hold Reddit mods accountable.
