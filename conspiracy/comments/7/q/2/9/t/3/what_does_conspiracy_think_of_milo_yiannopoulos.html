<p>The first time I really started hearing about him was after the pulse nightclub shooting and he gave a speech about how America needs to be careful about allowing Islam into America and stating stats, etc about his home in the EU.</p>

<p>I&#39;m genuinely curious about this person. Is he a valid person that occasionally talks about reasonable things or he is just one big troll out to <em>&quot;trigger the left&quot;</em> and make money off controversy?</p>

He did so because he was only 14 when a man more than twice his age seduced and groomed him. He claims this was a good event in his life and was healthy. After that a lot of people stopped listening to him.</p>

<p>Milo has experienced pain and trauma and hasn&#39;t come to terms with the fact that it fucked him up hard core, and even defended the practice saying other gay boys should be open to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the pedo thing was taken somewhat out of context, it seemed more like rationalizing his own experience but who really knows for sure? </p>

<p>As far as if he’s genuine, I’d say he falls somewhere between that and a troll, but closer to the troll side. Obviously he is famous for trollish behaviour, but like you said, a lot of what he does is state statistics that people don’t feel comfortable hearing. </p>

<p>I’m not really a fan, I mean he is entertaining and I like that he doesn’t just bow to PC pressure, but I don’t think he contributes anything at all of substance. If you’re looking for a conservative firebrand who is actually intelligent and adds to the discussion rather than devolving it to quasi-bigoted rhetoric, you’d do better with Ben Shapiro. I don’t agree with huge amounts of what Shapiro says, but it’s always well thought out and logical. </p>

<p>The main difference in my mind between him and Shapiro (other than 20 IQ points) is that milo tries to piss people off, whereas Ben just speaks his mind, explains his reasoning, and doesn’t care if it’s offensive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He just started a new podcast / daily video show, it&#39;s free for this month then it&#39;s going up behind a pay wall. Five or so episodes in and I enjoy it, he&#39;s trying to figure out how to structure everything, it feels amateur at times but he put a lot of money into the setup and he makes a great host imo. But I wouldn&#39;t pay for the content and I generally like Milo, you gotta earn that fifty bucks a year, it feels like a rushed attempt to stay relevant by jumping into an arena he hasn&#39;t proven himself to be competent in, a daily show. I contribute to a few interment personalities - Corbett, Shapiro, Crowder, THC and a few more. I don&#39;t think his reputation alone is enough to put that pay wall up at the end of January. </p>
