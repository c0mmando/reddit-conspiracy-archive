<blockquote>
<p>Until the 1980s, Haitians grew enough rice, beans, maize, sweet potato and cassava to feed themselves. But then, after the overthrow of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986, Haiti began to liberalise the economy. “The IMF and the World Bank decreed that we apply structural adjustment”, said Camille Chalmers from PAPDA.</p>

<p>&quot;They told us that we’re right next to the biggest agricultural producer in the world, so there was no reason to produce our own food because we could buy it cheaply. Instead of farming, peasants should go to the city to sell their labour to US assembly plants that make textiles and electronics for export.”</p>

<p>Thousands of peasant livelihoods were destroyed. According to the PAPDA statement,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a country seems like a shithole, it isn&#39;t that way because the people are bad. It&#39;s because of the way the country is run.</p>

<p>In Haiti&#39;s case, the leadership is a small group of selfish rich fucks and some sellout pols who run the country on their behalf.</p>

<p>You can say the exact same thing about a lot of other countries too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with your assessment. The personal actions of the individuals in society is what shapes things. And your actions reflect your genes and the environment you where raised in. </p>

<p>If your society is taken over by a corrupt government, or wealth elites, it&#39;s because the common people in your society allowed that to happen, and didn&#39;t resist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree up to a point although the public is rarely ever aware of who is or isn&#39;t corrupt or stooging for the elites until after they&#39;ve elected them and the damage has been done.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid most people here seem to have forgotten all about Haitian populist President Papa Doc Duvalier and his private militia, the vicious Tonton Macoute that murdered somewhere between 30 and 50,000 people and forced countless others to flee the country. </p>

<p>He ran the country from 1958 till his death in &#39;71 only to be replaced by his son who carried on the tradition of torturing and killing anyone that dared to disagree with him, too, until he was finally overthrown in &#39;86. Since then it&#39;s been pretty much been one military coup after another with only brief periods of democracy being restored only to toppled by the military again.</p>

<p>Haiti was and still is the absolutely poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. With that lowest standard of living comes equally low standards of health, education, and welfare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree as well, it just seems people are far too willing to blame those in power, or some shadow council. People are advocating things like the French revolution or the Haitian revolt, which will only dig their hole deeper. </p>

<p>Their has to be stability in the Haitian household. Only then can they hope to progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be more inclined to actually blame the US and US meddling and exploitation throughout Latin-America and the Caribbean for the multitude of problems and instability that presently exists among virtual all those small and still struggling nations to some degree or another. </p>

<p>What the CIA refers to as &quot;their backyard&quot; where it uses and exploits those smaller and less developed nations as a kind of test range for all the various clandestine and underhanded methods of gaining political control that serve US corporate interests and ambitions to set up business an drain all the profits out of them, just as it does elsewhere. </p>

<p>Something else and more immediate that needs to be added to this discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing in the article about &quot;The Rothschilds&quot;.

The Rothschilds have nothing to do with either institution.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that much about the Haitian economy, but the number of farmers has decreased in <em>every</em> country around the world for centuries. Countries where everybody is a farmer are poorer and, usually, have less food and less variety of food, as well as less of everything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haitians made Haiti a shithole when they allowed a psychotic dictator to take over and reverse the national progress to levels only seen in previous centuries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvalier_dynasty">François Duvalier</a> was one of the worst things to have ever happened to that country and they only really have themselves to blame for it. He brought a new level of corruption, greed, and evil that just became the norm. It&#39;s a very similar story to numerous other nations in that region as well as africa, and asia.</p>
