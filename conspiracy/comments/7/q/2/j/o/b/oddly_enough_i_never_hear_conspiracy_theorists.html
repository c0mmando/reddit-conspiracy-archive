      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Williams Safire wrote in the New York Times:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The B.C.C.I. scandal involves the laundering of drug money, the illicit financing of terrorism and of arms to Iraq, the easy purchase of respectability and the corruption of the world banking system.
      </p>
      <p>
       For more than a decade, the biggest banking swindle in history worked beautifully. Between $5 billion and $15 billion was bilked from governments and individual depositors to be put to the most evil of purposes — while lawmen and regulators slept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the fight among investigators is coming out into the open. Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who gave impetus to long-contained probes, told a Senate subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry that he is getting no cooperation from the Thornburgh Justice Department.
      </p>
      <p>
       Justice’s Criminal Division chief, Robert Mueller, tells me he will have a hatchet-burying session with the independent-minded D.A. next week, and vehemently denies having told British intelligence to stop cooperating with the Manhattan grand jury.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mueller’s handling of the BCCI scandal as the point man for the Justice Department was widely criticized.  As noted by a Senate report written by Senators Kerry and Brown:
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the past two years, the Justice Department’s handling of BCCI has been criticized in numerous editorials in major newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the New York Times, reflecting similar criticism on the part of several Congressmen, including the chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Kerry; the chief Customs undercover officer who handled the BCCI drug-money laundering sting, Robert Mazur; his superior at Customs, Commissioner William von Raab; New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau; former Senate investigator Jack Blum, and, within the Justice Department itself, the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Dexter Lehtinen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typical editorials criticized Justice’s prosecution of BCCI as “sluggish,” “conspicuously slow,” “inattentive,” and “lethargic.” Several editorials noted that there had been “poor cooperation” by Justice with other agencies. One stated that “the Justice Department seems to have been holding up information that should have been passed on” to regulators and others. Another that “the Justice Department’s secretive conduct in dealing with BCCI requires a better explanation than any so far offered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Assistant Attorney General Mueller, the Department assigned nearly three dozen attorneys to the case. During 1992, the Department brought several indictments, which remained narrower, less detailed and, at times, seemingly in response to the efforts of District Attorney Robert Morgenthau of New York, the Federal Reserve, or both
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly, on August 22, Dennis Saylor, chief assistant to Assistant Attorney General Mueller, called Lehtinen and, according to the US Attorney, “indicated to me that I was directed not to return the indictment.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The Senate Report also noted:
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Justice Department’s handling of BCCI has received substantial criticism, the office of Robert Morgenthau, District Attorney of New York, has generally received credit for breaking open the BCCI investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In going after BCCI, Morgenthau’s office quickly found that in addition to fighting off the bank, it would receive resistance from almost every other institution or entity connected to BCCI, including at various times, BCCI’s multitude of prominent and politically well-connected lawyers, BCCI’s accountants, BCCI’s shareholders, the Bank of England, the British Serious Fraud Office, and the U.S. Department of Justice.

       The Original Time magazine expose includes interesting information in the light of 9/11 happening later.
      </p>
      <p>
       "
A typical operation took place in April 1989, when a container ship from Colombia docked during the night at Karachi, Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black-unit operatives met the ship after paying $100,000 in bribes to Pakistani customs officials. The band unloaded large wooden crates from several containers.
"They were so heavy we had to use a crane rather than a forklift," says a participant.
The crates were trucked to a "secure airport" and loaded aboard an unmarked 707 jet, where an American, believed by the black-unit members to be a CIA agent, supervised the frantic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane then departed for Czechoslovakia, taking the place of a scheduled Pakistan International Airlines commercial flight that was aborted at the last minute by prearrangement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 707's radar transponder was altered to beep out the code of a commercial airliner, which enabled the plane to overfly several countries without arousing suspicion."

       I'm not talking with anybody.  I'm just taking about the things I've seen in this subreddit and elsewhere on the internet.  It was just a "hey, I've never seen this before so here it is" type thing.  I don't think there's any reason to get upset or defensive.  That being said, thanks for the links.  :)

        In its determination to secure a nuclear deal with Iran, the Obama administration derailed an ambitious law enforcement campaign targeting drug trafficking by the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, even as it was funneling cocaine into the United States.

       US authorities had to eventually do something about the money laundering because it was exposed, so they gave the banks relatively small fines. As some of the articles indicate, the fines were nothing compared to the banks' massive profits.

       Yes, it's a wider problem than just this bank.  I would have preferred it if you had added some commentary tying your post more into this particular bank as well as the wider problem of government/bank drug/dark money laundering and activities.  Because to be honest, the tone of this post comes across as "but, but, what about Obama!!" because you didn't actually connect it to my post on any way.  I get the connection but I think this approach tends to distract from the content, which is unfortunate because it seems like good info that I will look into.

       That wasn't the goal at all. I don't play the partisan games like other people. I was merely providing information about a similar case from recently. It's a sad situation we are in today that so many people have become fooled by others into thinking everyone is a partisan hack. If you happen to provide information that doesn't paint Obama in a good light, you must be a Trump supporting whackjob.

       Like I said, it just wasn't completely obvious what the connection was.  They're both banks/governments up to no good but I feel like some words to tie the two together would have been helpful.  Because yeah, that's the reality we live in, it's very partisan.  I don't know you personally, I just know what's out there.
