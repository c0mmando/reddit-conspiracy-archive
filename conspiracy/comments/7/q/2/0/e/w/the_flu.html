       Alright.  Just observations.  I may or may not be from Iowa,  and just in the last week we've had 8 people die of the flu.  A few grown adults I personally know have developed pneumonia afterwards and are still battling it (which is abnormal for them).
      </p>
      <p>
       To top it off,  I may or may not work on the phones all day calling all around the nation for sales.  Anyways I've had several places I call have to reschedule appointments with me bc too many people are out with the flu. I get that it's flu season height.  But this seems quite aggressive....

       Nothing better to knock you out for far longer than you would, normally (while forgetting you feel like shit, and cough every 10 seconds). I recommend 13-14 hours of sleep if you have a cold. Not a doctor, just coming from experience!

       My guess is that naproxen doesn't work well as an antiviral anymore. Antivirals are like antibiotics, except viruses seem to build resistance even faster than bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't recall the drug, but an effective avian flu antiviral was being used ubiquitously in China for chicken populations. It's now worthless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans will be quick to hear that and think, "damn Chinese, saving some money while screwing up our medicine." But in the US we're giving cattle and other livestock a diet of antibiotics for the same goal (short term money), it's just taking longer for the consequences to catch up with us, which is honestly terrifying.

       UK here, my sister had this same very strong flu over xmas. I myself caught it and it floored me from New Year's Eve til January 3rd. It takes a very strong strain to get me, and when it does it hits hard.
Sister developed pneumonia and now my partner is just starting to recover from the flu she got from me.
My folks also caught it from my sis and are still recovering too. 
We are a very healthy family, and this strain has totally floored us.

       I am not one to fear monger by any means,  but I've lived through many years of the flu and I've never actually noticed it being an issue till this season.  I almost think that each year the strain is getting worse and here soon (years) we may see a global pandemic.

       The last flu I had was the so-called swine flu in 08. It was a tough week, but even that didn't leave me feeling as drained as this recent one.
You could very well be right, and I for one wouldn't be overly surprised at such a development.

       I got it around the same time, and it was
       <em>
        rough
       </em>
       . Don't think I've had it before or since (may have, but nothing that's readily distinguishable from the common cold), and it floored me - sleeping for 18 hour periods, and when I was awake everything just hurt.

       Is it H3N2? It's terrible. I got it (most likely) several years ago, and had a fever for over a week, with a side of mild pneumonia following it. Worst flu I've ever had.

       It was! And it was at the time the worst flu I had suffered - no pneumonia thankfully, but I was bed-ridden for a week. Whole family got it, but weren't struck with it as bad as I was. Fortunately it means I don't get "man flu", since I know how bad things can really get!

       Same story in my family too. It usually expect to get some flu around this time of year, but most any flu I get passes in 2-3 days if I get a lot of rest, drink lots of water, and have a high fruit and berry diet. Same again this year on my part, but what was new was my dad getting the flu. He's got an immune system like a fucking champion so for him to get the flu was really something. But again, passed in 2-3 days. My brother got floored by it though. He couldn't visit over Christmas as he was out the whole week with it where he lives. Definitely noticeably different haha.

       That's probably the noticeable difference between the cold viruses you likely get annually and the influenza virus that your brother likely caught. Flu is much more serious, and pretty often mis-self-diagnosed.

       That's a good point. I usually assume that flu is when I have the cold symptoms, but when they're more extreme like with really drastic temperature changes (overheating then cold sweats), and also being sick. I don't feel nauseous with a cold, but on the occasions I think I have the flu it's the nausea that seemingly confirms it. The main symptoms are usually over in 2-3 days though, but I will spend the rest of the week coughing: partly to get the remaining shit out my lungs, and partly because all the coughing roughs up my throat, making me cough more. But yeah, I think whatever my brother got must have been the legit hard-hitting flu that had been going round at that time.

       Okay, and I was just wondering. I have a theory, and suffer from chronic bronchitis (or w/e it's called - had it since a baby). I've been hit, but, obviously... I'm not around many people, these days, so it's not so bad. Was just curious. I used to get hit hard when I lived in "civilization".

       I don’t know, but I imagine it may have something to do with the report that came out this year stating the flu vaccinations didn’t really combat against the flu. I’d have to find the report, I only heard about through a coworker. I try not to consume “the news”.

       Not OP, but this year's vaccine is less than 10% effective.  Might as well not bother.  It hasn't been effective for years, really.  Shit, some people gey sick f4om the shot itself.  I support never getting that shot.

       Me either and never had the flu. I don't trust being injected with a partially dead virus to gain immunity from it. You get the flu right after you have the shot. And pretty much you also get the flu when it goes around.

       From what I’ve heard it’s just that they screwed up the vaccine this year by calibrating it to the wrong strain. There might be more going on behind that, but it’d be perfectly plausible if there weren’t.

       The flu shot is a gamble every year. CDC openly discusses the process. It entails looking at flu trends in the southern hemisphere during their flu season (among other data) and trying to foresee which strains are likely to be a problem six months later in the north. Then come up with an inoculation and then produce and distribute it to millions within a couple of months. Every year, strains get through, but the big one this year has obviously been worse than usual.
Also, most of the time you say you have the flu but you don't. Categorically, you are more likely to have a respiratory or digestive tract virus; a true influenza will put you down and nearly kill you, not just make you miserable.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling">
        Linus Pauling
       </a>
       , one of only 4 people to have ever been awarded 2 Nobel prizes (his scientific Nobel is in chemistry), spent a large part of his life studying
       <strong>
        the effects of Vitamin C
       </strong>
       , what he calls “megavitamin” therapy, and its near-miraculous healing power.
      </p>
      <p>
       See his 2004 book,
       <em>
        Healing Cancer: Complementary Vitamin &amp; Drug Treatments
       </em>
       , or his 1987 book
       <em>
        How to Live Longer and Feel Better
       </em>
       in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Per this particular thread, I can also mention his 1977 book
       <em>
        Vitamin C, the Common Cold and the Flu
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, realize who this man is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look also into liposomal vitamin C (a way to increase one’s intake of the nutrient).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably one of the biggest medical discoveries of our time. The reason nobody speaks about it (and indeed the reason it is suppressed) is because ascorbic acid cannot be patented and is extremely easy &amp; cheap to produce.

       I take liposomal vitamin c everyday and double down when I'm sick- it usually works wonders. I swear by it. Also, quintessential optimum mineralization marine plasma.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got his hard with this nasty bug that has seemingly gotten to everyone in my area and is really difficult to beat. Started with a little cold and a cough a month ago and found myself with horrible pneumonia a few weeks later- i have never been so sick in my life, i was actually pretty scared. I still have it. I'm young and otherwise pretty healthy, this has been unbearable. The urgent care had a 2 hour wait, everyone pretty much all had the same thing. 5 kids sent home from my sons class in one day. I can think of 10 people off the top of my head who currently have this cough flu bronchitis bug - mine wound up pneumonia, and I'm hoping my kids, family and friends don't get it this bad.

       If I were paranoid I’d say he’s aimig at discouraging people. I would find it quite wild that someone who barely ever posts here arrives with such a contradictory experience.

       But fortunately I’m not paranoid so I don’t think that.

      <p>
       My own anectotal experience is I take up to 1g of Vitamin C per day when people start getting the flu, and I never catch it. When I’m out of Vitamin C or fail to take it for whatever reason, I catch it same as everyone else.

       Thanks. Yeah, it was late I couldn't sleep when I wrote it, and I guess I don't write as well as others. I used to have a really weak immune system, I was constantly sick. I have kids so they come home from school germ factories and parks etc and would constantly have something. I  began to take lipo vitamin c regularly. Since I started taking it I rarely get sick, if I do manage to pick something up it will be short and brief. This time around I was knocked on my ass and seemingly nothing helped. Although I did and still am taking it everyday and am finally on the mend!

       Cool. Thank you for sharing your experience. For what it’s worth, I think you are telling the truth, and that you’re legit, even though you rarely post in this sub. I read and found interesting your post about miscarriages (what’s your personal conclusion/theory on this?).

       I’m also glad vitamin C helps you. Happy new year.

       I'm more of a reader. I found this sub about 6 months ago and it quickly became my go to. I just get anxiety when I post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I need to go back and go over that. Shortly after that post I got sick and everything has kind of been on the back burner as I was out of it and pretty much asleep for 10 days.

       A huge number of people in the area have been sick with this similar bronchial flu cold. It is making me really lean towards the thought that there is an environmental factor in all of this. Possibly something in the water, soil from construction projects, something that we are breathing in, or even in the ocean. I also believe I'm most likely fighting an autoimmune issue which we have yet to pin point. I need to take time and let my body recover and heal and do my best to get healthy (and maintain it!) and bunker down and try and figure out serious possibilities and if there truly is a reason. I don't want that pain inflicted on anyone else and it's heartbreaking so many were and are (most likely, silently) going through it.

       He used green peppers for the vitamin c. Today's ascorbic acid is nothing like what he used. Vitamin C is very potent in illnesses but must be whole food vitamin c and not processed at high heat as it destroys the healing properties. Yes, please take more vitamin c. We take Pure Synergy Pure Radiance C and also Innate Response Vitamin C tablets. You may feel better with trash ascorbic acid but in the long run it will cause big problems. Just take whole food C

       Also I understand the chirality is important; in food it will be of the right chirality, in cheap synthetic Vitamin C it will be 50/50. But in quality synthetic Vitamin C it will be near-100% right chirality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there another difference between natural vs synthetic Vitamin C I’m not aware of?

       Also Pauling iirc advocated for intravenous megavitamin therapy in case of illness (e.g. cancer). So in that case it would
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to be synthetic, right?

       Does anyone know the more serious symptoms for the flu to watch out for? Seeing people die days after finding out they had it is so bizarre. I know that the flu can resemble a common cold but way more intense. Are there specific symptoms that you can develop to say to yourself shit, I gotta go to the hospital? Because  I know I wouldn’t go to the hospital if I felt sick because I’d just think it’s a cold or something. Maybe if I had strep I’d go. But it’s scary that now if I start to feel symptoms of a cold I wouldn’t know whether or not I should go or wait it out like any person would do when they feel “sick” (btw I’m not feeling sick, just started to get paranoid now)

       Don't do that! Anxiety lowers the immune system.  I don't mean for people to worry,  but something is off here. And at some point,  it's going to get out of control and be too late.

       I know! I do have an anxiety disorder so for me when I think about it I’m just like... fuck I’m not leaving my house for a while lol. News coverage really aims to scare the shit outta people. I’m not extremely worried about it but when I see another news article online about another damn death over the flu I’m just thinking what the actual fuck is it that easy? lol

       Look for Nutribiotic Sodium Ascorbate vitamin C crystalline powder. It’s about $19 for a 16 oz bottle and that’ll last about 9-12 months. Lypospheric vitamin C is very good too. High bioavailability which is great when you’re sick. That’s a little more pricey, but it’s worth it. Stay away from any vitamin C products that are calcium ascorbate.

       Vitamin D and K. Vitamin K is required for vitamin D absorption. Check with your doctor if you're on blood thinners though.

       I got hit super hard- went to the dr they sent me home with a steroid shot and told me bad bronchitis just need to ride it out. I didn't sleep for 3 nights pouring sweat coughing so hard i was throwing up and in excruciating pain with every breath, it wasn't going away it was getting worse. I don't remember 3 days i was so out of it, my husband drove me back to urgent care and they were seemingly annoyed I was back again- just a cold virus and bronchitis nothing we can do- but I knew it was beyond that as I have never felt so sick before. I had a verbal argument with the dr that i was not being dramatic that there was something seriously wrong and I needed bloodwork and chest x rays and I wasn't leaving until they figured it out. X-rays showed pretty bad pneumonia in both lungs and the tech said he  surprised I was there and not in the ER rushed and got the dr. the doctor's demeanor changed when she saw the X-rays and loaded me up on meds said if I'm not better after antibiotics go to hospital. That dr sent me home the first time without taking my symptoms seriously and doing full tests. Thank god i went back and fought with her to run tests.. i don't have insurance so also the reason i was hesitant to back a second time and pay it if pocket again within 3 days. And i was nervous that i was just overreacting and being a wuss about a bout of bronchitis... no. You know your body. You know when something is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'm saying is you'll know. If you really aren't feeling well- feeling disoriented, in a lot of pain, or a sense of something is not right. go to a dr. and ask for all the tests and don't leave until you feel comfortable going home and treating it. It's better to have them find out it's just a bad cold then to have something serious unknown and just try and tough it out.

       I threw echaneacha/goldenseal, 1000s mg of Vit C, zinc, raw ginger, raw garlic, raw honey, soup, whole lemons, a steroid nasal spray, a can of Pringles at it, nothing would kill it.

       Same here. Also try elderberry syrup and umcka drops and thieves oil (diluted with a carrier oil) on  bases of feet at night (with socks).  Wanted to try whiskey tea but even the thought of booze was too much, that's how I knew it was bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steeped turmeric root, ginger root, crushed garlic, black pepper, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon and raw honey (steeped for an hour then strained)was actually a good cough relief and it was very soothing.

       You'll know if you have the flu. I had it this past spring (qtip up the nose test). Imagine you have the worst cold you've ever had, then multiply that by 100, and then you got run over by a cement mixing truck. But then it comes back to run you over about once an hour for 5-7 days in a row to make sure you're still miserable.  Then the next week after you have no energy bc on the last day the truck floored it one last time and sucked all your energy away and about 10 pounds with it.  If you feel like that, you should go to the doctor.

       Why can't they make a vaccine that has more than one strain in it? Seems H1N1, H3N2, H2N3 seem to be the really bad ones and they also seem to be the most frequent in the last few years.

       The flu mutates every year because viruses don't have DNA proofreading like bacteria or animals. The vaccines we make try to predict what is coming next, which is why it doesn't always work because sometimes we predict wrong.

       You can, and do (most recent vaccines have had a H3N2 and a H1N1 strain). The problem is that the virus is constantly mutating (a strain of H3N2 from this year won't be the same as one from last year), so you have to predict which mutation/strain is likely to be prevalent in a given year. Sometimes we get that wrong, or the virus mutates in unexpected ways.

       The old Australian flu - it isnt just the weather and wildlife trying to kill you everyday, this shithole also develops the very worst strains of flu too.

       moved from cali to sydney recently.  My kid use to get sick all the time in cali - a lot of breathing problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since moving down under, the kid gets sick once out of 12 months as opposed to sick every month in cali.  a lot less trails in the sky in sydney as well.

       I too have a friend who is sick with the flu. However they don’t get people who die from the flu to determine what killed them. The doctor just reports it to the cdc. I wonder if their budget is being determined. These outbreaks always happen just before the cdc is getting a new budget.

       Antibiotics for a missed pneumonia diagnosis is an overly complicated solution?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't take them often, and tried everything else, this was one time I feel as if I really needed them. And am making sure to take probiotics and am drinking steeped ginger root, turmeric root, and honey which was the only think my body didn't reject for days before hand. After this is cleared up and am strong enough I would love to do a detox and clean out and reboot.
      </p>
      <p>
       They asked when to see a dr and how so many people were becoming severely ill or dying. I was just telling a story of how a doctor dismissed  my concerns about my symptoms as overreactions when in reality I was very ill. Which happens in many pneumonia or flu cases. Also- no health insurance so people cannot afford healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I won't post on here in awhile as posts get constantly ripped apart and pitchforked. I'm going back to being a reader.

       Yes, I believe intravenously it is synthetic and for things like cancer then of course the benefits out weigh the risks. Forgive me, I am still learning about all of this but synthetic causes an imbalance in copper. I have been trying to understand all the ins and outs of it all and the best place to learn this is
       <a href="http://www.gotmag.org">
        www.gotmag.org
       </a>
       and the magnesium advocacy FB page. I'm not sure if people understand the repercussions of unbalanced minerals and these two places answer so many questions. I am completely fascinated by the information provided. I just wish I was smart enough to understand it all the first time I read it. My husband has lost the ability to use his left so I spend many hours educating myself there to hopefully get him lined back out. Thank you for asking in a genuine manner about my post.

       It was! And it was at the time the worst flu I had suffered - no pneumonia thankfully, but I was bed-ridden for a week. Whole family got it, but weren't struck with it as bad as I was. Fortunately it means I don't get "man flu", since I know how bad things can really get!

       That's a good point. I usually assume that flu is when I have the cold symptoms, but when they're more extreme like with really drastic temperature changes (overheating then cold sweats), and also being sick. I don't feel nauseous with a cold, but on the occasions I think I have the flu it's the nausea that seemingly confirms it. The main symptoms are usually over in 2-3 days though, but I will spend the rest of the week coughing: partly to get the remaining shit out my lungs, and partly because all the coughing roughs up my throat, making me cough more. But yeah, I think whatever my brother got must have been the legit hard-hitting flu that had been going round at that time.

       Me either and never had the flu. I don't trust being injected with a partially dead virus to gain immunity from it. You get the flu right after you have the shot. And pretty much you also get the flu when it goes around.
