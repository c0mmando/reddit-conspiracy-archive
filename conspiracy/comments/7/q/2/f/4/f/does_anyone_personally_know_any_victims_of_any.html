    <div class="md"><p>I knew someone who died when one of the towers fell on 9/11 and someone else who survived Aurora. </p>

<p>That said, I believe some of these events may be staged (the Sandy Hook case in particular is full of disturbing anomalies) and I think crisis actors are sometimes used even in the aftermath of events with real victims (Orlando comes to mind).  Mainstream narratives about these events often seem to be falsified (look at San Bernardino). Vegas looks like a sloppy coverup.   </p>

<p>False flag attacks are real and unfortunately common, but false flags are not necessarily hoaxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not lying, just my opinions.  Although I expected this because I am usually the one rolling my eyes at people who claim to know a victim.  I honestly don&#39;t give a fuck if you believe me because I know what I&#39;ve experienced, and either someone I&#39;ve known and trusted for years survived the Aurora shooting or is inexplicably pretending they did and exhibiting PTSD symptoms for some other reason.  And there seems to be consensus even among CT circles that real people died on 9/11, do you agree?</p>

<p>I DO in fact agree that hoaxes exist and that some shootings and terror attacks are completely faked.  I think Sandy Hook is very likely one example of this, although I&#39;m not entirely certain about it.  </p>

<p>I also remember a LOT of people being convinced that this was a hoax, I haven&#39;t researched it much but they could be right: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Alison_Parker_and_Adam_Ward">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Alison_Parker_and_Adam_Ward</a></p>

<p>One I&#39;m not sure about but that bothers me a lot is the Ariana Grande terror attack.  I don&#39;t know if it was a hoax necessarily but it sure seemed to disappear down the memory hole even faster than most of these horrible stories and everything about it seemed fucky.</p>

<p>For the record I have noticed you consistently arguing that nobody died in Las Vegas.  A lot of people give you shit for it but I often throw you upvotes for asking good critical questions and asking people to prove you wrong.  I&#39;m not convinced either way, and I think Vegas might fall into the category of real violence was involved that day somehow, but crisis actors may have been used as well.  But I don&#39;t <em>know</em> anything, these are all just my hunches based on paying attention to these things for a long time.  I am open-minded about all of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see any of them being hoaxes. Vegas? We have information from doctors that they were told to dispose of the bullets. I don&#39;t care what anyone says you can&#39;t fake an er packed with gun shot wounds and nurses are going to talk.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook? I&#39;m sure there was some embellishment from crisis actors but the report recently released by the state police has me convinced it happened. </p>

<p>Mainly because of the mention of some of the detectives developing ptsd symptoms. My worst memories in Iraq and as a mp involve children and I think it&#39;s a detail that wouldn&#39;t have been out in if it wasn&#39;t true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I met one of my friends when I was a kid because they used to live in New York and his dad was a cop that died on 9/11 at the World Trade Center and they moved in my neighborhood afterwards. We both liked skateboarding and shit. He never really talked about it but I remember going to their house and they had the flag box thing and a little chunk of steel from the towers. My dad and his mom worked together while me and him drifted apart and stopped talking but my dad told me that when he turned 18 or something he got access to a bank account with like 2 million and he bought a row of townhouses and rents them out while he goes to film school in LA. Weird shit</p>

<p>See for yourself if you think they are believable. If one of them is lying it&#39;s a safe assumption that all are liars. </p>

<p>By the way since this article was published the number has grown to over 40.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not too crazy into conspiracy theories, but I think it’s extremely ignorant to just believe what anyone tells you first hand </p>

<p>I think these events have happened, I’m not big on the whole ‘the entire event was faked, all victims are fake’ thing. cause I think that’s just absurd. </p>

<p>I did know a guy who lost his dad in 9/11 and you can tell it really affected him. pretty sure he wasn’t a high schooler placed to fool us kids in kansas to make us believe 9/11 was real lol. and this was several years after because I was born in 1998 and I knew this kid when I was around 13. </p>

<p>I’m more on the conspiracy side that some of these things may have been allowed to happen or made to happen for whatever reasons and that there’s often cover ups as to what really happened and why</p>

<p>as for crisis actors, I’m not sure how I feel about that. it makes me feel a little crazy to believe in them lol. but I did see a pretty convincing video showing a similar looking girl in several different incidents. but I feel like the government would be smarter than to use the same person, with the same look, over and over again..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My ex sister in law was at the Vegas shooting.  I don&#39;t live near her and we are not close, but her posts via Facebook documented her involvement.  She had posted pics from the concert and previous day(s?) of the festival before she then posted that she was there when the shooting happened.   She did not get shot but posted a pic of her injuries from falling and getting hurt when running away.   Many of her posts since have been about having nightmares, trying to move on, attending lunches with survivors, etc.<br/>
I am a skeptic.  You can check my posts, I&#39;ve posted in here off and on.  But I don&#39;t think that all these shootings are made up. I think this fucked up society is absolutely producing fucked up people who can and do do fucked up things, all on their own.   </p>
