       This place used to be the most interesting thing on the internet. 
You know, if you exclude all porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then this rule 12&amp;13 biz happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's just troll post after troll post after a Bunche of suckin D's nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's mah goddamned lizard people?!!! Seriously. Where's my paradigm bending shit? Where's my sci fi mixed with middle ground hope?
      </p>
      <p>
       Used to be lots of uplifting antipolitical stuff. A good bit of paranormal fun. Out there spirituality. Some alternative history. And the people who believe the real crazy shit weren't too paranoid to post about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks trolls, you killed the best part of r/conspiracy, the people that gave you content to ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
       You bit the hand that feeds you for a temporary feast.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will keep swallowing D's nutz, and picking a red or blue card, but all the really interesting cats fled.

       I think you're focused more on me saying D's nutz than the parts about a lack of variety in topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not talking solely about trump posts being troll posts. I think people who think trumps some kind of savior are sincere. I don't agree, but I don't think it's impossible.

      <p>
       I'm talking about clear troll posts, and a lack of variety in topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you browse tmor, you can see that they post nazi sympathizer stuff here so that they can paint the sub as antisemitic whenever they question accuracy of the recorded events.
      </p>
      <p>
       They post a lot here actually, just to get people to say something which can be mocked.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't benefit either sub, as they kill genuine content, which if you want to mock, has more value than seeded stuff, and if you're actually interested, has more value than troll posts.

       Maybe I shouldn't pine for the way things were. So much content. It was like 1 in 20 posts wasn't sincere.

       The rule 13 thing happened, and it seemed to encourage more self posts, then just troll posts, increasing every night, until we're getting repeats of the same ones.

       Not to generalize, but you participate in a group which regularly attacks people on the sub.
      </p>

       I'd prefer to just go somewhere where you don't get banned, but you don't attack people's views either.

       Somewhere where you yourself would not jump to labeling others for exploring alternatives to what we've been taught.

       I don't remember why we banned you but judging by your post history, you are from r/TopMindsOfReddit, so it could have been for a whole lot of things.  You have had a lot of focus on our sub from the beginning; suspiciously so.
      </p>
      <p>
       No shills is not even our number one rule.  Our number one rule is collegial discussion.  Some may be surprised how people with bad intentions seem to be unable to not break this rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment's aim is to smear our sub.  TMOR responding to my shoutouts like this is like clockwork.  Don't you have anything better to do?  I think the people here will be above what either of us have to say and see for themselves what the sub is about.

       We rarely need to ban anyone for being a suspected shill not contributing to discussion in a positive way.  The rules are vague but we go to great lengths to show the community what we stand for.

       I could probably count on one hand how many holocaust denial posts there have been on the sub.   Yet, TMOR screams over and over, "They are Nazis for not taking those posts down!"  We want to let people decide for themselves whether to believe something or not.  We want collegial discussion to happen so that we can get to the bottom of it and improve our understanding.

       I never told him to remove the Nazi content. But when he is pro Nazi content and anti criticism of Nazi content, we can see his agenda clearly.

       Here are our rules.  There is nothing in there about users who criticize Holocaust deniers.  We also ban people who break the site wide Reddit rules on our sub:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Collegial discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This eliminates 95% of issues here. If you follow collegial discussion guidelines, along with the idea of Socratic discussion, this sub will be great. Here are some key points:
a) No mocking
b) No attacking
c) Listening/having an open mind
d) Agreeing to disagree when necessary
e) No low effort comments (you are an idiot, this is stupid, you are mentally ill)
f) Willingness to learn
g) Discussion overrides debate (though debate has its role!) There are times when things will get heated, but do NOT attack h) this sub is not completely serious, but denigrating this sub, the people who use this sub, or the mods here will not be tolerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) No shills/topminds users/trolls/etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably my most controversial rule. A shill has an agenda, and they are not willing to learn or listen to anyone. Though there is no foolproof way to identify a shill, it is obvious when a person refuses to open their mind to others in discussion. Collegial discussion serves as a filter to eliminate shilling on this sub. Though it is not perfect, it has been working thus far.
I do not immediately ban Topminds users. I do not immediately ban anyone. When somebody violates collegial/socratic discussion, I look into their post history for similar themes. Often, their post history indicates they are TMOR users or have a clear agenda. TMOR users can come here, but they must be willing to work within the rules of collegial discussion. It has been rare, but it has happened. The majority of banning occurs because TMOR users cannot follow rules of collegial discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) It's all about intentions:
      </p>
      <p>
       This originally said no low-effort posts, but I am more concerned about your intentions behind posting. Why are you posting? What is your purpose? What do you want people to get out of what you post? Please be willing to ask yourself these questions before you make posts - users and mods can tell when somebody is posting for nefarious purposes.

       Your sub mods called me a shill to get me banned. Slandering me is not proof. Provide proof of your claims.

       I got banned from your sub for questioning Holocaust denial with evidence.

       I know there isn't a rule here about promoting your subreddit, but your sub's #1 rule, "no shills," is used to persecute people like me who dare speak out against bigotry.

       The good stuff gets downvoted in the new queue. Try looking through controversial, you can sometimes find interesting things there. The hot or top queue of conspiracy has become what I imagine politics was just before the liberals won it over, only vice-versa.
