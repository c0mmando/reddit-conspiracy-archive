<p>Same thing can be said about the west and the small handful of companies that run the MSM.</p>

<p>Anyway, regarding level of conversation.  When was the last time you saw this coming out of the leadership of the west?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHd7s3I3Zb4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHd7s3I3Zb4</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin has many flaws, but, he is a great leader for Russia, and Russia alone. Many can learn from him, but he is no savior, and a part of me thinks that is his purpose ( he came from nothing, unless he is truly a Romanov). The West is seriously ignorant of Eastern Europe, and mainly, Russia. How long has the Vatican been fighting with the Eastern Orthodox Church? Thousands of years... Smoke and mirrors? Maybe... But, you cannot deny certain things.</p>

<p>Just my two cents, further source, I have Russian family. I&#39;m Polish-American, though. Life is complicated. Let&#39;s just say, I do not have Russian family because of <em>their choice</em>. </p>

<p>Like during the 2016 election where they basically allowed Clinton to just walk past the reporters line waving like royalty, plus they didn&#39;t shout out questions to her?</p>

<p>Clinton didn&#39;t take questions from the press until people started complaining about it over &amp; over online.</p>

<p>They she vetted the &#39;reporters&#39; who were allowed to ask her lame ass
questions on her jet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not surprised.
I downvoted this totally true story because it&#39;s not related to anything and just wants to show that media in Russia is free.
Heh, couple of days ago, I was downvoted by ppl like this guy in r/europe because I pointed out that Russia is not in Europe.</p>

<p>Also, really interesting how a random guy from Russia is so pro Trump, and even created his own pro-Trump subreddit.</p>

<p><a href="https://rsf.org/en/russia">https://rsf.org/en/russia</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>What with draconian laws and website blocking, the pressure on independent media has grown steadily since Vladimir Putin’s return to the Kremlin in 2012. Leading independent news outlets have either been brought under control or throttled out of existence. As TV channels continue to inundate viewers with propaganda, the climate has become increasingly oppressive for those who try to maintain quality journalism or question the new patriotic and neo-conservative. More and more bloggers are receiving prisons sentences for their activity on online social networks. The leading human rights NGOs have been declared “foreign agents.” The oppressive climate at the national level encourages powerful provincial officials far from Moscow to crack down even harder on their media critics.</p>

<p>Just because some americans behave and act like they&#39;re brainwashed it couldn&#39;t be that the russians do the same???</p>

<p>Well if Russia is such a smart place for free speech and press, then tell us a bit more about the dozens of critical journalists killed in Russia, the oppositional politicans sent to prison, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t really get it do you?</p>

<p>Russian press is more &quot;free&quot; is because everyone know it was state sponsored. So they either have to do some REALLY hard dig, or risk being sidelined by the people since once they go full propaganda, people will know really fast.</p>

<p>US press is less free is because it was coporate sponsored, so it has the pretense of an independent press to hide behind, while in fact it just spew propaganda 24/7 most of the time. The conspiracy theorist community know this for a long time ago, but most people doesn&#39;t. So it just became this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched it last year. Putin basically sits in front of a large audience &amp; they pass the mic around.</p>

<p>When he gets a difficult question like &quot;What do you have to say about how difficult it is with so many sanctions against our country?&quot;</p>

<p>Putin eventually replies &quot;It is very difficult &amp; we are doing all we can to make sure that everyone has the basics that they need..... I don&#39;t have any easy answers, but here are the things that we are doing...... &quot;</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t pull a US politician statement where they pretend like they are addressing the question but then talk about something else for the next 10 minutes hoping everyone forgot the original question.</p>

<p>He also just increased the minimum wage in Russia for the 2nd time. He did the same for pensioners.</p>

<p>I believe he cares about his country. People seem to believe he is doing the right things, but are upset because he said he is planning to retire after this next term.</p>
