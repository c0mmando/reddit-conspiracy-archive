       yes, everyone knows that he's sort of a tsar/dictator, yet even with all that, there was less fear and control than in US.

       US is truly a repressed, controlled society, modern day Nazi Germany lite with brainwashed citizens!

       People who oppose him end up time and time again. No fucking way those journalists are risking their life to put him on the spot and make him look stupid or nervous in front of the entire country. There’s just no way I believe that.

       Opposition leaders being randomly murdered 24/7 is a sign.

       Sorry, but Russia is a corrupt 2nd world "shithole" run by the mob.

       i wouldn't say more free..we're pretty free.  there's very much a dialogue going on.  what's different about america and russia is that russia has a leader in putin who doesn't shy away from honest dialogue and doesn't try to bullshit on hard and complicated issues.  and this in turn reflects the conversations that the media then has.  they're not as constrained by pc bullshit.  they speak more accurately.

       All three major Russian TV networks are controlled boy the state. And being an independent journalist is hazardous to your health in Russia. So why do you think the state-controlled journalists speak "more accurately"? Can you give us examples?

       Putin doesn't shy away from dialogue? Are you retarded, blind or Putin?
Every single event with mass murderer Putin is so heavily orchestrated by PR, GRU and FSB that mother Freedom and father Truth are not allowed to be anywhere closer than 1000 km. Neither are allowed any questions that aren't beforehand approved by the same and similar acronyms.

       Putin has many flaws, but, he is a great leader for Russia, and Russia alone. Many can learn from him, but he is no savior, and a part of me thinks that is his purpose ( he came from nothing, unless he is truly a Romanov). The West is seriously ignorant of Eastern Europe, and mainly, Russia. How long has the Vatican been fighting with the Eastern Orthodox Church? Thousands of years... Smoke and mirrors? Maybe... But, you cannot deny certain things.

       Just my two cents, further source, I have Russian family. I'm Polish-American, though. Life is complicated. Let's just say, I do not have Russian family because of
       <em>
        their choice
       </em>
       .

       <p>
        What with draconian laws and website blocking, the pressure on independent media has grown steadily since Vladimir Putin’s return to the Kremlin in 2012. Leading independent news outlets have either been brought under control or throttled out of existence. As TV channels continue to inundate viewers with propaganda, the climate has become increasingly oppressive for those who try to maintain quality journalism or question the new patriotic and neo-conservative. More and more bloggers are receiving prisons sentences for their activity on online social networks. The leading human rights NGOs have been declared “foreign agents.” The oppressive climate at the national level encourages powerful provincial officials far from Moscow to crack down even harder on their media critics.

       Russia sucks for journalistic freedom.  Putin might be an effeminate cuck, but he really likes to control the narrative in his country.

       Just because some americans behave and act like they're brainwashed it couldn't be that the russians do the same???

       Well if Russia is such a smart place for free speech and press, then tell us a bit more about the dozens of critical journalists killed in Russia, the oppositional politicans sent to prison, etc.

       You don't really get it do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Russian press is more "free" is because everyone know it was state sponsored. So they either have to do some REALLY hard dig, or risk being sidelined by the people since once they go full propaganda, people will know really fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       US press is less free is because it was coporate sponsored, so it has the pretense of an independent press to hide behind, while in fact it just spew propaganda 24/7 most of the time. The conspiracy theorist community know this for a long time ago, but most people doesn't. So it just became this.

       I watched it last year. Putin basically sits in front of a large audience &amp; they pass the mic around.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he gets a difficult question like "What do you have to say about how difficult it is with so many sanctions against our country?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin eventually replies "It is very difficult &amp; we are doing all we can to make sure that everyone has the basics that they need..... I don't have any easy answers, but here are the things that we are doing...... "
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't pull a US politician statement where they pretend like they are addressing the question but then talk about something else for the next 10 minutes hoping everyone forgot the original question.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also just increased the minimum wage in Russia for the 2nd time. He did the same for pensioners.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe he cares about his country. People seem to believe he is doing the right things, but are upset because he said he is planning to retire after this next term.

       This is, I believe, the prime reason for sanctions against Russia. They just don't want people to see that someone could try and do something that benefits their people.

       Question: What has the press bitten their lip on involving themselves with regarding Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       If accusing the president of receiving a golden shower isn't the sign of a free country, I don't know what is.
