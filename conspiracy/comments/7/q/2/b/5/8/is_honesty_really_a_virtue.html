        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Honesty has always seemed to me like a real important core value. I admit I am a coward and I am seldom honest, but I always wish I was and I always despised myself when I didn&#39;t have the balls to spit out whatever I was thinking.</p>

<p>But slowly I am coming to the conclusion that honesty is not a virtue, but rather an instrument of control.</p>

<p>The people in power want you to be honest. Why? So that they are able to categorize and keep you under control. They want you to show your hands at all times. While they pretty much never do. They want to know what you&#39;re up to, what tricks you have up your sleeves, they want to know your dirty secrets, your sex fantasies, your nightmares and your fears, they want to know it all.</p>

<p>Just think about this very popular &quot;common sense&quot; pop-psychology thing of &quot;showing weakness is a strength&quot;. Really? Well, I admit I somehow used to buy into it and maybe still do to an extent, but it seems more and more like an obvious attempt to actually put you in a weak position where you are easy to control.</p>

<p>&quot;Showing weakness is a strength&quot; = &quot;Exchange secrets we can use against you for a pat on your back&quot;</p>

<p>Do you know of any politician who is honest?</p>

<p>Me neither.</p>

<p>So why let them lecture us about honesty.</p>

<p>Honesty is something to share among valued and trusted friends where it might indeed make one and one another stronger. Not something to be given for free towards people who may have or are likely to have bad intents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe that&#39;s why I was so obsessed with being honest in the first place. Because I felt unable to be honest with myself (or felt like that wasn&#39;t enough to feel confirmed in my own beliefs), I wanted to overcompensate by being honest to everyone else and getting confirmation from them (which never works either).</p>

<p>Self reliance really makes you feel good. You look at your work, and you feel good. You know what you&#39;ve accomplished, and you respect yourself for it. </p>

<p>Nothing anybody said&#39;s can even compare to that feeling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always wished I had this, for as long as I can think back. But I&#39;m always too terrified, too untrusting. </p>

<p>You wanna hear something crazy? I like being creative. But the only times when I finish doing some project is when it&#39;s one I only care about maybe 20%. Why? Because I know my project is great by my standards, but I know I&#39;m mentally weak and somebody will come and tell me some stupid &quot;academic criticism&quot; that I don&#39;t agree with, but neither feel strong enough to disagree with, so other people end up ruining my own ideas for me. </p>

<p>Though of course sometimes there are criticisms that I do agree with, but usually I don&#39;t, because they seem like forced exercises of some inane rule book without any attempt to grasp what I have created in its essence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think you&#39;re mentally weak? Because you can&#39;t express your feelings to others? Shit, even the strongest people are still weak. We all have faults that drag us down, but as your grow, and experience more and more, you adapt. </p>

<p>Consider your academic criticism, view it as an argument from authority, meaning a professor criticizes your work, and says his theory is better, because hes a professor, and has been doing it longer. Because hes arguing from a position of authority, and not explaining his processes, and attempting to prove how his theory is superior, by offering it up to criticism, hes not being scientific. </p>

<p>The point is to reach the truth, be it with yourself, or a scientific theory, you have to be methodical, and apply the same rules every time.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why do you think you&#39;re mentally weak?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I feel like I have zero mental resistance to other people&#39;s thoughts. I feel threatened by the prospect of openly disagreeing, but merely keeping quiet doesn&#39;t work either (because people can read your face). Hence I have this defense mechanism (result of early childhood trauma I presume) where I automatically adapt my thoughts to the thoughts of another person, no matter how much they hurt me, just to feel safe. I suppose Stockholm Syndrome?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes I&#39;m open about it. It really depends on the circumstances. Call it a gut feeling. Other times the openness is achieved by dissociation (I can talk about it without actually feeling it at the same time, but later I feel bad about having been so open).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If this is what empathy is, I don&#39;t want any part of it. It feels like who I am, all my autonomy, free will and individuality is 100% repressed in favor of anyone else who checks of certain &quot;triggers&quot;. Nothing positive in it (other than being liked/useful to those people)</p>

<p>You need someone you can sit down with, and express this to, someone who will give feedback that you recognize as being non-threatening. </p>

<p>For me, I have an uncle, we agree and disagree about a lot of things, but we know each others deepest, darkest secrets. Things that we&#39;ve shared at 3:30am in the morning, after smoking weed all evening, after being loosened up.  After that barrier was broken between us, we realized that just to have someone else know, was such as base human instinct, it was like building a fire in the woods for the 1st time. He told be things that I will take to my grave, I would break that trust with him, because it would be like cutting off my own arm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are certain aspects in people that trigger my trust, even if only temporarily. Not 100% sure what, but I think it may have to do with me observing them doing or saying something that they could not/would not have said or done if they weren&#39;t trustworthy. Logically, if I told someone what these are though, they could fake them, and I could no longer rely on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mh. That may apply to a fringe amount of people, but it&#39;s hardly a general truth. I would say people believe a good liar far more easily than a bad truth-teller.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honesty is by far the most important thing to me, no matter the context. I started out life being honest, realized I&#39;m just getting fucked because of that, bacame a huge liar until about 22 years of age and then started being 100% honest with myself out of necessity (mushrooms helped convincing me). Then I started actually improving myself, seeing all my faults and issues, realized that I can&#39;t be honest to anyone if I&#39;m not honest to myself and vice versa and now I haven&#39;t been lying much in years. Exceptions are people who don&#39;t listen to what I&#39;m saying anyway and just care about talking about themselves, so I just withhold everything and try to end the conversation politely (which in my mind is a form of dishonesty). Sometimes, when I&#39;m too emotional, I just stop giving a fuck and just rant and am the most honest about everything, but generally that only paints me as an asshole, because people care more about themselves than the overall wellbeing.</p>

<p>Truth is something that doesn&#39;t need anyone&#39;s help, even in these times. If you align yourself with truth, you&#39;ll always know and recognize it. If you speak the truth, you have nothing to fear (on the grand scale). But I would recommend having balls and being sincere about it. Don&#39;t make it something you identify with or you just make it a part of your ego and continue the dishonesty bs.</p>

<p>Generally, since I became mostly honest, my life improved tremendously in all areas and I feel very blessed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are assuming your honesty should be shared with everyone at all times.  There are many situations where your input is not prompted and if it is, it can be withheld honestly.  If it is not useful, why share your opinion?  It’s always good to be circumspect and withhold your pearls from swine. </p>
