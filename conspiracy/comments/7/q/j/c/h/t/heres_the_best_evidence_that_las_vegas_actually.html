<blockquote>
<p>Even those who understand false flags seem a bit reluctant to accept that casualties can be faked. This is Stagecraft 101, and it’s as old as the hills. Researcher Miles Mathis uses public database searches, such as government-sponsored Intelius, to verify the existence of the victims at the Las Vegas massacre.</p>

<p>What he found is a pattern of subterfuge involving made-up sounding names, missing middle names, no records at all, same named people from the same town with completely different ages. Some appear to be to intelligence and technology of the military-industrial complex. In the case of Las Vegas there were an inordinate number of Canadians who fail to turn up in databases of that country.*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here. It definitely seems to me people were legitimately shot. The LV shooting does not look like sandy hook in that regard. I don’t believe this event was faked in anyway. I do believe there is foul play with regards to the official narrative. I’m not 100% positive that the narrative is wrong, but it all looks too strange and that is absolutely needs to be investigated further. Perhaps he was an arms dealer, perhaps other people were involved (I personally suspect this). </p>

<p>So, out of curiosity, for someone begging for evidence to be presented, what exactly would you consider legitimate confirmation that shots were fired?</p>

<p>This is the part that demands a response before anything else. If you&#39;re going to claim something&#39;s a hoax, you need to provide a <em>reasonable</em> standard of evidence that someone could conceivably meet, otherwise you have no place claiming anything but agnosticism.</p>

<p>Unbelievably, the FBI made the &quot;doctors and nurses&quot; dispose of all bullets recovered from victims--and I do mean UNBELIEVABLY, as in you&#39;d have to have the IQ of a turnip to believe them.

<p>Do you require <em>all</em> of these at once, or any <em>one</em> of these, or what?</p>

<p>No sparks from any bullet impacts, zero. Look at ANY video you will not find one spark. Only sound. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQfb6Kc_sg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQfb6Kc_sg</a>&amp;</p>

<p>More evidence of not a single shot fired. No damage from alleged bullets. Some of those structures should look like a country road stop sign. No bullet forensics being done. They are just covering up any fake blood and other artifacts from the crisis actors. They also seem to be deep cleaning (scrubbing) up any fragments or debris from the water bottles with firecrackers in them.</p>
