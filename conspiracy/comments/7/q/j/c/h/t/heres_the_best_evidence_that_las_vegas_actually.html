       It would only take 10-15 min to look up all the names, but I don’t question those people’s deaths. Spending 10 min on something isn’t hard, but i get lazy when it comes to proving something that is not of real importance to me, even if whatever took only 5 min.

       Lol, how are the obituaries 'coming up bogus'?  I bet you didn't even look at the two I linked much less look any others up for yourself.  You are the one making extraordinary claims the burden of proof is on you.  I have family members who were there and I'll take their word for what happened over whatever stupid fucking youtube videos you are pushing.

       [Miles Mathis Exposes Fake Personas in the Las Vegas Shooting Victims]

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Even those who understand false flags seem a bit reluctant to accept that casualties can be faked. This is Stagecraft 101, and it’s as old as the hills. Researcher Miles Mathis uses public database searches, such as government-sponsored Intelius, to verify the existence of the victims at the Las Vegas massacre.
       </p>
       <p>
        What he found is a pattern of subterfuge involving made-up sounding names, missing middle names, no records at all, same named people from the same town with completely different ages. Some appear to be to intelligence and technology of the military-industrial complex. In the case of Las Vegas there were an inordinate number of Canadians who fail to turn up in databases of that country.*

       Same here. It definitely seems to me people were legitimately shot. The LV shooting does not look like sandy hook in that regard. I don’t believe this event was faked in anyway. I do believe there is foul play with regards to the official narrative. I’m not 100% positive that the narrative is wrong, but it all looks too strange and that is absolutely needs to be investigated further. Perhaps he was an arms dealer, perhaps other people were involved (I personally suspect this).

       Tbqh this is the most compelling part of the post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So, out of curiosity, for someone begging for evidence to be presented, what exactly would you consider legitimate confirmation that shots were fired?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the part that demands a response before anything else. If you're going to claim something's a hoax, you need to provide a
       <em>
        reasonable
       </em>
       standard of evidence that someone could conceivably meet, otherwise you have no place claiming anything but agnosticism.

       Video of bullet impacts on people or on things or on the grounds.  There is none.  Video of realistic injuries.  There is none.  We have B-movie quality effects and amateur level acting.  Or actual physical evidence, like a bullet recovered from the grounds or from a victim.  Not one out of 1000 bullets supposedly fired were found.

      <p>
       Unbelievably, the FBI made the "doctors and nurses" dispose of all bullets recovered from victims--and I do mean UNBELIEVABLY, as in you'd have to have the IQ of a turnip to believe them.  There were no doctors, there were no nurses, there were no bullets.  All there ever was, were crisis actors in hospital beds with other crisis actors in scrubs pretending to be busy.

      <p>
       Here's a trained nurse pointing out the fake injuries and lack of medical emergency activity:

       New facts: No smoke coming from the "alleged" shooters hotel room. AND not one report of anyone smelling gunpowder. For 1000 rounds that is impossible.

       More evidence of not a single shot fired. No damage from alleged bullets. Some of those structures should look like a country road stop sign. No bullet forensics being done. They are just covering up any fake blood and other artifacts from the crisis actors. They also seem to be deep cleaning (scrubbing) up any fragments or debris from the water bottles with firecrackers in them.

       Military sound projection technology + Firecrackers in water bottles to simulate the effect of bullet impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Non-crisis actors were not fooled by this sound projection (like people with intimate knowledge of firearms.) You can hear them in this video.
