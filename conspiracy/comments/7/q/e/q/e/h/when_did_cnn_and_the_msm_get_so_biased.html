    <div class="md"><p>The bias of your video is immediately apparent - as I pointed out, there is this narrative that Fox news isn&#39;t MSM (directly from your link: Obama resurfaced on Friday and took a shot at <strong>Fox News</strong> Viewers, saying they&#39;re living on a different planet than people who consume <strong>MSM</strong>&quot;.  Hate to break it to you, fox is MSM.</p>

<p>Secondly, I watched that episode.  That isn&#39;t even what he said.  He was talking about how we can&#39;t even agree on facts anymore, and said that people who watch Fox News are on a different planet than people who watch NPR.  Do you disagree with that statement?  No one was &quot;bashed&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m being dishonest?  We were talking about the posted video, you linked an article from a Rolling Stone interview a year ago.  Looks like your the one who could do with some more honesty.</p>

<p>Even in the RS interview, he doesn&#39;t &quot;rip on&quot; Fox news viewers as the original post claims. Here is the full quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before that, you had folks like Hearst who used their newspapers very intentionally to promote their viewpoints. I think Fox is part of that tradition â€” it is part of the tradition that has a very clear, undeniable point of view. It&#39;s a point of view that I disagree with. It&#39;s a point of view that I think is ultimately destructive for the long-term growth of a country that has a vibrant middle class and is competitive in the world. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it surprising to anyone that a democrat would disagree with the viewpoints of Fox News? And don&#39;t most people on the right feel the same way about the left wing media?  </p>

<p>Why are you arguing about Fox News?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t take &quot;yes&quot; for an answer.  I agree that is well known as a conservative leaning station.  The question becomes, are there any unbiased news sources.  MSNBC and fox had their roles.  Now the rest are pure propaganda too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you continue to blather on that I don&#39;t acknowledge that FOX is right leaning?  The issue is similar to consent.  People consent to propaganda when they go to msnbc or fox.  Obama, and the msm, have made sure to label Fox News as propaganda.  MSNBC does not even pretend to be unbiased.  The issue is that the rest of the msm, let&#39;s say CNN for example, are continuing to be considered a news source.  CNN is propaganda.</p>

<p>its been this way for a while, at least since cable news started.  It does certain ebb and flow. I&#39;d agree we seem to be in a current war of words, propaganda regimes, fake news, and backroom media war rooms set up just to push agendas.  Dangerous times in the free world.</p>

<p>I used google to perform the search, that is all.  there are dozens of these out there, with a variety of sources and data points.  Just another tool see where it all comes from.   </p>

<p>Actual fun game, for every 10 articles you read form your chosen source, go read one from the opposite side of the chart.  :)  </p>
