       Stay strong. Fear motivates the broken. You could choose to hide in the fringes. The fact is that this forum is hated for a reason. Many are afraid to confront the truth. The real users of this forum are driven by Love and compassion, not fear and paranoia.

       td (with some help) has been trying to discredit conspiracy by making it lean so hard to the right (and more in support of trump) that it's totally written off as nonsense even beyond what a 'regular, old' conspiracy sub would look like.

       To be fair, Trump and his supporters are characterized largely as conspiracy theorists. Alex Jones and his followers are huge trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look inside T_D, you'll see conspiracy theory posts everywhere. Compare that to r/politics and you get ridiculed for questioning anything but mainstream news reports.
      </p>

       It's no wonder that this sub can be very pro-Trump. A vast majority of conspiracy theorists are trump supporters.

       I was very shocked by the community when i first stumbled upon it. Top upvoted posts would highlight how mass shootings were used to cover up big news and distract people and even posts about how 9/11 was done by globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was very shocking for me to see that, in such a big community.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, at the same time, the news there is very polarized. And very antifeminist, antiblacklivesmatter, and anti-illegal immigration.... Basically anti any group that acts victimized but acts like white males are victims. And also very pro-cop, pro-military...
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting community there anyway. I'll definitely see a lot of big news posted there that won't be in /news or /politics.

       There are conspiracy theorists and then there are blatant propagandists.  It's easy to confuse the two.  I'd say TD and their crossposts fall into the latter category.

       That's more fringe conspiracy theory work. Not coordinated narratives pushed by mainstream news, aka propaganda.

       Do I call all of it propaganda?  No.  Do I call most of it propaganda?  Definitely.  TD is a 24/7 propaganda machine that throws as much shit against the wall as it can in the hopes that a small percentage of it will have a lasting effect. I'd say TD is far more engaged in propaganda than any MSM source including Fox News.

       That's all a psyop. The govt created/promoted the term "conspiracy theorist" to discredit anyone questioning the office JFK story. Nowadays they try to lump all conspiracy theorists with far right wingers. Alex Jones is a character sponsored by the govt as a limited hangout/ gatekeeper for the right wing. If you spent any time on the forum, you'd see how many of us reject left-right political divisiveness and reject both political party mafias.

       i agree this explains a lot of it, and it is organic. Which is fine.

       I also think protrump forces have noticed this same trend and want to amplify it, and control it. This is a great way to keep their supporters on their team, and to make sure they dont believe any counter narratives about their guy. Look at the way you can easily use conspiracy minded thinking to dismiss any criticism against your side. any bad news = 'deep state framejob'

       I second this. 
Do not let the trolls silence you or distract you. 
Stay the course and ignore the trolls. They don't like it when you ignore them. They also don't like it when you refuse to argue, they need to get a response to engage.

       There is never going to be proof of intention, in my opinion. We can infer it and speculate, but that’s why in my posts I just present behavior and not my interpretation of the user(s) motivations.

       I have recently seen a few examples of people copying and pasting more “liberal” comments, but no clear indication they are shareblue. Check out
       <a href="/r/thesefuckingaccounts">

       which has all variety of astroturfing examples.

       The link spamming and the alt/ban evasion issue seems particularly bad in this sub, though the former has somewhat improved with rule 13 (when it’s being enforced).

       It always ends up that the most egregious brigaders and spammers are the same group of turds that have been trying to shitup reddit since day one.  Once they latched onto Trump and that sub, they have been emboldened and think they can take over any place.
      </p>
      <p>
       They team up with the Stromfronters that have been coming here for years and are fantastically good at making their numbers seem larger.  In the end it's about 200 dedicated folks that can make the hay to disrupt and capture a sub.  Amazing how easy manipulating a sub is when you focus on the new queue.

       Is that what you’ve observed since you’ve been here awhile? Do you have any links to read about it. I’ve heard rumors on other oldtimer/meta/astroturfing threads in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the last part you wrote, I don’t doubt it at all. Each sockpuppet group I’ve seen, many of whom had accounts suspended by admins now, I think we’re run by just one person. One guy had 40+ alts. It doesn’t take many early votes to propel something to the fp.

       You can recognize shills by their use of disruptive and deceptive tactics, and lack of contributing any good material. You can narrow it down to the liberal political organizations by the talking points they use.

       I'm skeptical about the shareblue involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example - when was the last time anyone on this sub, anyone at all, had a kind word for Hillary Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, very few posts here portray any sort of progressive mindset at all.  That doesn't bother me, even though I tend left - I'm here to glean out the 5% gems in the 95% muck.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were Sharebluebots here, we'd have endless conspiracy theories about how the Russians or RNC spies destroyed Saint Hillary's chances (instead of her shooting herself in the foot over and over and over and over as actually happened).
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, there are two camps here when it comes to American politics:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        People who love Trump but hate Hillary.
       </li>
       <li>
        People who hate Trump
        <em>
         and
        </em>
        Hillary.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Ah, poor Hillary!  You could almost feel sorry for her, if she weren't so evil, and incompetent, and fakey.

       users are responsible for copying those comments? Seems much more likely that those comments were copied intentionally to further the narrative that

       You are right in the assertion that it is entirely possible that it's left-wing folk from r/politics or TMOR digging through T_D posts and copy/pasting here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you've got to look at the motivation. What would these left-wing ideologues have to gain for months and months of posts? Everyone already thinks T_D brigades and bots, and Conspiracy is known to lean right (though it has become more balanced recently). So it would be a small, meaningless victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does T_D gain from botting and brigading? Well, convincing those on the fence that their narrative/worldview is more pervasive than it actually is, for one. For two, these small, "independent" sites contained above are clearly monetized by clicks. So someone is getting paid here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You weigh it out and the answer is pretty obvious, T_D and those affiliated with these websites have, by and far, the most to gain.

       Shareblue pays people just to stalk the comments section here and yell at anyone who disagrees with their politics. Why in the world do you suppose that making a few fake accounts to frame their arch enemies for running low quality bots is outside their wheelhouse? The_Donald certainly has bots, but their sophistication is now being studied because it was so effective during the election.

       And I'm noticing more criticism towards people that don't understand something or ask a question deemed "stupid". 
Doesn't this discourage discussion and isn't the main purpose of this sub to wake up the masses to conspiracies and alternate perspectives?

       People that shut down discussion and try to cause others to feel stupid for even asking a question are the real shills imo.

       Once you've browsed 4 or 8chan and learned the system over there, the concern trolls here are immediately easy to spot. If you haven't, you can be more forgiving to those who appear to be asking serious questions, but their sole purpose is to derail or mislead a convo.

       Here's the answer to the increase of "trolls":
      </p>
      <p>
       People (Normies?) come here when a particular story piques their curiosity.  Then end up sticking around here because they find other things interesting, and/or they find some of the ridiculous shit people believe here entertaining....with that comes the trolling, which = more entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also doesn't help that when someone goes against a narrative, they instantly get called a shill or a troll.

       I agree, though I started lurking here when it was already awful.

       The link spamming and the alt/ban evasion issue seems particularly bad in this sub, though the former has somewhat improved with rule 13 (when it’s being enforced).

       users are responsible for copying those comments? Seems much more likely that those comments were copied intentionally to further the narrative that
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">

       to notice them.
