<p>Make some searches </p>

<p>You&#39;ll find endless posts on Pedogate/human trafficking and false flags. </p>

<p>I was very shocked by the community when i first stumbled upon it. Top upvoted posts would highlight how mass shootings were used to cover up big news and distract people and even posts about how 9/11 was done by globalists. </p>

<p>It was very shocking for me to see that, in such a big community. </p>

<p>But, at the same time, the news there is very polarized. And very antifeminist, antiblacklivesmatter, and anti-illegal immigration.... Basically anti any group that acts victimized but acts like white males are victims. And also very pro-cop, pro-military...</p>

<p>Interesting community there anyway. I&#39;ll definitely see a lot of big news posted there that won&#39;t be in /news or /politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s all a psyop. The govt created/promoted the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; to discredit anyone questioning the office JFK story. Nowadays they try to lump all conspiracy theorists with far right wingers. Alex Jones is a character sponsored by the govt as a limited hangout/ gatekeeper for the right wing. If you spent any time on the forum, you&#39;d see how many of us reject left-right political divisiveness and reject both political party mafias. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree this explains a lot of it, and it is organic. Which is fine. </p>

<p>I also think protrump forces have noticed this same trend and want to amplify it, and control it. This is a great way to keep their supporters on their team, and to make sure they dont believe any counter narratives about their guy. Look at the way you can easily use conspiracy minded thinking to dismiss any criticism against your side. any bad news = &#39;deep state framejob&#39;</p>

<p>They team up with the Stromfronters that have been coming here for years and are fantastically good at making their numbers seem larger.  In the end it&#39;s about 200 dedicated folks that can make the hay to disrupt and capture a sub.  Amazing how easy manipulating a sub is when you focus on the new queue.</p>

<p>For the last part you wrote, I don’t doubt it at all. Each sockpuppet group I’ve seen, many of whom had accounts suspended by admins now, I think we’re run by just one person. One guy had 40+ alts. It doesn’t take many early votes to propel something to the fp. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical about the shareblue involvement.</p>

<p>For example - when was the last time anyone on this sub, anyone at all, had a kind word for Hillary Clinton?  </p>

<p>Indeed, very few posts here portray any sort of progressive mindset at all.  That doesn&#39;t bother me, even though I tend left - I&#39;m here to glean out the 5% gems in the 95% muck.</p>

<p>If there were Sharebluebots here, we&#39;d have endless conspiracy theories about how the Russians or RNC spies destroyed Saint Hillary&#39;s chances (instead of her shooting herself in the foot over and over and over and over as actually happened).</p>

<p>Really, there are two camps here when it comes to American politics:</p>

<ul>
<li>People who love Trump but hate Hillary.</li>
<li>People who hate Trump <em>and</em> Hillary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ah, poor Hillary!  You could almost feel sorry for her, if she weren&#39;t so evil, and incompetent, and fakey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right in the assertion that it is entirely possible that it&#39;s left-wing folk from r/politics or TMOR digging through T_D posts and copy/pasting here. </p>

<p>But you&#39;ve got to look at the motivation. What would these left-wing ideologues have to gain for months and months of posts? Everyone already thinks T_D brigades and bots, and Conspiracy is known to lean right (though it has become more balanced recently). So it would be a small, meaningless victory. </p>

<p>What does T_D gain from botting and brigading? Well, convincing those on the fence that their narrative/worldview is more pervasive than it actually is, for one. For two, these small, &quot;independent&quot; sites contained above are clearly monetized by clicks. So someone is getting paid here.</p>

<p>You weigh it out and the answer is pretty obvious, T_D and those affiliated with these websites have, by and far, the most to gain.</p>

<p>Shareblue pays people just to stalk the comments section here and yell at anyone who disagrees with their politics. Why in the world do you suppose that making a few fake accounts to frame their arch enemies for running low quality bots is outside their wheelhouse? The_Donald certainly has bots, but their sophistication is now being studied because it was so effective during the election.</p>
