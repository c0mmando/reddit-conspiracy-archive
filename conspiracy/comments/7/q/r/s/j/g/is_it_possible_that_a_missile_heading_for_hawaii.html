    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s tough! The thing I have found to be the case most of the time with this is that people do have some sort of realization that something isn&#39;t right, but they consciously refuse to address it because they aren&#39;t comfortable - terrified, actually - with replacing the programming they are comfortable with; they prefer to &#39;fit in&#39;&#39;/be part of the herd, maybe. But I also think they just don&#39;t want to give up the nice, little, pat imaginary world they live in. I think some of it is pure laziness, that they don&#39;t want to put effort of thinking, of puzzling it out, which, I&#39;m sure you know, is a life&#39;s work. Denial is the least effort, and easiest to &#39;go along to get along&#39;. </p>

<p>This is good- it&#39;s very long (so requires a willingness to want to know), and is from a biblical perspective, so it&#39;s only for those with open minds and that can think for themselves, beyond dogmas; it does help explain the background on how things came to be this way, &amp; are: </p>

<p>That&#39;s about 20 hours of video, all of it pretty intense for the novice, but I&#39;m a fan of maximum culture shock. You can mix &amp; match, but I like this order. I don&#39;t have a clue how to convince anyone (but I love to share with those desirous of knowing!), as I have never been totally successful in leading anyone to the full truth the few times I&#39;ve tried - reluctance doesn&#39;t begin to describe it (there&#39;s a high incidence of recidivism, too, heh). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  No chance.  The US is itching for war because wartime spending is the only thing that can postpone the inevitable collapse of the dollar as the world reserve currency.  If someone, anyone, launched missile for real, the US would be responding with full force, doing it&#39;s best to drag the world into ww3.  Just look at Trump&#39;s rhetoric - he&#39;s actively trying to pick fights with other nations, just waiting for someone to give him an excuse.</p>

<p>So if anyone <em>actually</em> launched something, we&#39;d be seeing a hugely aroused federal reserve/deep state pushing Congress for boots-on-the-ground invasion.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider, almost all nations are beholden to their central banks.  In fact, many speculate that all wars since the fall of Napoleon have been orchestrated deliberately by central banks to rake improved profits from nations that have to massively increase borrowing to cover wartime spending.</p>

<p>Since a nuclear exchange is so extraordinarily final, it&#39;s also extraordinarily UNprofitable for the central banks.  After all, who will be left to make interest payments on national debts if the nations wind up destroyed?</p>

<p>Extended ground campaigns cost millions of dollars a day for all parties involved, which is an incalculable boon to the central banks that lend to each of the warring governments.  Since it&#39;s really central banks behind a majority of world governments/policies, it&#39;s very very unlikely that they would ever allow for a course that damages their own ability to profit and maintain political control of the world.</p>

<p>So, no nukes, unless it really is an un-directed human-error-y accident or equipment malfunction.  Or an un-directed hack of defense systems by a malicious independent actor.</p>

<p>But as long as TPTB still have control, they won&#39;t allow nukes.  It&#39;s just not as profitable as ongoing multilateral ground-based warfare.  </p>

<p>Which is what we have now.  You should be a lot less worried about hot-headed individuals pushing red buttons, and a lot more worried about the worldwide system of financial control  that deliberately manipulates nations into war in the first place.</p>
