<p>by Michael Salla
January 03, 2018
from <a href="http://exopolitics.org/">Exopolitics</a> Website</p>

<p>The internet has been buzzing with rumors that high level VIP members of the <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_secretgov.htm">Deep State</a> (aka Cabal/Illuminati/Global Elite) are being detained for <strong>human rights abuses and corruption</strong>, and are being taken by U.S. Special Forces to military prison at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_Naval_Base">Gitmo</a>) as a result of thousands of sealed indictments.</p>

<p>Multiple sources have been reporting on some of the key VIP figures taken there.</p>

<p>While these are still only rumors, recent events point to their plausibility. If accurate, these secret investigations, arrests and extractions to Gitmo where they face extended detention and military justice has enormous political implications, and makes possible the release of suppressed information previously withheld by the Deep State.</p>

<p>One source of such rumors comes from <strong>David Todeschini</strong>, a former USAF veteran who wrote an expose about covert operations during the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>He describes what he learned from a reliable FBI source about recent events at Guantanamo in a December 24, 2017 Youtube below video, which he summarized as follows:</p>

<pre><code>High-level confidential sources tell this reporter that the U.S. Military prison at Guantanamo Bay has been alerted to expect high-profile prisoners shortly - possibly as a result of over 10,000 Sealed FEDERAL indictments.



1,000 Marines accompanied General Mattis to Gitmo to provide security for &quot;special prisoners&quot;...

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RVWoNX4PY0">VIDEO</a></p>

<p>Another source for secret extractions to GITMO via sealed indictments is veteran journalist Dr. Jerome Corsi <a href="https://twitter.com/jerome_corsi/status/946777668212740096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bibliotecapleyades.net%2Fsociopolitica%2Fsociopol_globalelite301.htm">who tweeted</a>:</p>

<p>A third source is <strong>Brenden Dilley</strong>, a<a href="https://twitter.com/hublife?lang=en"> radio host running for the U.S. Congress</a>, who received information from another anonymous whistleblower who has a track record for reliability.</p>

<p>The whistleblower&#39;s information appeared in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/crowdsourcethetruth/permalink/543397476017001/">December 27 post</a> that was <a href="http://operationdisclosure.blogspot.com.au/2017/12/qanon-intel-gitmo-7-new-residents.html">mistakenly attributed to QAnon</a> (see update below for discussion of misattribution to QAnon).</p>

<p>The post refers to recent VIP arrivals at Gitmo discussion:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_sociopol2/globalelite301_02_small.jpg">#QAnon #MassArrests</a> </p>

<p>What is worth emphasizing in the above post is that new residents began arriving at Gitmo on December 26, 2017, and more were expected.</p>

<p>This was after President <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_trump.htm">Trump</a> had issued his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-blocking-property-persons-involved-serious-human-rights-abuse-corruption/">Executive Order</a> on December 21 declaring a &quot;national emergency&quot; in response to human rights abuses and corruption anywhere around the world.</p>

<p>Finally, we have former Forbes Magazine correspondent, <strong>Benjamin Fulford</strong>, <a href="https://benjaminfulford.net/2018/01/01/happy-new-year-hundreds-top-khazarian-mobsters-including-bush-family-renditioned-gitmo/">who wrote</a> on January 01, 2018:</p>

<pre><code>In a historic moment of poetic justice, most of the U.S.-based top perpetrators of the fake &quot;[war on terror](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_waronterror.htm)&quot; have now themselves been renditioned to the U.S. Navy camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Pentagon sources say. 

    &quot;The Rothschild assets [George Soros](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_soros.htm), Peter Munk, Peter Sutherland, [the Bushes](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_bush.htm), the Podestas, and many others may have been airlifted to Gitmo for military tribunals, as the Department of Defense spends $500M to upgrade the prison and send more military police and Marines,&quot; the sources say.
</code></pre>

<p>What can be distilled from these independent sources is that high level Deep State members, many of whom are part of a Pedophile Satanic global network, are being detained by U.S. Special Forces and taken to Gitmo where they are to be held indefinitely, while military justice is applied to their cases.</p>

<p>In the process, Gitmo&#39;s holding facilities are being significantly upgraded with expansions and more guards to accommodate an infusion of VIP prisoners.</p>

<p>Among the first to refer to U.S. Special Forces being used to investigate and detain Deep State figures under the authority of sealed indictments was Secret Space Program whistleblower <strong>Corey Goode</strong>.</p>

<p>He referred to such military investigations <a href="http://exonews.org/corey-goode-update-us-special-forces-take-on-satanic-pedophile-group/">back on August 09, 2017</a> after being briefed by a source he described as retired FBI and career military:</p>

<pre><code>[T]here were teams of U.S. Special Forces that were conducting,

    &quot;domestic surveillance and investigations of a Satanic group that had infiltrated all aspects of government agencies and the military.&quot;

These Special Forces teams have been in place since the middle of the election cycle… I was informed that a secret report on how pervasive these infiltrations are is more shocking than what was expected.



Strangely, this report also had notes from several secret grand juries that are active right now in D.C.



The report states that the conspiracy involves the majority of powerful people in within the U.N., E.U., U.S., State and local (City) power structures.



These government organization are completely complicit in what is going on.



All the way down to local Post Offices and Police Offices...
</code></pre>

<p>More recently, Goode says that his sources have told him that Gitmo is being upgraded to host VIP detainees, and includes wheelchair access for some of them, who are being detained by Special Forces working around the globe</p>

<p>As explained in a <a href="http://projectavalon.net/forum4/showthread.php?100554-David-Wilcock-upate-2017-nov-11-12-Saudi-Mass-Arrests-Sign-of-Impending-Cabal-Defeat">November 05 communication</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Secret Grand Juries were almost totally complete with their investigations when everything changed. They had sealed indictments being prepared when they received a cache of new info that gave them a wider net to cast.



Their investigation has since expanded dramatically.



So much about the plans of a coup is known about by the Cabal that I don&#39;t know how much longer the Alliance can wait to act and prevent the Cabal from sneaking out of the country.



Some of the really bad ones have already left.



Our SF (Special Forces) teams are planning on going in to some of these countries that are hiding these Cabal members and taking them by force.
</code></pre>

<p>Are such claims true...? </p>

<p>In scrutinizing public records what is known fact is that <strong>James Mattis</strong>, Secretary of Defense, <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/12/21/mattis-makes-unusual-visit-to-gitmo/"><strong>did visit</strong> Gitmo on December 21</a> becoming the first Secretary of Defense to do so since 2002.</p>

<p>It was the same day that Trump issued his &quot;Executive Order Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse or Corruption&quot;, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-blocking-property-persons-involved-serious-human-rights-abuse-corruption/">where he declared</a>:</p>

<pre><code>I therefore determine that serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.
</code></pre>

<p>The timing suggests that this was more than coincidence, and raised a possible link between Mattis&#39; visit and the Executive Order.</p>

<p>Such a link is strengthened by an earlier visit to Gitmo in July 2017 by Attorney General <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/12/21/mattis-makes-unusual-visit-to-gitmo/">who called Gitmo</a>:</p>

<pre><code>a &quot;perfectly acceptable&quot; place to detain new terrorist suspects, as opposed to holding them in the U.S. and having his own Justice Department try them in civilian courts.
</code></pre>

<p>GITMO CHATTER: MATTlS VISITS CUBA</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiaP492Jyqs">VIDEO</a></p>

<p>It is quite feasible that Gitmo would be used to house detainees under Trump&#39;s Executive Order.</p>

<p>They could be treated similarly to terrorists under the Executive Order&#39;s &quot;national emergency&quot; which <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-blocking-property-persons-involved-serious-human-rights-abuse-corruption/">delegated authority to any U.S. agency</a> capable of enforcing the Order&#39;s primary function of cutting off the financial assets of targeted individuals and groups:</p>

<pre><code>Sec. 8 - …The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States.



All agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.
</code></pre>

<p>Consequently, Trump&#39;s Executive Order provided a firm legal foundation for U.S. Special Forces to physically detain targeted individuals in the U.S. mainland and anywhere around the planet, and have them relocated to Gitmo when necessary.</p>

<p>Military law rather than U.S. domestic law would apply those detained by U.S. Special Forces acting under the authority of Sealed Indictments and the December 21, Executive Order.</p>

<p>This would be powerful leverage that could be used to gain confessions and cooperation from lower level Deep State operatives against their superiors who are being taken to Gitmo.</p>

<p>Another pertinent fact is that Todeschini claims that 1000 marines accompanied Mattis and will remain to provide special security for the VIP prisoners.</p>

<p>Similarly, they refer to both Marines and National Guard military police being taken to Gitmo.  </p>

<p>As far as USMC personnel being taken to Gitmo, a <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article168273127.html">Miami Herald news story</a> refers to a proposed upgrade at Gitmo that includes barracks for 848 prison troops to be ready in four years.</p>

<p>This is very close to the alleged 1000 marines that Todeschini (and others) claim have been sent there to guard the VIP prisoners.</p>

<p>There is also corroboration for the claim regarding National Guard military police being taken to Gitmo. On December 29, 2017,<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2017/12/29/arizona-national-guard-military-police-help-guantanamo-bay/990063001/"> it was reported</a> that the Arizona National Guard was deploying over four dozen military police to Gitmo for a nine month term.</p>

<p>A Department of Defense Report <a href="https://democrats-oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/Opening.pdf,">cited in a May 24, 2016 U.S. Congressional statement</a>, described the peak prison population at Gitmo was 684 prisoners in June of 2003, and this had been reduced to about 80 by 2016.</p>

<p>More recent estimates of the Gitmo prison population is roughly 40 Islamic terrorists</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article168273127.html">Miami Herald stor</a>y from August 21, 2017 revealed that the Trump administration was planning to spend up to $500 million on upgrading Gitmo facilities. This included a Navy proposal to build a five bed hospital at a total cost of $250 million.</p>

<p>The fact that a five bed hospital is to be built at such significant cost does suggest that Trump plans to significantly expand the number of prisoners at Gitmo.</p>

<p>These would not be suspected Islamic terrorists, however, but VIP prisoners behind international human rights abuses and corruption who will not be allowed medical treatment on the U.S. mainland.</p>

<p>Finally, we arrive at the key claim that thousands of sealed indictments have been prepared which have been used to authorize the detention and extraction of Deep State personnel.</p>

<p>The Public Access to Court Electronic Records (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACER_(law)">PACER</a>) system was scrutinized to confirm the existence of 4289 sealed Federal indictments by November 22, 2017, according to former FBI agent <a href="http://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/news/u-s-national-news/1679-now-4-289-sealed-federal-indictments-cases-in-all-94-federal-districts-historic">Hal Turner</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWantedEmcees/status/944965851391905794/photo/1">sources claim</a> that this has risen to over 9000 sealed indictments as of December 24, 2017.</p>

<p>This figure has not yet been substantiated, but it would be reasonable to conclude that the November figure may have significantly increased during December.</p>

<p>In conclusion, there is compelling evidence to support claims that leading figures from a Deep State international network of VIPs that are involved in,</p>

<pre><code>    *child trafficking

    *human rights abuses

    *corruption

    *Satanic rituals,
</code></pre>

<p>...are being investigated, detained and extracted to Gitmo via sealed indictments enforced by U.S. Special Forces.</p>

<p>The implications of these unfolding events for,</p>

<pre><code>    *disclosure of classified technologies related to [secret space programs](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_flyingobjects.htm#Space_Command)

    *[Antarctic bases](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_antartica.htm) hidden under the ice sheets

    *[extraterrestrial life](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_18.htm),
</code></pre>

<p>...all previously suppressed by the Deep State, are profound.</p>

<p>There is grounds for cautious optimism that the prospects of &quot;full disclosure&quot; will substantially increase as more corrupt <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_secretgov.htm">Deep State</a> officials are taken to Gitmo.</p>

<p>Their removal from powerful global leadership positions will help greatly in ending their decades-long policies of denying the rest of humanity the benefits of advanced technologies that will revolutionize life all over the planet.</p>

<p><strong>Update - January 03, 2018:</strong></p>

<pre><code>I received the following comment on my Facebook page about an alleged Q post on December 27, 2017. The commenter, Ann Schrock says that it is a misattribution since Q Anon has not posted since Dec 25.



She says she transcribed the anonymous source for the December 27 quote and wrote:

    &quot;That info came from a &#39;source&#39; who has/had been feeding Brenden Dilley, who was doing a Periscope on his personal twitter page.



    I watched and transcribed as I listened. I have no idea if this info is true, I simply wrote what I heard. It is for you to keep in mind... or don&#39;t.&quot;

Ann Schrock posted additional material which can be [read here]facebook/groups/crowdsourcethetruth/permalink/543397476017001/).



While there is reason to believe the Brendan Dilley source is legitimate, the December 27 post was misattributed to QAnon. I have henceforth corrected the article and added this update to clarify the situation.



Thanks to Ann Schrock for pointing out the error.
