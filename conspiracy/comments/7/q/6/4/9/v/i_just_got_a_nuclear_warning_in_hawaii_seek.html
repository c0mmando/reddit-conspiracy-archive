<p>Also, add some L-Theanine, high quality CBD and phosphatidylserine supplements to your supplies. They help eliminate excess cortisol (stress hormone) from your body so you don’t end up wrecked by stress. They can be very helpful supplements for disasters, close calls and false alarms, like today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what youre saying but i dont think youre really taking the severity of the situation into account. Like sure feeling like im normal and healthy is great, but id rather be normal and healthy. To do that i need food and water which i can buy quite alot of with 20$.</p>

<p>I just imagine it like this, doomsday happened 2 weeks ago, ive been feeling pretty rough recently but thats expected sitting in this bunker 24/7 supplies are starting to get low but thankfully i spent that extra money on food and water so we have a little bit more time we can hold out and nobody dies of thirst or starvation. </p>

<p>Vs</p>

<p>So doomsday happened yesterday but i feel great thanks to this l-theanine i dropped 20$ on honestly it was a great purchase now everyone take a capsule, yes 3 times is probably the amount needed for it to have actual effect but we dont have the rations for that so everyone take 1 and prey to the gods of placebo effect. </p>

<p>Day 2. Ok so surprisingly thanks to this miracle supplement we&#39;re all feeling pretty good, now i know we still cant leave the bunker but atleast we&#39;ll be slightly less miserable, dont drink too much water sweetie we have to ration that. </p>

<p>Day 3. Fuck, this theanine is going faster than i thought i guess we can take it away from the kids they dont really need it anyways. For my 20$ i might have gotten a months supply but thats for 1 person. I shouldve bought more.</p>

<p>Day 21 am. We&#39;re desperately low on food and water, the radiation shouldve lowered by now. No official statement by the military has been made but i have no choice i have to go to the surface today. Luckily i realized early on to save the l-theanine instead of wasting it so ill be alert. </p>

<p>Day 21 pm. I cant believe this i went to the surface, the city is destroyed everything is in ruin and i was nearly robbed by some bandits luckily my L-theanine kicked in and i was alert enough to escape in time. NO HONEY IT WASNT MY GODAMNED FUCKING ADRENALINE KICKING IN DO YOU EVER JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP, JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER YOU THINK YOURE SO FUCKING SMART I CANT WAIT UNTIL YOU STARVE. Im sorry, i didnt mean that i was just stressed, theanine must not be kicking in right now, maybe ive built a tolerance. </p>

<p>Day 30. Honey we knew it was going to come to this, but its one of the kids. We just dont have enough rations to keep both and theirs no word of rescue, we cant risk traveling because of the bandits and theirs nothing to scrounge for in the city because everything is destroyed. We&#39;ll flip a coin and ill make it quick. </p>

<p>Day 31. We killed brian yesterday, the wifes snapped no matter how much theanine i give her she just wont calm down, funny its supposed to calm you down when youre extraordinarily stressed, she must have a built a tolerance too, maybe a non-responder. Grace keeps asking where her brother is, i dont know how to tell her.</p>

<p>Day 32. We ate Brian today. We&#39;re nearly out of food, i didnt have a choice. But Brian was so skinny from the lack of food he didnt give us much, Grace is starving too...</p>

<p>Day 33. The theanine ran out 2 days ago, nothings going to calm us down now. The descent into madness is painfully apparent. We have to kill Grace today as we cant afford to feed her any longer. I really wish id bought more rations. </p>

<p>Day 40. I ate both my children, i had no choice we had to survive the children wouldnt last on their own. My wife shot herself after we killed Grace she just snapped, i wish id had l-theanine to fix it. But maybe if i hadnt wasted my money on theanine instead of necessities we couldve lasted longer and been rescued before we had to eat our own children causing her to go insane. Hindsight is 20/20 i guess. Fantastic news though the military is coming to help survivors now, i was on our last can of soup and only had 2 more bottles of water left thank god. </p>

<p>Day 60. I was rescued 20 days ago, it was the happiest moment of my life even though they threw me in this cell to rot i had food and water and i dont have to worry about anything, but apparently killing and eating your wife/2 children is serious crime even in the apocalypse so i guess im being tried for that now. Oh theyre coming to get me now, that was quicker than i thought i saved one last pill for a dire situation like this and now ill get to use it. </p>

<p>Day 61, I&#39;ve been told im going to die, i have no regrets though. The lives of my family and to a lesser extent myself are nothing compared to the euphoria i feel from this miracle drug l-theanine, as he puts the gun to my head numerous men spitting in my face, pissing on my soon to be corpse i think to myself wow do i feel alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>L-theanine isn&#39;t a miracle drug, it&#39;s like a vitamin that will help you chill the fuck out at least a bit, and make sure you&#39;re level-headed enough to think, rather than panic uselessly like what it seems you&#39;re doing now. A $15 bottle of l-theanine will last you 60 days, and you&#39;ll probably have enough money to purchase food, unless your doomsday budget is $30 dollars, and then I understand why you think buying a supplement spells out your doom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just a foolish use of available funds, when you say 60 days do you saying that knowing the clinical dosage for l-theanine dived by numerous people?</p>

<p>And yes realistically to a lesser extent i figure most rational people dont have insanely large doomsday budgets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, if your doomsday budget is $30 dollars don’t expect to make it more than a a week anyhow. But from the look of your response, you probably would greatly benefit from some cortisol reducing supplements regardless of doom approaching. Seriously, this stuff helps with overthinking and you probably will find it very helpful. </p>

<p>Best wishes to you. I hope you have a wonderful and safe weekend, friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CBD oil comes from Marijuana and also Hemp. It can be separated out so that there are literally no psychoactive effects, so it will not make you high in any way. But CBD has been found to do amazing stuff for the body. It binds with excess cortisol (stress hormone) every effectively lowering it and thus reducing bad stress effects on the body. But can do much much more. It can immediately stop seizures. Some people have found it reduces cancer tumor size and can even get rid of some types of cancer. It also is great for reducing inflammation. Many people also find they can think more clearly (just mentally sharper) after taking CBD. It’s good stuff. I believe it is legal everywhere in the US, but for places where Marijuana is still illegal on the state level, the CBD that is sold is derived from Hemp. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>where i live, a week ago the tsunami alert went off at about the usual monthly test time but then the recorded message said something about it not being a test.  When that ended, a voice came on saying to disregard the warning.  Then, the original recording came back on, saying a tsunami warning had been issued.  After which, the &quot;disregard this message&quot; voice came back.</p>

<p>The part of town I was at, it was really hard to make out what was being said and I didn&#39;t realize the &quot;test&quot; was going on longer than usual.  The &quot;test&quot; was going on for awhile, before I realized a voice was saying &quot;This is not a test.&quot;  I perked up right away, but it was a good 15-20 seconds before I could make anything else out, and that was when the 2nd voice said &quot;disregard&quot;.</p>

<p>My roommate was in a part of town where the alert could be heard more clearly.  Him and a few other people were headed for their cars to drive inland when the 2nd voice came on.  My roommate said the &quot;not a test&quot;/&quot;disregard&quot; thing cycled thru 3 times before stopping.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder if the disaster alert systems are getting tested because TPTB have something planned <strong>ANNNNND</strong> if part of what is being planned relies on people not trusting the various disaster alert systems.</p>

<p>Anyone else have one of their locale&#39;s/region&#39;s disaster alert systems send out a false alert recently?</p>
