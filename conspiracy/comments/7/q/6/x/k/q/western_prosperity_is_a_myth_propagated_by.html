<p>Outside of western world, you can just start selling hotdogs outside of a shed. You CANT do this anywhere in Western world - need 100 permits - dont have them - police will ARREST YOU.</p>

<p>All you need to do is to look at the COST of products, for example, milk/bread. They are super expensive anywhere in the Western world, and CHEAP anywhere outside of the Western world. </p>

<p>they are expensive for ONE MAIN REASON - high government taxes/fees/ripoffs. The West has INSANENLY high taxes, and that is how Western Elites (formerly Kings/Queens) get RICH.</p>

<p>You cant even build a simple building in the USwithout the government charging you approval/bs fees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i live in china and there are lots of taxes and fees- its just that the cost of labor is so low that people can get jobs easier</p>

<p>also, on a productivity scale, most chinese are much lazier then americans- chinese usually way over staff their jobs and create tons of waste- also they have paid vacation and sick leave and most jobs provide free apartment or subsidies </p>

<p>i mean, chinese workers just work less hours and are getting a better quality of life- economically speaking </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ya, the level of shittiness that USA has reached is very high ... so high that average chinese worker lives better and works less than an american one </p>

<p>oh, i have some questions for you regarding fees. 
for example, if i wanted to build a 1500 sq m warehouse in a semi rural area, how much would the fees be, do you know? for example, if an employer hires an employee, what taxes do they pay to govt? are they required to buy insurance? </p>

<p>can u kinda go over fees and amounts approximate as far as you know</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well when it comes to building in china it is very complicated- people do not really own the land they are on, all property is owned by the chinese government 
- lets say you where interested in building a warehouse in a tier 3 area, basically cities with 4 million or less people then you would need permission from the central planners in the city before you can begin construction- the actual cost for the permits is very low, maybe a hundred dollars, but the process to get the permits filed and approved is very long, if you are an average person not connected to the government it could take months or years to get a new construction approved</p>

<p>the faster and easier way would be to rent a warehouse that already exists, rents in china are very cheap while actually owning a building is incredibly expensive since they are used as huge investments </p>

<p>taxes in china work slightly similar to the us- the more you make the more you pay, the difference is most employers take the tax rate into account in contracts and salaries- people always negotiate an after tax salary and expect the employer to cover the tax burden-taxes rise steeply once you hit over 30,000rmb a month(about 4200usd), but most chinese don&#39;t care since if you are working for an employer they are covering the taxes and you just see your money- but the overall tax burden is just much lower to the average worker then the us</p>

<p>most people in china don&#39;t need health insurance, but some jobs provide it- most common reason people get health insurance is for concerns about long term illness or a pregnancy- i have no insurance but i see doctors regularly for care</p>

<p>medical costs in china are just a joke, a fraction of us prices for even the most expensive procedures, the language barrier is always an issue, but even deluxe international hospitals are easily affordable </p>

<p>i cant stress how cheap the rent is and how high the pay is- low skilled english teachers are regularly making in the 20-30k rmb month after tax, rent is barely 3000rmb in beijing and shanghai- the most expensive markets for a one bed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thx, the wage/rent ratio is so awesome ... maybe i should apply ... in US, more than 50% of your wage goes to rent if not more ... but thats because american warmachine has to take a cut/etc</p>

<p>rents are obviously cheap in China because building is cheap
however it sucks that permits take so long</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is actually a really easy answer</p>

<p>its first and foremost to buy property outside of china, buying a house or land in china is illegal(land) or crazy expensive (property) so even a million dollar house in the us is a bargain to the chinese</p>

<p>then there is also the issue of rights of travel- your average china person does not have the right to free travel, not even inside china- BUT if they can get an american college degree they can travel to complete it, open bank accounts, but property- these things give them the right to travel outside of china</p>

<p>also- chinese people don&#39;t have a lot of &quot;rights&quot; in general- they don&#39;t have a right to trial, they don&#39;t have a right to a lawyer, they can be detained for virtually any reason, the internet is heavily controlled and a lot of other things that make general quality of life not great- it has dramatically improved in the past 5 years and is likely to continues, but its still not great</p>

<p>i often discus this with my co workers with the american obsession with norway- in norway the cost of living is incredibly high, mobility relatively low, and reliance on public assistance universal- this seems to be to GOAL of America right now- the chinese want their current growth and economic mobility, but they also would like more social and human rights- but they don&#39;t want to risk the financial gains that have been happened</p>

<p>so if you ask a chinese- do you want to be norway or china- they say china</p>

<p>ask and american if you want to be norway or america- they say norway</p>

<p>there seems to be a disconnect in the goal</p>

<p>immigration is a good place to look- china HAS a merit based immigration system that leads to permeant residency, this is a sea change for china in the past 5 years- people on a lot of subs want america to end ALL worker visas and all permanent residency to protect the cutlure- china likes its culture but it likes growth more!</p>
