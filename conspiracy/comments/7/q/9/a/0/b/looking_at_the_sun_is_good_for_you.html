       Staring at the sun, just at sunrise and sunset, before it rises too high above the horizon is healthy for every part of your body.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a lost practice of truly living.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not a quick process. It is not instantly refreshing nor rejuvenating. It is healing and nourishing, and it takes time and adherence. That's why it is so easily dismissed. Sure I could post some phony bologna site about how it does this or that, maybe its not bologna, but you wouldn't believe it anyway. Sometimes someones word is more convincing than evidence from the most reputable source.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do this every day. Except when there are clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
       All life revolves around the sun, growing food, sustaining animals, warmth, light, everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       And gazing at our source of life can be life giving, if done correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would the world be like if people did not consume Mcdonalds, or Hershey bars, and Cocainecola...? What would it be like if people could overcome the addictive substances and poisonous chemicals injected into products like these? They put these poisons in our food and water to keep us docile, dependent, and drugged... They make us more compliant, less creative and cradles an environment shapable to their every need. Do you think that sounds crazy? Thats ok, I would have thought the same thing not so long ago. Ever wonder why Mcdonalds used a clown as their mascot? They're laughing at you! Its a joke! Their food is not real! But you'll eat it anyway, because you saw a funny commercial and its cheap. Are you tired everyday? Working too much? Headaches all the time? Always worried about the future? Want to end all the exhaustion? Get up early and watch the sun rise! Sunset too if you have the time. Your head will clear, you'll feel energetic, you'll worry no more! Things you wanted to do tomorrow, next week, next month... they get done today! Watch the sun, and you'll watch your life blossom into what you've always dreamed!

       lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       That aside even though there's less UV shortly before/after sunset/sunrise it's still not a great idea. The sungazing and sun eating stuff talks about building up endurance so I think they are ruining their vision!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm from Australia and UV damage to eyes is a real problem just from day to day life, lot of children getting issues so it has been talked about a lot. Many schools now have sunglasses in their sun protection policies.

       Unless your body is fit to be sustained on nothing but sunlight, you will still need food.
      </p>
      <p>
       In our poisoned, chemically laden, world of food and drink, it is next to impossible to live off nothing but sunlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can tell you that food tastes better, and feels more filling after a month of sun gazing.

       Oh, I know. Don't worry, I have common sense. I did find a few good articles on it, saying to start out slowly. It also said it helps to activate the pineal gland, which is great!

       Yes, it is the main reason why it is healthy. Our pineal gland is the center of the brain, our inner eye, the lamp of the body, the genesis of all thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       It regulates every process within us, and is never truly "deactivated", crippled is a better term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watching the sun is good for the pineal gland just as walking is healthy for the muscles. It stimulates and strengthens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting out slow is good practice. Some say to go barefoot and stand on loose dirt, but I have never done that. I do find that being in an open field where a wide view of the sun can be attained is very beneficial though, as apposed to watching it through a small window.

       Drinking lemon juice on an empty stomach and eating cilantro will help. Distilled water is good, despite what people say about leaching minerals. The number one thing you can do for your pineal is exercise.

       Oh, Moron again. Do you stalk me? You username is ever so entertaining, and ill have you know that I have had no negative effects on my eyes, in fact just the opposite. My astigmatism that was worsening suddenly cured itself after less than a year of sun gazing. In fact, my vision is so much more clear, I have never seen better.

       the suneater documentaries are fascinating.  what's interesting is that many of them describe the exact same process of their changes psychologically.  haven't tried it myself.  worried about the eye damage.  but it's an interesting thing, and the consistency of anecdotal evidence is somewhat compelling (at least to learn more).  btw IAMN30, i really like your posts.  the battery stuff is awesome.

       When blue(approx 460nm) light hits these cells, it tells your brain to stop secreting the hormone melatonin. Melatonin allows you to sleep and is a powerful antioxidant. Without enough melatonin your cancer risk goes up.

       This is why white LEDs are so bad for your eyes and your health. Sunlight doesnt cause rhodopsin mediated photoreversal like LEDs but its not great to look directly into sources of UV(although blue light is just as dangerous in reality). Blue light destroys the retina while UV destroys the lens and causes cataracts.

       I too have significantly improved my vision, specifically by avoiding blue light. Orange sunrise and sunset is probably ok to look at briefly but i wouldnt literally stare into it. That being said, most "eco friendly" lights and white LED backlit devices destroy your vision just as easily.

       And again I'll say, I get that a lot, and I may say a lot that could be construed as trollish. But surprisingly, when I get this it's always after a perfectly reasonable comment.
      </p>

       What about my statement makes you feel like I'm trolling? Or did I just hurt your feelings by disagreeing with your pet theory or something?

       If you made a post about new puppies being being cute, and someone commented, "Puppies are ugly rats, you can see much cuter things in a sewer with your eyes closed" I would call them a stupid f'ing troll. Your comment is not perfectly reasonable.

       Lol huh? You are telling people to look directly into the sun. Apparently you didn't know the name of this practice, which is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungazing">

       .

       Apparently you also haven't looked very far into vitamin D synthesis and how it works. You don't need to have your eyes open, since the vitamin D is synthesized in the skin. There is a point between your eyes where it is absorbed readily, which is why I said to face the sun, but even just laying in the sun will still confer the same benefits.
      </p>

       Also, this definitely is nothing like someone saying puppies are cute and me saying "puppies are ugly rats". This is more like you saying "drinking rubbing alcohol is good it gets you drunk" and me saying "ya but rubbing alcohol is dangerous you can drink beer and get drunk too".
