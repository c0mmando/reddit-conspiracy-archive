       in 1972 in south central Alaska my Mom and Aunt were at home one Thursday night watching TV when they decided to go into the kitchen for drinks and snacks. While there they noticed how much brighter the moon seemed to be than it normally was, but being teenage girls didn't think much of it and went back to the living room. However when reentering the living room they noticed the moon again, this time it looked how it normally does but.... it was on the opposite side of the house. They ran back to kitchen window only to see the light was gone. The following day a group of kids reported "being followed home by the moon."

       Nothing more ever came of it. Kind of a let down of a story but it's the only one I have, lets hear yours!

       Driving down the highway I noticed a silver oval, but it really seemed more rectangular. As I watched and drove the speed limit, it began to move east as I traveled south. I continued to watch it drift along and disappear behind the tree line. When I got to where it should have been, it was flipping gone!!! I posted it on facebook that night, this was when I was young and gave a shit about social media.

       I was a preteen, don't recall actual age, guessing around 10 (would have to ask my mother for that story) but this was way before my drugs/psychedelics years. We were riding home, and we saw a ball of light come up from the tree line, do a little curve as it went up and away- but was seemingly noticeably different from the movement of either plane that we had ever seen. It just went up quickly, and disappeared in a smooth zig zag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most conventional plausible explanation was ball lightning, but appeared to be a controlled ascent.

       I have also seen a ball of light. I was mowing the lawn at dusk and a ball of light came up out of the woods and hovered for a few seconds and then took off into the sky. I had been seeing alot of shadow people around the house, mostly outside for a few weeks before seeing the ball of light. After that I never saw the shadow people again.

       I was driving on a busy road with 3 kids in the car, the youngest said "dats airplane," the middle said "that's a weird airplane," the oldest said "wow that's not an airplane." So i looked back and caught a glimpse of what they saw and it was absolutely a ufo. I made a uturn on the highway to get another look, but it was gone within that 30 seconds. I separated the kids when we got home and asked them to draw what they saw, just in case I was imagining things. Nope... 3 domes spread across "wings." Basically this:

       To be honest I'm pretty bad with estimating distance into measurement but I'll try. Apparently a car is about 15ft long, so using that as reference, I'd say that the ufo was 30-40 feet long. The domes, if complete spheres, would have been about 5' in diameter, but I believe they were flat on the bottom iirc. I can't speculate what material, but the rod itself was metal colored, dark gray. The domes were pitch black.
      </p>
      <p>
       For more size reference, 
There was a large vertical antenna on the roof of the restaurant
       <a href="http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/20a1809342fd44ef82f33abe1ecd1979/communications-mast-with-antennas-on-the-roof-of-an-office-building-g2ntjp.jpg">
        like this
       </a>
       which the ufo was hovering next to. So, not understanding what I was seeing, I thought that i was watching a 2nd anntenna mid-collapse, possivly suspended by guy wires? So that would make the structure horizontal? But like I said,  after a quick u turn, it was gone within 30 seconds... nothing in the sky, nothing collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any way I try to process the info, all I can conclude is UFO, without a doubt, foreign entity. I wasn't a believer before that day.

       I saw something very similar 3 years ago. Was in a car with my father about to drive home from the mall when I spotted a black metallic rod with bright white circular lights on the bottom in a 2X4 pattern emerge from behind the treeline in front of us. The UFO made absolutely no sound and was below cloud level maybe up 150 meters or so. It came and went out of view in a straight line within about 20 seconds.

       Cool. After it happened, i looked online for other wittness testimony of similar crafts and couldn't find anything similar, so I think it's interesting that you saw something similar. I wonder if regular dome shaped ufos have a way of morphing shape and linking together with rods in a horizontal formation.

       My father made into project blue book. Years ago they unclassified a ton of if I reports and for kicks I searched up our small state and found a bunch, and one from our very small town...a group of pilots saw an unexplained light in the sky.  My father (a pilot with his own strip) neither confirms or denies he made the call to this day.  The report goes on to state that the light was likely a jet engine flying away from them as there was a major air force base near us at the time.  Oh well.

       Another one: A good friend of mine and his grandfather were watching tv on a rainy night...they noticed a glow in the room the great brighter and brighter.  The glow was from a transparent blue ball floating right in the middle of their living room...just feet in front of them.  Both were frozen solid. It was about 3 feet wide and slowly faded away.  They are convinced it was ball lightening.

       When I was about 13 or 14 I was in my parents back yard on a slightly cloudy but otherwise clear day. I looked up and saw something I still can’t explain. A smooth gray / silver disk sailing across the sky while rotating and tumbling. The speed, altitude and direction of it stayed completely constant, as did the speed of the tumbling motion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was so confused by it that I just watched it until it disappeared over the house (20-30 seconds in total).
      </p>
      <p>
       Still can’t find an explanation, and I’ve never heard of any similar sightings.

       I live in West Virginia, and my dad would go out hunting on some family property early in the morning. One morning he said that as he was standing there, getting ready to walk into the woods; he watched some type of aircraft in the sky hovering and moving around in ways that normal aircraft can't. He wasn't one to bullshit, so i believe he saw something.

       Camping in the Hudson River valley of New York. Saw a silent glowing red oval cruise across the sky
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t  guess the size or it’s elevation but if you held a dime at arms length it would be about the size. Took about 45 seconds to go from the trees of one side of the clearing to the other. I’ll say the silence of it was the amazing part of it. Big, pretty close, moving so smoothly and all totally silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three of us saw it, all we could say the whole time was oh my god and holy shot. Pre camera phone days. It was awesome. Something from somewhere else was in my proximity

       That was the amazing part right, it was like a truck got my past without making any sound.  Saw other things that night too but this was the most obvious UFO. Saw other small formation flying.  If you want to see odd things in the sky go camping in th Hudson River valley near Woodstock. Lay ina field and look up.

       I woke up from a dream when I was about nine or ten where I was being chased by aliens. I looked over and saw a figure about four or five feet tall in my bedroom, large head grey skin and large black eyes. He backed up towards a window and seemed to disappear through the wall. There was a very weird orange yellow light coming from outside. It terrified me and it took me what seemed like an hour to move.
       <br/>
       I've never had another experience like that but my aunt told me once that her and my uncle were driving to Phoenix from Albuquerque. She said they were out near Quemado , nm when she remembers there being a bright light. She said things felt blurry for moment and then all of a sudden it was four hours later and they had only gone like a mile down the road. She said it freaked out my uncle, which is hard to do because he was a six foot five former marine who was a parol officer at the time. This happened to them in the late seventies or early eighties, and she's one of the smartest most level headed people I've ever known. She told me I was the only person she ever told that story to, so I completely believe her.

       It's possible and I've considered it, but I was able to move as soon as I woke up and again after I calmed down. I wasn't freaked out when I woke, it was right after I saw what I saw that I was frozen with terror.

       I'm not discounting the stories from others who say they have experienced something but I definitely think this is a possibility in many cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a moment I still remember extremely vividly about 20 years ago of a little girl walking towards my bed and me being unable to move. None of it was real and I knew that when I finally woke up and I think it was just an example of sleep paralysis.

       I had something similar to your first story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Woke up feeling kinda scared, rolled over and saw my cat was sitting by my window, and he was freaking out. Looking in all directions up and out the window, as if he was watching 20 birds fly by in all directions. That's when I noticed him looking at all these lights flashing: white, green, blue, yellow, orange etc very fast. Looked like a rave outside my window, but all the lights coming from above, in the sky. I sat up in bed and that's when I seemed to have truly "woke up" and the lights/my cat were both gone. I thought I must have been dreaming so I got up to walk around my place a bit and shake it off. That's when I found my cat, hiding behind a table, scared as shit from something. I had to coax him out for a good 3 minutes before he calmed down, he avoided the window for awhile after that.

       Bc you come across as Randy Quaid. Thankfully, this is here... And we are all Randy Quaids.

       My experience, and cred to my Quaidness...

       I was 9  (1991) and my family were driving to nh to visit family from new mexico. we were driving in a black cherry 89 dodge caravan and my mother, father, sister and grandmother were in the vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       we were driving through oklahoma when all of the traffic backed up due to construction.. my father continued on the highway for hours, but every hotel we stopped at was full and after a while, he pulled us into a rest stop to get some shut eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       about a half hour later, my mother, my sister and i were laying in the back of the van, my nana was stretched out on the front bench and my dad was trying to sleep in the driver's seat.
      </p>
      <p>
       My sister (8 at the time,) says, "mum... mum... what's that?" to which my mother responded, "it's nothing stefanie, just go to sleep." "NO, NO mum... what's that?!?" i am facing the fron of the vehicle and i just wanted her to shut up... do i didn't look. Suddenly, my mother shrieks, "george! george! get out of the car, now!!!!"  he does.. so does the trucker behind us.  finally i turn around, tired and irritated. then i saw what she was a griping about.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the sky, barely above the treeline was the most massive thing i have ever seen. it was silent, discus shaped, silver in color, with the most mesmerizing lights whipping around the brim, it was tilted down at us, almost as if it were observing our reactions. we were all awestruck, fixed in place, staring up at this gigantic thing that shouldn't be able to stay afloat. but it did. what seemed like minutes was probably just seconds, but then it quickly righted itself, rose about a hundred feet and then? it disappeared in the blink of an eye. my father denied this ever happened unless you got a couple drinks into him, the rest of my family admits this peculiar event happened... i just wish i could find the trucker to corroborate.

       Walking home from a friend's house, about nine years old, early afternoon... I saw a silent black cylinder slowly making its way across the sky at 600-1000 ft... Probably half a mile away...
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched it for about 30 seconds before running to get the friend I'd just left..

       Happened on my way home from a friend after watching shitty rent DVD movies (like 10 years ago). I saw 3 lights, in a triangle,  shooting from one end of the horizon to the other end in maybe 2 seconds. Came home, googled... found the Phoenix incident and other UFO videos, all looking exactly like what I've seen that day.

       This happened to the wife of a friend of mine years ago, before they met and during her first marriage. She had gone camping with her first husband and another male friend of theirs. They were all three abducted from their tent that night, taken aboard a UFO and examined by small grey alien beings. She and the other male friend seemed to handle it alright, but her husband was unhinged by it. He started abusing drugs and became abusive. They ended up divorcing and he was eventually arrested. I believe he robbed a liquor store. He ended up dying in prison years ago. He just wasn't able to cope after the abduction.

       I saw a UFO once, but it was very far away, and could have been my eyes I guess. I was interested one summer day in a cloud the seemed to be coming up from the ground from the mountains near my house. I was watching it closely because I thought it might be a bush fire. Suddenly near the top of this cloud I see a big shower of sparks coming from a very bright white light. The sparks kind of fizzled out, and I saw a very bright silver metallic object, cigar shaped, which then moved in very quick semi circle, and disappeared. It was all so bright it left an image on my retinas when I closed my eyes for a minute or so.

       And here's one my daughter and I saw about 10 years ago. I think it was probably some sort of drone test because we're not far from a Navy base. We were out swimming in the pool one evening just before dusk and saw what looked like a silver basketball sized orb floating somewhat above us. It was windy, so if it had been a metallic balloon of some kind, it should have been bobbing around like crazy, but it wasn't. It just floated there in place. I went into the house and got my camera and tried taking a picture, but for some reason it didn't show up. I'm not sure if it was because it was metallic and reflected the sky, or what. We looked away and looked back up and the thing was just gone. I don't believe it was alien, as there have been other drone sightings around here. But it looked like a silver basketball sized and shaped object. Just a perfect, silver orb. If you look at this video, it looked like the silver orb that shows up about the 9:00 minute mark...

       This is one I've heard of second hand. A father and son both said they once saw a silver orb floating in the sky. Silently, shiny metallic exterior and the son said he thinks it was slowly spinning. I think for them too, if I recall correctly, it never moved, simply disappeared at some point.

       Saw two.
      </p>
      <p>
       One:  Mid-day.  I was a teen.  My mom, slightly younger teen sister, and her friend, our neighbor, were all home.  I saw/felt/heard something, and opened the sliding glass door, stood on the deck, and from the edge of the house to the edge of the garage roof to the edge of assorted trees was a massive thing.  Metal, low in the sky, like I could throw a baseball at it, certainly shoot a bow at at, and huge.  I was only looking at the left side of it yet it spanned my available lines of sight from overhead to the east.  I could not see the middle or right side.  It moved slow and mostly noiseless.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mom, sister, and friend all came out and we stared silent for 3, 5, 8 seconds, then it was past the tree line, garage line, etc.  We looked at each other and cried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two:  Night.  Older teen, driving home from my girlfriends house.  Clear night, heading east on a 4-lane road.  A speck of light in the sky, basically lined up with this road, began dropping smaller specks of light.  I had not noticed the big speck until this.  These smaller specks, maybe 7-9 total, dropped straight down for a second or so, then darted off left or right much faster.  The big speck never moved.

       My father served in Vietnam (mentally sane) and told me that during one night, he and a couple of his army buddies saw a configuration of 3 lights in a triangular formation. Unlike any plane it simply hovered in the air. After a couple of minutes, it jettisoned away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also keep in mind that my father told me this in the late nineties, way before discussions of triangular light  UFOs became more public.

       I've seen an orb on 2 occasions, I'll just give you the parts that felt distinct or odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       You couldnt pinpoint their color. Any color you wanted to see in them, you could.
      </p>
      <p>
       You couldn't really tell if they were 50ft away, or 50 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both times I got this weird feeling that it knew I was watching it, and it was there for me. Almost like a weird angel or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of them just hovered for a couple of minutes, then zipped off to the north at shooting star speeds. The other was zig zagging, making impossible maneuvers, then zipped off the east. The zig zagging one looked like it was scanning for something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both happened in a 6 month span in SE Oklahoma around 2008, in different towns about 30 miles apart. Tahlequah and Muskogee
      </p>
      <p>
       They were identical, so probably the same orb. What's always weirded me out is it felt like it was projecting a feeling on to me. It's hard to explain

       Me and my buddys were chilling on my roof outside my attic window after the 8th grade jr prom. We were still dressed all fancy and stuff. We tried to score some weed off dome highschoolers but thing dodnt work out so we were up playing board games and chilling on the roof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, it was like 2 in the morning and my friend had been saying they had been seeing lights in the sky but I thought they were just pulling my leg. We were all laying on the roof, looking at the moon and the stars, when all of a sudden this bright blinding white disc of light roughly twice the observable size of the moon appeared about 100ft or so above us.  We were all enveloped in this beam-like spotlight. I remember staring up into the light and glancing over at my friends. We were all frozen or too scared to move. I know I was scared, it was just so bright and so
       <em>
        silent
       </em>
       . And we knew it was looking at
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly it shot up into the air. It zoomed left, then stopped, then shot off over the horizon like a shooting star.
      </p>
      <p>
       We called it a night after that.

       I lived in a rural area outside Texarkana at the time, but sometime in October of 1988 it was dusk outside(the sun had set, yet the sky still had a little bit of light left), my dad was on the porch and he called me to come out here and see something. Anyway it was a large canoe shaped object floating and slowly moving deeper into the forrest(very slow, less than 5 mph) just above the trees, and it appeared to be dropping what looked like color changing flares(very fast changing, almost blinking like a stobe light, but not so bright) into the forrest. It dropped a "flare" about every ten to fifteen seconds, and they slowly descended into the woods. The canoe shapped object didn't give off any light, infact it looked to be solid black. My backyard was where the forrest began and it appeared as if it were about 500 to 800 yards away. It just kept going until we couldn't see it any longer due to the trees. My dad thought it was some sort of strange looking military aircraft that was dropping flares(and still believes that to this day).

       Was about 10. I was at school during recess or lunch. Suddenly I see a black triangular object in the sky. Looked like it was falling down while making a really loud noise. It also felt like am earthquake was happening. Dunno what it was.

       I was thirteen or so, living in SW Colorado. My nearest neighbor was about a mile away. We lived in BFE, near the New Mexico/Colorado border. My friend Tim and I were standing on our makeshift back porch, a 4x4 ft pallet perched upon cinder blocks. As Tim was talking, i happened to notice a red light overhead. It was pretty large, and it was not blinking at all. When Tim finished talking, i nudged him in the ribs, saying "Look, Tim... It's a fucking ALIEN!" We both laughed as this thing was now DIRECTLY overhead. 
 Then it stopped. Not slowed down. Did not COME to a stop. It just STOPPED. We exchanged worried glances, and looked back up at this red, unchanging light, now hovering completely silent over our heads. 
 Do you remember, in old movies, when they throw the switch that turns on the lights to say, a football field, or a school gymnasium? That "Ka-CHUNK" noise as the switch is thrown? We heard that noise, and a brilliant white beam of light came down, and barely overlapped the edges of the 4x4 ft porch we were on. Focused. Like a spotlight. 
 We were SCARED as hell and ran inside my house. I remember we locked the doors, turned off the lights, and peeked through the venetian blinds. The porch was still lit up. After what seemed like forever, we heard the lights turn off, again with the "Ka-CHUNK!" and the red light continued on it's way SW towards the four corners national monument. About ten minutes later, several helicopters followed in that same direction. Lots of air traffic in a place that is thirty miles from an airport in any direction. Tim still asks, 25 years later, if i still remember that night. I'll never forget.

       One night after a few drinks some friends and I decided to lay in the grass of the university's law quad to star gaze and such. The sky was pretty clear, as were the stars. As I'm looking up i see a small formation of lights moving. At first I thought they were just stars because that's how far away they were, but they were steadily moving. There were 4 lights in a diamond formation just traveling amongst the stars. I couldn't even get my friends to find them in the sky as they were truly blending in with other stars, but I knew what I was seeing. In that moment I felt this strange sensation, like a sudden realization that those probably weren't creatures from earth in whatever vessels I was staring at, and I was strangely satisfied.

       I was sitting in my back yard one late morning enjoying a cup of coffee maybe 15 years ago. It was a beautiful day, sunny, clear, cool but not cold. There wasn't a cloud in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked off to the sky in the west and I saw.....something. It was a series of  rectangular/square shapes but disjointed more like a series of structure hanging there in the sky motionless. If you took like a city block of square, blocky buildings and hanged it in the air that's kind of what it looked like. The colors were washed out. It was different shades of white, gray and black. It was high, at least higher than the con trail from a jetliner that seemed to pass under it. This object had no con trail or other emission of its own that I could see. It was at least +30,000 feet up and about 30
       <sup>
        <sup>
         o
        </sup>
       </sup>
       up from the horizon in the sky from my perspective. The sun was probably 35
       <sup>
        <sup>
         o
        </sup>
       </sup>
       to 45
       <sup>
        <sup>
         o
        </sup>
       </sup>
       in the sky behind me in the east. So it was high and far away and the light from the sun would likely have been almost head on. I've never seen anything like it before or since and it bugs me to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked at it for at least 2 or 3 minutes trying to make out more details and then I remembered to get my binoculars. I ran inside and quickly grabbed them. When I returned it was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm familiar with what most aircraft look like in the sky. I understand that a plane approaching you dead on can look like it hangs in the sky for a while. At the time I was even a certified single engine pilot having flown solo cross country. I'm by no means a professional pilot, but more aware of what aircraft look like than most. I've even caught by chance the space shuttle making its reentry across the sky in Louisiana one early morning seeing it make a trail of smoke from horizon to horizon. When I saw it I just ran through the possibilities and remembered the shuttle was due to land that morning. 1 + 1 = 2, it was logical. This UFO that I saw 15 years ago....I've no clue what it was and I've been looking for an explanation ever since.

       I saw a metallic sphere flying in a zig-zag-like path at extremely high speeds. I thought it was a balloon until i saw it fly behind some hills in the far distance and realized it had to be at least the size of a car. The speed it was moving across the sky also seemed to be to fast for the wind to be moving it. I couldn't really make out any details it just looked like a giant chrome orb.

       14th February, 2015. I was sitting at my bedroom window late at night ~22:00 about to smoke a joint, as I usually would. Now my bedroom window faces East, and I live in south London, so from my window I can see planes from the Gatwick airport plane stack, and if I turn to look left/north I can just see planes from the Heathrow stack going the other way. So I know which direction the planes normally fly. And this night was partly cloudy, so I could see some of the stars and the planes through the gaps in the clouds. But before I light up I notice off to the left a bright light moving slowly. I put my joint and lighter down to get a decent look, and I notice that it's not one, but three orange orbs/balls of fiery light flying together in an equilateral triangle formation from NE&gt;SW kinda slowly, and it's below the clouds so I assumed it was around ~100-200m up. It's flying dead silent, and when I realise that it definitely isn't Chinese lanterns, or a done, or a helicopter or anything normal I think to get my phone, but I quickly look and it's across the room and realise I won't have time to grab it, unlock it, and then get a decent video of it in time, so instead I decide to get as good a look as I possibly can. There was no physical form to the lights. They were spherical and just looked like well contained balls of fiery plasma. I didn't think they were connected, it just looked like they were independent but in formation. Though it was dark, so they could have been lights on the points of a dark triangular craft. But if they were it wasn't obvious. Anyway, it almost flies directly overhead and by this point I'm leaning out my window to get a decent view. Just before it goes out of sight over the roof of my house it accelerates directly upward with no warning, no sound, no stopping to change direction. And I can only describe the speed of its acceleration as if you imagine the millennium falcon jumping to light speed. That confirmed what I just saw wasn't made with standard human technology. It confirmed for me then and there that advanced/alien tech exists on earth today.
       <br/>
       I was hyped on adrenaline and immediately went downstairs to tell my dad about it - entirely expecting him to dismiss it, as he's an engineer and quite the sceptic - but I telling him anyway. And then he comes out unexpectedly and tells new he saw a similar thing 20 years ago from our garden! Similar thing with orange lights in a formation, but 5 or 6 of them, and that they flew in formation then split to fly independently in all decent directions. So yeah. That shoved be down the ufo rabbit hole hard and fast. But I couldn't be any more appreciative that it had, because it led me to be the person who I am today!

       Around 1970 my father was driving back to school at LSU after fall break. In a field south of Baton Rouge off of Hwy 61 he says there was a circular UFO the size of a football field hovering motionless about 100ft off the ground. He pulled over on side the road to observe the craft. Once he got out his car he noticed that there was no noise coming from the craft. He observed the craft for about 10-15 minutes. He says the most distinct features where the lights rhythmically pulsating around the edge of the craft and what he called spot lights shooting out of the top of a lighted dome and moving in no particular pattern   against the clouds above. After 10-15 minutes the craft slowly began to move silently towards the east. After it was out of sight he noticed that others had stopped on the road to look at it but strangely no one said a word or even acknowledged each others presence.

       Years ago in the 80's I remember seeing a ufo vividly. It hovered over is and then moved on. I was about 8.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the longest time I completely forgot about it and though I have the memory of the incident it passed me by till years later my sister casually mentioned to me about the time we saw the ufo and I was like that was real?!

       Was ~15 or so and sleeping outside with a few friends. There was a "satellite" in the sky we saw just kind of moving in a straight line and suddenly started doing random zig-zags. It stopped above us and hung there, turned from white to bright red and grew in size to be about half the moon in apparent size. Shrunk back to it's original size, turned white again, and took off from view incredibly fast. No idea what it was and don't really have a theory

       A friend and I and his brother went hunting with backpacks walking a couple of miles up a mountain trail to a small lake above Mammoth Valley, California.
We set up camp in the afternoon, did a little scouting, and made some dinner and were relaxing before retiring. We were approximately level with the tops of the pines going down the mountainside from which we came. There were some sporadic clouds that would move in over the valley and as it became dark we saw, indirectly, many bright flashes that we could only attribute to lightning. These flashes were extremely bright and would light up for 10-30 seconds at a time and we thought it weird but maybe 'ball lightning". Who knows, right? My buddy and I shared a tent and retired early to be fresh in the morning. Approximately 12:30 I was awoken by a bright light completely illuminating the tent on and off. It was completely silent and my friend and I laid there wondering what the fuck was going on. The flash intervals were much shorter than earlier only lasting about one second on and various longer dark periods in between.
I had thought about UFOs during my life and knew that if I ever had the chance to see one I would approach and welcome the visitors. I was wrong. This scared the shit out of me and we had both left our rifles leaning against a tree outside the tent. 
"Tom", I said, "go get our guns." He responded that he was not going outside no matter what. So we waited 15 minutes while these flashes passed over us and finally disappeared as they headed further up the mountain. That's all.

       I was back in my hometown in northern Canada when me and my friends went out for a drive in the evening. We were far away out of town when we saw this light in the sky zig zagging, changing colours and it even split in to two lights then came back together. It did this for about half hour until we couldn’t see it.

       In 2010 i was in a guard tower in Afghanistan and we saw some light that seemed closer/brighter than a star changing directions for &gt;30 minutes. Long enough that we called over the radio to the SOG and the other 3 towers said they had been watching it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was also about 4 am and we had been in the tower for awhile. We eventually lost track of it scanning for actual people

       Once while driving home with a buddy on the freeway we encountered what I now know to be a tr-3b triangle shaped craft just hovering over the freeway in the middle of the day, no more than 100 feet off of the ground. That was a really weird experience but was most likely human. I go outside to smoke cigarettes so at night I see plenty of shooting stars and meteors and have on numerous occasions seen lights shoot by at high speeds making sharp angled turns, stopping, doing things that meteors don't usually do. I was outside with my girlfriend at the time and we were talking about the lights because she never saw them and thought I was crazy for thinking some were aliens. Well of course at that exact moment we both look up to see a saucer shaped aircraft maybe a quarter mile up directly above my house, close enough to make out lights on the sides and bottom and what appeared to be glass windows around the top portion. She ran in the house immediately and never wanted to talk about the lights again or that night.

       I was about 1988 or so, dad came home from hiring a movie and comes in telling us to come look at the UFO, my dads a bit excitable and exaggerates so I figured it would be l nothing
      </p>
      <p>
       We see point of light in the  sky toward the horizon but still fairly highly a fair distance away but no detail  or noise, just a light point in the sky,  so hard to say how far away it was, I figured it was a helicopter up high and he was being stupid but he told us to keep watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually it just whips across the sky from one side to the other faster than anything a plane could do and stops dead, it did this moving and then stopping to random points in the sky for at least  10min, our neighbours came home while we were out in the street and saw it too we watched for quite a while longer
      </p>
      <p>
       Dad said while he was at the video store it had changed colours and been much brighter and many people at the shops, workers etc were looking at it so I just figured we'll someone surely reported it and it'd be on the TV news so I stopped watching and went inside after a while to check, was a few radio reports people ringing in etc but no coverage on TV news etc and didn't hear another thing about it.
      </p>

       so yeah dunno about aliens but it sure was a UFO.

       This is an account from my grandma, and it happened in 1966: My mom, aunt, and grandma were living in the Centerville area of Ohio, and had a large property with an apple orchard in the back yard. One day (I sadly can't recall the exact date) they were just arriving at home, pulling into the driveway, when my grandma's car started malfunctioning. Its lights would flash on and off, and she couldn't get the engine to work (experiences consistent with many UFO sightings.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, long story short, she got spooked by the car and ran into her house, thinking maybe someone had broken in somehow. Then she saw flashes of light in her back yard, went out to investigate, and saw a big silver UFO with flashing, multicolored lights along the rim. It was hovering directly over that apple orchard, and when it zoomed away it actually scorched the tops off of all the apple trees. My grandma was in the Dayton Daily News because of this (I need to recover the article, I do have it somewhere in my house actually).
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the most incredible thing about her story was the aftermath. Project Blue Book showed up at her door a couple weeks later, and basically told her to shut the hell up about the sighting, and to turn away any media folks asking for interviews. Sheesh, that's proof enough to me!

       I’ve seen the occasional weird lights and “stars” that suddenly shoot off, as of recently I’ve had a constant UFO (UHoveringO?) experience. About a year ago I decided if I was going to see UFOs with my own eyes, I would need to start looking up at the sky much more often - that’s when I noticed this light in the sky at night. It was a very cloudy night, so my immediate thought was that it was the moon shining through the clouds; but, as I sat there, something nagged at me and I decided to use a stargazing app to find the location of the moon. Not only was the moon on the other side of the sky, but it hadn’t even come above the horizon yet - and since then, the light is always visible at the same location and doesn’t travel across the night sky like the moon does (it does, however, drift like a boat anchored - never far, and
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       slowly). It’s also not visible every night, and only visible on cloudy nights. Because of this, I’m certain it’s not the moon. Additionally, the clouds must be low (but not necessarily thick) in order for the light to be visible. One evening the cloud cover was patchy, and I became excited at the idea of seeing the mystery object shining through, however there was nothing but clear sky behind the clouds. This led me to hypothesize that maybe something from the ground
       <em>
        onto
       </em>
       the clouds - though, there are flaws that seem to, at the very least, suggest that the light source isn’t static. I also haven’t found the light source, despite looking multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       The light itself is soft, most of the time it’s barely even visible, though large - reminiscent of a very dim spotlight. Aside from being, it doesn’t do much else. There was one evening in which a meteor shower would’ve been visible had it not been for the clouds. Disappointed, but persistent, I periodically checked outside hoping the skies would clear. They didn’t. I
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       see a light similar to the glow normally chilling in the sky, though much smaller, “dancing” across the clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, it’s here tonight (the large glowing one). I took photos. Since it’s a faint glow, I took a couple photos at different ISOs.

       It's possible and I've considered it, but I was able to move as soon as I woke up and again after I calmed down. I wasn't freaked out when I woke, it was right after I saw what I saw that I was frozen with terror.

       I'm not discounting the stories from others who say they have experienced something but I definitely think this is a possibility in many cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a moment I still remember extremely vividly about 20 years ago of a little girl walking towards my bed and me being unable to move. None of it was real and I knew that when I finally woke up and I think it was just an example of sleep paralysis.
