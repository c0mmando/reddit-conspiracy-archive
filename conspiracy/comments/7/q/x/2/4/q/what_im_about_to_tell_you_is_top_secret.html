        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, for the past couple of years i&#39;ve been deciding where to throw out this information and if i should or not. 
if people would find it interesting or not.  </p>

<p>So finally i decided to throw it out on here. Reddit&#39;s Conspiracy Subreddit, Because i think there may be a few people on here that would find this quite interesting. So well, Let&#39;s Begin.  </p>

<p>For this post im gonna assume you already know who David Miscavige is, Right?.  </p>

<p>For those who don&#39;t know here&#39;s a quick bio:
He was a 12 year old kid who got recruited and adopted on L. Ron Hubbard&#39;s scientology boat back when the church was forming up, 
 he quitted school and became full involved in the teachings of the sci-fi writter. He became the closest one to L. Ron and when Ron died he left David in charge of his beloved Church and now he&#39;s one of the richest men and most psychotic dudes in the world today.<br/>
So David is the Head of Scientology and he has been doing an amazing job in it, he made the goverment recognize the movement as a religion and is known for organising some &quot;TOP NOTCH&quot; heists and projects like &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Celebrity recruitment missions&quot;, he even got a few Scientologists to infiltrate the FBI in order to destroy documents and he succeeded masterfully.<br/>
Anyways, Since 2007 the backlash and controversy towards the church has made this peculiar man lose his nuts. Making Him go to a point wich he literally used his lawyers and pushed them into Creating a lawsuit against Google (wich again, he won) and sending lots of death treats to whoever gets their eyes on the church activities (Like, Journalists, FBI, CIA, Human Civil Rights, etc)<br/>
So in the year 2011 maybe or 2012 i don&#39;t remember correctly. He called for a Major meeting with the chief memebers of the cult to come up with a plan to shut down the eyes of the media towards the church activities.<br/>
Many missions were made, where he throw a huge spy campaign against all the journalists involved in researching the church. Many Journalists were being monitored and assaulted by this so called &quot;Scientology Spies&quot; 24/7.<br/>
There were lost of lawsuits against websites like <a href="http://www.xenu.com">www.xenu.com</a>, wikipedia.org and many more who contained valuable information against the church activities.<br/>
But none of this stuff resulted in anything meaningful for them, they realised doing this stuff was way worse, like if they were trying to hide something, they ended up as &quot;butthurt&quot; psychos in the public opinion, and for every website they shut-down another 10 more appeared.  </p>

<p>So one day Little David was crying in rage and insulting all his people and kicking chairs and flipping tables and giving random punishment to everyone that he thought had the blame on this. One of this people was the handsome and prideful Tommy Davis.
Tommy is the official spokesman of the church and as his boss David Miscavige he is also too well known for being an irritated rage machine as we can see in this video where he walks out of an interview when the reporter asked him about his almighty alien god Xenu: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqzmbnrglUg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqzmbnrglUg</a></p>

<p>So little Tommy in order to calm his bossy pal David, came up with the following amazing idea:</p>

<p>PAY ATTENTION:
Select several high rank members of The Church (Mostly Known Celebrities) to come out as &quot;Rebels&quot; who decided to leave the church and spoke out.<br/>
WITH WHAT porpuse you may be asking? Well, with the sole porpuse of infiltrate this same journalists, newspapers, websites and media they were fighting against.<br/>
When Tommy&#39;s idea became official they called this &quot;PROJECT FIREBIRD&quot;  </p>

<p>WHAT IS PROJECT FIREBIRD?</p>

<p>Project firebird is a Scientology Prospekt in wich the main goal is to succefully infiltrate the &quot;Scientology Opposition&quot; of public communication media such as: News Channels, Websites, Journalists and take over every single points in wich scientology is being attacked and control it in order to spread their own words and their own attacks against themselves as David Miscavige finds appropiate.  </p>

<p>In simple words, the genius plan of Tommy Davis and his Project Firebird is to not fight against their enemy, but rather become the enemy.<br/>
Attack themselves, spread bullshit about themselves, control the opposition becoming THEMSELVES The Opposition.<br/>
They designated several Scientology memebers to be the new agents of this branch &quot;The Scientology Opposition Branch&quot; controled by none other than The Scientology Church themselves.
Many of this &quot;Infiltration Agents&quot; include:<br/>
Leah Remini<br/>
Jason Beghe<br/>
Mike Rinder<br/>
Alex Gibney<br/>
Lawrence Wright<br/>
Paul Haggins<br/>
Jenna Miscavige (niece of little David)<br/>
Chantal Dodson<br/>
Mary Kahn<br/>
Lawrence Wright<br/>
Sara Goldberg  </p>

<p>And Many, Many More who are coming out as &quot;Retractors&quot; Ex-Scientologists that escaped and now are willing to speak out against the church.<br/>
Going to the newspapers agencies, calling to the harrassed Journailst that David Attacked, Getting in the front covers of Magazines, Getting full articles wrote about how they hate scientology and spreading the &quot;truth&quot; of what they do inside.
Even making TV Shows attacking the church, Documentaries, Being interviewed by all the opposition and all this journalists fell for it greatly and are willing to write everything that comes out of the mouth of this &quot;Rebels&quot; and spread it around just like little David and little Tommy wanted.<br/>
So Basically David is now the one dictating the articles and the &quot;truths&quot; he hated so much. It was a brillant plan in my humble opinion and he must be saving a lot of money in lawyers nowadays.<br/>
Its kinda funny, if we put this in the context of Scientology Beliefs he is like the Demonic Spirit that possesed the bodies of the press. Haha.</p>

<p>Well, i honestly feel like a lot of pressure came out of my shoulders now that i revealed this, If you&#39;re wondering how i know all this, well that&#39;s because i was part of a cult that happens to be linked to The Scietologists, although the organisation i was part of is called different, its called &quot;OTO&quot; but we share a lot of our religion views with The Scientologists, i have a few friends who are high ranked Scientologists wich now probably will be pissed out at me. Maybe little David is gonna come kill me himself or is gonna send his Agent Squads to torture me, I don&#39;t really care. I don&#39;t care if i die, im a proud Christian now and fear of death doesn&#39;t mean anything to me anymore. To God All The Glory And Honor. We are dust, and in dust we will become.</p>

<p>EDIT: This post has been hidden by the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> Moderators<br/>
i suggest you to copy this text and share it elsewhere to spread it out  </p>

<p>Peace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spawning a rebellion against David and the basic church itself after Hubbard&#39;s death - in order to regain control of a CIA MK asset?</p>

<p>You want more - Steve Fishman was a man caught and accused of theft and fraud (I believe), when confronted by police he told how he was given a guide for how to steal - then would pump a percentage of his &quot;earnings&quot; back into the church. The church disavowed him (as any intelligence agency does) - so he came out and unsealed ALL the Operating Thetan documents in open court.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because of Steve Fishman that we know ANYTHING about all the Xenu crap and all that - he ALSO said, that the Georgia Guidestones were a birthday gift from L Ron, to himself - to commemorate his original landing place on Earth (in a previous incarnation). Another tidbit from this interview is that the Church believes Jesus was another incarnation of (their satan:) Xenu.</p>

<p>L Ron VEHEMENTLY hated the &quot;oligarch, King and richman&quot;. He was CLOSE friends with Jack Parsons (whom he was shown to by his other &quot;good friend&quot; (his words, not mine)) Aleister Crowley. </p>

<p>Coincidence that the conspiracy culture popped up right about the time he was getting started? What if the entire conspiracy culture from the JFK/MLK/RFK conspiracys to where we are now (with Dumbo Jones and the vast array of stupidity we are offered... Maxwell, Wilcox, Rense, Noory all come to mind)) was nothing but a plot by one group of evil fuckers to defeat another group of evil fuckers, for the evil purpose of ruling the world?</p>

<p>What else have I got... uh. The Church of Scientology (and the Church of Mormon! (Look up: Kolob)) are the only two religions which believe in &quot;alien saviours&quot; so look to them to step up when Bluebeam occurs...</p>

<p>I mean fuck, when you add the CoS into the equation, the whole conspiracy thing makes sense.</p>

<p>&quot;The Babalon Working was a series of magic ceremonies or rituals performed from January to March, 1946 by author, pioneer rocket-fuel scientist, and occultist Jack Parsons and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.[1] This ritual was essentially designed to manifest an individual incarnation of the archetypal divine feminine called Babalon. The project was based on the ideas of Aleister Crowley, and his description of a similar project in his 1917 novel Moonchild&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s the “all press is good press” approach. When they can dictate the opposing narrative, they’re able to forge this two side debate where anyone who they suck into their world can be tricked with “insider info” that they conveniently have against the manufactured dissent. It’s like how US politics are right now.  Both sides have these realities that they think the other side doesn’t have, and therefore makes them right. </p>

<p>Scientology doesn’t want to concert or everyone. They just need to maximize their money contributing membership while maintaining their ability to recruit. At this point their endgame isn’t to make Scientology the world’s religion.  They’re just trying to secure the financing of the upper echelon of the church leadership’s lifestyle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elisabeth Moss is the current name that surprises me.  She seems to have a going career with a lot of critical acclaim.</p>

<p>I think since Cruise&#39;s antics, Haggis and Remini quitting, it has really hurt Scientology&#39;s ability to recruit celebrities.  I can&#39;t see why anyone would get involved anymore, and the lack of A-listers able to boost new recruit celebs careers kind of hurts its ability to even deliver for those they can recruit.</p>

<p>I think Scientology has enough money and property to &quot;exist&quot; for quite a while, and I read someplace that as an organizational structure it&#39;s basically a giant tax-free real estate scheme.  They could probably very slowly sell off real estate for decades and keep the core church going without much new money coming in.</p>

<p>The larger problem is Miscavige -- what happens to the organization when he dies? I doubt there&#39;s a succession plan and Miscavige&#39;s paranoia and control is such that he&#39;s probably purged most of the potential new leadership or even the lower level skilled people that would give it continuity.  The same thing mostly happened when Hubbard died, which enabled Miscavige&#39;s takeover, but it seems worse now.  I&#39;d wager either another Miscavige seizes control or the organization implodes.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>wait, Ted Gunderson was a good guy, not a puppet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You sure about that? Let&#39;s start off with his background at the FBI. Under Hoover. And he was quite successful in Hoover&#39;s FBI, which is pretty hard to pull off if you&#39;re a &quot;good guy.&quot;</p>

<p>He spent lots of effort trying to convince everyone that &quot;The Illuminati&quot; was behind all of the pedophilia, when &quot;The Illuminati&quot; does not exist in any real sense and is actually misdirection from the groups that are actually doing the pedophilia: priests, Mormons, religious cults, Satanists, and Freemasons. How can he be a &quot;good guy&quot; if his central thesis is obviously bullshit?</p>

<p>He also told people that &quot;The Illuminati&quot;&#39;s central goal was to create one world government. That&#39;s not true and never has been true. Their goal has always been to perpetuate and spread oligarchical control systems, which tend to work better when you divide large nation states up into smaller ones that can never stand up to the extraterritorial conspiracy.</p>

<p>Bill Cooper made the same mistake. But Bill Cooper spent immense time and effort telling you about real groups that were actually responsible for the mayhem, not blaming it all on some ultrasecretive group that can&#39;t be verified.</p>

<p>Back to Gunderson, he certainly told the truth about things like systemic pedophilia. But then there are some credible allegations that he only did this to get trust with victims, who he would then turn into the FBI. Look at all of the actual good people that have died trying to expose pedophilia, and then look at Gunderson who lived to a ripe old age.</p>

<p>Then you have all of the people he slandered, including calling Art Bell a child molester that led to a slander lawsuit which Gunderson lost.</p>

Now, if leadership suddenly changes hands or even Miscavige comes out and says he&#39;s going to reform the Church, those same dissenters could be used to go into the media and say, &quot;oh, hey, they&#39;re better now and I&#39;m going back and they&#39;re not really so bad after all.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is, how are they helping themselves by doing this? Their false opposition is doing nothing buy educate and rally true opposition. It&#39;s not replacing it. What is the purpose of infiltrating a thing just to make it more powerful? It&#39;s not as if they could infiltrate this movement and then change it. The ideology of the movement is inherent to the thing. To change it would be to destroy it, so again, why infiltrate at all? Leah Remini&#39;s show alone has educated more people who previously had no idea about the insanity that is Scientology that her participation alone has been deleterious. Surely their ignorance and apathy was a superior state to emotional opposition. This is ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t mind, there are some minor corrections to this that I would like to suggest, which I think would help you when you post it again in the future. </p>

<p>If you do not like any sort of criticism you can skip this post (or ignore me). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who don&#39;t know here&#39;s a quick bio: He was a 12 year old kid who got recruited and adopted on L. Ron Hubbard&#39;s scientology boat back when the church was forming up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Miscavige was born in 1960 (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+old+is+David+Miscavige&amp;amp;oq=how+old+is+David+Miscavige&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">source</a>). The Church of Scientology was incorporated around 1952/1954 (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=when+did+the+Church+of+Scientology+start&amp;amp;oq=when+did+the+Church+of+Scientology+start&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">source</a>). However, the Sea Org, of which he is a member, started in 1967 (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=when+did+the+Sea+Org+start&amp;amp;oq=when+did+the+Sea+Org+start&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">source</a>). So, saying that he was recruited/adopted at the age of 12 (putting that around 1972) is misleading, that&#39;s 20 years since Scientology started, and at least 5 since the Sea Org. Granted, this term is vague, but I mention this for accuracy purposes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he quitted school and became full involved in the teachings of the sci-fi writter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just some spelling/grammatical errors. You want to say quit (quitted is a real word but it is used very infrequently). Also it&#39;s better to say &quot;fully involved&quot; instead of &quot;full involved.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he made the goverment recognize the movement as a religion </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very simplistic statement as it really doesn&#39;t cover enough detail to be fully accurate, but I&#39;ll leave this alone. You just may want to use better phrasing or an example here for this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and is known for organising some &quot;TOP NOTCH&quot; heists and projects like &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Celebrity recruitment missions&quot;, he even got a few Scientologist to infiltrate the FBI in order to destroy documents and he succeded masterfully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alright, here is where the argument is weakest, I think. Let&#39;s start with Operation Snow White. Church of Scientology was raided in 1963 by the Food and Drug Administration. This is where the IRS charged them with an enormous tax bill of which they had no way to pay (you could say it was a legal method of trying to shut down the church). In supposed retaliation (or protection), Church of Scientology set up the Guardian Office in order to secure the interests of the church, and fought against the IRS tax bill. Part of this was the infiltration of differing government agencies, and then later in 1977, the Church was raided by the FBI (under direction from the IRS).</p>

<p>However, David Miscavige was... 17 at this time of the FBI raid. It&#39;s extremely unlikely that he had any sort of involvement, or per the words that you wrote, organised the whole thing.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But none of this stuff [lawsuits] resulted in anything meaningful for them, they realised doing this stuff was way worse, like if they were trying to hide something, they ended up as &quot;butthurt&quot; psychos in the public opinion, and for every website they shut-down another 10 more appeared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shows a separation of what Church of Scientology does, and the purpose behind it. The purpose of the way they handle the media and the way they handle lawsuits is extremely intentional. They have not changed their methods at all, and even though it looks like it&#39;s terrible for them, they are still in business, so in a sense, you can say it works for them. </p>

<p>I do agree, on the surface, they way they handle the media (never answer direct claims, always claim the person who is alleging X/Y/Z is 100% incorrect) and the way they do lawsuits (as a punishment) seems quite odd, but again it is intentional. So the claim you make here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So one day Little David was crying in rage and insulting all his people and kicking chairs and flipping tables and giving random punishment to everyone that he thought had the blame on this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems way off base. Could he be angry about something and have done this? Sure, but it doesn&#39;t align with the theory that it&#39;s related to the way they handle lawsuits or the media.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Many, Many More who are coming out as &quot;Retractors&quot; Ex-Scientologist that escaped and now are willing to speak out against the church.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word here is Detractors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to The Scietologist, although the organisation i was part of is called different, its called &quot;OTO&quot; but we share a lot of our religion views with The Scientologist,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard anyone call the Church of Scientology or its various organizations by &quot;The Scientologist&quot;. Is there a special reason for this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT: This post has been hidden by the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> Moderators</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, it hasn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Overall, I find your argument very weak because it uses the wrong data in order to bolster its story. David Miscavige had no dealing with the Operations that you mentioned, or if he did, he most certainly didn&#39;t control them as a teenager, no matter how smart or intelligent he may be. With the incorrect timelines, it doesn&#39;t set up for a good story.</p>

<p>Instead, a different tactic you can use is instead of going with the angle that David Miscaviage is behind all this, you can say that the Church of Scientology is behind all this. It has less of a &quot;hook&quot; (in the sense that people relate to other people easier than they do an organization) but it has more validity as then you can use prior examples of what the Church is doing to show how it matches up with what the Church is doing now.</p>

<p>That said, the main idea of Project Firebird has a couple of fatal flaws. First, is that the Church has no need to shape the story of what detractors say, as what they say is <em>extremely</em> predictable. In fact so much so, you could predict what will &quot;come out&quot; about Scientology within the next 10 years and be very close to 90% accuracy. The best example of this is the news story that have followed Scientology around since the beginning. This post is quite long so I won&#39;t link them here, but go back 30 years - how do those stories compare to the stories of today? The people have changed, but the story and the narrative have not. </p>

<p>Therefore there&#39;s no need for the Church of Scientology (or David Miscavige) to control or infiltrate the news.</p>

<p>Second fatal flaw is that all of this activity of infiltrating news organizations or spreading out false information about the Church goes directly against the doctrine laid out. The easiest example is the Code of a Scientologist (<a href="https://www.scientology.org/what-is-scientology/the-scientology-creeds-and-codes/the-code-of-a-scientologist.html">source</a>). See the very first point. </p>

<p>At the very minimum, you wouldn&#39;t be able to get Scientologists to violate this en masse, especially once they go through the bridge as they become even more devoted to it.</p>

<p>Hope that helps improve your argument/story for the future. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is going to sound harsh, but you sound like you&#39;re just trying to fill a void in your life. You join cults, then you leave and become a &quot;proud Christian&quot;, and you start repeating a different set of rituals / copy and paste garbage such as this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To God All The Glory And Honor. We are dust, and in dust we will become.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that not sound cult-like at all to you, as someone who has cult experience?</p>

<p>Why do you replace one cult with another cult, replacing one pre-written script with another? Why not just be yourself, and write your own script?</p>
