        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">77</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/theredditgotme.html">theredditgotme</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>I&#39;m sure many of you have hear of this before, whether on this sub or otherwise, but I think it&#39;s important we do not let this issue slide. Now more than ever it&#39;s important to call out these things. Keep them in the public eye.</strong> </p>

<p>The Hollywood pedo-elite had water thrown on the fire that was nipping at their heels. The Harvey Weinstein sex accusations were first used to douse that fire and as they gathered up heat themselves, the #MeToo and especially the &quot;Time&#39;s Up&quot; malarky were created to discredit the allegations that were true by watering the whole issue down with all of these non-offences being claimed AS offences. (This isn&#39;t new though.)</p>

<p>I and several other people I know personally were raped and none of us used the #MeToo thing, or bought into it - I personally felt that it was more about victimhood and almost became like a bragging rights competition after a while , everyone was pretty much virtue signalling with it. <em>(The irony of that sentence is not lost on me)</em> </p>

<p>I understood that many people viewed it as a &quot;coming together in support&quot; thing, but in fairness all it did was just put victims in a very public position and take away from the actual exposure of sex (and worse) crimes that were/are happening. </p>

<p>I felt that lately Hollywood has been trying to infiltrate our media/lives with instances of Pedophilia and this has been going on for a long time, possible 20 or so years, and its been very subtle. However, lately it&#39;s been much more brazen. Quick example, one YouTuber pointed out that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8VoVwuZVac">Netflix show &quot;Big Mouth&quot;, a show that is targeted at adults, shows children engaging in sexual activities</a>. It differs from shows like South Park in that the sexuality in South Park is always shown between the adult characters. This show focuses on the children&#39;s sex lives through the lens of &quot;reminiscing puberty&quot;. It&#39;s a way of normalising seeing children being sexual and desensitising us to that. Even in Germany, a tv show was shown depicting a sexual relationship between a 16 year old girl and an older refugee man. </p>

<p>It got me thinking of actually how much this surrounds us daily. I used to work in a shop that sold spirituality shop, but this shop was particularly for witchcraft. Well I was there for the last leg of that shop before it closed, and we used to have a regular customer who would come in and she was a former sex slave of a cult. I&#39;d never met anyone like her before but it shocked me to believe that that was going on in my country where literally nothing (supposedly) happens - it&#39;s practically <strong>The Shire</strong> here. She was there her whole life until she was 19 and finally escaped. She didn&#39;t talk much about it and never mentioned names. </p>

<p>THEN, someone close to me had a high-profile job were they were meeting celebrities and working with them. One of these celebrities they had known years and was just on a night out with them. This celebrity they knew was <em>BRAGGING</em> about how he regularly pays thousands to have sex with 13 year old boys, he has a service, as if this was just something you do, as if it was normal and something to be proud of. That celebrity was then &quot;suspended&quot; ( BUT <strong>NOT FIRED</strong> ) over alleged sex assaults he made on a adult male (This celebrity is out anyway so it wasn&#39;t that shocking). He has since resigned. The person who this information came from <strong>WAS FIRED</strong> from their high-profile job, for literally no good reason (their high profile job was more successful since they started) and I&#39;m starting to wonder if it was because the comments from this celebrity were not reacted to in a way that celebrity was expecting they would have been, as if they were a sort of initiation to this &quot;elite club&quot;. (<em>That bit about the &quot;comment reaction&quot; is just my speculation though</em>).</p>

<p>There was another married man in his 30s, who worked for the same group as the celebrity guy who was charged with grooming a 13 year old girl. These two guys worked in that business in a very small country. They both worked for umbrella companies/groups - one of those is publicly owned, most of them are owned under a man here who is a real shady character.</p>

<p>Then when that information was relayed to me, no one else was as shocked by it as I expected they would be. I felt like this is the kinda thing you&#39;d be told and you&#39;d go ballistic over. ( <em>They do pump the fluoride into our water though at an unusually higher rate than anywhere else in the world</em> ). I couldn&#39;t get over it but I also couldn&#39;t believe the fact everyone was so <em>blas√©</em> about it. </p>

<p>I recently did a post about how I was convinced Millie Bobby Brown was being used to normalise pedophilia in this sub and I feel that that is what&#39;s after happening, on such subtle levels that even when we normal people are confronted with REAL LIFE stories, we don&#39;t notice it because we&#39;ve been exposed to varying degrees of it with such subtlety that we&#39;ve become desensitised to it. So of the following links are things people shared with me on that thread: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BVzsgYBAtkn/"><em>&quot;Why TV Is SEXIER Than Ever&quot;</em> - A front cover magazine where 13 yer old Millie Bobby Brown&#39;s name is grouped in with a group of ALL adults aged between 30-50</a></p>

<p><a href="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Rw0FMCxiN_GStv9GfUlYeMm56BU/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/01/07/065/n/1922564/edb923eca81624df_GettyImages-902347928/i/Millie-Bobby-Brown-Black-Dress-Golden-Globes-2018.jpg"><em>13 Year Old Millie Bobby Brown at this year&#39;s Golden Globes</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is how even the <em>HIGH STREET</em> is trying to get you to dress your child provocatively because <strong>fashion</strong>. <strong>Now they are trying to sell full on women&#39;s wear to children, as if to make these children appear sexually available.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/apr/16/children-clothing-survey-bikini-heels">An article about how high street shop NEW LOOK was selling 3 inch heels to 8 year olds</a> </p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/03/25/abercrombie-fitch-sparks-outcry-padded-bikini-bras-designed-8-year-olds.html">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch come under fire for selling a &quot;PUSH-UP BRA&quot; to 8 year olds</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was growing up bikinis and non-padded bras were becoming a thing you see on the market aimed at CHILDREN (very very young girls) and that was outrage back then, by most sane people, of course you occasionally get the parent who think <a href="http://www.homorazzi.com/article/single-ladies-world-of-dance-video-beyonce-seven-years-old-wod-performance/">this</a> is okay (wth is wrong with these people), but now it&#39;s becoming the norm. </p>

<p>The clothing, the posing, everything. All to make you think these are sexually available girls.</p>

<p>And what about the <em>adult women&#39;s wear</em>? Well now it&#39;s being sold to you with <em>children models</em>.
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-482192/Fury-12-year-old-model-fronts-world-fashion-show.html">Here&#39;s an article about how a 12 year old is fronting one of the world&#39;s leading women&#39;s fashion shows</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grAzdv66pD4">Here one of the more shocking ones, a 14 year old wearing a gossamer gown for the women wear for  Dior - that Fox had to censor for this video but adults were present at the show and witnessed this under the name of &quot;art&quot;</a>. </p>

<p>Woman are outdated apparently and they need to be sold clothes worn by children. I think this always was an agenda of the High Fashion world.</p>

<hr/>

<p>To backtrack a bit, you&#39;d have to wonder, who the parent of these children are? How are they not doing anything about this?</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s a quote supposedly from Millie Bobby Brown&#39;s parents, <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/blind-item-12_21.html">where they&#39;ve claimed to auction off her first sex scene in an effort to make more money</a>. </p>

<p>And then I stumbled across this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/anneke-lucass-harrowing-tale-of-sex-trafficking-am/">Anneke Lucas</a>, </p>

<p><strong>&quot;My mother sold me, and drove me wherever, whenever she got the call. The boss of this pedophile network was a Belgian cabinet minister. The clients were members of the elite...&quot;</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;...During the week, I went to school. I was a shy girl, with few friends.&quot;</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m starting to think that maybe some of these celebrities are former child sex slaves. Maybe many of these sex slaves are killed ( for the fun of it ) and maybe some of them go on to live life in trauma and fear. But maybe some of these &quot;rise from nowhere&quot; celebrities, are actually child sex slaves. Maybe that 14 year old and her siblings who&#39;s now walking for Dior is actually a child sex slave? </p>

<p>There&#39;s this man, Steven D. Kelly ( the way in which he delivers his message needs work - if you&#39;re reading this Steven you need to work on your communication skills, truth cat radio on youtube, or just youtube his name ), but he&#39;s raised the idea of these elitist bunkers, particularly the Getty in LA, claiming that it is a built upon the biggest underground fortress, and many of his ideas I actually do give credibility too because all the &quot;woo-woo&quot; stuff I&#39;ve had personal experience with. Same for David Icke, but I&#39;ve only learned about these guys recently and have been experiencing the other stuff for a few years now. Anyway, he believes that many of the missing children get put in this place under the Getty, and maybe when then grow up, maybe some of them are silenced with the promise of wealth, riches and fame? I think this would give more credibility to those claims.</p>

<p>Maybe all of these victims are parading right under our noses all this time under stage names and implants. </p>

<p>Then again, maybe some were just killed. But even the ones that have supposedly &quot;normal&quot; lives - at least outwardly so, as the above example shows by that woman Anneke, that her life for all intents and purposes looked outwardly normal. So The Olsen Twins&#39; lives growing up looked outwardly &quot;normal&quot; for celebrity children, but they could have been pimped out by their parents. Millie Bobby Brown&#39;s life looks outwardly normal, heck, even Finn&#39;s live looks outwardly normal for a 14 year old celebrity ( he&#39;s got a band, he&#39;s got a brother that is not much older? Who&#39;s also in the industry as a voice actor ), and maybe their parents pimp them out? Heck maybe even Katy Perry was one, or Miley Cyrus, or Lana Del Rey even?</p>

<p>Maybe these are more innocent, or maybe they are insidious, but this is a reality for many people and that&#39;s something that needs to change. I just can&#39;t let this slide and we can&#39;t, we were so close, the fire was exposing just the truth, just the teeniest bit of truth before it all got doused out by those MeToo sexual allegations and we just have to keep the fire going, by the light that never burns out. </p>

<p><strong>This was just an expansion on the thread I did of Millie Bobby Brown, but I&#39;d like to start this one as a general exposure thread.</strong></p>

<p>Share any links you think we should be sharing to spread awareness. Share any news here you think we should be aware of that is important. Let&#39;s make them burn under the gaze of the public eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thank you for sharing this with me. It all makes so much sense, and the fact so many of us can see what&#39;s really going on between the lines of society, must mean that we&#39;re coming to some sort of ... ... ...finale? It&#39;s scary, and it makes me not want to have any part in this world, but as a great wise man once said, <em>&quot;and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>only recently has that stuff been posted here so it&#39;s new to me too.  and it&#39;s crazy.  props to the people spreading it here because i&#39;d have probably never run into it, <em>and i look for these kinds of things</em>.  it looks like this crowd is on the run and escalating their plans for an event, so my advice to anyone out there is to get your trust networks in place, and to be willing to act.  that doesn&#39;t mean bad acts, but rather to deliberate and contribute to things that will put an end to this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we need to start forming groups in real-life with like-minded individuals. Then form a network ourselves that works outside of the internet at least, or these types of forums. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point but I&#39;m not saying these kids look sexy - I have never once said that - you&#39;re missing my point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying these kids are being presented in a way that implies they are sexually mature and sexually available by imitating adult women.
There is a difference.</p>

<p>Basically I am saying that these kids are being treated like adult women when they are not and that is wrong because adult women understand the context of certain poses, certain clothing and it seems these children either do not or are too young to fully realise what they are doing. </p>

<p>Some of the younger children genuinely might just innocently be imitating the women they see around them and it&#39;s still wrong because (for one where are their parents and) while they don&#39;t understand the context of their actions, other people will and some sick people might take this presentation of children to mean that children ARE sexually mature and available and use this presentation of children to JUSTIFY their desires &amp; actions.</p>

<p>I mean look at that girl in the Fox news video - she believe what she&#39;s doing is art, yet how many adults present at that show are aware that she&#39;s 14 and not a adult woman? I&#39;ll bet you more than not that most of the attendees of that show are under the impression that all the models are over 18 since it was an ADULT womens-wear runway. </p>

<p>That is what I am outraged about. The fact that these young children are being presented in light that paints them as sexually mature WOMEN and not the children they are. It&#39;s treating children as if they are adult women. </p>

<p>You should be angry too because it&#39;s fucked up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said I was a rape victim of a Hollywood pedophile I said I was raped. From that perspective I nor the other people I know in my life who were raped agreed with the #MeToo movement. I personally felt like it was turning into an &quot;All Men Are Pigs&quot; separatist movement, and yet while doing that gave people a chance to play the victim over things that they should not have been claiming as assaults, put the spotlight on actual victims ( they had to relive their trauma ) and make a farce of real sex crimes.</p>

<p>There are news articles that confirm that those guys who worked for that network were charged/or alleged ( it&#39;s alleged with the guy who said he sleeps regularly with 13 year old boys - and he said that, so I can&#39;t prove that).</p>

<p>Yes, it IS fucked up if a child wears high heels. Not only are they bad for a child&#39;s growing feet, and bad for posture, the literal ONLY function of heels is to elongate the leg and make it look sexually appealing - even Louboutin&#39;s, the high heels with the red sole - they are modelled after the woman&#39;s foot shape she makes WHILE ORGASMING. <a href="https://www.independent.ie/style/fashion/so-can-high-heels-really-give-you-an-orgasm-26800510.html">His idea for making them that shape was that &quot;when you wear his shoes, you *may&quot; possibly orgasm&quot; - that was his whole marketing ploy. The only reason women wear high heels IS to look sexy.</a></p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see anything wrong with it, maybe YOU&#39;RE part of the problem and you can&#39;t see how abnormal it is for children to be presented in this way? That is a problem. I&#39;m a women, I understand that posing certain ways and wearing certain clothes gives off certain sexual vibes - in fact I do those things when I WANT to be sexually attractive. Kids doing these these that are not sexually mature is wrong because it&#39;s IMPLYING these children ARE SEXUALLY AVAILABLE.</p>

<p>That last bit about celebrities that rise from nowhere could be former child sex slaves is my opinion and it&#39;s a theory I think would give credibility to the child-sex slave ring that some people are claiming had thousands of children in it. </p>

<p>I agree, comments on a blog aren&#39;t a great source of information, only that blog is the known first one that says things that tend to be true. 
I&#39;m starting this thread to see if anyone here can share things that would confirm things. To see if there is more solid proof out there and so that it doesn&#39;t get buried and so that we make a song and dance over it because it is happening. It&#39;s still happening, and it&#39;s got to stop it and it seems the only thing that threatened them was being exposed in the public eye.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you said about heels applies to grown women as well.  I agree -- there&#39;s no doubt that the only reason women wear heels is to look sexy.  If we&#39;re so fucked up that kids are wearing them now, maybe every woman in the nation shouldn&#39;t go around wearing them all the time, even to church and the work place?  Is that something you complain about, or do you just care about the fact that they make heels for children, and market them?  Don&#39;t you think the fact that nearly every female rolemodel (hollywood or no) including a child&#39;s mother is wearing this sexually charged clothing has more of an influence on the child&#39;s development than the fact that child heels could be purchased if so desired?  See what I&#39;m saying here?</p>

<p>I see plenty wrong with it, but I don&#39;t give a fuck about the fact that they manufacture them.  That literally does not matter in light of the terrifying fact that <em>no one would make them if people didn&#39;t want them</em>.  You see something really fucked up with the fact that some kids will wear these things, and blame hollywood demons, and you don&#39;t look around you, or within you.  </p>

<p>You say you&#39;re a woman and that you will do those things when you want to be sexually attractive.  That&#39;s vague re: heels.  In my opinion, if you ever wear heels, don&#39;t complain about some other person in hollywood when you yourself are doing everything you can to fuck up the world in exactly the way you&#39;re upset about.</p>

<p>I have no idea what that blog is... I strongly suspect its bullshit but maybe Im wrong.  Is there any reason to think it is credible?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with you on heels. I normally don&#39;t wear them, and would you believe that I&#39;m currently sitting in a leg brace with crutches because one week before Xmas I decided to wear heels on a night out - something I rarely do - and I fell and dislocated my knee. I never normally wear heels and I have weak knees, but this was the first time I ever ended up in hospital and it was due to high heels.</p>

<p>I can say now with certainty I will not ever be wearing them again - even though I only wore them 4 times in 2017. I normally give out about women in high heels too. It is retarded - especially that in some workplaces it was considered unprofessional for women if they DIDN&#39;T wear high heels. </p>

<p>I totally agree with what you&#39;re saying about the Hollywood role models wearing these clothing and influencing these people too and I think that should be changed.</p>

<p>I feel that many grown women don&#39;t think that they way they look influences the attention they get and then you have all these women done up like pornstars appearing on talkshows giving out ( in part of this &quot;MeToo&quot; bullshit ) about how men cat-call them all the time. To me, if you dress a certain way, you&#39;re going to attract a certain kind of attention. I don&#39;t think these women realise that and they are the very ones who dress their kids like mini-versions of themselves, and don&#39;t realise what&#39;s fucked up about that. I agree with you.</p>

<p>It is a bullshit blog here that deals specifically with celebrity gossip. But many of the things on that blog have been confirmed or turned out to be true, so it&#39;s the most reliable source I guess you could say of rumours within Hollywood. </p>

As soon as something actually detrimental comes out on the internet, they can shut down entire sites/browsers/domains.. and its not like we can run up on Hillary Clinton and take her out ourselves..

    <div class="md"><p>Hollywood has pedos, just like every other demographic. Seen zero evidence they all conspire. I think the idea there is some organized push to promote pedophilia is retarded. Most stories about cult sex slaves are bullshit. 
I&#39;m all for a war on pedos. But you want a war on rich famous people because you are jealous. Look at this post wild theories based on nothing. There is all sorts of real child abuse out there, it&#39;s perpetuated by normal average middle class men, that doesn&#39;t make as good a story as satanic ritual abuse though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not denying that there is plenty of abuse by non-famous people. My country was riddled with pedophile priests for a long long time that was just swept under the rug. That was controlled and it was well aware it was happening, but it wasn&#39;t until many years later that people actually started coming forward. You could say that that was cult-ish. I feel in a way there are similarities between what was happening then with what seems to be going on now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware that there&#39;s pedophile in other communities, that no one knows about until they get caught. I do think that seeing children presented in a certain way encourages those people. It normalises their feelings in their mind, and justifies them.</p>
