<p>It just seemed to me that the OP of this thread was using language that doesn&#39;t fit with the situation, and using it for dramatic effect. </p>

<p>People who live in Metro Detroit will never say &quot;As far north as Canada&quot;. Ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from the area too. I visit Windsor frequently, probably 2 to 3 times per month. Before I started doing this, I didn&#39;t really realize that Canada was just a 15 minute drive away, and I certainly never realized that I&#39;d have to drive south to get there. You shouldn&#39;t assume that people in Michigan know anything about Canada, and you shouldn&#39;t assume that Americans know anything about geography. If someone from Michigan knows anything about Windsor, it&#39;s probably limited to the knowledge that you can go drink there before you&#39;re 21. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comment is reflective of the fact that Americans aren&#39;t taught things like local geography in school. They&#39;re not trying to ruin public education because people are uninformed about these things, people aren&#39;t informed about these things because they&#39;ve already ruined public education system. Not like it was especially good before, but my point is that you&#39;ve got cause and effect mixed up. People not knowing about local geography is an effect of their deliberate class warfare, it is not the thing which is causing them to do class warfare. </p>

<p>Perhaps a split in the St. Lawrence Seaway, and/or a split in the continent along the Mississippi River from N to S this year. I am no one, but this is what has been revealed to me. I hope that I am incorrect, but when I experienced what you have described it caused me to move across the country. I, of course, have no idea consciously.

<p>1.) The missile defense system is working as intended and has successfully shot down 2/3 NK ballistic missiles. They’re claiming  ‘mistake’ and ‘meteor’ so people don’t panic. </p>

<p>2.) LAZARUS; the NK hacking group is doing this on purpose to rile the American Public against preemptive war. </p>

A meteor sounds like a good explanation, just found it odd. Like a &quot;DON&#39;T OPEN THAT DOOR&quot; type of way. Oh this door? Yeah I wanna open it now. DON&#39;T WORRY IT&#39;S JUST A METEOR!

    <div class="md"><p>Mentioned this over at cbts, we should try to find a seismograph of the 2.0 event. Meteors look way different than earthquakes because of the air/ground interface. If the graph supports the MSM narrative of a meteor burst in air then we can dismiss the orbital weapon conspiracy theory. The Russia meteor from a few years ago offers a nice example of a seismograph due to sonic boom or meteor exploding. Earthquakes (and I assume a tungsten rod the size of a telephone pole) should show classic P and S waves on the graph.</p>
