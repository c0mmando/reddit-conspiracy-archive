<ol>
<li><p>Only men are required to be drafted and sent to die
for the United States. The Selective Service System
of the United States Government states,
“Almost all male U.S. citizens, and
male immigrants living in the U.S.,
who are 18 through 25, are required
to register with Selective Service.”4</p></li>
<li><p>Taking paid work and household duties into
consideration, Fathers worked 47 hours a week,
while Mothers worked 39 in 2011.5</p></li>
<li><p>Men are the slaves of women.<br/>
a. They do the hardest and most dangerous jobs to
keep women’s lives comfortable. The U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics, Census of Fatal Occupational
Injuries Charts, 1992-2012 page 8 shows that 92%
of occupational fatalities were men.6
Page 19 shows that the most dangerous jobs are:7</p>

<ol>
<li>Logging workers</li>
<li>Fishers and related fishing workers</li>
<li>Aircraft pilot and flight engineers</li>
<li>Roofers</li>
<li>Structural iron and steel workers</li>
<li>Refuse and recyclable material collectors</li>
<li>Electrical power-line installers and repairers</li>
<li>Drivers/sales workers and truck drivers</li>
<li>Farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural
managers</li>
<li>Construction laborers</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider also garbage men, taxi drivers, firefighters,
miners, and police officers. According to the U.S.
Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,
85% of all police officers are men.8
According to the United State’s Department of
Labor’s 20 Leading Occupations of Employed
Women, we see that the jobs women do are
considerably safer and less stressful jobs than men
perform.9  </p>

<p>b. Outnumbered over two to one, 258,000 Southern
men died to defend Southern women from the
invasion of a Northern Army.10 The same story runs
today as well. 2011 Demographics Profile Of The
Military Community, Updated November 2012, page
17 shows that 85.5% of active duty military
personnel are male. Yet this does not imply that the
14.5% female population is involved in combat.
11</p>

<p>In fact, The Washington Post states in its article,
“Three women pass Marine ‘grunt’ test, but Corps
holds off on letting them in infantry” by Craig
Whitlock, November 20, 2013,
“For the first time, three enlisted
women have passed the Marine
Corps’ grueling infantry course,
carrying the same rifles and lugging
the same 85-pound packs on the same
12-mile hikes through the piney
woods of North Carolina as the men.
The female Marines are scheduled to
graduate Thursday at Camp Geiger,
N.C. — a historic development as the
U.S. military prepares to open ground
combat forces to women. ”
12</p>

<p>It appears then that the G.I. Jane persona that we have
been led to believe has regularly existed for so long,
is actually a myth.
Clearly then, women get paid less, not because they
are women but because the men are taking the most
risk and subjecting themselves to the most danger.
Also “Men Earn More Money and Promotions
Because They Work More Hours Than Women”.13  </p>

<p>c. Women complain about the glass ceiling that
keeps them from ascending into the highest positions of power in America, yet more men are trapped in the
“glass cellar” that keeps men in jobs with the most
danger.  </p>

<p>d. Men are expected to be the unpaid bodyguards of
women. They are to receive violence but never return
it. They are expected to give up their seats for women
and at one time they were expected to stand up as a
woman entered the room and were also expected to
bow to them. They also help women put on their
jackets. Men are often seen walking along side of the
highway in desperation. Who ever saw a woman in
this condition? Men are also more likely to be
homeless.
14  </p>

<p>e. Men are less likely to be able to go to college.
“On a national scale, public
universities had the most even
division between male and female
students, with a male-female ratio of
43.6–56.4. While that difference is
substantial, it still is smaller than
private not-for-profit institutions
(42.5-57.5) or all private schools
(40.7-59.3). The nearly 40-60 ratio of
private schools was most surprising,
though perhaps this is partly due to
the fact that most all-female schools
are private. Nevertheless, the female
domination of higher education
prevails across all types of schools.”15  </p>

<p>f. Violence against women is abhorred but violence
against men is entertainment. We are the gladiators
for women’s amusement in Football, MMA, Boxing,
Wrestling, Ice Hockey, Rodeos, Auto Racing etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Fast Facts About Female Supremacy In The United States.</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>The Government plays the bodyguard role for
women in America.  </p>

<p>a. “Across a wide range of jurisdictions the estimates
are that mothers receive primary custody 68-88% of
the time, fathers receive primary custody 8-14%, and
equal residential custody is awarded in only 2-6% of
the cases.”16
This leaves the burden of two households on the
Father. Is it then any wonder that “Divorced men are
more likely to have heart disease, high blood
pressure and strokes than married ones - are also 39%
more likely to commit suicide”?17
Men are so ridiculed by other men for depression as
if it was a sign of weakness, that when faced with
suicidal thoughts, instead of seeking help men just
commit suicide.
When I was in college I ministered at a detention
center in Greenwood, Sc. Most of the men that
attended my Bible study were men in prison for
failure to pay child support. And get this; if a woman
tells you she is using birth control and isn’t, if you
get her pregnant she can still sue you for child
support!</p>

<p>b. The fact that the men don’t pay shows that women
are not qualified to chose their lovers.</p></li>
<li><p>Breast cancer receives much more research
funding and publicity than prostate cancer despite
similar number of victims.
18</p></li>
<li><p>Men commit suicide over 3 times the rate women
do.19</p></li>
<li><p>“Across the industrialized world, women still live
5 to 10 years longer than men. Among people over
100 years old, 85% are women”.20</p></li>
<li><p>“Males were nearly 4 times more likely than
females to be murdered in 2008”.
21</p></li>
<li><p>Women spend the most money in America:
“Female shopping trips are most
important to the mass merchandiser
and dollar store channels, while male
shopping trips are of greater relative
importance within convenience/gas,
grocery and warehouse club outlets.
Women spend more money per trip
than men in all of the channels
examined, but in many channels, the
differences between the sexes are not
as great as one might expect.
Nevertheless, spending differences
do indicate that women drive the
larger stock-up or planned trips as
they outspend males by $14.31 per
trip in supercenters and by $10.32 per
trip in grocery stores.”22</p></li>
<li><p>It has been my life experience that women are far
more competitive with each other than men are with
men and when given power have shown themselves
just as bloodthirsty if not more bloodthirsty and
warlike than men. My fathers come from England.
One of the reasons my Fathers left England was
religious persecution. One of the most famous
persecutors was Bloody Mary. She killed hundreds
of Protestants by burning them alive for their
religious beliefs. Queen Isabella engaged in War
with Portugal and enabled the conquest of North
America via Christopher Columbus. In recent years
Margaret Thatcher, the “Iron Lady” engaged in the
Falklands War.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Feminism Hurts Women</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Too many short broken relationships leaves
modern women mentally and emotionally scarred.
This serves to create huge masses of both men and
women who seek revenge on the opposite sex at
every opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p>The only way to enjoy this type of life is to harden
yourself to the point where you become ruthless.</p></li>
<li><p>Your young years are the best to start having
children and your best time to find a life partner.
When you are out of college and in the work force
you are not going to have the time or the opportunity
to be around men you have known for years and can
trust with your life.</p></li>
<li><p>Feminism makes men apathetic toward family
roles and life in general. Man has lost his sense of
leadership, masculinity and also his chivalry and it’s
all the fault of Feminist women. Not only do
Feminists not believe that the woman was made for
the man (1 Cor. 11:9), they view men as the great
burden on humanity, full of sexual perversions and
grotesque dependencies- a real life slobbering
werewolf. He is to wear a dunce hat for all his life,
and bear the guilt of all the sins in the world,
especially if he is white. Moreover, the vast majority
of Feminists have sex before marriage with multiple
partners. Feminists want to have sex with as many
men as they want and then when they want to get
married to a good guy, he is just supposed to
overlook all the men that have had their way with his
wife to be and the mother of his children. Moreover,
Feminism takes away his authority and makes the
word “Father” empty of meaning. Also, women are
given preferential treatment in the divorce courts.</p>

<p>“RESULTS For the entire sample,
higher risks of suicide were found in
divorced than in married persons.
Divorced and separated persons were
over twice as likely to commit suicide
as married persons (RR=2.08, 95%
confidence intervals (95% CI) 1.58,
2.72). Being single or widowed had
no significant effect on suicide risk.
When data were stratified by sex, it
was observed that the risk of suicide
among divorced men was over twice
that of married men (RR=2.38, CI
1.77, 3.20). Among women, however,
there were no statistically significant
differentials in the risk of suicide by
marital status categories.
CONCLUSIONS Marital status,
especially divorce, has strong net
effect on mortality from suicide, but
only among men.”23</p>

<p>As a matter of fact a woman can divorce a man and
take half of the family assets for no fault or
wrongdoing on his part at all.24
The modern sports, drug and porn culture is a result
of men seeing no incentive in committing to
responsible family life. This leaves these “liberated” 
women mostly single as they ascend into their later
years, bitter, and alone.</p></li>
<li><p>The Feminist attitude is unnaturally crass and
pugnacious as a way to impersonate male toughness
as an attempt to make men see them as equals. This
makes men hate women and paints a proverbial
target on the forehead of such women. It also creates
chaos in the workplace.</p></li>
<li><p>The Feminist sexual revolution, pace Margret
Sanger, has turned women into empty shells whose
lives are primarily focused on appealing to the sexual
desires of men.</p></li>
<li><p>The children of Feminists have no one to raise
them but the media and the government public
schools. This is creating a savage generation of
children that cause their parents great grief.25</p></li>
<li><p>The Feminist sexual revolution has literally killed
millions of girls in abortion clinics.</p></li>
<li><p>The Feminist sexual revolution has seen to the
creation of an international human trafficking market
where women are kidnapped and forced into sex
slavery.</p></li>
<li><p>The Feminist sexual revolution has created a
plague of sexually transmitted diseases.</p></li>
<li><p>Feminism sparked the Civil War, pace Harriet
Beecher Stowe. This civil war created a more
centralized federal government that created the
modern monetary and tax system which steals so
much money from Americans that women must work
in order for a common family to survive.</p></li>
<li><p>Feminism has deceived young girls into thinking
that they can govern their own lives. The problem is,
young women are too controlled by their emotions to
make well thought through decisions.</p>

<p>Example #1. Young girls follow their emotions and
typically look for the bad boy. From what I have
heard, young women, in their narcissism, think they
can bring worship to themselves if they can change
said bad boy. This experiment has resulted in a
plague of tens of millions of aborted children and a
population of mostly abandoned unwed mothers in
America. According to the CDC’s National Vital
Statistics Reports (October 3, 2012), see tables 1 and
7, 40% of births in the US are to unwed mothers!
Here we see that Feminism enfranchises the bad boy.
And women wonder why there are no good men.</p>

<p>Example #2. When I was in college I was good
friends with a young Latino girl. She was in love with
my best friend. The year before our first year in
college, he had offered himself to her at the time
that she was in love with him. I asked her why she
turned him down. She said, “I was too scared. I was
overcome with emotion.” A couple years later she
had despaired of finding a good guy and married a
savage police officer she knew little about. He turned
out to be a violent man with a porn addiction. After
having a child with him, she divorced him for
multiple grievances. After this divorce she gave up
on romance completely. Feminism is a disease.</p></li>

<h3>White Men In Protestant Countries Have Made All Of The Most Significant Accomplishments Even After The Liberation And Higher Education Of Women</h3>

<p>In the Fourth Session of the Roman Catholic Council
of Trent we Read,</p>

<p>“DECREE CONCERNING THE
EDITION, AND THE USE, OF THE
SACRED BOOKS
Moreover, the same sacred and holy
Synod,--considering that no small
utility may accrue to the Church of
God, if it be made known which out
of all the Latin editions, now in
circulation, of the sacred books, is to
be held as authentic,--ordains and
declares, that the said old and vulgate
edition, which, by the lengthened
usage of so many years, has been
approved of in the Church, be, in
public lectures, disputations, sermons
and expositions, held as authentic;
and that no one is to dare, or presume
to reject it under any pretext
whatever.
Furthermore, in order to restrain
petulant spirits, It decrees, that no
one, relying on his own skill, shall,--
in matters of faith, and of morals
pertaining to the edification of
Christian doctrine, --wresting the sacred Scripture to his own senses,
presume to interpret the said sacred
Scripture contrary to that sense which
holy mother Church,--whose it is to
judge of the true sense and
interpretation of the holy Scriptures,-
-hath held and doth hold; [Page 20] or
even contrary to the unanimous
consent of the Fathers; even though
such interpretations were never
(intended) to be at any time
published. Contraveners shall be
made known by their Ordinaries, and
be punished with the penalties by law
established.
And wishing, as is just, to impose a
restraint, in this matter, also on
printers, who now without restraint,--
thinking, that is, that whatsoever they
please is allowed them,--print,
without the license of ecclesiastical
superiors, the said books of sacred
Scripture, and the notes and
comments upon them of all persons
indifferently, with the press ofttimes
unnamed, often even fictitious, and
what is more grievous still, without
the author&#39;s name; and also keep for
indiscriminate sale books of this kind
printed elsewhere; (this Synod)
ordains and decrees, that, henceforth,
the sacred Scripture, and especially
the said old and vulgate edition, be
printed in the most correct manner
possible; and that it shall not be lawful for any one to print, or cause to
be printed, any books whatever, on
sacred matters, without the name of
the author; nor to sell them in future,
or even to keep them, unless they
shall have been first examined, and
approved of, by the Ordinary; under
pain of the anathema and fine
imposed in a canon of the last Council
of Lateran: and, if they be Regulars,
besides this examination and
approval, they shall be bound to
obtain a license also from their own
superiors, who shall have examined
the books according to the form of
their own statutes. As to those who
lend, or circulate them in manuscript,
without their having been first
examined, and approved of, they shall
be subjected to the same penalties as
printers: and they who shall have
them in their possession or shall read
them, shall, unless they discover the
authors, be themselves regarded as
the authors. And the said approbation
of books of this kind shall be given in
writing; and for this end it shall
appear authentically at the beginning
of the book, whether the book be
written, or printed; and all this, that is,
both the approbation and the
examination, shall be done gratis, that
so what ought to be approved, may be approved, and what ought to be
condemned, may be condemned.”26</p>

<p>Here we see that it was the Protestant demand for
Bibles that opened the Freedom of the Press in
Protestant Nations. Subsequently, the Treaty of
Westphalia which ended the failed Catholic War of
Protestant Annihilation, The Thirty Years War, is, in
defiance of the local University’s denial of facts, the
true end of Catholic dominance in Europe and thus
the true end of the Middle Ages, introducing the
modern period.</p>

<p>At this point the Protestant Nations explode with
Scholarship, Culture, Literature, Art, and Science,
created the highest Civilizations that have ever
existed and have dominated the world since. The
reason why this was possible is because the
Protestant Reformation opened the press, which gave
the Bible to the people and thus raised the people’s
morals and the Protestant Governments allowed
freedom of thought and invention.</p>

<p>England had already entered their Protestant Golden
Age with blessed Elizabeth, which produced Sir
William Shakespeare but picking right up from
Westphalia is the production of one of the greatest
minds to ever exist, Sir Isaac Newton. Protestant
Germany produced the great Lutheran Johann
Sebastian Bach. The Protestant Dutch enter their
Golden Age with Rembrandt (His Father was Dutch
Reformed). The Protestant Presbyterian Scottish
produced Adam Smith who invented modern Economics and James Watt who invented the Steam
Engine.</p>

<p>In grievous pain the modern Feminist will look upon
this horrifying period of History and complain that
there are no women participating in all of this glory
because they were being systemically suppressed by
the evil white man. In reply, I would simply ask the
reader to consider the technological
accomplishments that have taken place since women
began to receive Professional Education in the mid
19th Century.</p>

<p>The following is taken from Technology A World
History by Daniel Headrick published by Oxford
University Press, 2009 where we see a list of the
most significant inventions since the mid 19th
century. The text says on page 138,
“Almost all technologies introduced
since World War II originated in the
United States, Germany, Great
Britain or the Soviet Union.”</p>

<ol>

</ol>

<p>100% men and as a rule we are looking at white men
from Protestant Countries. Not one woman is
mentioned in this volume as having accomplished
anything in the realm of civilization since her
supposed liberation. Most of these men did all these things when the Patriarchal Protestant Religion
absolutely dominated the lives of men here and
elsewhere in Europe and the British Isles. These men
were generally raised up in homes where they were
disciplined, the Fathers ruled the house, and the Bible
was taught to them from their childhood. When you
look at their pictures, you see men, with intense looks
about their faces and they are dressed like
Professionals. This was the manhood of possibly the
greatest Gentile generations in world history. Today
things are much different. The cultural archetypes of
my generation, the wigger, the pothead, the punk-
grunge and the sports-fan are all distinct modes of the
same psychological nihilism that permeates the
minds of the youth here in America. These young
people have been taught to hate their Bible reading
fathers, to hate their family’s religion, to hate their
history, and to firmly believe that things were never
better in the past. The previous generation was raised
to rule; the present generation is being raised to serve
as subjects and slaves. </p>

<h3>Pause</h3>

<p>Thus, if women do not pull equal weight, if they do
not have equal contributions to civilization, and if
they do not have equal responsibilities in a society,
as they don’t and never will, they should not enjoy
equal rights, privileges and franchise.</p>

<p>Luke 12:48 From everyone who has
been given much, much will be
required; and to whom they entrusted
much, of him they will ask all the
more.</p>

<p>Moreover, these women have shown themselves
incapable of choosing a qualified mate and raising a
family as they have murdered over 50 million of their
own children since Roe v. Wade.</p>

<p>Ignoring the overwhelmingly one-sided imbalance between men and woman offered in the OP to which you did not care to comment on whatsoever, you are saying that there are different amounts of value being brought into the husband-wife relationship. If that is the case, then by definition the husband and wife, or male and female, cannot be equal, as equality demands conformity of value. </p>

<p>So the family unit, the backbone of civilization, doesn&#39;t matter? And can you address ANY aspect of the post detailing how the male with his certain set of attributes, is being discriminated against? Does this &quot;matter&quot; to you or are you just here to virtue signal?</p>

<p>No, there is a hierarchy just as there is in the parent-child relation. Civilization is built on female subordination to the husband and child subordination to the parents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that males are disproportionately discriminated against, being that femanism is caused by women and affects all men, and men are being disenfranchised as primary beneficiaries hence the pornography culture and MGTOW-like movements: these men do not feel any sense of obligation to be attached to a female who they know is rebellious or a whore, yet femanist woman who sleeps around with everyone in the neighborhood still expect men to overlook this. It is largely one-sided discrimination. Yes, it does hurt females too, as the post shows, but the discrimination is unequal; men and women do not suffer in the same way or to the same degree from feminism. It is the men who are hurt the most, and it is society that will see the repercussions down the road. Men are not going to even attempt to raise a family in a climate which many times is only going to rob from them and make their lives miserable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly before i address any of your points i&#39;d like to know where I&#39;ve previously mentioned feminism? And Ii&#39;m left wondering why have you suddenly brought it into the conversation?</p>

<p>Have you automatically attributed it to me because i choose to believe that my partner is equal in worth, to me? </p>

<p>The truth be told feminism (as it stands right now) is of no interest to my partner, nor me. She is a fan of Dr Jordan Peterson and likes to actually be feminine, rather than subscribe to some ideology that&#39;s doing more to keep a certain few women in a youtube career than it&#39;ll will ever do for women. </p>

<p>However, that does not make her subservient to me in anyway. The feminine compliments the masculine.</p>

<p>Onto your points... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is that males are disproportionately discriminated against.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In certain areas i would agree with you. It also differs from country to country. Where I am we&#39;re not very litigious and divorce rates are low, so I&#39;m sure the divorce outcomes may not be as shocking as some in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>being that femanism is caused by women</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cant agree with this. Feminism is purely a gynocentric view of a system that controls all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>these men do not feel any sense of obligation to be attached to a female who they know is rebellious or a whore, yet femanist woman who sleeps around with everyone in the neighborhood still expect men to overlook this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s in anyone&#39;s interest to be sleeping around. If a man overlooks his wife sleeping around he either enjoys cuckolding or he needs to man up. Maybe not going for women who are a &quot;rebellious whore&quot; in the first place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men are not going to even attempt to raise a family in a climate which is set up to rob from them and easily make their lives miserable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet a lot of us still do, with no problems. </p>

<p>I think you need to stop looking for the whore in young ladies, start looking for the good instead. You may find that some of the ones you think are whores, are not. </p>

<p>Priests forbid laymen from possessing Bibles, and Catholic doctrine is based on blindly accepting what Rome says. These are prime examples of Catholic restriction of conscience which is why the scientific and intellectual climates were inferior before the Reformation and before 1648 when the Jesuits were defeated in their Thirty Years War of annihilation against the Protestant nations. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you assume technology didn&#39;t exist before the protestant revolt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you really going to compare innovation and scientific advances that have been accomplished in the time after the reformation to the technologies produced before that time, when the pope ruled? You are looking at two entirely unequal landscapes. The very branches of science that we know today including physics and chemistry were made because of Protestant men Issac Newton and Robert Boyle. Adam Smith invented modern economics.</p>

<p>Patently false.  Bibles were rare because there were made of vellum and transcribed by hand, sometime using 14 carat gold- by Catholic monks.   It took a lot of work to produce a single copy of the Bible before the printing press was invented.  Even then, the Gutenberg Bible was a Catholic Bible.  The first English and German Bibles in fact came from the Catholic Church, NOT from Martin Luther.</p>

<p>The only thing Luther did was make copious use of the relatively newly invented printing press to his advantage to spread his false ideas and mistranslated Bible.</p>

<p>I love the Bible and in fact, St. Jerome - a Catholic - was one of the primary transcribers of the Bible.  The Catholic Church canoninzed the Bible and protestants wouldn&#39;t even have a Bible had it not been for the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The first German Bible translation was by Ulfilas who was an Arian and denied the deity of Christ.

<p>The Council of Tolouse &quot;had no complaint about mere translations of the Bible; vernacular versions having been appearing for centuries. But the Albergensians were twisting the Bible to support an immoral moral system. So the bishops at Toulouse restricted the use of the Bible until the Heresy was ended...

<p>The argument is that the common people did not have access to bibles, which this admits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thirdly, the Council of Tolouse was a local council, not an ecumencial council</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? It is still under the jurisdiction of the Catholic church and the law was made by Catholics in order to forbid the people from reading bibles. And concerning ecumenical councils on this matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proclamations at the Ecumenical Council of Constance in 1415 C.E.: Oxford professor, and theologian John Wycliffe, was the first (1380 C.E.) to translate the New Testament into English to “...helpeth Christian men to study the Gospel in that tongue in which they know best Christ’s sentence.” For this “heresy” Wycliffe was posthumously condemned by Arundel, the archbishop of Canterbury. By the Council’s decree “Wycliffe’s bones were exhumed and publicly burned and the ashes were thrown into the Swift River.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>William Tyndale was burned at the stake for translating the bible to English.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Council of Tolouse &quot;had no complaint about mere translations of the Bible; vernacular versions having been appearing for centuries. But the Albergensians were twisting the Bible to support an immoral moral system. So the bishops at Toulouse restricted the use of the Bible until the Heresy was ended... Their action was a local one, and when the Albigensian problem disappeared, so did the force of their order, which never affected more than southern France.&quot; (pp. 45-46, Catholicism and Fundamentalism).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with this argument is that Rome would say the Protestants were also guilty of heresy for simply reading the bible as it is meant to be read. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your &#39;wikipedia&#39; entry is for the &#39;first translations of the Bible into MODERN English&#39; ...not the &#39;first translations of the Bible into ENGLISH&#39;. . In case you are unaware, there are three time periods of attributed to the development of English: OLD, MIDDLE, and MODERN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep and so is the German information, it is about modern German translations which is the reason I pointed out the arian heretic who translated some of the Bible to an early form of German. If you are saying the first ones qualify as most important, then you would be giving credence to an arian. Also, the translations you mention were not full translations. From the same wiki page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although John Wycliffe is often credited with the first translation of the Bible into English, there were, in fact, many translations of large parts of the Bible centuries before Wycliffe&#39;s work. The English Bible was first translated from the Latin Vulgate into Old English by a few select monks and scholars. Such translations were generally in the form of prose or as interlinear glosses (literal translations above the Latin words). Very few complete translations existed during that time. Rather, most of the books of the Bible existed separately and were read as individual texts. Thus, the sense of the Bible as history that often exists today did not exist at that time. Instead, an allegorical rendering of the Bible was more common and translations of the Bible often included the writer’s own commentary on passages in addition to the literal translation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tyndale&#39;s translation on the other hand was of the entire new Testament and then supplemented by Miles Cverdale to contain the entire Old Testament as well, giving the people a full English bible. This was the first real english bible. It is also the first English translation to work directly from Hebrew and Greek texts. The previous wiki citation clearly stated &quot;the first major period of Bible translation into the English language&quot; was of Tyndale. It is not distinguishing modern English from old English.  It is a general assessment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not being able to find a suitable mate? Are you looking a woman who can bench press as much as you do? Those women exist. There are even women who proclaim to be against feminism. </p>

<p>But if you think gender equality is the cause of all your problems and lack of “suitable” women, you are pretty far off base and those beliefs and the chip on your shoulder over gender differences is what is holding you back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you are blaming everything else on your lack of successful relationships instead of looking inside and figuring out what exactly you want and how to find that in a partner (there is someone for everyone). If you feel you keep getting shitty partners then do something different. Posting a bitter post about how feminism makes women bitter isn&#39;t going to help you. </p>

<p>You get what you give. Stop complaining and make a change if you don&#39;t like your results. Blaming women for everything wrong in the world seems like a really lonely road...but if you want to end up alone that&#39;s your choice. Most won&#39;t hate you for it or blame you for their problems.</p>

<p>Good luck my friend.</p>

<p>However i dont judge the sexes on an equality of output. </p>
