<p>Shill: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a person who publicizes or praises something or someone for reasons of self-interest, personal profit, or friendship or loyalty.  <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/shilled">http://www.dictionary.com/browse/shilled</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another definition I found:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A person who pretends to give an impartial endorsement of something in which they themselves have an interest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/shill">https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/shill</a></p>

<p>These definitions happen to describe &quot;positive shilling,&quot; which means they endorse something, but there is also negative shilling, which is what we see in the post about Trump hotels. They are pretending to give an impartial negative review of something which they&#39;ve never purchased for reasons of self-interest, political motivations, etc.</p>

<p>In conclusion, a post in that subreddit is full of people attempting to convince others to shill against Trump hotels. Pathetic. There are plenty of real things to shit on Trump for. For instance, pretty much whatever he says on a daily basis. But no, these people are so petty that they want to shill against Trump hotels, many of which have very little connection to Trump himself. They are full of decent people who need those jobs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t you just post that?</p>

<p>Again I ask, is boycotting the same as organizing a group to spam false claims on public forums to harm a business? My gut tells me this is not the same as refusing to support a business with your money and that you are aware of this fact.</p>

<p>Try this- if I used this subreddit to make a post asking people to spam review sites saying that we all got e-coli from Pelosi&#39;s Goat Hill Pizza restaurant because I don&#39;t like her politics, would that be ethical? Would you consider it unfair and detestable conspiring?</p>

<p>I would. I would report that crap in a second. Simultaneously, I effectively can boycott her restaurant by not spending my money there and letting folks know so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those definitions of shill consider clarifying that both of them use the term &quot;Interest&quot; the way it used in the second noun definition here:</p>

<p>&quot;in·ter·est
ˈint(ə)rəst/Submit
noun
1.
the state of wanting to know or learn about something or someone.
&quot;she looked about her with interest&quot;
synonyms:   attentiveness, attention, absorption; More
2.
money paid regularly at a particular rate for the use of money lent, or for delaying the repayment of a debt.
&quot;the monthly rate of interest&quot;
synonyms:   dividends, profits, returns; a percentage
&quot;her savings earned interest&quot;</p>

<p>verb
1.
excite the curiosity or attention of (someone).
&quot;I thought the book might interest Eric&quot;
synonyms:   appeal to, be of interest to, attract, intrigue, fascinate; absorb, engross, rivet, grip, captivate; amuse, divert, entertain; arouse one&#39;s curiosity, whet one&#39;s appetite; informalfloat someone&#39;s boat, tickle someone&#39;s fancy
&quot;a topic that interests you&quot;
persuade to have, tempt to have;
sell
&quot;can I interest you in a drink?&quot;</p>

<p>When I first read those definitions you posted I thought in terms of the first noun or verb  definition. I that it meant just about anybody that speaks out in favor of something is a shill...took me a second to think about it more in terms of a &quot;gain&quot; or &quot;profit,&quot; improving ones standing in some way. Hope that makes sense.</p>

<p>Again I ask, is boycotting the same as organizing a group to spam false claims on public forums to harm a business? My gut tells me this is not the same as refusing to support a business with your money and that you are aware of this fact.</p>

<p>Try this- if I used this subreddit to make a post asking people to spam review sites saying that we all got e-coli from Pelosi&#39;s Goat Hill Pizza restaurant because I don&#39;t like her politics, would that be ethical? Would you consider it unfair and detestable conspiring?</p>

<p>I would. I would report that crap in a second. Simultaneously, I effectively can boycott her restaurant by not spending my money there and letting folks know so.</p>
