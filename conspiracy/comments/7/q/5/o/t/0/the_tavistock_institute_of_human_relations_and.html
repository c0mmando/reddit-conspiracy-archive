        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Tavistock Institute was founded in 1946, in Tavistock Square, London. It was an outgrowth of The Tavistock Clinic, which was founded in 1920. The Institute was originally funded with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. </p>

<p>&quot;The Rockefeller Foundation (RF) operates out of New York City and was first established by John D. Rockefeller, Sr. in 1913. The Rockefellers are an American industrial, banking and political family dynasty. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, John D., Sr. (1839-1937) and his brother William Rockefeller (1841-1922) amassed the largest private fortune in history, primarily through Standard Oil. [1] The family is also known for its long association with and financial interest in the Chase Manhattan Bank, now JP Morgan Chase.[2]&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s research and purpose is murky, with not much information publicly available.</p>

<p>&quot;A cadre of highly trained specialists in psychological warfare was built up in total secrecy. In fifty years, the name &quot;Tavistock Institute’ appears only twice in the Index of the New York Times, yet this group, according to LaRouche and other authorities, organized and trained the entire staffs of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the Strategic Bombing Survey, Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, and other key American military groups during World War II. During World War II, the Tavistock Institute combined with the medical sciences division of the Rockefeller Foundation for esoteric experiments with mind-altering drugs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The English Tavistock Institute has not restricted its activities to left-wing groups, but has also directed the programs of such supposedly &quot;conservative&quot; American think tanks as the:
-Herbert Hoover Institute at Stanford University
-Heritage Foundation
-Wharton
-Hudson
-Massachusetts Institute of Technology
-Rand</p>

<p>&quot;One of the rare items concerning the Tavistock Institute appears in Business Week, Oct. 26, 1963, with a photograph of its building in the most expensive medical offices area of London. The story mentions &quot;the Freudian bias&quot; of the Institute, and comments that it is amply financed by British blue-chip corporations, including Unilever, British Petroleum, and Baldwin Steel. According to Business Week, the psychological testing programs and group relations training programs of the Institute were implemented in the United States by the University of Michigan and the University of California.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_tavistock02.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_tavistock02.htm</a></p>

<p>The Institute is a powerful, yet largely unknown influence on shaping public opinion, culture, moral values etc throughout the world through its many offshoot groups and subsidiaries. It was one of the organization&#39;s in the forefront of research on brainwashing and mind control, as well as psychology of large groups and what predicts and influences behavior. It has also been influential in shaping public opinion in order to gain support for war.</p>

<p>&quot;Tavistock Istitute developed the mass brain-washing techniques which were first used experimentally on American prisoners of war in Korea. Its experiments in crowd control methods have been widely used on the American public, a surreptitious but nevertheless outrageous assault on human freedom by modifying individual behavior through topical psychology. A German refugee, Kurt Lewin, became director of Tavistock in 1932. He came to the U.S. in 1933 as a “refugee”, the first of many infiltrators, and set up the Harvard Psychology Clinic, which originated the propaganda campaign to turn the American public against Germany and involve us in World War II&quot;</p>

<p>One of its most influential offshoots are the Stanford Research Institute:</p>

<p>&quot;Stanford Research is plugged into at least 200 smaller “think tanks” doing research into every facet of life in America. This is ARPA networking and represents the emergence of probably the most far reaching effort to control the environment of every individual in the country. At present Stanford’s computers are linked with 2500 “sister” research consoles which include the CIA, Bell Telephone Laboratories, U.S. Army Intelligence, The Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), Rand, MIT, Harvard and UCLA. Stanford plays a key role in that it is the “library”, cataloging all ARPA documentation.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s enough links and data to write several books regarding this subject. And the connections and tendrils between all these institutes reaches through major institutions, corporations, political entities, think tanks, corporations that own news networks, tv channels, through Hollywood, the music industry, and other areas of media. The list goes on and on. In short, you live in a Truman show in which those pulling the strings control and influence your environment, they know how you&#39;ll react to stresses, propaganda, media, and they use it to shape your opinions and thoughts, and our culture.</p>

<p>Combined with childhood education which teaches you to memorizeinformation and repeat it, with the emphasis on critical thinking nearly nowhere to be found, leaves the masses wide open to be further indoctrinated and told what to think.</p>

<p>In conclusion, question everything. Do your own research. Read. Don&#39;t believe everything you&#39;re told. Don&#39;t even believe this post. Research it for yourself. Many people are waking up to the system of control. Be the change you want to see in the world. </p>

<p>You have to wonder what it would be like today if none of these “think tanks” existed. How would the world be without all of these controls and manipulation? Would it be better or worse? I would like to believe better, but I really don’t know that with 100% certainty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, as with anything, the motives matter. If there was this &quot;system of control&quot; that had think tanks that existed to manipulate the world somehow into peace, prosperity for everyone, and to improve quality of living etc., then perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be such a bad thing. One look at the state of the world will tell you that&#39;s nowhere near the objective IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read this book <a href="https://archive.org/details/Tavistock_201601">Tavistock Institute of Human Relations by John D Coleman</a>. It&#39;s a great read which showed how this think tank manufactured consent for WW1, WW2, Vietnam, and Iraq. Plus it&#39;s like $5,000 on Amazon it&#39;s totally worth reading because knowledge should be free. In my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of my favorite books about conspiracy including parts about Tavistock are by an author Daniel Estulin. His books are usually in other languages, but I believe they are in English as well.</p>

<p>The guy writes things that almost always inevitably happen within a few years. He also writes about past conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember reading that Tavistock was heavily involved in the creation of the CIA after WW2, when the OSS was redesigned.  The OSS had trouble gaining access to intelligence from more legitimate US military sources (including broken Axis force codes), and turned to English intelligence, who wanted a way in to US intelligence. Tavistock got their grubby hands on the whole mess, and the CIA was born.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Was it John Coleman&#39;s book you read? </p>

<p>&quot;Under the guidance of Dr. Kurt Lewin, Tavistock established the OSS, the forerunner of the CIA. [...] Tavistock was behind another major development in providing a detailed study-program that led to the creation of the Office of Naval Intelligence, (ONI) the premiere intelligence service in the United States, one that dwarfs in the CIA in size and scope. [...] Tavistock runs more than 30 research institutions in the United States [...]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get your point but this was a super small company and I got to know this bloke pretty well, I worked really closely with him and went to his wedding. I&#39;ll be sure to follow up and do a bit of reading on the subject (any particularly good recommendations?) but knowing this guy as I did I find it difficult to believe that he would ever be close to or involved in something like that. That led me to putting this conspiracy theory aside. </p>
