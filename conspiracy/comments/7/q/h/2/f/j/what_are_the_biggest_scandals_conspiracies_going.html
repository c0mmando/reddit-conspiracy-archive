       What are the biggest scandals &amp; conspiracies going on in America that are most likely being covered up behind the scenes while the media continues to create endless scandals about everything Trump does? Like i'm talking horrible things, that we should absolutely be informed of in the news

       Domestic spying is so out-in-the-open that I'd hesitate to even call it a "secret" conspiracy, but that's my vote for #1.  The incredible trick they pulled off was not just finding new ways to shred the 4th Amendment, but convincing people to practically ask for it.

       It’s probably because it’s another Trump defense post.  I like the idea of this post but then OP said the media is creating scandals.

       Though it might be relevant bc the president kicked off a dipolomatic blunder of chatastrophical size. He litteraly insulted docents of US allies, some of them being allies of the US since WW1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you have to adress that this is the 13th ( or 14th?) investigation vs Clinton. Most people just stopped counting. Its hard to comitt an entire week of news to the docents time the clintons get investigated

       This. Is. Huge. RESEARCH OBREDECHT people. Politicians in South America are going to jail over this. Unfortunately Americans are much better at covering up their corruption, but hopefully their day will come.. Corruption is this company’s normal business practice. Everything it touches is rotten. Here’s a lead: Obredecht has been awarded contracts at Miami International Airport.

       Not yet. But like I said they’ve done work here,. They need to be 100% sure they get the contract so they always pay people off. They’ve paid off both sides of elections just to make sure they get contracts. So if they got contracts for MIA, people took money from them. We’d have to investigate who approved those contracts. Fun fact: this whole thing blew wide open because some low level government employee in Brazil was driving around in a Range Rover.

       But if you'd enjoy a brief summary: The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is planning to imprison US citizens in concentration camps following the imposition of martial law in the United States after a major disaster or crisis. In some versions of the theory, only suspected dissidents will be imprisoned. In more extreme versions, large numbers of US citizens will be imprisoned for the purposes of extermination as a New World Order is established.

       I've also heard that about 2017. And 2016. And 2015. And 2014. And 2013. And 2012. Let's be real here, TPTB aren't going to lose their grip any time soon. That's not to say that we must all lose our hope, and I believe one can still lead a very fulfilling life in an NWO-controlled world, but it is foolish to tell ourselves that we're winning the battle, or that there even is a battle in the first place.

       Ive never believed it about any year except for this one. But if 2018 isn't the year, I still believe it's coming. Whatever "it" is, I'm not expecting to over throw the system like some mission impossible movie. But I believe some reckless events will go down. If nuclear war hits and we end up in some tunnels under Wal-Mart I'm going to piss myself.

       Agreed. The motive is the most important factor and the piece of information I'm most desperate for. Keep in mind that for all we know, it could be completely beyond our understanding. We don't really know what goes on in the upper tier of society.

       I don’t think they’re gonna imprison them. Project blue book (faked alien attack) will take place and they will use the Walmart’s and shit as bunkers. Not that it’s entirely innocent because it’s pretty much the same thing as what you described but this will be the disguise imo.

       I was driving down the I5 once and saw a train about a mile long. On it there white trailers all labeled FEMA. I don't know where it was going, but it looked like it was going North.

       I was just reading a report in r/holofractal that was discussing piezioelectric secondary harmonic generators and how calcite crystals display these effects. To my understanding, fluoride actually fills in gaps between calcite crystals and "muffles" their vibrations. 
Calcification is actually what lets you "tune in"

       Why are you a shill if you don't believe one particular theory? I lived next to a National Park, and we've had 6 people go missing and never found in 100 years. The guy claims the gov't doesn't keep data on missing people. But it took me one minute to find the National Park Service's page for cold case missing persons in National Parks. And I just saw a post saying hundreds of people go missing each year under "bizarre" circumstances each year. The OP doesn't even link one case that was bizarre in the last few years, and what's the source for hundreds of people? Most who go missing are found, and Park Rangers and local DPs use immense resources to find those people. Sorry, but I think it's complete bullshit.

       The relationship between App rides and burglary. The driver picks up the Mark, chats them up (those drivers are awfully chatty, no?) , contacts their shady cousin or buddy, and he loots the place. Trips to and from the airport are targeted specifically, but it could happen anytime. I think this information is downplayed by the app companies because they don't want to add any more drama to their growing pile of problems, especially with the Uber IPO on the way.

       I'm European and educated in sociology. (I'm guessing that doesn't exactly make you like me, but fuck it)

       "Cultural Marxism" is something completely different from what you think:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The understanding of cultural marxism you use originated in Nazi Germany;  "Kulturbolschewismus (Cultural Bolshevism)", or sometimes "Jewish bolshevism."
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and I can absolutely assure you that "Cultural Marxism" (Franfurter school theories) is not taught in US schools. The theories are quite demanding to understand and the US school system is shit. No way it would be taught.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand what you're saying, but you're wrong and the words you use make you sound like a nazi.

       I guess i could change cultural Marxism to "SJW bullshit, white guilt, destruction of Western culture, anti-American, progressive leftism". Is that more accurate?

      <p>
       You don't think that mass migration of people who have no desire to assimilate, but rather to replace the current population and culture of Western countries is a bad thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Germany, Sweden, Canada Australia and other Western nations are being destroyed by that currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The progressive leftists say they need those people in order to maintain the workforce and welfare programs, but many of them just go on welfare themselves, so thats an outright lie. Plus, automation is about to put millions out of jobs, so why import more workers who wont ever work?

       EDIT: Shit I think I might have completely misunderstood you. I'm used to the words you used being used by other types of people and made a bunch os stupid assumptions about your point of view.

      <p>
       I live in Sweden and it ain't that bad. I used to live in one of the so called "no-go-zones" for a couple of years and never had problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion the people who fuck up "foreign countries" (Africa &amp; some parts of Asia) are exactly the same people that fuck up the countries we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't about left and right, it is about evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean If we hadn't fucked over Africa for the last 1000 years or so most Africans would probably stay. It is cold as fuck where I live and it can't be too funny coming up here where you don't speak the language and don't fit in culturally. I think most immigrants would stay where they were if they had a decent chance of a decent life there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we see the same issues but disagree on the cause.

       I agree that imperialism and exploitation of those places and driving them out of their home is wrong as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I avoid buying conflict mineral containing goods, and since China is the biggest abuser of Africa, i avoid buying things made in China as well. I try to buy as ethically as possible because out of sight evil is still evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making their countries into shitholes is wrong, but  so is wiping out Western civilization. I also agree that the problem needs to be stopped at its source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats why my name on here is Amazonistrash. I hate the people who get rich by screwing people over like Bezos. He could feed a small country with his wealth. I hate socialism but i wouldnt mind if all his wealth was stripped and redistributed because hes an evil fucker. Same with Zark Fuckerberg. Neither of them have earned their wealth by doing something good. Many super rich get that way unethically.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we fix the system from the bottom up, Bezos and Zuck will go bankrupt, but everyone would have to wake up.

       There is plenty of scientific reason to believe that mass extinctions are real things that happen, and the same applies to the dramatic desintegration of the biosphere (

       ). These are all mainstream sources, so either this information is false TPTB wants us to believe that ecological collapse is possible for some reason or you are trusting your guts too much and your brain too little. If you can think of any reason why option 1 would apply I'm happy to hear it, but I don't think it does.

       the land hasn't been inhabitable. But that doesn't mean the land, beneath the ice, was never habitable. Some even claim that Antarctica used to be tropical and rich of life. There are a lot of stories about what used to live on the lands of antarctica. Also stuff about "inner earth" which is somewhat fun to look into.

       Every one of your replies to people seem to be you trying to be condescending... I think it goes without saying that there is land under the ice. Crazy frozen species, super advanced technology, proof of aliens... all things that could be on or in that land. That's more along the lines of what I was alluding to.

       If that was a joke, I blame being tired... and dumb. I just imagined him saying "land, clearly" and then adjusting his glasses while staring me with contempt. Then again, that's why I went back and read his other comments. They all seem a little too r/iamverysmart for that to have been a joke.

       I know Hitler was interested, just not sure how interested. "Unwaning interest" from the "elites" makes it sound like there jas been secretive, or not so secret research into it that I haven't been aware of. Obviously there is some research there, but I was asking you if you have any links or conspiracy info regarding this "unwaning" research going on...

       The Rockefellers and Rothschilds funded many of the first expeditions,  Hitler and many other major governments came a little later. The Rockefellers and Rothschilds never left, having funded sending many Rockefeller linked corporate CEO's over to visit antarctica as parts of "academic retreats". Its hard to believe CEO's would have any interest in a place if it was only scientists with beakers and ice. I don't claim to know whats there, but I know how to identify when certain people's gazes are locked on something intently.

       It's not really a mainstream community, but lead in drinking water. The NRDC did a report and found that there are 6,000+ communities at a greater risk for lead contamination then Flint. There are tens of millions of people drinking water that has either gone through a lead distribution pipe, or touched lead in their house. It's going to cost hundreds of billions to fix this problem, and the government is just kind of ignoring it, while millions of people are being poisoned, and children are ingesting a chemical daily that has been proven to lower IQ with a single small dose.

       The power structures’ forecast of the world in the not so distant future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political upheavals, organic or manufactured, are becoming commonplace, corporations grow larger, advancements in robotics and AI will change everything to some degree, and no one is given the slightest idea that they’ll be a secondary notion in the scheme of it all, that their children will almost certainly live in a world that looks radically different than it does now.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a real possibility that as farming becomes more and more mechanized, rural living is lost to the cities.    Cities will swell.    Inequality will become more pronounced.    Crime will fester.   So on and so on...
      </p>
      <p>
       We’re at a stage when people need to actively shape their world if they don’t want it to become a cyberpunk shithole.    It’s happening quicker than we realize and pausing to look beyond the days duty’s is required.

       I bet social media platforms have reached their peak and are fighting for every user they can get.   Facebook is the prime example.   Every teenager out there understands Youtube controls content to some degree and they want their net neutrality.    The internet may be sucky at the moment but people know it’s a platform to be harnessed and a few movers and shakers can make it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money will be a big one to watch but the users want anonymity and that bodes well for freedom.   When crypto starts getting regulated and taxed and accepted at Walgreens people will be looking for the next something.
      </p>
      <p>
       And corporations cannot effectively brand like they used to.   The same goes for politicians and platforms.    Nestle, the Star Wars franchise, Hollywood, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are waking up quicker than than can be put back to sleep.    If they slowly muster up the ability to live independently from a centralized system then courage and efficacy and freedom should flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, decentralization is winning.   I’m hopeful.

       Oh bullshit, I read this shit all the time, have you ever visited a lodge? Have you actually talked to a mason? Freemasonry is dying in the us, majority of members are over 60 and not many want to join. Lodges are closing almost everyday. The fact that people think they are some super powerful entity is laughable.

      <p>
       I'd like to hear your thoughts on the Royal Order of Jesters:
      </p>
      <p>
       "On March 9th, 2008, Buffalo News broke a story involving New York Supreme Court Justice Ronald Tills, Erie County, NY Deputy Michael Lesinski, Lockport, NY Police Captain John Trowbridge and New York State Law Clerk Michael Stebick participating in a human trafficking operation that involved transporting undocumented immigrant sex workers from as far as Kentucky to New York and Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       In June 2008, former Justice Ronald Tills told investigators that there were about 30 women at the national event and “described a network of members who had the ability to supply such women.”"

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you gonna go with "not every mason does that kind of thing!" or "Shriners aren't masons!" as if that doesn't literally prove the point that Freemasonry conceals its true intentions to the initiates?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       know what Freemasonry is really about, because most masons don't.

       "Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert C. Moscati, who is handling the case, stated that Lesinski admitted to transporting women in April, 2005 from the Buffalo airport to a hotel in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, where the Royal Order of Jesters was holding its national convention. While there, the women engaged in sex acts with members of the Jesters in exchange for money. Lesinski also admitted knowing about the prostitution but lying to U.S. Custom’s officials about the purpose of his visit when returning to the United States. Lesinski was an Erie County Sheriff’s Deputy at the time."

       This is how freemasonry works: they conceal the dark lodge within the outer shell so that most masons have absolutely no idea what is going on. Have you read Morals and Dogma? Albert Pike is unequivocal about this.

       There are tons of freemasons that act as unpaid shills for their organization in the promise of getting higher degrees or other advancement. They really vary in knowledge level, from guys who really have no idea how bad the black lodge inside freemasonry really is, to guys who are in the loop and very much protecting the secrets.

       I wouldn't mind at all if they just came in and said "I've been a mason for years and it's just a harmless fraternity" because for most of them, that's the truth. But they rarely do that, it's almost always accompanied by calling the other person ignorant, extremely misleading statements like claiming not to be a secret society, and so on.

       Also you have to be a master mason before you can become a Shriner except in Arkansas that has been a heated debate and they have broke Masonic law, most join so they can be a Shriner they are known as the party crowd but they do good work and the Shriners hospitals have done a lot of good. Try getting your info from life experience and not from off the wall websites.

       In terms of technology, 5G is almost identical to 4G. The only real difference is a slightly different frequency range; the increase in speed is not achieved through some radical new innovation, but merely by ramping up the bandwidth. If 5G fucks with your brain, 4G does as well.

       Please do not spread false information. 4G is in the low GHz bands around 2.4GHz, which does not have the same destructive effects as the up to 80GHz that 5G will be using. 5G will directly damage skin, cause cataracts, and has the ability to interfere with bodily functions much more profoundly than 4G or any other commercial communications RF.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately 5G is easy to shield against, as it is attenuated by water in plant leaves, the atmosphere, and by normal building walls.
      </p>
      <p>
       EMI shielding for windows within LOS to a 5G transmitter will be necessary though.
      </p>
      <p>
       High frequency microwave like 5G doesnt travel far and is highly directional, which is why the assholes behind it are planning on putting mini cell sites on utility poles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, you will be getting microwaved constantly in places with 5G coverage in a way that you never have been
      </p>
      <p>
       I am truly amazed that 5G is legal. Its basically a lighter version of the military microwave weapons but used for communications

       No problem. 5G is going to be a scourge to peoples' health. I am extremely concerned about it. If you want to avoid the eye, skin and cellular damage, youll probably have to become vigilant about electromagnetic shielding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately the EMC(electromagnetic compliance) industry is robust because, ironically, computers have to be shielded properly against all kinds of radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this, the literature about effective shielding from every kind of radiation is freely available online, but you have to be technically inclined to make sense of a lot of it.

       Naaah, man. Not at all. 4G uses little virgin wimax and LTE whereas 5G uses the chad OFDM, MC-CDMA, LAS-CDMA, UWB, Network LMDS and IPV6 systems. Saying they're the same thing is like saying a firehose and a kitchen faucet are the same thing because they move water. I mean, in that sense, yeah, but in a real world setting, they're hardly similar, and if you doubted it, I'd say let me spray you with my sink sprayer and then go stand in front of a fire hose. lol

       They did tests up in Alberta, I think, with towers placed among trees that were just coming into bloom, and a perfect circle of discolored, unhealthy leaves surrounded each one, extending out for a distance, and the effects, while most pronounced closes to the tower, could be seen miles away.

       The stock market it ridged. They keep changing the equations and factors so that the echelon stays on top. You're very unlikely to ever escape the financial place you are in... The richest people do 0 work and collect a lot while complaining about lazy people being a burden. Bc of subsidizing, the richest people can set an income expectation. Of they don't make it, the government picks up the missing amount. Its legal fraud to maintain Americas oligarchy.

       I think it's more insidious than that. Anyone can invest in a well-diversified portfolio and expect 10% (7% with inflation) returns over the long-term. That's just enough for someone who invests a significant amount of their paycheck to have a decent retirement. But doing so requires continuous sacrifice throughout one's entire adult life with the payoff being that you can not be destitute for like 10 years between when you retire and when you die.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, a very, very, specific and small number of people have access to algorithms that buy and sell millions of shares of stock each second, relying on the tiny gains and losses and huge volume to make massive profits. This essentially drains an enormous amount of wealth out of the economy (ie out of the middle class) and puts it directly into the pockets of the already uber wealthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and then those uber wealthy people convince us that it's in our best interest to give them huge tax cuts, and they throw up crumbs to get people to say, "oh, well, I'm getting a tax cut too!"

       The longer your retirement is locked up in managment the more fees you pay also. That's why superannuation companies in Australia have been lobbying to increase the retirement age higher and higher. It equals billions more profit for them.

       Day trading is more profitable, albeit more risky, than long-term portfolios handled by financial advisors. You're never going to become wealthy by playing it safe on the exchange, you're only going to get a comfortable retirement.

       I fuck with stocks and keep myself up to date on the latest movers and shakers. It's really not that hard to do either. There's definitely insider trading, but it's not rigged lol. People just don't know what they're doing.

       They're biting themselves in the ass. I pirate because I don't want commercials, they're losing so much money from people like me, but someone's gotta pay for the shows to get made. If enough people subscribed the show gets paid for. Adding ads is a straight up insult. Look at Netflix, they're doing great without commercials.

       Politics is FAKE.  Trump and Hillary and Putin are all in it together. Aided by almost everyone you've ever seen on national TV.  They buried pizzagate and spirit cooking not so much because they expose pedophilia and satanic cannabilism, but because they expose quite succinctly the "1 degree of kevin bacon" between politicians, hollywood (actors, directors, producers) , and other "elites".  Even a cursory examination of the facts easily connect the Hillary and Trump campaigns and their gadflies like Julian Assange, and all media personalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone states in another post here, it all seems to stem from project paperclip, the US government program that brought NAZI scientists to the US in order to invent and perfect ICBMs.   But some of these NAZI's were also involved in human experimentation and propaganda.  They insinuated themselves into the government to become what we now know as the "Military Industrial (Congressional) Complex".
      </p>
      <p>
       These "people" were able to relax moral standards that allowed horrors like MKULTRA to happen.
MKULTRA included a mind control program that includes many famous celebrities including the new presidential rival Oprah Winfrey.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that no-one seems to have noticed that the former CEO of the WWE (fake wrestling) is in the current Cabinet of the President (Linda McMahon)is boggling.  Again, possible presidential candidate "The Rock" is from this ilk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, look at Jes-se Ven-tura, WWE wrestler who became Governor.  He makes a great case that 911 was an inside job, and then goes and blows his own credibility by creating a TV show titled "Conspiracy Theory".  He sues (and wins against!) the widow of Americ-an Sni-per Ch-ris K-yle to shut down sales of his book (published before his assassination) that includes evidence of Govt killings.   This one deed exposes his true character and association and a force with the MICC.

       That the war against CO2 is a war on life itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans exhale CO2, so claiming we need it reduced leads to population reduction. Look at how many people blame humanity as a whole for the environment collapsing.
      </p>
      <p>
       CO2 isn't toxic and doesn't smell, in fact plants need CO2 to live! The more CO2 in the air the bigger plants get. Without CO2 there would be no life on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       CO2 is the bubbles in our soda, yet they're saying it's "dangerous pollution". Something doesn't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       A tax on CO2 could be done on every human forever, as we will always exhale CO2.
      </p>

       Allow me to play the devil's advocate and rebuke your statements. I don't necessarily disagree with your point of view, but there are a lot of good reasons why it might be false.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The reason why humans exhaling CO2 doesn't matter while fossil fuels creating CO2 does is something called the carbon cycle. The CO2 in fossil fuels was extracted by the atmosphere millions of years ago (that is what plants do) and buried under a thick layer of sediments, so burning fossil fuels is essentially introducing new CO2 into the atmosphere. Our ecosystem isn't equipped to deal with this sudden influx, so the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere rises and we get climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CO2 you exhale was also formed by plants, but in a much more recent timeframe. It was extracted from the atmosphere only a short while ago and is now given back; assuming that the amount of plants remains somewhat consistent over the years, the net amount of CO2 in our ecosystem doesn't change and none is 'leaked' into the atmosphere. This is one of the reasons why deforestation is such a huge problem, but human existence on its own doesn't in any way upset the CO2-balance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Exactly! That's why nobody who knows what they're talking about would tell you that CO2 is toxic, at least not in the amounts that it will ever be found in our atmosphere. The problem with CO2 is that it causes climate change, not that it poisons you.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As I said before, toxicology is not the reason why CO2 is so worrisome, so this point is moot.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A One World Government needs to tax people to gain legitimacy and to fund itself. Protection of the environment is the excuse they will use to tax and rule us all.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a very valid argument and one of the reasons why I am against the Paris-agreements, but it is no counter to human-induced climate change as a phenomenon.

       The biggest Conspiracies are the ones in plain sight. Everything is a rich man's trick. Our entire society is based on waking up, going to work, "earning money" - - which is a complete farce and paying taxes/buying food and providing the basics of human survival to ourself while completely dependant on a society that is based on money... Which is a fallacy. No one can sustain themselves on food/water/shelter without relying on the government or existing infrastructure to get it. We are all slaves to the elite.... Like livestock. Our daily exististnace makes minimal impact and just hands cash to the government/bankers. Welcome to the hamster wheel that is your life.

Tired by the time I get home only enough energy to make food and eat it and watch my programming then go to sleep and repeat it 4 more fucking times. It's a joke. I hate it so much.

       Haha I kinda cheated there actually as my girlfriend usually makes our dinner so I get some down time on the Xbox thank god. Cooking in itself takes a good chunk of time especially if you're trying to eat healthy

       Many things but for a while id probably just be lazy and play a lot of video games. In all honesty I want to get 10 or more acres and make my own homestead sanctuary. It can be a lot of work going completely sustainable so I'm honestly just aiming to get land for now then plan the house/living quarters later on.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mean time id try to continue to grow my knowledge and rememberance of self. We never truly stop growing so it'll be good to keep reading learning and applying myself in various ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a huge collection of books I'd like to read and work through that I never ever have the time for. Thankfully I can listen to audio books at work but that can only stretch me so far. I'd continue to be a truth seeker and research conspiracies and post and share what I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I'd go after my joy and continue to live life and try to grow. Some things I'm willing to give up is a steady paycheck. A set weekly schedule. The social interactions from being at a job 5 days a week. Career opportunities, advancement, etc all of that I am willing to give up if it could mean true freedom and the availability to pursue my true joys and aspirations and not be stuck grinding hours of my life out at a job that doesn't reward me back except keep me off the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of a long winded post but it's something I think about constantly. I don't talk to many people about it because some people seem to perceive that as a lack of drive or a loser or loner or whatever else lame term you wanna slap on it for going against the grain of society. Either way all I know is that I want some land with a creek or river and continue to grow learn and enjoy life as I can. Go out and explore and adventure. Ultimately have a big garden and get into the soil and plant what I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       so many possibilities. I just need to make myself financially able to do such an opportunity and then I am more than willing to take the leap.
      </p>

       Thanks for asking

       I was curious because most people just have a vague idea with no real plan. You job isn't really something you give up. You don't want it to begin with. how about video games? Cut them off the list. You always have time to read. Just unplug or even go to a coffee shop every day get some cheap coffee and read for an hour. Get library books. Don't buy another book until you finish your latest one.

       We/they have trapped us in an idea that you have to do this or that or have x or y to quit the treadmill. Move someplace kind of cheap and get a crappy, but clean apartment. Work for a bit and see where it leads you. Off the grid can be pretty brutal. You have to start very small, learn a lot, work your ass off, and try not to get sick.
      </p>

       I've traded in freedom for the illusion of freedom and an easy lifestyle. If you don't spend too much time looking at the houses on the hill. You can enjoy what you've got. Just two cents.

       I have obsessive compulsive disorder and have been dealing with the mental health system for awhile. What I've found from discussions with patients and doctors, my own experience, and from my own research, is that psychiatry is a complete scam. Most of drugs do almost nothing of benefit for the patient and cause terrible often permanent "side effects" ("permanent side effect" is really just a euphemism for neurological damage - how would one go about causing a permanent side effect like muscle twitching without causing brain damage?).

       Sure, those are probably legitimate reasons and there are probably many other factors that may increase suicide rates as well. But the issue is that, in an era of unprecendently high prescription of drugs whose sole purpose is to reduce suicides, the suicide rates have increased staggeringly. How can anyone argue that these drugs actually work?

        The economy is rigged from the start because our money is debt-based.  As long as we continue to use debt-based money, we can only become more indebted.  There is no way for us to collectively to pay off our debt.  The only way to pay off the interest portions of our debt it to take out another loan.  This is why the younger generations continue to fall further and further behind, because their debt allows the older generations to pay off their older debt.
       </li>
       <li>
        Fractional Reserve Banking allows banks to profit from lending money they don’t have, and if anything bad happens, they are too big to fail and the taxpayers just give them money.  This allows them to steal wealth without having any skin in the game, unless a bigger bank wants to steal their wealth.
       </li>
       <li>
        Our food and water are poison.  Almost all food and water that we ingest is loaded with stuff that contains chemicals designed to kill life, whether it’s chorine or fluoride in the water or pesticides/herbicides in your food.  These are poisons that our bodies can deal with … sort of, but it is a definite burden on our bodies to have to deal with this.  Also, our bodies are heavily dependent on the bacteria in our guts.  These poisons not only are a burden on us, but also our beneficial gut bacteria.  Furthermore, foods raised with fertilizers become more and more deficient in all the minerals that are lacking in the fertilizers, as such the human body is less equipped to deal with the stresses of our bodies as time goes on.  This completely ignores all the chemicals in the water and soil due to poisoning creating by companies, just dumping poison into nature.
       </li>
       <li>
        War is rigged.  The elite make up excuses to go to war.  They control both sides, profit from arms sales to both sides, profit from fixing the destruction on both sides, the natural resources won in a war go to the elite and not the people of the winning side.  It’s pretty much just a controlled demolition of the people and wealth on all parties involved except those who profit from the war itself.
       </li>
       <li>
        The elites are international and above nations.  Our governments are mostly for show.  They get us to bicker back and forth about things that don’t really matter to them and won’t change easily (gun control, marijuana, abortion, racism/sexism, etc.), and then under the cover of night they just unanimously pass whatever laws they need to get done while nobody notices.
       </li>
       <li>
        Corporations are massively favored over labor.  They are designed to concentrate wealth in the hands of their owners.  Meanwhile we increase regulations and hurdles that make it harder for new entrepreneurs from getting their ventures off the ground which corrals the masses into labor type jobs where they are paid for their time and not the value that they create.
       </li>
       <li>
        That and all the Satanism, pedophilia, MKUltra, etc. that basically suggest that the elite are pure evil people.

       I agree that imperialism and exploitation of those places and driving them out of their home is wrong as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I avoid buying conflict mineral containing goods, and since China is the biggest abuser of Africa, i avoid buying things made in China as well. I try to buy as ethically as possible because out of sight evil is still evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making their countries into shitholes is wrong, but  so is wiping out Western civilization. I also agree that the problem needs to be stopped at its source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats why my name on here is Amazonistrash. I hate the people who get rich by screwing people over like Bezos. He could feed a small country with his wealth. I hate socialism but i wouldnt mind if all his wealth was stripped and redistributed because hes an evil fucker. Same with Zark Fuckerberg. Neither of them have earned their wealth by doing something good. Many super rich get that way unethically.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we fix the system from the bottom up, Bezos and Zuck will go bankrupt, but everyone would have to wake up.
