       Recently reported on NPR, an explosive news piece on emails exchanged between the shooter Paddock and another one of his email aliases. Who the fuck was he talking too? Was it a FBI sting gone wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I quote verbatim from this NPR article
      </p>
      <p>
       “One affidavit includes email exchanges between
       <a href="mailto:centralpark1@live.com">
        centralpark1@live.com
       </a>
       , a Microsoft account that FBI authorities believe belonged to Paddock, and
       <a href="mailto:centralpark4804@gmail.com">
        centralpark4804@gmail.com
       </a>
       . (It is unclear if the FBI knows who is responsible for the latter account.) The messages were sent on July 6, 2017,
      </p>
      <p>
       The affidavit reads:
      </p>
      <p>
       "...[
       <a href="mailto:centralpark1@live.com">
        centralpark1@live.com
       </a>
       ] sent an email to
       <a href="mailto:centralpark4804@gmail.com">
        centralpark4804@gmail.com
       </a>
       which read, 'try an ar before u buy. we have huge selection. located in the las vegas area,' Later the day, an email was received back from
       <a href="mailto:centralpark4804@gmail.com">
        centralpark4804@gmail.com
       </a>
       to [
       <a href="mailto:centralpark1@live.com">
        centralpark1@live.com
       </a>
       ] that read, 'we have a wide variety of optics and ammunition to try.' And lastly, [
       <a href="mailto:centralpark1@live.com">
        centralpark1@live.com
       </a>
       sent an email to
       <a href="mailto:centralpark4804@gmail.com">
        centralpark4804@gmail.com
       </a>
       that read, 'for a thrill try out bumpfire ar's with a 100 round magazine.' Investigators believe these communications may have been related to the eventual attack that occurred at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas."

       CNN is saying Paddock was working for Trump personally to sell high powered arms to the Russians in exchange for another 2020 banker based victory, however because Paddock was actually a Hillary Supporter, once he found out the sale was going to benefit Trump and the Russians, he started shooting into the country music crown he knew would be mostly Trump supporters, live on CNN as we speak

       But what even is the sarcasm? CNN didn't say this. So are you saying this is the kind of thing people who believe CNN is "fake news" would say they said? I don't think so. You seem to be saying that CNN WOULD say something like this, but they clearly haven't. So I don't see where the sarcasm is here.

       To be fair, this massacre took place during Trump’s presidency. For someone who likes to act like a hard liner against crime and terrorism, it’s surprising this was allowed to happen. All of that domestic spying and nothing could be done to prevent this?

       It was pretty obvious from the very start that he was an arms dealer.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had a shitload of money but never had a job that would have paid him that much.
-He worked for the postal service or some other small job 20 years ago for a few years then had millions of dollars to spend on real estate, planes, and guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a pilot and his plane is currently owned by a known CIA front company.
-exactly what it says. His plane was sold off to people known to be running guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       His family members were all criminals.
-dad was wanted by the feds, he grew up on the run with him. 
-his dad is one of about 20 people to commit crimes with an actual machine gun in the US.
-brothers are both convicted felons
      </p>
      <p>
       He knew how to buy guns, but not how to use them.
-all of his guns were either Daniel Defense (the stocks are a giveaway) with Scopes and bipods or BCM with bump stocks and Eotechs, subject to a recall due to poi shift.
-The "note" on the nightstand was a ballistic chart for the DAD rifles, and yet his first rounds missed his target. The first ones hit were directly between him and the singer on stage indicating that he tried to shoot him, but missed due to not knowing what he was doing.
-the BCM rifles were all carbine length gas system guns and that combined with the bump stocks caused them to fire too fast and override the bolt, jamming the guns when he got excited. 
-The Surefire 100 round magazines used in the attack (there were dozens, I counted 17 still stacked neatly and unused in one of the photos) are very expensive but offer very little benefit to actual shooters as a mag change lasts all of 2 seconds. He spent money he didn't have to because he didn't know any better.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a mall ninja, but not a gun guy, but he sure knew how to spend money. Even without the ammunition, he spent at least $100,000 on this attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this points to one type of person, someone who buys guns but rarely uses them. He knew brand names, but not how to set them up. He sold guns.

       The fact that he wired $100k to the Philippines, and had $100k worth of weapons, stands out to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was an arms dealer, why would he send the cash equivalent of a weapons deal to an unknown account, you might ask?
      </p>
      <p>
       Escrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a black market transaction. Both the buyer and seller cannot be held accountable under the normal systems, I.e. the courts. So a third party becomes involved to handle the transaction, in lieu of a normal legal contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buyer X wants to purchase $100k of black market weapons. Seller (Paddock) has $100k of weapons. A deal is arranged.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if the buyer just kills Paddock and takes the weapons for himself? Or what if Paddock kills the buyer and takes his money? Alternately, what if the buyer writes a bad check? Or pays in tungsten-filled fake gold bars? Or maybe Paddock sells weapons that are defective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution to this problem, again, because the normal legal system cannot be used, is a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buyer wants $100k in weapons and seller wants to sell $100k in weapons. Buyer sends $100k to third party. Seller posts $100k bond. Buyer scams the seller? Seller gets the buyer's $100k deposit and all is good. Seller is selling defective weapons? Seller forfeits his $100k bond. All of the financial transactions happen in a country connected to the SWIFT system, but sufficiently unmonitored by international authorities. The Philippines makes sense.

       The story that the money was for the girlfriend's family sounds perfectly plausible to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were about to go to jail/die in a mass shooting and there was someone I deeply cared about (or even just really liked paying for sex) and still had money left over, I'd give it to them. He sent her back to her family to be safe and possibly avoid going to jail before the shooting, so why not give her money as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question I've always had was who else was supposed to be part of the attack? Someone very clearly backed out at the last moment and didn't fulfil their part of the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shooting jet fuel tanks doesn't make them explode. That's just not how fuel works. Shooting 100lbs of tannerite strapped to jet fuel tanks is a completely different matter though. That would have changed this from simply the largest mass shooting in modern US history to a 9/11 level event in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that whoever gave him the bad ballistic table also signed up to plant a bomb, but backed out at the last minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the photo of the rifle laying over his legs is a real problem for me. That's just not easily explainable unless someone set the rifle down after he was dead. The likelyhood of someone kicking their feet out after being shot and falling and not knocking the rifle over is nearly 0 considering his feet were longer than the height of the rifle above the ground. I've tried to do it with one of my rifles and just can't do it without seriously twisting both of my feet out 90° to either side and being extremely careful.

       I'm not sure I follow your logic but, anyway, if he is a dealer he's not selling Mack 10's to gangbangers. These are expensive guns and accessories purchased by people who likely know their shit.

       It's not like walking into Best Buy and the sales guy knows the top-of-the-line refrigerator inside and out. This is people going to him with a list, and he gets the stuff for them. He may never even touch the guns he's selling, let alone know how to set them up for various situations. Perhaps I was unclear.

       Im just questioning his SS, why he went to Mexico, him getting shot... I don't believe his story period. I question him being there. BTW he went on a daytime show to tell the wives the official narritave before the husbands heard about his story in the afternoon news. We're all adults here. Ellen is prodominatley watched by women.

       I was just about to ask this question. I've been fairly ambivalent about Vegas so far, and I'm not quite convinced that Paddock was an arms dealer, but I think it's a possibility. But that doesn't seem to offer any explanation for why he decided to murder a bunch of people all of a sudden.

       I’m with you on this. We have evidence behind the arms dealer theory, but it makes zero sense to commit the mass shooting. Criminals prefer to fly under the radar.

       I just read an elaborate theory about Paddock supplying arms to a team of dozens of assassins sent to kill the Saudi Crown Prince. When the plot failed, the assassins shot Paddock and started shooting into the crowd to make it look like a random mass shooting. And the FBI apparently went along with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory makes no sense to me, but I think that's how people are using the idea that Paddock was an arms dealer.

       Yeah, I’ve never committed a murder before, but if I did I would probably stop after killing Paddock and try to sneak away. This is why I don’t necessarily buy this theory. BUT, stranger things have happened and I know people don’t always think clearly during intense situations, so I’m not completely ruling it out.

       "Arms deal gone bad." I'm not innately familiar with arms deals, but I don't understand how an arms deal leads to a mass shooting. It also doesn't speak to all the evidence that points to this being meticulously planned. The cameras set up in the room. The fact he had checked into hotels overlooking other concert events, seemingly to scope them out as he planned his attack. Or the holographic sight he bought off of Amazon in September. Why would he purchase a sight on Amazon if he's an arms dealer or was at all connected to arms dealings?

       From other reading, it sounds like people on 4chan have created an elaborate narrative where Paddock was set up to sell guns to a couple dozen assassins who were sent to kill the Saudi Crown Prince. The whole thing falls apart with a little bit of scrutiny, but it certainly sounds like a great story when you first read it.

       Particularly when considered with what little we know about his past. His father being wanted by the FBI. His pilot's license. The amount of wealth he had and his multiple business dealings in different states. It all plays into a theory resembling American Made or War Dogs. It's fun and it definitely catches your attention, but I agree, I don't think this theory holds up much when you piece it together with what we do know.

       I have serious questions if he actually did the shooting, or at least if he did it alone. The photo of the gun laying over his body suggests pretty heavily that he wasn't along in the room.

       But what does it have to do with them? And how does that connect to Paddock being an arms dealer? If he was a patsy, you'd think they would choose someone more random and less involved in possible arms dealing, because that makes the whole thing seem suspicious.

       It's always easier to frame a criminal for a crime. I know the Saudis owning the Four Seasons and the location of Paddocks room smells funny, I feel like there has to be a connection there. Like maybe the CIA was using Paddock to get to these Saudis and something went horribly wrong, as it tends to do.

       A lot of people shoot themselves in the chest actually. Mostly women though. Men, usually, shoot themselves in the head, women in the chest. It has to do with the psychological make-up of each. I think it has to do with vanity or something like that, I can't remember exactly how it breaks down.

       <em>
        real

       emails. But who is he emailing? Paddock used to live at 4804 Via Ventura, in a building called the Central Park apartments. Paddock is sending emails to
       <a href="mailto:4804centralpark@">
        4804centralpark@
       </a>
       . Honestly sounds like he was sending emails to himself.

       Yes that's what I meant the article said that he controlled both email addresses.

       Send them to himself? Is he crazy? Multiple personality? Was it a shitty attempt to draw attention to the wrong direction?

       Maybe just trying to confuse the investigation that he knows will happen later?

       All I am saying is that the email address he is emailing (from the affidavit) is linked to him. Sure it might not be his, but it sounds like it could be, and it certainly doesn't prove he was an arms dealer

       Eh, if we weren't getting gun control after sandy hook, were not getting it after vegas. Not thay we should, just that if we think the media is pushing an agenda ( which it somewhat is always) there's really no win here. American people don't want gun control, so there's not a ton here to debate or give legs to.

       Wrong, there is a bigger more pernicious plot to the downplay to this than that. The way it was immediately and unanimously swept under the rug shows you that whatever is going on. They want people to forget and fast. Not their usual m.o. when something like this happens.

       the same thing happens every "worst in us history shooting". Right after people want to talk about gun control, for obvious reasons.

       That's kind of what happens when you're talking about limiting the only amendment we have in our Constitution that specifically says shall not be infringed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The talk didn't keep going about gun control because no one can come up with a law that would have prevented this. Hell had the shooters have fired in semi auto instead of full auto a hell of a lot more people would have died because 50 out of every 60 round burst wouldnt have gone over everyone's heads and you can fire plenty fast that way

       A weapon is simply a tool. Where they lack guns, they use other instruments.

       Granted guns make things a little more convenient but they aren't the only tool available for murder.

       Why aren't any of the attacks in Paris considered "mass shootings"?  Specifically Charlie Hebdo and and Bataclan nightclub.
      </p>
      <p>
       France has strict gun control and lots of paranoia about terrorism, yet those gunmen managed to get ahold of full auto AKs.   I'm willing to concede that perhaps in Europe those kinds of guns might actually be even easier obtain in the US because of leakage from Eastern Europe where everything from the fall of the Iron Curtain, Balkans War and maybe even the ongoing Ukraine conflict may put a lot of Soviet hardware onto the black market.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will also say that in the US mass killings, there seem to be few laws that aren't widely infringing that would have stopped most of these.  The people who bought the guns passed background checks.  In fact, I can't think of many examples of US mass killings that involve prohibited persons who obtained guns illegally, although it seems like prohibited person killings just happen 1-2 at a time every day and we call them "urban crime".

       No, you have a mental health crisis and a violent culture + guns. Yanks are violent people, nothing you can do about that in the short term.

       I hate to say it, but if you're a non-Republican, each day brings a new outrage in the news.  People don't have time to react or even really digest things, because the next day there's something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might also note that most Democrats have simply given up any idea of there being gun control legislation of any type until at least after this year's elections, but perhaps not till 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, and let me be brutally frank, while no one
       <em>
        said
       </em>
       anything like this at least in circles I frequent, I think the fact that it was a country music concert limited sympathy on the left, because of the (probably not inaccurate) perception that country music fans are more likely to be Republicans and gun supporters.

       1.
paddock got a huge gambling debt/arms shipment gone wrong that he couldnt pay back. If not debt than blackmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       They threatened him and his wife. This is why his wife fled to the philippines He took on 'the job' to absolve his debt and get money to his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.
paddock was a mind control mk ultra type. him being a govt contractor fits the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.
paddock didnt do it, he was just used as scapegoat

       just had an idea....
      </p>
      <p>
       what if the 100k of guns he had was supposed to be delivered to an evil buyer, but instead used them in the shooting. we have proof that he had 100k send to the philippines so this adds up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if paddock used the shooting as a means of exposing who the buyer was supposed to be, belieiving the shooting would be thoroughly investigated, thereby exposing the much greater evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, I know, killing all of those people was extremely messed up and senseless, but if you see paddock as the disilusioned guy with all his family members wanted or in prison, its fucked up, but you can kind of see psychologically how he might be willing to shoot people and end up dieing himself to expose a much greater evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I like most about this idea is that it explains why MSM is giving it no coverage. Following the leads would expose that paddock's buyer was connected to the deep state, hence the trump slander smokescreen.

       If all I have read, this seems most likely. I have been thinking it’s possible that this was a government sting and he realized he was burned and decided to do the shooting to expose the government project that caught him,. But somehow it seems more likely to me that he realized he had done a deal that was for some reason going to leave him dead (saudi’s?) and he decided to go out with an angry protest, and hopefully expose what had happened to him.

       More of a process of elimination.  Those things are considered stupid toys with an stupid level of failure, mostly used by try-hard idiots.  They also don't have a history of being reported on as involved with him crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, basically everyone knows that you can convert that same AR to actual full auto with a piece of metal the size of a grape.  Modifications which
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       get reported on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So an arms dealer advertising that they have bump stocks, something that you can legally get over the counter in a lot of places, comes across as strangely out of place.  Imagine this was about trafficking stolen cars, and someone bragged about how they had a 1997 Dodge Neon in stock.

       I semi-agree, it is very easy to get automatic weapons on the black market for around a thousand dollars for your basic Uzi, mach-20 similar smaller guns and 1500-2000 for rifles. However a lot of semi auto rifles do make it to black markets and are much more accurate and reliable as well as usually cheaper so that doesn't necessarily rule it out as possible. The thing is, that as far as I know or at least have read, he bought all of these guns legally through a store and  if he went to sell them illegally would lose money. So if this was a gun deal gone wrong it was more than likely going to be either him legally selling to somebody or possibly him trading these weapons to another collector to "trade up" it's doubtful that it was a black market deal though, as you don't sell legal weapons for street value or you'll be losing like 70-80% of your investment.

       Not always true. Basic $500 ARs were going for like $2k in the border towns between Texas and Mexico. And Arizona and Mexico.

       The more times a gun is used illegally the more the decrease in value. Those were probably stolen from the start, which also decreases the value. Cartels down south are making billions of dollars and they want every gun they can get their hands on. That's why they can pay the premium. I think Mexico has restrictions on caliber. I have heard that 38 super is the largest allowed, which is part of the reason it became the cartel's weapon of choice. That and they're pretty damn accurate and dependable.

       I'm not sure about the arms dealer theory either. Really hope the truth comes out at some point. It is odd his gf deleted all of her social media before his name was made public. Maybe he had contacted her after the fact. I'm a firm believer in Occam's Razor. Leads me to think the guy just flipped out, maybe had a terminal illness, pissed at the world and wanted to go out with a blast. Idk. But its hard for me to see an angle where the govt is involved. Other accomplishes, yea I can believe that. The email exchange is strange. Why would he be emailing himself those messages? Tyler Durden style multiple personalities? The comments about him not really knowing what he was doing make sense. He could have done a lot more damage without those bump stocks.

       Or, the FBI adjusted or withheld some additional electronic evidence to make him appear as we expected - an arms dealer. The email dialog almost made it sound like he thought the situation may have been a joke or a surreal situation that he found himself in.

       Has there ever been an explanation given for the Tropicana video with the dude being escorted out? It's so bizarre. But if that is the Crown Prince, where are his bodyguards? Can we identify the military people who are escorting him out by their uniforms?

       The rest of that story is pretty hard to believe and involves an enormous amount of reaching. I mean, the guy literally writes that the FBI, as part of the plot, "remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative."

       I've been thinking about this non-stop (if my comments are any indication of that) and here's what makes the most sense to me after taking in all of it--the Campos interview, the documents, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock was an arms dealer who'd been doing this for a very long time, which is why he was able to get 20+ firearms into that hotel room undetected. He thought this was a routine sale. The people buying the guns from him were Saudi goons who were intending to kill another Saudi staying in the Four Seasons. It makes sense this way. Say they bought guns outside of the hotel--how would they get in without being noticed? If they rent a room they'd have to interact with more people who'd see who they were. Why risk all of this when you can get the weapons from a known entity who does this for a living, and could subsequently be pegged with all of this after the fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock knew how hotel security worked. He also wouldn't have left a stairwell door open. The people he was selling to did, because the Four Seasons have express elevators separate from Mandalay Bay. That means the only way you can access the Four Seasons part of the building is via stairwells. Campos came up to check on the door. The bracketed door and the drilling were made up bullshit details--look at the specifics of that Ellen interview and you can see for yourself how impossible the logic of that part of his story is.
      </p>
      <p>
       ^ That detail is the most important detail of determining whether or not the festival shooting was planned in advance or something done after the fact. You're not going to risk alerting security if your intention is to shoot as many people as possible in a crowd below you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any number of things could have happened at this point--Campos could have knocked on Paddock's room door, his walkie could have alerted them, etc. Whatever it was, it let the people in Paddock's room know security was going to be coming into a room with them and 20+ guns set up and spread around. They were fucked. They shot Campos in hopes of killing him and getting away--Campos, still alive starts yelling on his walkie that shots were fired. At that point their options are even more limited. So they break the windows and shoot into the crowd below just long enough to try and create enough of a distraction to escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key to understanding the Four Seasons component is who owns it, and what happened to this person after the fact. Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, is one of the richest men in the world. He is the largest individual shareholder of Citigroup. He jointly owns Four Seasons, Inc. along with Bill Gates, which sits on top of Mandalay Bay as previously mentioned. He is also a member of the Saudi royal family--who have a long and storied history of conspiring against and assassinating each other for power. Talal's on the historically opposite side of the current King and current heir successor, King Salman and Prince Salman respectively. The Salman side has always been more interested in politics, while the side Talal is on has always been more interested in business. King Abdullah, who was business side died and Salman (politics side) became king.
      </p>
      <p>
       A month after Vegas, Talal was one of the 11 princes arrested in the anti-corruption purge Prince Salman/Salman Jr. implemented. Since King Salman's ascent to throne in 2015, Muhammad bin Nayef had been the appointed crown prince (meaning he becomes King when the King decides or can't be King). Nayef happens to be the Royal family member closest to American intelligence agencies. In July 2017, Nayef was removed from all of his positions and Salman Jr. was appointed crown prince/heir apparent. This was viewed as a huge shift and consolidation of power in the Saudi world. In October, the Vegas shooting happens, and then in November the corruption purge occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talal is currently imprisoned and Riyadh authorities are requesting $6 billion from him that he is currently refusing to pay. How things unfold from here will hopefully be enlightening.

       I have two questions with this theory. One, the assassins could have brought the weapons in suitcases, golf club carriers, etc. Hotels don't go through your luggage before you get to your room. Two, how the hell is shooting up an entire concert, which invites all of the FBI, SWAT, and LVMPD to your doorstep, to make your escape more preferable to just killing Paddock and walking out of the hotel?

       It didn't though--remember how long it took for authorities to get up to the hotel room? They were going to come anyway the moment Campos called in fired shots on his walkie and they knew it. Remember--Campos was shot first. That's what authorities said originally, and that is what they changed for seemingly no reason. The line of action re: firing into a crowd to create panic/confusion after the guard you tried to kill notified a whole hotel someone shot him is mildly plausible while also being impulsive/ill-thought out--both things together make way more sense to me than the official narrative, and align more with panicked people coming up with something to do very quickly. This thing was sloppy, stupid and done on a whim. It doesn't jive with a guy who meticulously planned out seemingly everything else but actually shooting these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: Your first point, it's been reported by news sources via an anonymous hotel employee that Paddock intentionally timed bringing in the guns with shift changes of hotel workers. Casino/hotel security is a lot more elevated than regular hotel security for a number of different reasons. As a result they find more things to be suspicious. Also keep in mind that there were over 20 large guns in that room--that's a lot of guns, and a lot of bags. Paddock bringing the guns in this way indicates that he was aware of this and acted accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other people being there also explains the stupidity of leaving a stairwell door ajar. Based on his sequence of behavior leading up to the shooting, Paddock was not stupid. These people were.

       ok so explain like i'm 5 - even if he is an arms dealer, how does that result in him opening fire on a crowd at a concert and killing people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, not trying to say he ISNT an arms dealer, i'm just trying to understand what happened. i haven't really kept up with the story so i most likely missed something.

       I've been doing some research today and it seems pretty clear that the dude being "escorted" out of Tropicana is a security guard at Tropicana. Just to clear up the whole "it's the Crown Prince!" thing.

       People need to focus less on Paddock as a man, but more as an identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was probably a straw buyer, being manipulated by Danley.
      </p>
      <p>
       Danley obviously is involved and has ties to the aggressive left.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is entirely possible she is the mastermind:
      </p>
      <p>
       The guns were sold to a group of people, whom brought them into Mandalay, in small quantities, which could explain why no video evidence is being shown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: It makes absolutely no sense to do a single, large, gun and ammo deal in Mandalay, unless you are a complete idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock had a comped room in Mandalay, then another room was booked for him on the 32nd floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money was wired to the Danley in Paddocks name, not necessarily by him (just as his identity was used for her get away to Philippines).

       Is it just me or is it weird as fuck that one of the 4 largest sponsors of the SALT Conference nowadays is a video game company with a relatively small output? Especially a publisher like Starbreeze who've had constant financial difficulties since its inception.

       Has there ever been an explanation given for the Tropicana video with the dude being escorted out? It's so bizarre. But if that is the Crown Prince, where are his bodyguards? Can we identify the military people who are escorting him out by their uniforms?
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of that story is pretty hard to believe and involves an enormous amount of reaching. I mean, the guy literally writes that the FBI, as part of the plot, "remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative."

       I think he's telling what his bosses told him to tell. You don't go on a daytime talk show instead of the news for truth, you do it for the lack of real journalists asking you questions.

       Im just questioning his SS, why he went to Mexico, him getting shot... I don't believe his story period. I question him being there. BTW he went on a daytime show to tell the wives the official narritave before the husbands heard about his story in the afternoon news. We're all adults here. Ellen is prodominatley watched by women.
