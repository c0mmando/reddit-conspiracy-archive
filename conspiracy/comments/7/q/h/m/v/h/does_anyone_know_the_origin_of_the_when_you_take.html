       This gets brought up every single time you talk about LSD with the ... I dunno, "uninitiated".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like it's a firm part of the common consciousness that this is some kind of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder where it comes from. Seems like one of these psyops to me, perhaps similar to what was posted about the attempt to discredit "conspiracy theorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I don't mind people criticizing something or not liking it. But when you talk to 100 people and every single one of them brings up the exact same argument with the exact same words ... something's up, right?

       Fun trivia, in Germany we have the "Say No To Drugs" campaign which also spreads pretty monstrous lies about LSD. They have their stands in the streets sometimes. Most people don't know they are literally Scientology.

       I think it might have its origins in some of the mythos surrounding the CIA experiments. There was an incident when they dosed an entire French hamlet in the 50's w/o their knowledge and there was something like a dozen deaths. If someone doesn't know they are on LSD and start tripping...they could honestly snap mentally, or at least think they have. I've never had a bad experience but I know that if I was unknowingly dosed and didn't know what tripping was...I would panic. And panic only plays into the LSD even more. Once you are in a bad trip, and don't know that you are, and also don't know how to get out, and the whole town is flipping shit and tripping balls...you've got a recipe for trouble and danger.

       I agree. Never having been on LSD and suddenly being plunged into that world out of nowhere ... that must be pretty horrible and confusing. I'm also glad you said "think they have" because that's what it comes down to I think. If they survive long enough and realize what actually happened, I think they're likely to recover without too much of a problem, unless it somehow made them aware of some repressed trauma. (which happened to me)

       Truly terrifying. And I think you make a good point about repressed memories. That's always something I advise first-timers. Make sure you have dealt with your demons, or are at least at peace with them, because the LSD
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       make you confront anything you've buried within yourself.

       Well, easier said than done. Before taking psychedelics I didn't even remotely imagine I actually HAD demons. Think of that. So while I've had trips that make bad trips look like a walk in the park ... at least it made me aware there was stuff I've yet to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ironic thing is that a few times on LSD, I just surrendered and everything was okay while the trip lasted, but as the effects wore off, it became bad again. Though in hindsight, it's possible that the "surrender" was actually just me giving in to some defense mechanism. Not entirely sure, have not figured that mystery out as of yet.

       It's a weird drug for sure. Definitely a lot of fun, but not something I recommend anyone take lightly. You make a good point that not everyone will
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       there are things they have to confront, but that's also one of the "perks" I suppose of LSD. It will show you what is really going on up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the point about surrender and the issues getting worse as the LSD wore off is also something I've thought about, though in a different way. I explain it to people that when you trip on LSD, you don't want to do it every day. It changes you as a person, even just one trip. But this can be for the better. It's not good to trip constantly, because you aren't able to essentially "come down", and bring what you learned while on LSD back to apply to practical reality. Even if that means your own observations of your personal demons.

       To be fair though, I don't feel like LSD is something you can get addicted to. I've never felt the urge to take another dose just after the first one wore off. Felt more like I wanted to process what I've seen for a week or two.

       Same for me on both counts. But I have known a couple of people that have tried the whole "tripping every day" thing. It definitely changed them...they end up in a state where they never quite seem "themselves" anymore. Even though they aren't chemically tripping in their brain, they are permanently locked within that sort of tripping mentality. Which I don't think is useful or good for the long term.

       On the other hand, you could argue they don't really care or feel bad about being in that state, so maybe it is what they wanted anyway. Who is to judge?

       I could see a possible scenario where someone decides to use LSD as their escape from their bad situation in life without thinking about the long term psychological repercussions. But on the whole I think you are right, just spitballin'.

       Would that work tho? As you said, LSD only amplifies all issues you may have. It's not really much of an escape drug unless your life is cool anyway.

       True. All said it's not the best drug for "escapism" unless, as you said, you aren't really faced with that many issues other than the ones you decide to make into problems for yourself.

       I believe I've heard you have to more or less double the dose the next day. Seems to me this comes from either someone in Motley Crue or Ozzy Osborne, and of course any of them would be among the most credible sources on Earth, not for most things, but certainly about overdoing it on drugs.

       Its another thing all together to have no idea what LSD even is, what tripping is, having no clue that its even a thing and then someone dosing you with a heroic amount without your knowledge.  All while everyone around you is also freaking the fuck out.

       Snopes is a shit website.  People do stupid shit on acid because acid is a powerful drug.  The more you take the more powerful it is and its pretty much impossible to tell how strong of a dose you have in your hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       One hit of acid, typically on a tiny square of blotter paper could actually be 4 hits of acid on the same size paper, or it could just be a piece of paper with no LSD on it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that you have people making this shit and some of them are good chemists and others not so much.  Some know how to properly measure a dose and some don't.  Some care about the drug and the experience and the customer. Some just want to make money like a heroin dealer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one girl snopes is talking about is one story they could call into question or debunk.  Anyone who has been around people doing LSD or who has done it themselves for a significant (beyond initial experimentation) knows that people's minds are easily pushed into insanity.  All it takes is a super stressful situation or a bad hit of acid to send you WAAAAAAY over the edge.  Its important that you don't drop a couple hits of acid for your first time when you know your going to be in a crowded situation with no hope of retreat.  I'm not saying that going to Las Vegas on acid is always an awful idea but you better damn well know what you're getting into before you try that stunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore I feel like mushrooms are much safer and they certainly are more forgiving if you eat too much.  My personal advice would be stay the fuck away from LSD and if you want an experience in that realm, Do mushrooms because they are easier on your mind or do DMT because it doesn't last for hours on end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going on a trip is strange thing.  One time you might love it and never want it to end, the next time you might spend the night praying for it all to be over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter with caution, tread lightly and don't wing it until you understand the drug.

       The first time or two you should also have a "guide", someone who has experience with hallucinogenics who can steer you back if things go bad.  This saved my ass the first time I took LSD.

       It doesn't matter, in DMT there is
       <strong>
        no time
       </strong>
       , so it doesn't matter if you are 5 minutes or 12 hours on a trip.

       Mushrooms are not safer, there is now way (unless your a chemist) to know the strength of the trip, I've had a mate who has had acid a good few times, tried mushrooms and the trip was way more intense. Needless to say he hasn't taken mushrooms again.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone wants to know a safer way to try acid without taking any smoke some salvia divinorum, get the strongest you can and smoke it pure through a pipe, it's 100% legal and only lasts 10 minutes and is the closest you'll get to tripping without taking acid or mushrooms. If you do, make sure you have a friend with you. It only lasts 10 mins but it's an experience!

       Sorry, but I think this is bad advice and no one should listen to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've done mushrooms many times and never had anything but a spectacularly awesome time. Everyone should do mushrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've done acid a bunch of times and had one time where I wasn't in a terrific place for a brief time, maybe an hour or two, and the rest was pretty great. Every other trip, I had an awesome time as well pretty much start to finish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've watched videos of people on salvia and read about it and it seems like it's way too easy to do too much, and apparently some people can experience a break from reality they never fully recover from. I would never even think about trying this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're nervous about this stuff, do half a gram of shrooms and take it from there.

       I watched it and it’s really fucking good. I highly recommend it to everyone here and it will quickly erode any last trust you had of the federal government. I was typically skeptical of most government “conspiracies” but after watching wormwood and doing a little more research into the topic I can honestly say I don’t believe a fucking word of any official narrative without significant supporting evidence.

       I had always believed the he-jumped story, and it was believable enough. Imagine that you had been dosed without your knowledge. You would think that you were going crazy. But, the head wound was consistent with the CIA method of "dropping" so I guess it could be that also. We know they will kill anyone if they want to.

       The CIA beat him and threw him out of the 13th story of a hotel because he expressed unease and guilt to his colleagues over Operation Paperclip/MK Ultra experiments he witnessed and indirectly participated in. Some of these experiments tested the use of LSD as a sort of “truth serum” and “brainwashing” agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       They alleged that he committed suicide but a recent exhumation demonstrated evidence of death due to homicide.

       I mean tbh, I think the exact origin came from a group of old hippies back in the day while they tripped nuts and all decided to meditate, or slowing their thoughts, when they achieved something that's entirely too hard to put into words (ie: Breaking through the "wall" on DMT) they realized they were flying through dimensions lol. Over time though, it kind of just became about those people who would actually try to fly for whatever dumb reason they were influenced by. Reminds me of a meme lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr: Probably wasn't a psyop at first, definitely is manipulated to some extent now.

       If you have ever taken LSD you are aware that reality can skew, movements, shapes, "melting" of things you see, simply due to more information coming in than you're used to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our brains are very good at filtering out too much information, presented with a chemical which prevents that from happening your brain tries to make sense of the incomming information, and much like dreaming it just fills in the gaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that you can fly, that you are able to lift off is entirely plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though in my lifetime it has always been "guy thinks he can fly on PCP, jumps out of window, breaks both legs, cops chase as he is running on broken legs, takes a few shots and finally falls dead after supermanning against the cops".
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never heard the LSD mythos of jumping out a window.
      </p>
      <p>
       LSD has always been associated with hippies and trippy posters for me.

       LSD and pcp are

       the same drug. It is a totally different drug at the chemical level.

       I don't think they actually think they can fly... they just don't even understand the concept of gravity or height or windows or even where they are at the time... I doubt anyone has ever pulled an "up, up, and away!"... but LSD can fuxxor you up so bad you really have no idea where you are or what you are doing.

      <p>
       The Superman cliche is just an easy way to get that point across.

       Mind-altering drugs can make a person confused and scared. A bad trip on a potent dose of a powerful hallucinogen could absolutely lead a person to becoming confused and doing something like jumping off of a building. Confusion and fear combined with delusions and hallucinations can lead a person to kill themselves even if they wouldn't have intended to if sober. This possibility for a bad experience is why people who do hallucinogens usually advocate using a "trip sitter", someone trustworthy who can watch over and make sure the person tripping doesn't do anything dangerous or destructive.

       There was a cheesy cop drama in the 70s. Harry-O. Or was it Ironside.  Either way an early episode had a guy on PCP go "I can fly" and jumped out the window. They used the clip in the intro and it became a trope then.

       My friend once took 7 grams of dried pyschedellic mushrooms.  Normal is 2-3 grams a trip.  He was soo out of it he tried jumping off his balcony and his buddy had to hold him down from jumping.  Afterwards he said 7 grams at once was a horrible idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       It depends on the person.  I had another friend who would turn into a three year old and just sit down where ever she was.  I had to hold her hand and guide her on where to go.  If I stopped she would just sit down.

       TL;DR Plausible if a ludicrous amount is taken.  Like 10-20 hits maybe?  Rather than one to three.

       It almost certainly originated from the death of Frank Olson, who allegedly "jumped" or "fell" out of a window a few days after being surreptitiously fed LSD by the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many levels of disinfo here though. First, there's never been another documented case of someone jumping out of a window while on LSD because they thought they could fly. It's just good anti-LSD propaganda. Second, it's likely now that Frank Olson was never even dosed with LSD, and instead the CIA made that up because it was a better story than what really happened (which is pretty alarming, that the CIA thought that admitting they had secretly dosed an American citizen with LSD, resulting in his death, was
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       for the CIA than telling the truth).

       Probably Art Linkletters daughter.
Or that CIA biological warfare scientist that was dosed unknowingly many times - Frank Olson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting events..Diane Linkletter and Frank Olson were imo most likely murdered. The LSD window jumping suicide was a cover up.

       Actually this was very similar to the death of Diane Linkletter who committed suicide and who's death was attributed to LSD use by her father Art Linkletter.

       Similarly, if you watch the show Wormwood on netflix, it tells the story of a government scientist who fell out a window and his death was ruled a suicide while MK Ultra was going through on.

       I live on central Pennsylvania and when I was in school a guy would annually make a visit to our school to do a special presentation on drugs.. he was on LSD and did jump out of a window and now is paralyzed from the waist down.

       Dianne Linkleter: At 9 a.m., on October 4, 1969, Linkletter jumped out of a window of her sixth-floor apartment at the Shoreham Towers in West Hollywood, California. She was first taken to Hollywood Receiving Hospital, and then to Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center where she died of her injuries sustained in the fall.[4] Her death was widely reported in the media at the time. Her father blamed her death on drug use, specifically LSD.[5]

       My friends and I were all told this exact "fact" by a cop who came to talk to us about drugs over 30 years ago, but I don't think it was LSD, I think it was PCP/Angel Dust.

       For first timers: having a guide is probably the most important tip in addition to being in a good/chill environment, having the right music and a good amount of supplies such as water, munchies, etc.
