        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anybody ever think that maybe the Clintons might be the good guys, and TPTB led us to believe they were our opposition? Consider this: during Bills presidency, he pushed for disclosure of the ET presence and hidden tech. His NWO speech was actually talking about a world with the hidden tech where we can access zero point energy and have flying saucers and shit. TPTB don’t want this, so they create scandal after scandal to drag down the Clintons. I mean obviously the Clintons were as dirty as the come, but you have to be dirty to play at this game. And if you look at the scandals, (besides Monica Lewinsky, which was just Bill gettin a quick nut and nothing as bad as they made it seem) they mostly have to do with finances and don’t seem like anything overly crazy. Not super knowledgeable about this though so this may not be so true. </p>

<p>Idk I was always a Clinton hater, but now I’m beginning to realize it’s possible that I bought into TPTB’s subversion and they’re actually not so bad. Thoughts??</p>

<p>Edit: the fact that so many of you immediately say “no it’s not possible at all, no chance they could ever be good” kinda proves my point even more because you won’t even consider the possibility that we played right into TPTB’s hands. I agree with most of you that it’s a very unlikely scenario, but it is still a possibility so it should be discussed </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like to think in black and white. It makes the world easier to understand. In reality, the Clintons have done some good things and some bad things. I tend to think that the bad things outweigh the good, so I don&#39;t support them. Indeed, I think Bill Clinton&#39;s crime policies in the 90s are some of the worst this country has seen. But by no means do I think the Clintons are pure evil. Very, very few people are pure evil. </p>

<p>The Clintons are pure evil, and any honest look at the “ET disclosure” scene is like lifting a large rock up to examine what’s underneath. Just... all kinds of weird, filthy,disgusting organisms down there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the difference between Trump and Clinton. Check out the replies here and it’s clear that no one is under any impression that the Clintons are out for the good of the common folk. Contrast that to Trump, who most of his loyal supporters believe is anything from Captain America to Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>And let’s be honest, at this point Hillary already lost and Bill is no longer in office either. At this point it comes down to whether you are a realist or you think Trump can do absolutely no wrong, and there are a surprising number of people who think Trump can legitimately do no wrong. Suppose that’s to be expected though with the level of astroturfing going on here straight out of T_D and Cambridge Analytica.</p>

<p>People who are on our side don&#39;t create illegal home brew servers in their basements in order to get around FOIA laws and they don&#39;t send CIA field agents into secret outposts in Libya where massive arms deals are going on under the cover of ambassadorships.

<p>They don&#39;t hire Parkinson&#39;s specialists named Odaquan Okunola to run around behind them holding diazapam injectors at all times and pretend he&#39;s a secret service agent.</p>
