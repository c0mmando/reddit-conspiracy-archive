<p>Guess how many of them have been arrested in the last 20 years? </p>

<p>Zero.</p>

<p>Trump is president (swamp drainer) and still 0 high ranking officials have been arrested. Not even officially indited yet...</p>

<p>Stop focusing on those Elites. Start local. Media rarely/doesn’t talk about corrupt local mayors, judges, sheriffs, school board directors, police officers, etc. These are the people who are the elites in community and control your life directly. These people are the real elites that impact your life everyday.</p>

<p>Climb the latter, stop trying to skip steps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually OP you are spot on!</p>

<p>I&#39;m Aussie and watch this circus from afar, and at first I wasn&#39;t sure wtf to think about Trump&#39;s presidential run ... but fuck Hitlary, she&#39;s Evil and Trump won! fucking hell! And he was banging on about &quot;draining the swamp&quot; whatever the fuck that meant!?</p>

<p>Now I know what he was on about AND what he&#39;s trying to do now, and he&#39;s not just One guy figuring all this shit out, he&#39;s cleverly built (and &quot;been given&quot; as he&#39;s got high level support from the military) a team around him that&#39;s capable of &quot;draining the bloody swamp&quot;!</p>

<p>And why would he bother? He&#39;s a crazy Patriot who doesn&#39;t want his grandkids dealing with the crap that&#39;s <em>already</em> on their table! He&#39;s also a narcissist who&#39;d Love to have such an amazing legacy as to be known as The POTUS who got rid of more corruption and other fucked up shit than any other ever did.</p>

<p>And so long as he does &#39;drain the swamp&#39; and smartens up about drugs, IDGAF what else he does, IF he and his team can deal with these people effectively!</p>

<p>BUT, my friend, look around you. What&#39;s going on in Hollywood at the moment? Exactly the kind of people you&#39;re talking about are being exposed and that&#39;s just a start.</p>

<p>In Australia, the Pope&#39;s right hand Archbishop is about to go on trial for pedophilia charges <em>that will most likely</em> see him be imprisoned!   Shit&#39;s getting real <em>although</em> &quot;they&#39;re&quot; doing their best to keep all the shit &quot;hush hush&quot; and on the QT!</p>

<p>BUT DON&#39;T FORGET, according to Sun Tzu and The Art of War</p>

<p><em>the best way</em> to &quot;beat your enemy&quot; in not to fight them at all&quot;</p>

<p>You want to put them in the position where <em>they can not win the battle</em> to begin with, so they surrender&quot; </p>

<p>THINK ABOUT THIS: Trump says &quot;they KNOW IT ALL&quot; which sounds to me like a guy who&#39;s used to playing games with the Mafia has got his hands on The.Most.Incriminating.Evidence. you can get on most of The Most Powerful people on the planet ... And he&#39;s using it like a Pro and the once &#39;Captains of Industry&#39; are beginning to shit themselves accordingly as he TELLS THEM &quot;you&#39;re <em>either going to DO</em> THIS, Or, we&#39;re going to <em>DO THIS!</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s called &quot;making them an offer they can&#39;t refuse&quot;</p>

<p>The people &quot;we&quot; the public REALLY want to see &quot;gone&quot; never to be able to do what they&#39;ve done in the past --- is an extremely idealistic dream BUT it IS possible to do IF .... and here&#39;s the rub, BUT IT&quot;S SO VERY IMPORTANT!</p>

<p>A Lot of the <em>worst</em> players, people who&#39;s names we&#39;ve never heard but they make up the &#39;pyramid&#39; of corruption this group thrived on.</p>

<p>IF we <em>really want them to go</em>, then getting them to <em>chose to resign</em> is the Ultimate win as it&#39;s fast And efficient, </p>

<p>Trying to &quot;lock them up&quot; becoz they broke some laws would take YEARS to get a conviction, MUCH BETTER to blackmail them.</p>

<p>I&#39;d bet 80%+ of the &#39;cabal&#39; have some <em>nasty shit</em> to hide BUT me thinks that <em>most of it</em> has found it&#39;s way into DT and Co&#39;s hands and they&#39;ve allied themselves with a group of other &#39;heads of state&#39; in using this &quot;information&quot; to <em>effect</em> things like the arrest of half the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, coincidentally &quot;the half that <em>bankrolled the Clintons</em> et al&quot; ... the &#39;bad actors&#39; who&#39;d rather face losing billions than have the sex tape of <em>them and their mates</em> drinking and taking LOTS of drugs whist having &quot;sexy times&quot; with camels and other things/people&quot;</p>

<p>You get The Noose for that shit in the KSA so no wonder these dudes have <em>accepted</em>  &#39;house arrest&#39; in a 5 star hotel And <em>having ALL their money/funds Frozen!</em> ... so they can&#39;t &#39;finance any more CF&#39;s and pal&#39;s  shennanigans ... a MAJOR coup for Team America!</p>

<p>Like Q said, <em>over</em> 80% <em>won&#39;t be shown/talked about in the (esp MS) media</em> as it&#39;s important to be able to &quot;let these cowards creeps away quietly&quot; BUT SO long as they&#39;re GONE is what really matters! </p>

<p>Let the fuckers find an expensive rock to hide under .. as long as they GTFO! </p>

<p>But so what? I reckon give it a few years and the recipients of the 9000 &quot;sealed indictments&quot; will be fairly well known, or dead or dying, in shame!</p>

<p>fuck yeah!</p>

Have each state separate so people can navigate it easy and pay people to follow cops and politicians around. Don&#39;t allow the story unless they have the facts to back it up and keep it clean no stories from when they were kids or shit like such and such is gay or a lesbian or cheating on there spouse.</p>

<p>I would like a news source that only focused on what type of official they are. One that praise&#39;s the cops and politicians in the community that are doing good for the people. One that shows fact based corruption of cops and politicians. I think it would put an end to this shit show. If people had a trustworthy news source and we compiled unbiased data on each politicians and put it all in one place were the average person could see what type of person there voting for I believe it could change America for the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to address solutions to stopping elites in the thread I created yesterday... The biggest difference, I am tackling the ROOT PROBLEM of our oppression, and it is Competition through using a Currency.</p>

<p>I applaud peoples interest in solving the problem, but I feel we need direction and a debate on what is actually causing the problems and again.. how to fix the root problem, not the symptom of the problem.  If you are being poisoned by the same water source, do you try to take medicines to offset the symptoms caused by the poisoned water, or do you simply find a new water source that you can confirm is not poisoned?</p>

<p>Again, if you just address the symptom and not the root cause of the problem, you will always be chasing your own tail.  You might end up replacing your local politiions and power players, but as long as we are always competing against our elites, they will always just end up using the system against us by replacing Old corrupt players with New corrupt players-Chasing your own tail, indefinitely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about rarely. I can think of shows like Jon Oliver talking about these issues and every other sociological problem out there, making some plea about change, whilst not touching the players that pull the string to begin with.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say you&#39;ll still have the higher elite themselves accomodating a machine that motivates lower level corruption to begin. The system that perpetuates it is still there, albeit not a bad idea to focus on local corruption generally for overall awareness maybe, but make it wholesome. Call out the entire construct. Somehow it sounds like the status quo. It&#39;s not like people haven&#39;t been doing such. Isn&#39;t this how it has been working for quite some time?</p>

<p>While whichever judge, sheriff or director are exposed and hung out to dry, they&#39;ll, that is high officials and obligarchs still operate outside the spotlight and some other opportnist will merely replace said judge, director becasue some top brass won&#39;t tackle it sufficiently?</p>

<p>I certainly wouldn&#39;t turn a blind eye. It looks like something that has to be rooted out altogether.</p>

<p>You focus on solely tackling it locally you might just not make swift progress and the higher class of elite still have leeway to pull strings, and the general conception will be an issue of individual greed, rather than a corrupt culture of politicans that leep it operational to begin with.</p>
