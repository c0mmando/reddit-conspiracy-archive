        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know about the rest of my fellow free thinkers, but following topics on the political climate <em>-Q, Clintons, Trump, Roths, coups, Iran, DPRK, war, (you get the rest)-</em> has given me anxiety I&#39;ve never felt before.  I&#39;ve been feeling like we&#39;re all in some impending doom; that life as we know it could fundamentally change overnight.</p>

<p>I started believing everything being said disregarding my own rational thinking.  Events around me have become part of this narrative only seeming to prove what I was reading here was real.</p>

<p>I started prepping: Guns, Ammo, Generator, Gas, Batteries, Survival Tools, Canned Food, Water, Bug-out Bags, Medicine, Routes, etc, etc...  all the while dragging my family into my little fantasy of what I believed. I&#39;ve also been losing sleep paying less attention to my business than I should.  I&#39;d Argue politics straining my marriage.  Without continuing on about it, things were not headed in a positive direction until today.</p>

<p>While making my general rounds over reddit, I&#39;d stop and read comments on the latest happenings around the World.  Something was different this time.  Instead of taking a side in these arguments, I began to wonder &quot;Why are we all fighting one another?  What difference is it going to make?  If I prove a point, is it really going to change anything?&quot;... no it won&#39;t.</p>

<p>I realized that if I really believed the theories I took as true were to actually happen, then there is NO amount of prepping I can do to save my family.  Am I really heading for the mountains family in tow if there were a political assassination?  No.  If bombs drop tomorrow, why would I want to survive though <em>(even though I know it wouldn&#39;t happen like this)</em> a post apocalyptic World Fallout style?  An example of my thought process was one night there was a blackout in my city and I thought we might be under attack by some EMP weapon.  <em>(I am cringing as I&#39;m reflecting)</em></p>

<p>So my point is this.  Quitting reddit for a while is not going to be easy, but I have to do it.  This sub -r/conspiracy- has been my number one sub on reddit; one I visit four or five times a day.  But if any of my fellow free thinkers feel anxiety over what they&#39;re reading, then join me.  Unplug from media, and give it a break for a while.</p>

<p>Check out Owen Benjamin&#39;s &#39;Peace Will Never Go Viral&#39; video on YouTube. It&#39;s pretty old but I think it&#39;ll help someone feeling how you feel now. It helped me feel better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to pay attention to and believe in all but the most far-fetched conspiracy theories  and i too had a bug out bag fulla guns and ammo and basic necessities. I must have watched several hundred YouTube videos and checked out conspiracy sites, and then it hit me.</p>

<p>Even if all this shit is true, what can I do about it? I mean if there is some giant shadow government doing things like 9/11, what in the world can a little person like me do about it, and what good does it do to know about any of it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a waste of time, imo. I have a life to live, and if the fucking Illuminati exists, what does that have to do with me?</p>

<p>So fuck it. I don&#39;t care anymore. And I am 100% more happy and have a lot more time available to spend on the things that really do matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well OP I&#39;d suggest that you keep that old saying- <em>The more things change, the more they remain the same.</em> firmly in mind.</p>

<p>Nothing ever happens all at once but in fits and starts and more importantly there are always unseen counter-reactions and lateral shifts that take place as a result that keep even the best laid plans from ever turning out as predicted.</p>

<p>If anything the grasp of so-called &quot;Powers That Be&quot; has exceeded their reach. Their high crimes against the common people have become so extensive and all-pervasive it&#39;s no longer possible to hide them and it&#39;s no longer possible for anyone to simply ignore or brush them off, either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>please dont misunderstand me but I think You are in a cyclejerk spiral. all Your views and opinions turn arround the topic when the big collapse will come and how to survive it. but whats about a car fatal accident or any other unforseen death? I think that an Apocalypse has sonething mystical/heroic epical but on the NET side, it doesnt differ that much from Your own death. both are the end. There must be more to it, in order to conentrate so much on the worlds end and invest ammounts of money and time to think. I catched myself to lean to that idea everytime my life was shitty(i.e. lack of goals, no happiness and fullfillment). I dont know what &quot;attracts&quot; other people to that idea though but anyhow no matter if Youre convinced about the Apocalypse or not, some are too far off the balance and if You want to do it professional and reasonably, IMO You have to enjoy Your life, take care about Your job, Family&amp;Friends AND Your retirement.</p>
