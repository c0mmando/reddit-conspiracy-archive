<p>Altruism doesn&#39;t exist, as doing good deeds gives you a serotonin rush, encouraging more good deeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, which is why I said &quot;I do agree that TPTB probably don&#39;t see themselves as evil and I&#39;m sure that they have some sort of justification for their deeds, but it&#39;s hard to not despise them from an outsider&#39;s perspective.&quot;</p>

<p>I agree that morals are relative in most cases, but it would be insane to deny that evolution has pre-programmed some very fundamental sense of good or bad into us. For example: murder reduces group cohesion and thus your hunter-gatherer tribe&#39;s chance of survival, which is why almost everyone who isn&#39;t drunk with power is apalled by it. I think that it is far to judge TPTB by these near-universal standards.</p>

We are encouraged though ego to only see the separation, but the connection is where the sublime resides, and where we realise our true potential as part of that Grand Divinity.

    <div class="md"><p>You carry so much hate and cynicysm around. How&#39;s that &quot;polarity experiment&quot; working out for you?</p>

<p>You&#39;re confusing Christians and Catholics. Big difference.</p>

<p>The papacy has tortured and killed more Christians than arguably any other entity. In fact, the early Protestants saw it as the Antichrist system spoken of in the Bible. I agree. </p>

<p>Some points that clearly divide Catholics from biblical teaching:</p>

<p>The absolution of sins is something only God/Jesus can do. Not men. Especially perverts. This is biblical definition of blasphemy. Man as God.</p>

<p>The title of the pope, translates to &quot;in the place of Christ.&quot; Antichrist in the original text, Greek, means the same. This title is biblical blasphemy. Man as God.</p>

<p>Priest call themselves &quot;father&quot;, while Jesus said &quot;may no man be called father but me.&quot; Again blasphemy. Man as God.</p>

<p>Gnostic teaching, just like the beginning comment of this thread, teaches man as divine. Man as God. There is no &quot;balancing&quot; good and evil, nor is there man united as one without Jesus. </p>

<p>I expect a cynical angry response. Prove me wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funnily enough the bible was compiled by Catholics,not to say that they follow it. (I know that much as a former Catholic myself.) Which formed the basis of ALL Christian sects, so yeah they are the same. You may not agree with the way they handled and interpret the scriptures(again neither do I) but they are still considered Christian. And yes I agree that only God can wipe your slate clean,but you can help yourself by not repeating the actions that led to you needing it in the first place.</p>

<p>Idk what to say about asceticism, I think it&#39;s a bit weird and not my thing, but some people feel a &quot;calling&quot; to do it. Maybe if it&#39;s wrong they can learn in the apophatic sense. Never heard of Gnostics specifically becoming pedophiles, but I guess that would justify what  happened to alot of them. Reap what ya sow and all that.</p>

<p>Jesus never said he was the father, how could he be the Son of God then?  Matthew 23:9-&quot;And do not call anyone on earth &#39;father,&#39; for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.&quot; last time I checked Jesus walked the Earth, well supposedly did. Also John 20:17 &quot;Jesus said unto her, “Touch Me not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say unto them, ‘I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.’”&quot; Again how can he ascend to be one with the Father if he IS the Father? Did you even read the Bible I&#39;m wondering at this point?</p>

<p>Man as God, well here&#39;s another Bible quote for ya: Psalms 82:6-&quot;I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High&quot;
What my personal interpretation is that I am not the creator God obviously, anymore than a single cell in my body is me. But those cells compose my body, just like everything you can sense is part of the great body of God itself. Just like in any individuals body the parts may work together and in harmony, or war and become cancerous. May be a rough interpretation but I am still working on it. Man IS of divine nature, but I think we have regressed or lost sight of it, taking on grosser forms and attitudes. For what reason? I don&#39;t know, just my theory. I do believe that this is a test though like the original commenter said, to see if you deserve to become reunited with God or not. If not now then you will one way or another, nothing is wasted. Nor can it be. To paraphrase Manly P. Hall &quot;In the long run everyone is redeemed, but some find the run too long.&quot;. </p>

<p>So was that angry and cynical enough for ya?  What honestly chapped my ass to begin with was your dismissal of the original comment with nothing to back it up with. No counter-point, no nothing just &quot;bunk&quot;. Hell you didn&#39;t even use any bible verses to back up your reply to me, assuming I haven&#39;t heard the scriptures a billion times at church and reading it at home. So I&#39;ll ttyl peace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are very very very far from the same. Inception does not dictate doctrine. To be considered Christian you must uphold the teaching of Christ, dictated through the apostles. Statutes to &quot;saints&quot; is a pagan practice. Deification of Mary is absurd. &quot;What have thou to do with me woman?&quot; This is the cloaking of Babylonian &quot;father mother child&quot; in Christianity.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye are gods&quot; does not mean what you think it means. He is referring to the Divine council established by God, and comprised of the other Sons of God, the watchers. This is alluded to in Psalms. Before you get stuck on Jesus being &quot;the only begotten Son&quot; you have to know that &quot;only begotten&quot; is bad translation from the ancient Greek. It should say &quot;unique, or, one of a kind.&quot; This was only discovered 100 years ago, so no fault on the translators.</p>

<p>While yes &quot;Catholics&quot; originally comprised the scriptures, remember it was in Latin, and not native tongues. This was done so that the general population could not read it, and the church could make the scripture &quot;say&quot; whatever they wanted. The translation into the native tongues of the population is a huge piece of the pie that sparked the Protestant movement. People saw that the abilities the pope seized were not biblical. To combat this, the church created the version still uses today, the Vulgate, as opposed to the textus receptus we read as the KJV. </p>

<p>Jesus was God in the flesh, not just a man. The unique Son of God, incarnated as the Son of Man. What makes him unique is that he IS God, as a figurehead presiding over the Divine Council. Your ignorance of this is not uncommon. Your allusion to my not reading the Bible shows how little you know about it and your attack on my character noted. </p>

<p>John 10:30 &quot;I and the father are one.&quot;</p>

<p>Let God speak the truth, and every man be a liar</p>

<p>Divinity of man? <a href="http://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Depravity-Of-Man">I think not.</a></p>

<p>I find it comical you quote a Masonic Luciferian. No need to address how far you&#39;ve drifted from truth.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d have asked why I thought that the post was bunk, instead of posting a cynical sarcastic jerk off comment, perhaps this conversation would be friendlier. But that&#39;s the spirit behind the beliefs you currently hold, and it slips out unawares. I know, because I was once the same. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll pray you <strong>feel</strong> the errors in that doctrine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it comical when people insult Manly Hall, if he is a mason, then Obama has 11 law degrees lol. He was made an HONORARY mason for his great work &quot;The Secret Teachings of All Ages&quot; among other notable contributions to esoteric studies and humanity as a whole. Listen to his hundreds of free lectures online, very insightful and down to Earth. Anybody could better themselves if they apply what he taught. It&#39;s done wonders in my own life.</p>

<p>John 10:30-He goes on to say this John 10:34-Jesus answered them, &quot;Is it not written in your Law, &#39;I have said you are &quot;gods&quot;&#39;? Those passages further illustrate my point, he is not separated from divinity and neither are we. The difference being he knew it and acted accordingly, most of us fall short of that. Also note that Jesus once again never called himself the Father he said he is ONE with him, big distinction. Another side note here is why did he sort of back track in John 20:17? If he is already one then why is he saying he hasn&#39;t ascended? Something to think about I think. We are given free will to either align with the ways of God or create a hell for ourselves right here, Jesus chose the former in aligning with the Fathers wishes as opposed to the latter which most of us choose. Genesis 1-27 if you want go way back:&quot;So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.&quot; If I have human parents then that makes me human, and if humanity has a divine Father then we must be divine. We may not act it but we are, same with everything else that we sense and beyond. Not all of it&#39;s good, but I believe it was St. Augustine of all people who said&quot;When you touch God you touch the devil as well.&quot; Which leads me more and more to believe this is a test of sorts, you fail you take it again. Also check into Faust the old tale of the fall of man and his redemption, powerful stuff. (Also the Book of Job one of the more interesting books imho)</p>

<p>With the quote from psalms what do you mean watchers? This isn&#39;t a JV thing is it?What sort of Divine Council?</p>

<p>Sorry I&#39;m reversing order but the jab at Manly Hall pissed me off having read alot of his work and listened to hundreds of hours of his lectures.He was more knowledgeable on these subjects than either of us combined,and respected all religious creeds and peoples. Probably the wisest man of the 20th century in my opinion.</p>

<p>Anywho alot of common Christian practice was borrowed from older philosophies and religions (yes even pagan ones), I don&#39;t see it changing anytime soon,with a new sect being formed daily. Seeing as the Roman Empire helped spur Christianity&#39;s growth you should hardly be surprised considering they were fairly tolerant of other faiths up until Constantine. Of course religions the world over borrowed from each other, Christianity is far from unique it&#39;s just another variation on a theme.  Like you said above let God speak truth and every man be a liar, these similar themes crop up from India to Sumer to Native Americans to who knows where and it just shows that God speaks to all regardless of dogma. It&#39;s just interpreted differently because of the language and cultural barriers that we have. I mean people even now will argue over which translation was right or wrong and everyone is a Greek, Aramaic or Sanskrit scholar.  Not too familiar with Babylonian theology, so I&#39;ll cede the point.</p>

<p>The Catholic church did nothing new in regards to keeping the sacred from the profane, they believed that only the initiated should be allowed to read and interpret the scriptures. They had &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; dialects, one for the clergy and one for the marketplace. Egyptians,Zoroastrians, Hindus and Sumerians did the same, though few could read even the common language back then. I personally have no problem with the concept, looking at all the fundamentalist religions today. However that privilege was very much abused obviously, and has led to many of the problems we still deal with now as far as religious conflicts go. </p>

<p>Also yeah I was an asshole, you want to dismiss something explain why or don&#39;t comment. Despite the fact we&#39;re arguing theology this is still r/conspiracy, you either put up or shutup. I&#39;ve seen so many people pull this shit, say &quot;cuz Jesus&quot; and leave without much else. Then act like they&#39;re a persecuted minority but belonging to the worlds largest religious group. Btw here&#39;s a fun bible verse from King James(which Protestants love for some reason despite it being commissioned by a king being advised by John Dee, rumored to be a black magician,nothing could be tampered and twisted here amirite?) that pretty much destroys almost all of the dogma surrounding Christianity as a whole if you pay attention. Matthew 24:5-&quot;For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.&quot; Well despite all that I&#39;m rather enjoying myself,so rare to talk to people about this stuff. Sorry for being a dick earlier,have a good night.</p>

I can sum up Mr. Halls teachings very quickly; be honest, be patient, think of others and respect/help them out when necessary, if you have a job work hard and don&#39;t steal from your employer by being lazy or shoddy your work, respect others religious creeds and understand they are trying to worship the divine in their own way(not talking satanists here, or any other &quot;faith&quot; that preaches selfishness) even if you don&#39;t necessarily hold those beliefs, understand that there is a divine power and it&#39;s not all about you, I could go on but you get the picture. He considered the greatest sin to be selfishness, and he practiced what he preached by only charging a dollar for a 1 1/2-2 hour lecture, and freely counseled anybody who needed his help when could have easily charged far more for his services. He was more Christian than most pastors, and people smear him all the time without bothering to read and listen to what he had to say. I cannot speak for Blavatsky as I have yet to really look at her works, though I have heard she freely gave information and guidance to those who sought it. Here are a couple of Hall&#39;s lectures for you to check out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch the Dr. He will explain it better and more accurately than I can. He gives no opinions, only states facts. As a scholar should. One of the reasons I love his lectures. People commenting are giving biased opinions based on personal beliefs ingrained by people in their lives who were taught the same. This man learned ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, then went straight to the textual source. I, like most people, have biases and opinions that may cloud or inaccurately represent the truth. While I&#39;m sure he has opinions as well, he leaves them out professionally.</p>

<p>When Hall/Blavatsky wrote their &quot;secret&quot; books respective to when they began teaching the jargon is of no importance.</p>

<p>All the other &quot;gods&quot; mankind knows about, aside from YHWH, we were never meant to see as gods. Do you know the story of the watchers? The other sons of God who came to the daughters of men? Read 1 Enoch. The problem with respecting these other gods, is that <em>we are meant to rule over them</em>, as opposed to their ruling over us, and some of us will eventually take that place. </p>

<p>Of course they propagated parts of their theology near freely. How else would it take hold. I always find it funny that in a conspiracy sub, where people can see all the connections groups like Masons have full control over most governments globally, either directly or by economic slavery,  see their tactics, the horrible and unethical things they do as rulers, the sexual deviancy overflowing the cup into media...  Then sit here and propagate the exact religion they fucking follow. Excuse my language but it&#39;s upsetting.</p>

<p>Yes Christianity as an organization has been corrupted. Most of it induced by Masons! There&#39;s a book you can find online for free detailing their, and the Jesuits involvement in this which is very well sourced from their own documents. &quot;Scarlet and the Beast.&quot; While the authors opinion on the place of masonry in prophecy is debatable, the research is sound. About 100 pages of primary, when available, and secondary sources when not. Check it out. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen these lectures. And read his books. And her books also. Remember, I was a student of that school of thought for many years. I also thought it was helping me, and maybe it did. It schooled me on its deception, and how easy it is to fall prey to it. Taught me to recognize it. <em>I thought just like you</em>. This conversation has been quite uncanny to say the least. Providential even.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I genuinely do not understand how living a life based on honesty,virtue, and integrity would be upsetting to God in anyway.I also don&#39;t see how their theology ever took hold,few have have heard of them and fewer practice their teachings. No one I have met in person has heard of either of them,and people only seem to say bad things about what they said with very vague reasons as to why they dislike them, mainly self proclaimed Christians. They never seemed to reach great popularity in their time or in ours. I mean look at the view counts on YouTube, I may have seen one video reach 160k tops. A drop in the bucket compared to the 300+million professed Christians in America alone.If Freemasonry wanted to destroy and corrupt wouldn&#39;t they try to preach about narcissism,selfishness,lies and perversion? I don&#39;t see Hall or Blavatsky in the msm ever or any of their of teachings. I&#39;m being honest I do not see at all how I&#39;m being deceived, I&#39;ve never seen clearer or lived better. My life has improved by a large margin and my friends and family have noticed, so is it not said in 1 Samuel 24:13-&#39;From evildoers come evil deeds.&#39;. What evil has Mr. Hall brought? I&#39;ve been following his advice and no evil has ever came from it only good. P.S. Found the PDF will look into when I have the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they wouldn&#39;t. They&#39;d preach honesty and virtue, most all the things taught by God and the apostles. Then tweak it just a bit. Cosmic Christ vs Jesus Christ. Accept all religions. Man&#39;s divinity. Faith by works. God as some invisible &quot;force&quot; vs a conscious being. Duality.  Then integrate it into multiple Christian theologies. Create many Christian sects, thousands of them even, until the whole organization was corrupted. The pope wouldn&#39;t be calling for the ecumenical movement if it hadn&#39;t already happened. And that&#39;s exactly what happened and there&#39;s much documentation to prove it. Infiltration and subversion is the tool used. And it worked well, which is why you think what you do. People not having heard of them specifically is no cause for concern, the teachings were propagated by other members of masonry. </p>

<p>Be ye separate.</p>

<p>The issue with all those teachings is it removes the sovereignty of God, and negates the sacrifice of Jesus. </p>

<p>There is nothing man can do to save himself. Only God can save you. &quot;Working on yourself&quot; will always eventually let you down. None of our actions or works mean diddly because we will always slip up, crash and burn. Repentance is all we have, along with faith and humility. The sacrifice made on the cross is the only way out. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect to change your mind. That&#39;s God&#39;s job. I can merely present the information. I can however say that predestination is real. Choice in these matters is an illusion. How can an omniscient being outside of time not know already what we will &quot;choose?&quot; If He wants you, you will see it eventually.</p>

<p>I&#39;m headed on vacation, enjoy the book and lecture. There&#39;s plenty more where they came from.</p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-8" data-depth="15" data-id="dsydj59">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/wackypack90.html">wackypack90</a> 2018-01-16</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they preached and LIVED it, and how on Earth could you tweak  honesty and virtue? These are universal concepts here. Secondly if Jesus is the son of a universal God would he not be the &quot;Cosmic&quot; Jesus as well? 
I&#39;ll just go through the list here
-Accept all religions-You misunderstand, what I referred to was realizing other people are trying to devote time and attention to THE God in their own way. Guess what, you don&#39;t have to agree with that particular religion or practice it. Religious institutions only have as much authority as YOU give them. I disagreed with Catholicism so I walked away,doesn&#39;t mean I have a beef with everything taught or hate practicing Catholics. I just had problems with the institution and I felt as a whole the teachings weren&#39;t satisfying to my needs. Too watered down,milk for babes and all that, because I outgrew it. Respect others who are not at your &quot;level&quot; though, not everyone cares about theology.
-Mans Divinity- Yeah we are divine beings, so is my cat and my dog. We all move, live, and have our being within God&#39;s body. What else could we be? Where else would we be? There is nothing else. 
-Faith by works- I don&#39;t understand what you mean here. Faith may influence the work you do, as in faith in a good God who you try to emulate like a child emulates his/her parents I suppose.
-God as some invisible &quot;force&quot; vs a conscious being-Why not both? You knocked the Babylonians earlier and they agreed with you very much there.  This much I know.
-Duality- One is two,two is one. Easy to grasp. In fact I remember this from the bible, Isaiah 45:6-7&quot;That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun That there is no one besides Me. I am the LORD, and there is no other, The One forming light and creating darkness, Causing well-being and creating calamity; I am the LORD who does all these.&quot; (Holy hell, KJV strikes again check this version out&quot;I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.&quot; wow If nothing else I may be wrong about this version of the bible,may need to snag a copy.)</p>

<p>Ok what documents prove infiltration and subversion? You got a source? I think the way I do because I arrived here thanks, and funnily enough what led me to agree with these so called &quot;masonic&quot; teachings is because I thought in a similar fashion already. I live a fairly solitary lifestyle and work at a lonely job,your mind tends to wander and ponder.</p>

<p>I disagree with it removing sovereignty of God as those teachings emphasize greatly working with and having faith in a divine creator, have yet to hear otherwise and if you can support that with sources please send them. &quot;Negates the sacrifice of Jesus.&quot; What? Jesus is a great guy and all but I don&#39;t recall asking him to be burdened with my sins and die for me. Did he not say take up YOUR cross and follow me(Matthew 16:24,Luke 9:23)? I&#39;ll take responsibility for my actions good or bad, you have to anyways. Whether you believe it or not is a moot point because it is how things work,belief is not required.</p>

<p>Ok this getting abit ridiculous, you say I shouldn&#39;t &quot;work on myself&quot; but then you turn around and say you believe in predestination. So then you&#39;re telling I shouldn&#39;t do what I&#39;m predestined to do because only God can save me, but God already decided where I&#39;m going so therefore I can&#39;t help myself because I have no choice in the matter; so what I do, think, or say has no bearing at all because the choice was made for me. So every deed I do matters little good or bad, making the whole concept irrelevant because well people are just predestined to rape,steal,lie,cheat and murder with no conscious thought in the process. It also negates Christ&#39;s sacrifice because whats the point of sending your only begotten Son to die if you already know who&#39;s damned and who&#39;s not. I guess you could say you have a &quot;choice&quot; in the matter about salvation, but God already knew you would accept/reject it before your physical body was formed;so what are you being saved from? If you &quot;accept&quot; and are part of the &quot;elect&quot; it&#39;s a pretty hollow acceptance, only a thin facade of thanks and praise from a puppet that is only semi-aware and &quot;thinks&quot; it made the right decision but the Godhead scripted it from the very beginning of time itself because he&#39;s so vain and lonely he needs the praise and reminders of his eternal glory from small mammals on a blue marble in space that he created. A few will &quot;repent&quot; have &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;humility&quot; because it was chosen set of &quot;virtues&quot; for them so far in advance the stars weren&#39;t even born yet. There is no yes or no just blind obedience, no free will just an illusion of it. The rest and the worst I don&#39;t even want to think about. 
Truth is there are predetermined factors and there are random factors, causal and acausal. So yeah in a sense you&#39;re right we are predestined to return to God because we came (and I think never really separated)from him, how you get there is UP TO YOU though i.e free will. </p>

<p>Anywho enjoy your vacation, had some other things come up but I&#39;ll try to get to the gnostic vid and pdf soon. Laters</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah because followers of Christianity never committed atrocities in the name of God before. Not saying masons are saints or anything, but perhaps making him an honorary member was an attempt to steer people away from what he had to say. In fact masons are struggling to find new members in the present day and alot of churches stand empty,probably because of their checkered pasts. Interestingly enough Hall refused to actually join the organization because he felt the knowledge he gained should be shared with everyone and not kept bound secret by oaths. Anyways ttyl.</p>

 made footnotes and tabbed the pages I thought would come up in conversation. Like I ever thought that would happen at all lol.

I don&#39;t know which scripture got mistranslated or whatever because it really doesn&#39;t matter. A man on a desert island could find the truth about reality if he wanted to, alot of the bible is allegorical anyways.

“We can only escape from the world by outgrowing the world. Death may take man out of the world but only wisdom can take the world out of the man. As long as the human being is obsessed by worldliness, he will suffer from the Karmic consequences of false allegiances. When however, worldliness is transmuted into Spiritual Integrity he is free, even though he still dwells physically among worldly things.” MPH, here&#39;s another “The esoteric system is all based upon the ultimate motive. Ultimate motive is the service of truth itself, a complete dedication to the service of the realities of existence.” Manly P Hall. A bit wordy, but the spirit of what you&#39;re saying is there.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Truth is God&quot; Gandhi, this is what Hall was referring to. God is the ultimate reality. As for the ultimate blasphemy, read Job 38:19-21&quot;Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place,that you may take it to its territory And that you may discern the paths to its home? You know, for you were born then,And the number of your days is great!&quot;, God appears to disagree with you. It&#39;s a very deep subject, and I don&#39;t fully get it either, but if what we are being told is true then we were with/of/something idk what with the creator since the beginning. I don&#39;t consort with spirits or any of that and Hall suggested not to do those things anyways for the reasons you mentioned. Plus he figured you&#39;ll be in the spirit realm soon enough anyways lol. As far as Babylon and Buddhism goes, who honestly cares. We&#39;ve had what, over two thousand years of Abrahamic dogma and society has never been in more chaos and danger than today. At least 3 billion people follow what I consider the unholy trinity on the exoteric side of things and I can&#39;t think of a more materialistic/nihilistic time in history. We have been acting less than what we are(myself included) and look at where we are now, at least those two faiths aimed high. In fact we are still on r/conspiracy, go check out the latest news and look at what&#39;s happening. Christianity taught us that we are nothing but lowly, pitiful, sinners and look what the got us, a world of lowly, pitiful, sinners lol.</p>

The state of the world today is what happens when man deifies himself, blaming that on Christianity is absurd. </p>

<p>So this &quot;Truth is God,&quot; what&#39;s its name?  God is a being. Has a &quot;personality.&quot; And a name. Yahweh is that name. He speaks truth therefore truth exists, though it and He are not the same. While Hall himself may not have written it, other Masons of that degree have no issue naming the god that group serves. Pike and Blavatsky both use the same teachings of Hall, with minimal changes. One of which is naming their god. Lucifer himself. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re basing what you believe in on it having billions of followers, that&#39;s sad to hear. </p>

<p>As for Job, perhaps you should read the whole chapter. God isn&#39;t saying Job was there at all. He&#39;s asking Job &quot;what are you some kind of know it all? Were you there at the beginning? Did you create the heavens and Earth?&quot; It&#39;s the exact opposite of what you think it is. God is putting Job in his place in this chapter, saying &quot;I am God, not you!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh...Hall never pushed sexual promiscuity, drug abuse, pedophilia, or any of that bs found in today&#39;s culture. The state of the world today comes from the fact that people refuse to take responsibility for their actions and would rather &quot;lean on the Lord&quot; or blame the devil for everything that happens in life. That and blind obedience to authority figures religious or governmental has led to some serious problems and the strife and division we see today.</p>

<p>God has no name because he is so great we can&#39;t label him. It is the great &quot;Is&quot; and no one could possibly slap a label on that. Truth also just &quot;Is&quot;, but I think you&#39;re right in saying that God supersedes truth because he created the it. That&#39;s why He is not named because no man can comprehend such power, the only thing closest to Godliness though is the truth hence what Gandhi said. Also funny you should mention Lucifer because here is Jesus saying this in Revelation 22:13-&quot;I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.&quot;. Omega is thought to be a reference to Lucifer because he continued further on in Revelation 22:16-&quot;I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.&quot;. Again he refers to himself as Lucifer, as Lucifer is also known as the morning star. So make of that what you will. Feel free to check it out yourself don&#39;t take my word for it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t honestly care what people believe in on a numbers scale, if it&#39;s bullshit it&#39;s bullshit. The point I was trying to make was if the way these religions taught in their churches was correct, this world wouldn&#39;t be a waking nightmare. 3 billion odd people could really make a difference. They complain about abortion but won&#39;t allow contraceptives, talk about the sanctity of life but are ok with the death penalty and bombing the crap out countries as long as they are a different faith and speak funny, hate on gays and lesbians but look the other way while pastors diddle kids, tell you you&#39;ll roast in hell for all eternity and then speak of God&#39;s love and grace, bitch about the homeless and impoverished people and won&#39;t lift a finger to help in any meaningful way. That&#39;s what I was referring to is the hypocrites in churches the world over, and how this planet is turning into a hellhole in a hurry.</p>

<p>You must have missed the &quot;You know, for you were born then,And the number of your days is great!&quot; It&#39;s alluding I believe to you being a part of the creator. I think it&#39;s another paradox, that we are and are not God, so we are both right in a sense. The closest thing I could get to approximating it would be like the cells in our bodies. They are not human, but they are. Without them they are nothing, without me they are nothing. Idk it&#39;s hard to explain. So while God put him in his place to be sure, he reminded him of what he&#39;s a part of and where his place on the hierarchy is.</p>

<p>I watched 3 hours of the presentation you sent me, and tbh I stopped because he kept hawking his software, didn&#39;t stay on topic at all, and sounded like he had a beef with Dan Brown&#39;s sources (never saw the movies or read the books btw). He literally only spent 40min talking about the topic at hand, I actually stopped the video twice to make sure I clicked on the right one. He seemed to be in it for the glory rather than truth. The only big grievance he had was that Gnostics didn&#39;t consider women to have the divine spark, when in fact the WOMAN they referred to through symbolism was the creation of the material world and they didn&#39;t consider it divine. They thought it was more or less a prison. I disagree to a point but whatever. He seemed to have put the church fathers and the Christian religion on a pedestal, but being a bible scholar he surely must have seen Luke:37-54 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11%3A37-54&amp;amp;version=NIV">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11%3A37-54&amp;amp;version=NIV</a> </p>

<p>There Jesus rebuked the pharisees (or priest class of today), and ties in with what I said above.</p>

<p>Anywho sorry for the late reply I had life stuff happen, hope you had fun on your vacation ttyl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, the &quot;glory&quot; of lectures on an obscure religious subject. Interesting premise. Are you surprised that a professional scholar has &quot;beef&quot; with &quot;sources&quot; who make a mockery of many people&#39;s, including his own life&#39;s work? </p>

<p>LMAO what country do you live in where all these people are &quot;leaning on the Lord&quot; and blaming the devil for everything? </p>

<p>Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for their racial supremacy doctrine. They held the keys to the kingdom, which had been commanded by Elijah to be spread to the Gentiles. We both know how that turned out for them. </p>

<p>Interesting post in the sub today, this part caught my eye:</p>

<ol>
<li>Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with &quot;social&quot; religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a &quot;religious crutch.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>Sounds like you!</p>

<p>That&#39;s from a US communist manifesto BTW.</p>

<p>And God does have a name! Call it, and <em>He will come!</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So which is it is the doctrine obscure or is it common and being pushed everywhere? The dude is attacking a work of FICTION and went off on one line that wasn&#39;t true in the books, he could have corrected the record in 15mins tops if he wasn&#39;t too busy promoting his software and showing it off every chance he got. Like I said before if he wants to beef with Dan Brown and his boys fine by me, but don&#39;t title the video &quot;Gnosticism and Early Christianity&quot; if it isn&#39;t about that. Also I said I never watched the movies or read the books of Dan Brown, or is it &quot;childish&quot; of me to say you didn&#39;t read my post?</p>

<p>I live on the border of the bible belt and Catholic country so yeah I hear those phrases alot.</p>

<p>No he didn&#39;t re-read what he said, he rebuked the priest class and organized religion. Take a gander at Mark 13:2 when Jesus was asked to comment on the beauty of the temple by one of his disciples&quot;And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.&quot; If it isn&#39;t clear enough for you check out Matthew 15 <a href="http://biblehub.com/kjv/matthew/15.htm">http://biblehub.com/kjv/matthew/15.htm</a> my favorite part is 12-14-&quot;Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.&quot; So yeah I don&#39;t know how much clearer he could make it. The J man must be part of that communist conspiracy too lol. Also you wanna know where the kingdom of heaven is? Luke 17:21-&quot;Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you&quot; </p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point, when did I discredit the bible and declare myself a communist? I&#39;ve used bible quotes this entire time to prove my points, the book you said you&#39;ve read but I&#39;m beginning to doubt it just like you claimed to know of Hall&#39;s and Blavatsky&#39;s work. The only thing that religion has over communism is the teaching that there is more to life than the material realm and that man has an immortal soul. Capitalism has had it&#39;s grip on the churches in America for as long as I&#39;ve been alive with pastors like Creflo Dollar and Joel Osteen and their ilk, the whole &quot;send me $1000 and the Lord will multiply it tenfold&quot; shtick. I don&#39;t hear right wingers bitching about that. Hell I recall Jesus driving out the money changers from the temple in his day. The reason the communists want to remove religion is because they know most people would be lost without it, and would most likely turn to atheism and nihilism. The state would then become god because they&#39;ve little else to cling to. After making everything seem depressing,bleak and worthless (read the rest of the 45 goals) the state becomes more appealing,and the material world is all that exists anymore to most people. Like I&#39;ve said before most people don&#39;t care about spiritual matters or study religion, they just go to the same church their parents went to and so on down the line. I will say this much if there is one thing churches get right it&#39;s the existence of our immortal souls, the dogma is generally horseshit though. For the record I&#39;m not a statist either, I consider it a religion that&#39;s as much bullshit as the rest.</p>

<p>Ok what is the name of God I should call then? I&#39;ve called him Yahweh, Jehovah, Allah, Jesus, Yeshua, YHVH, Krishna, Father, Creator,Creator God, I AM, Me, and so on. No one came for any of them, and I&#39;m not being sarcastic at all. </p>

<p>Yeah I know that Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, some people think Omega refers to Satan and Alpha being God. I&#39;m still waiting on you to tell me why Jesus called himself Lucifer in no uncertain terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh the morning star is what Lucifer is referred to retard. You know it means the one who overcame the world right? I would say the claims you made about the bible were taken out of &quot;context and twisted&quot; but you scarcely referenced the book. How are they out of context huh? Oh wait you need to ask your pastors permission to read the good book and have him hold your hand over the scary parts. I would also like to know when you tore anything to shreds of mine, you couldn&#39;t defend half the bullshit you spewed and then would change the subject. Actually you couldn&#39;t defend over half, and the shit you gave me was next to worthless.  &quot; You have been continuously rude, accusatory, inciteful, and even spiteful at times in your writings to me.&quot; Damn right I have, you haven&#39;t a leg to stand on but you continue to be arrogant. &quot;Oh I&#39;ve read Hall and Blavatsky, but I couldn&#39;t come up with a reason why they&#39;re satanic so watch a six hour presentation on Gnosticism that&#39;s really a hidden software ad.&quot; The reason I continued writing was to see what the &quot;born again&quot; crowd had against all these other religious and mystical groups. Turns out they don&#39;t know either. I&#39;m thinking God sent you to test my faith and I think I passed. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;oh wackypack, brightest of the topminds! How far have you fallen&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s called sarcasm! </p>

<p>All this is quoted:</p>

<p>In Scripture, &quot;star&quot; can refer to &quot;angel&quot; (Numbers 24:7; Revelation 1:20, 9:1, 12:4; and other places). A &quot;morning star&quot; can be considered to be a good angel, full of light, who does God&#39;s will..</p>

<p>The name Lucifer comes from the Latin lucem ferre or &quot;light bearer.&quot; In fact, Lucifer was anointed as a guardian cherub, and he was blameless from the day he was created, until wickedness was found in him (Ezekiel 28:14,15). I believe that before Lucifer fell from grace, he was a good, wise, and enlightened angel.</p>

<p>It is unclear how long after Lucifer&#39;s creation that wickedness and pride were found in him, and when he envied and coveted God&#39;s supreme and unlimited authority, power, position, knowledge and wisdom. He also had the delusion that all of these traits could be contained within himself, apart from God, and even harbored a self-entitlement mindset that they should be. Consequently, God rejected him, and Lucifer was transformed into Satan: the adversary of God and the deceiver of other angels and of humanity.</p>

<p>Presumably, all of this took place after the foundation of the earth was laid (Job 38:4), since Lucifer was the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, when he was placed in Eden, with every precious stone adorning him (Ezekiel 28:12,13). So this would have been before he, as Satan, tempted Eve and Adam.</p>

<p>Whether his &quot;transition&quot; from Lucifier to Satan occurred before or after the creation of Adam (and then Eve) is unknown.  Perhaps the creation of Adam, a &quot;son&quot; of God, is the event that instilled anger into the mind of Lucifer. He probably felt that God&#39;s attention should be solely on him (pride). Then he perceived that God&#39;s main focus suddenly was turned to someone else, Adam, who certainly was not as magnificent, brilliant, and exceptional as himself. It would have been the classic case of jealousy, which is the anger and resentment that results from being &quot;replaced.&quot;</p>

<p>It also could have been the primary reason why Satan tempted Eve and Adam, in hopes that God would destroy them for succumbing to that temptation. Then, in the mind of Lucifer/Satan, his place as the center of God&#39;s attention and interest would have been restored. If this is so, it backfired on him, because he never has regained his high standing in heaven again. This would explain why he has been on a rampage against humanity since then, as well as why his primary goal was to destroy Jesus—the only begotten Son of God—on the cross, knowing that Jesus could (and would) become the Savior and King of the world.</p>

<p>In any case, once Lucifer/Satan failed to maintain an honorable status, because iniquity and conceit had been found in him, he no longer could be considered to be a &quot;morning star&quot; (other than in his own eyes and in the eyes of those he has duped into venerating him). Ever since then, his goal has been to raise his throne above all the other &quot;stars&quot; or angels of God (Isaiah 14:12,13).</p>

<p>The term &quot;morning star&quot; has been given to the planet Venus, which is seen at dawn, even though Venus isn&#39;t really a star. However, once the sun rises, the light of Venus is overcome by the light of the sun, the real morning star. That is, Venus&#39; light lasts only until the true star, the sun, appears with its extremely bright light. Likewise, when Jesus the Son returns, His true Light will vanquish the false, counterfeit light of Satan, who only masquerades as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 1:14) or &quot;morning star.&quot;</p>

<p>In Old Covenant Scripture, the &quot;Angel of the Lord&quot; is mentioned several places (Genesis 16:7,9,11, 22:11,15, 31:11, 48:16; Exodus 3:2; Numbers 22:22-27; Judges 6:12, 13:3,20,21; and other places). I am convinced that this is the pre-incarnate Jesus. Of course, in the form of an angel or messenger of God, He is the highest and brightest Angel, full of Light. Thus, He is the most brilliant and brightest &quot;Morning Star&quot; (Revelation 22:16).</p>

<p>Lucifer and the pre-incarnate Jesus may or may not have been among the &quot;morning stars&quot; of Job 38:7. Again, I see &quot;morning stars&quot; as being good angels, full of light, who do God&#39;s will. Lucifer and the pre-incarnate Jesus were not the only two good angels, full of light/Light. There have been many of these—such as Michael and Gabriel, for instance. And probably many, if not all, of these angels sang together, and shouted for joy (Job 38:7), when God laid the foundation of the earth (38:4) but before Lucifer&#39;s self-deception and sin changed him into Satan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Oh Hypocrosee, you never fell because you never rose!&quot; </p>

<p>Yeah I know Lucifer means &quot;light bearer&quot;, and that the &quot;star&quot; is actually Venus. Fun fact, it&#39;s also called the &quot;evening star&quot;. Rev 22:16 &quot;I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.&quot; Why not just say he is the Sun then? He already says he&#39;s the Son of God so why this specific reference? Look at Philippians 2:6-8&quot;Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.&quot; He never called himself an angel, nor are angels equal to God. The passages themselves give more to ponder certainly, but wouldn&#39;t they have mentioned an angelic nature?  The closest mention of that is in Rev 22:16 that I&#39;ve found. I guess it all boils down to if you consider the &quot;Angel of the Lord&quot; to be Christ or not, I don&#39;t think they are the same. The scriptures really don&#39;t go further into what it is other than &quot;I am&quot;, I think the angel is God&#39;s messenger and nothing more. </p>

<p>Good for you! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Moses said, ‘Let me turn aside and see this great sight. Why does the bush not burn up?’ And Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him from the midst of the bush, and he said, ‘Moses, Moses.’ And he said, ‘Here I am.’ And he said, ‘You must not come near to here. Take off your sandals from on your feet, because the place on which you are standing, it is holy ground.’ And he said, ‘I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ And Moses hid his face because he was afraid of looking at God.” —Exodus 3:1–6</p>

<p>The text quite clearly states that “the angel of Yahweh” was in the bush (v. 2). But when Moses turns to look at the bush (v. 3), the text has Yahweh observing him and calling to him—“from the midst of the bush” (v. 4). Both the Angel—the visible Yahweh in human form—and the invisible Yahweh are characters in the burning bush scene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I&#39;m surprised a good Christian like yourself has ever heard of the word &quot;think&quot; . </p>

<p>Sarcasm aside, if this angel is the Son of God why not make it known instead calling itself Yahweh? Its goes on to say that is the God of Abe&#39;s father etc,etc, but those guys never worshiped Jesus (obviously) and the Lord here is clearly referring to Yahweh, not the Son of Yahweh or his second cousin or what have you but Yahweh himself. The name of the Lord changes depending on context, and the lord of the OT certainly wasn&#39;t Jesus. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t think every mention of &quot;Angel of the Lord&quot; speaks of Jesus himself. But hey you &quot;think&quot; so, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reply to the other comment I made, but I didn&#39;t insult Hall. Whether or not it was an &quot;honorary&quot; induction, he was indeed a mason, his work fit their Luciferian agenda, and was a Luciferian by his own words. He saw Lucifer as the Christ. He is what he is, and my opinion of that teaching is unchanged. </p>

<p>If the devil is to deceive the whole world, even some of the elect, his argument must be <strong>very effing strong.</strong> It must have &quot;good&quot; logic, it must make you feel &quot;good.&quot; I remember the <em>I am powerful</em> feeling I got from it when meditating on certain principles. This was one of the things that struck me as wrong about it, and while I continued down that path for a short time after there was a nagging thought to the contrary in the back of my mind. </p>

<p>God is love. The feelings from God are quite peaceful, tear inducing, joyous gratitude towards Him. The feeling from Lucifer is a sense of self godhood, powerful trembling, tense, a rebellious sense of doing what I want regardless of who it hurts, as I was above them now. This was the key to my return to YHWH. </p>

<p>Once I familiarized myself with the symbology surrounding Masonry, Jesuits etc. Saw it in every major company (apple with a bite out of it is Apple, Google&#39;s logo is the sigil of Lucifer, on an on it goes) I realized that the prince of this world was, and had indeed been in control of it for <strong>ages</strong>. When tempting Jesus in the desert he <em>absolutely</em> had the power to deliver. He&#39;s been in control of this evil place since we gave it to him by eating of his fruit. All the pain and suffering in this world is <strong>due to him.</strong> When bad things happen to good people, <em>that&#39;s why.</em> He hates us. Loathes us. We will rule above him if we can find our way back to God <em>and he knows this.</em> </p>

<p>In Eden, Lucifer didn&#39;t attack the command of God when tempting us with evil, (yes, apple and evil are the same word in Aramaic) he attacked the <em>consequence</em>. And he was a <strong>LIAR.</strong> God on the other hand, EXACTLY what He said would happen, did.</p>

<p>Let God speak the truth, and every man be a liar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does Hall fit that agenda? You do know he was murdered and most of his library vanished right? As far as I know he never formerly declared himself to belong to any religion much less a to being a Luciferian. If you have any sources that he did please send them, the last person who gave me a quote saying it was from The Secret Teachings turned out to be false; I mean I have the book lol. Tbh I felt like I got put in my place when I heard him lecture, to the point where I turned it off because I couldn&#39;t take it anymore. In looking over my past realized how I got the outcomes I did, because I did wrong and got wrong. I felt everything but powerful and rebellious, and began to understand that much of my suffering was of my own doing, because I didn&#39;t get there are rules here for an embarrassingly long time. I don&#39;t put the blame on nobody but myself. What I think Hall was getting at was humanity finding the truth through negation,having learned it&#39;s place in the universe the hard way.</p>

<p>Here is a short clip on the subject from the man himself on the subject <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHQNKlJS0qM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHQNKlJS0qM</a>, you two agree more than you realize.Though tbh again I didn&#39;t think you interpreted scripture quite so literally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the first subsection about the earth can mostly all be computed with high school math...  the earth being round is a prime example...  you don’t have to rely on NASA or something, look up Galileo’s proof ffs, you can compute and verify yourself.  Also learn about azimuths and declination.  Obviously it throws in wild speculation such as intelligent life (which is a guess for science based on probability anyway) to seem knowledgeable.  Purposely mixing verifiable facts with unverifiable conjecture to add vagary to all makes it propaganda at least in method. </p>

<p>Others such as oil need more advanced physics and chemistry but if you want to claim a concept that goes back to simple logic (I.e. anything chemistry and physics based) you would need to have an equally sound counter conjecture or else you are just an ignorant child saying “I don’t understand it so it’s not true.”</p>

<p>Other parts, such as the media and pop-culture sections are so obvious as to be pointless, most can be addressed simply as assigning profit as the motivation and saying “who profits.”</p>

<p>Other shit about the age of the earth, giants and such is a weird grab bag of religious fundamentalism and atheism randomly interspersed.</p>

<p>And of course there are some items which are simply pointless...  proposing fluoride and then proposing “mental illness due to chemical imbalance” it contradicts itself, the brain works by chemical reactions so it is fundamentally true that “chemical imbalances” cause mental defects, it is simply an incredibly vague and blunt statement.  The question that <em>should</em> be asked is if these can be “fixed” by scientific modification of the chemicals in the brain/blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either look up that proof or any other and see for yourself, I am not going to write up a proof that I worked in high school when a simple search on google, ddg, or wolfram alpha will find you a ton of others.  Why would you believe me writing it out when you don’t believe any number of more educated mathematicians doing the same?  The reason I tell you to look it up is that it can be solved with high school trigonometry, the <em>value</em> is in doing it yourself so you can claim no fuckery (u less you intend to argue that there is some conspiracy in basic math which I <em>guarantee</em> you are not educated enough to attempt to prove if you are questioning this, no offense.)</p>

<p>The others I will have to leave to an assumption of general knowledge.  There are but a few subsets of ideology that claim the earth is a significantly different age than geology states:  religious fundies who base this on some specific calculation in the Bible,  and the many variants on the earth being a simulation or brain-in-a-vat type thing that simply posit a fundamental different reality than is perceived, oh, and then there are the ones claiming the earth is significantly older and civilization is cyclical.  I am sorry, but given that the “mainstream” theory is readily available in great detail and the others are essentially unprovable (feel free to try) the <em>onus of proof</em> is not on me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What criteria are you attempting to apply to “provide evidence”?  Do you want me to do the web searching for you to provide links?  TBH most of that can be found clearly stated and exhaustively sourced on Wikipedia, is that within your abilities to operate?  I am unclear what you are defending exactly because almost all of the points we are discussing rely on science, they are not political explanations or based on simple testimony by people.</p>

<p>To be explicitly clear on that, the theories <em>were not</em> developed first and the evidence gathered to support them (as too many pop-culture level conspiracy theories are).   Evidence was found and the theory developed <em>based on it</em>.  The age of the earth, for example.  Before science you had various religious (or I suppose more accurately philosophical) guess or ideas about it.  Then as evidence accumulated and science developed, the theory was fundamentally shifted from common beliefs based on this.</p>

<p>What most of these propositions do is to either come up with a theory or else simply deny the veracity of one as a starting point <em>and then</em> attempt to find evidence to support it (which itself should be telling).  At <em>best</em> the “evidence” found is an error or discrepancy in some part of the body of knowledge upon which scientific <em>theories</em> are based.  That is as close to a logically or scientifically valid argument as these can claim, and much more of the “evidence” is a mix of ideas, inability to understand the math or science required to <em>understand</em> rather than simply <em>believe</em> the theories (I.e. I have a full understanding of the math to prove that the earth is round or that we can launch rockets into space, but I simply believe relativity because while I understand the basic concept, I do not possess the knowledge of advanced physics to follow a proof) and some religion or philosophy for good measure.</p>

<p>So, again, I cannot “prove” all of these things myself for there are many lifetimes worth of work and knowledge required.  However, the good news is that thanks to written language, I don’t have to prove them because others already have.  If I question one, everything required to investigate is available.  Before attempting to posit an alternate theory, or <em>even an error in a theory</em> one must understand the thing they are objecting to and have <em>something</em> to point at and say “this error contradicts this theory, therefore I find reason to question it.”  And that only proves one thing: that there is an error in the theory (assuming the error isnt in your own work).  To come up with an alternate theory, you would need <em>evidence</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s us the example of radio-carbon dating.  There have been demonstrated and verified accounts of vastly incorrect dates on objects tested, such as medieval manuscripts that testing claims are a million years old.  What does this prove?  That the book is actually a million years old?  That the earth isn’t as old as is theorized?  That our entire understanding of history is wrong?</p>

<p>None of those.  It proves there was an error.  And a logical person would understand that this is addressed from small to large scale, the opposite of claiming it proves an entire theory is wrong.  Was the test done incorrectly?  Is there a problem with the equipment?  Is there a source of pollution (such as atomic radiation we have released) that explains this?  Is the problem that our ideas about radio-carbon dating are wrong?  Are our ideas about radiation wrong?  And so on, stopping at each step to actually prove or disprove the hypothesis.</p>

<p>There are several classes of “conspiracy” often seen on the web.  There are real ones which are based on multiple forms of evidence from photos, witnesses, physics, motives etc.  such as JFK, 9/11, The Apollo program, The Franklin coverup and various other similar ones.  By real I don’t mean true, I mean based on multiple sources of evidence that is not explained by an official narrative.</p>

<p>There are the fun ones:  Aliens, Cryptids, Lost civilizations, ancient aliens and extraterrestrial origins, ghosts, astral projection, multiple dimensions and such.  There isn’t necessarily any hard evidence that explicitly verifies <em>some</em> of these, but there is enough for some that they can’t be fully discounted or otherwise explained either.  They are the stuff that is fun to read and think about but doesn’t really affect the nature of reality in any significant way.</p>

<p>Then there are the ones that range from philosophical to dogmatic (rarely even conspiracies by nature but often lumped in):  Simulation reality, reincarnation, collective unconscious, religions, esoteric stuff, young earth, flat earth, hollow earth, alternate history (as in really alternate: Dino and human coexisted) Q anon.  The beginning of the list aren’t really conspiracies, they are philosophies and thought experiments.  There is no one trying to “hide” these.  However, the point of most when understood is that there is no proof or way to prove it externally and that doesn’t matter.  This describes the ones up to religion.  The rest are based on purposeful deception for gain (esoteric stuff whether by Egyptian priests to control others or Wiccan “Spellbook” authors wanting to get money from fat girls).  The rest are surprising that they are even taken seriously at all, and the odd few who do take them seriously form a slavish devotion to the idea in dearth of fact and believe it more feircely than most religious people believe their sacred texts.  They will question vast amounts of established and tested science but believe an unverified (or not bother to attempt to verify) reports from essentially anonymous people who wrote an article or blog post.  Don’t be like the last ones.  They are the enemies of logic and free thought for they are merely following someone else blindly, which does well to describe the Q cult.</p>

<p>I don’t know the details of exactly how the machines work, but my general understanding is that it simply detects the strength of very minute radiation and applies this to the half-life theory.

    <div class="md"><p>Ignore him, he goes around this site linking to non informative John le Bon blog posts like thus all day. </p>

<p>He backs up none of these points with science and directs you be a member of his site... </p>

<p>Its not possible to understand what he believes based on his blog or sometime even which side of the issue he is on because its all hype and 0 substance. </p>

<p>Reminds me of infomercials peddling diet pills and self improvement systems...   </p>

<p>His brand of skepticism boils down to the fact that he lacks  understanding of basic science principles and theories, down to basic newtonian physics up to atomic/ quantum physics therefore its not real. </p>

<p>He he misunderstands basic planetary science by trying to reduce it to an early experiment. He main argument since he does not actually understand it is that some guy did it long ago in a shed... which misses that most science was done in a shed or attic at the time and that these experiments have been replicated and built on with more advanced and standardized approaches.</p>

<p>He is either John le bonn trying to grow his fan base (almost all the videos he references are made by him and require paid membership for $20 every 4 weeks).</p>

<p>Or he is paid to direct traffic to the site or a groupie. </p>

<p>None of John le Bond posts make any sense and rarely offer any substance other than promises to blow your mind, condescension to both “notmies” and “consiritards” and promises that all this wisdom can be had for a mere $5/weeks... that’s right, for the price of just one Australian cup of coffee (well some fancy latte), you can listen John le bonn blow your mind with his genius blogs and you can even watch him slay doubters on online round tables...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  I have not received any solicitations, but don’t worry they would fall on deaf ears.  I don’t really care if he does that, a fool and their money are easily parted, but I do understand your reasoning for why it is wrong.</p>

<p>Since you seem to have a sound mind, perhaps I will follow you for a moment instead :).  This sub can be fun and the quality used to be better, but there was always that annoying divide between people who understand skepticism and its importance, and people who think conspiracy just means everything anyone says is a lie.  It is a strange development lately, however, the fomenting religiosity found here.  Where once reptilians and hollow earth or moon Nazis were discussed half ironically and half as, essentially, fun sci-fi, lately there has been an earnest acceptance of these.  Unless, of course, they are all shills (which is doubtful,  all young teenagers much more likely).</p>

<p>What is interesting to come of it, being that societal trends are relevant to an analysis of theories, is that this religiosity has developed alongside the “messiah” that is the Q anon and attending cult.  And I think that cult is the apt word.  For many who have long written it off as a LARP or some other form of bullshit, it may seem that the idea got old and vanished.  It did not, the thing merely withdrew to its own areas and crystallized...  check out CBTS_stream sub to see what it has become, it is actually disturbing... like going to visit a friend who you discuss conspiracies with only to find he has actually coated his house in tinfoil and is drinking his own urine (I assure you this has never happened to me but it paints a good picture imo). </p>

<p>I do think that those who wrote it off shouldn’t have.  It <em>absolutely is</em> something, and something more than a LARP, but I am not sure what.  I mean it is still possible some obsessive compulsive narcissist is behind it, but it seems far too purposeful, and it is far to easy to extrapolate uses for various entities beyond a single person’s self gratification.  Even if that is how it started, if intelligence agencies <em>actually do</em> monitor this sub and 4chan, they are remiss not to have seen great potential there.  And that is what I think is most likely behind it.</p>

<p>It seems to be in favor of Trump, but I don’t really think it is of his team or on his side.  It <em>is</em> purposefully targeting his followers.</p>

<p>It doesn’t do his opposition any favors either though, they needn’t point to random online weirdos to portray him in a bad light.</p>

<p>If anything, my theory is that it is some coordinated study of susceptibility to direction and viral spread along social media.  Which makes it prime to be an intel agency project.</p>

    The apparently ancient reports of the importance of Pythagoras and his pupils in laying the foundations of mathematics crumble on touch, and what we can get hold of is not authentic testimony by the efforts latecomers to paper over a crack, which they obviously found surprising, by the use of various kinds of reconstruction and reinterpretation. On the other hand, there are ancient and unassailable indications of a Greek mathematics antedating Pythagoras and quite outside his sphere of influence.

<p>This. I have went through a period where I allowed the whole &#39;the world is run by satanists&#39;-thing to run me into the ground and I became heavily depressed. We&#39;ll all escape from this shithole (no pun intended) when we die anyway, so it&#39;s better to regard these things with the perception of a scientist instead of a victim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judging by the fact that I have no previous memory of my respawn this time around, I probably won&#39;t have the next time either, so the subjective experience will be one of a non-cyclical universe. Much like the simulation argument, the cyclical hypothesis has a far less drastic impact on one&#39;s life than one would initially believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider the following example. Let&#39;s say that we have a monkey that is invisible, invincible and somehow undetectable through either equipment or your senses. Because the monkey is undetectable, its presence in your life is by definition so incredibly minimal that your subjective experience of reality would be more or less the same, regardless of the monkey&#39;s existence. Your life wouldn&#39;t change in any meaningful way if the monkey were to suddenly pop out of existence, or into it. The same applies to the reincarnation hypothesis and its variants; if you are not <em>aware</em> that you&#39;re a reincarnation, your life would for all intents and purposes be identical to a &#39;one hit wonder&#39; existence.</p>

<p>“Stop reading into things so vaguely” No, start communicating things more clearly. If you aren’t trying to do that, then you aren’t communicating effectively. Far too many horrors have been caused by the bible or the quran being too vague or conflicted. Poetic writing has its place, it exists to communicate feelings that concise, straightforward language fails at. However, what you were trying to say does not need poeticism, it can be said very simply, as can be much of the bible.</p>

I&#39;d like to know your personal opinion about escaping the matrix after physical death. I mean, of course we will be free eventually due to how powers play out over time, but can we harness our power and escape the matrix before the evil force&#39;s downfall? I have heard we can exit the grid that entraps us through willpower and knowledge, but i have no extrasensory trips to prove this to myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well after the NDE, I havent stopped reading and have consumed hundreds of books since then. I am of the opinion that Buddha style spiritual enlightenment frees you from here, but also Christ as well. I saw the heavens broken up into chunks for different cultures, however saw beings made of light/spirit the size of planets who many were confusing as &quot;god&quot; who really werent and souls were getting tricked.</p>

<p>Angels for demons, karma, transcendence of karma, other universes, all sorts of beings (alien, animals, other planets, etc), abso-fucking-lutely filled to the brim with existence both physical, light, weird dimensions like fuzz, neon, all sorts of crazy shit everywhere.</p>

<p>My preference is Zen though, where you no longer identify as a someone who is reincarnating, you are also not identifying as someone who is not reincarnating, you find a sort of inbetweenness where nothing or no system, demon, trap etc can grab into you anymore because there is nothing to grab onto and so you merge with the whole</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so cut and dry. There are consequences, reincarnation, karma, the smallest most seemingly insignificant thing like having a bird feeder out for the birds in the winter, or opening the door at a restaurant for some old folks to go in before you, has a butterfly effect that literally affects the whole, physical and non, everythingness. </p>

<p>In a sense, having the NDE was a cheat code for my own life, because I no longer partake in the drama&#39;s, see through the scams, quit playing, will never have kids, and just don&#39;t give a fuck because I&#39;ve see where I come from. On the other hand. It fucked me up so bad to have gone through that because knowing how powerful and eternal each move you make, word you say, expression you create, is......in a sense my life has turned into a game of chess where I won&#39;t make any moves which by proxy freezes it all. Even then, the body ages and will come to an end and we return to the cosmic soul we originally come from.</p>

<p>I think the point of being here, is that here provides for a sort of opportunity to escape and unlock Enlightenment that can be had in bodiless mode. It&#39;s a theory I had for a while after I started accessing Oneness in the physical heart, and remembering that we don&#39;t have physical hearts when we are bodiless. Then eventually came across I believe it was Krishnamurti writings and some Buddhist writing GS which echoed this sentiment.</p>

<p>I will say, to be bodiless consciousness, you are so much bigger than the body, you fill up a master bedroom or more even, can fly, pass through walls, etc. But at the same time in that stage you can&#39;t have sex, eat ice cream, feel the breeze on a hot summer day, have your dog curl up beside you, etc. </p>

<p>Added caveat, I&#39;m not so sure what you see on the other side isn&#39;t also a massive SIM which tricks you by convincing you to have your memory wiped and get recycled again.</p>

<p>Really is a gift and a curse to have gone through that</p>

<p>Dude, so refreshing to see this here. You are speaking my language. Consciousness is fundamental, and we all derive from the one supreme source consciousness.

    <div class="md"><p>How expendable the average human is compared to the elites.    How far the elites are willing to go for their dirty money.    The insanity that prevails at the top of empire,  where their is a competition for who is best at telling lies.    That gradually,   the corruption is so incredibly inefficient that the last days of empire rely on exponential levels of fraud,  and more and more ruthless disregard of life.    That Americans can &quot;sleep well at night&quot; after being complicit in the creation of 65 million refugees,  millions murdered in criminal wars,   torture,   destruction of hundreds of cities,   is amazing,  but you know,  there is also an epidemic of despair,  and so there isn&#39;t all that much good rest and relaxation,  but more of a frenzied rush into the stupor of intoxication and other perversions.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t living in a computer simulation. We are living in a rudimentary caste system. Humans learn things and simulate events in their mind before they act. THIS is what they meant by &quot;simulation&quot;. There will never be a simulation loop. There will only be humans and computers. Sure, we can simulate ourselves within a computer and fool ourselves, but our actually real life brain will rot in 80 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;oh wackypack, brightest of the topminds! How far have you fallen&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s called sarcasm! </p>

<p>All this is quoted:</p>

<p>In Scripture, &quot;star&quot; can refer to &quot;angel&quot; (Numbers 24:7; Revelation 1:20, 9:1, 12:4; and other places). A &quot;morning star&quot; can be considered to be a good angel, full of light, who does God&#39;s will..</p>

<p>The name Lucifer comes from the Latin lucem ferre or &quot;light bearer.&quot; In fact, Lucifer was anointed as a guardian cherub, and he was blameless from the day he was created, until wickedness was found in him (Ezekiel 28:14,15). I believe that before Lucifer fell from grace, he was a good, wise, and enlightened angel.</p>

<p>It is unclear how long after Lucifer&#39;s creation that wickedness and pride were found in him, and when he envied and coveted God&#39;s supreme and unlimited authority, power, position, knowledge and wisdom. He also had the delusion that all of these traits could be contained within himself, apart from God, and even harbored a self-entitlement mindset that they should be. Consequently, God rejected him, and Lucifer was transformed into Satan: the adversary of God and the deceiver of other angels and of humanity.</p>

<p>Presumably, all of this took place after the foundation of the earth was laid (Job 38:4), since Lucifer was the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, when he was placed in Eden, with every precious stone adorning him (Ezekiel 28:12,13). So this would have been before he, as Satan, tempted Eve and Adam.</p>

<p>Whether his &quot;transition&quot; from Lucifier to Satan occurred before or after the creation of Adam (and then Eve) is unknown.  Perhaps the creation of Adam, a &quot;son&quot; of God, is the event that instilled anger into the mind of Lucifer. He probably felt that God&#39;s attention should be solely on him (pride). Then he perceived that God&#39;s main focus suddenly was turned to someone else, Adam, who certainly was not as magnificent, brilliant, and exceptional as himself. It would have been the classic case of jealousy, which is the anger and resentment that results from being &quot;replaced.&quot;</p>

<p>It also could have been the primary reason why Satan tempted Eve and Adam, in hopes that God would destroy them for succumbing to that temptation. Then, in the mind of Lucifer/Satan, his place as the center of God&#39;s attention and interest would have been restored. If this is so, it backfired on him, because he never has regained his high standing in heaven again. This would explain why he has been on a rampage against humanity since then, as well as why his primary goal was to destroy Jesus—the only begotten Son of God—on the cross, knowing that Jesus could (and would) become the Savior and King of the world.</p>

<p>In any case, once Lucifer/Satan failed to maintain an honorable status, because iniquity and conceit had been found in him, he no longer could be considered to be a &quot;morning star&quot; (other than in his own eyes and in the eyes of those he has duped into venerating him). Ever since then, his goal has been to raise his throne above all the other &quot;stars&quot; or angels of God (Isaiah 14:12,13).</p>

<p>The term &quot;morning star&quot; has been given to the planet Venus, which is seen at dawn, even though Venus isn&#39;t really a star. However, once the sun rises, the light of Venus is overcome by the light of the sun, the real morning star. That is, Venus&#39; light lasts only until the true star, the sun, appears with its extremely bright light. Likewise, when Jesus the Son returns, His true Light will vanquish the false, counterfeit light of Satan, who only masquerades as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 1:14) or &quot;morning star.&quot;</p>

<p>In Old Covenant Scripture, the &quot;Angel of the Lord&quot; is mentioned several places (Genesis 16:7,9,11, 22:11,15, 31:11, 48:16; Exodus 3:2; Numbers 22:22-27; Judges 6:12, 13:3,20,21; and other places). I am convinced that this is the pre-incarnate Jesus. Of course, in the form of an angel or messenger of God, He is the highest and brightest Angel, full of Light. Thus, He is the most brilliant and brightest &quot;Morning Star&quot; (Revelation 22:16).</p>

<p>Lucifer and the pre-incarnate Jesus may or may not have been among the &quot;morning stars&quot; of Job 38:7. Again, I see &quot;morning stars&quot; as being good angels, full of light, who do God&#39;s will. Lucifer and the pre-incarnate Jesus were not the only two good angels, full of light/Light. There have been many of these—such as Michael and Gabriel, for instance. And probably many, if not all, of these angels sang together, and shouted for joy (Job 38:7), when God laid the foundation of the earth (38:4) but before Lucifer&#39;s self-deception and sin changed him into Satan.</p>

<p>This. I have went through a period where I allowed the whole &#39;the world is run by satanists&#39;-thing to run me into the ground and I became heavily depressed. We&#39;ll all escape from this shithole (no pun intended) when we die anyway, so it&#39;s better to regard these things with the perception of a scientist instead of a victim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, which is why I said &quot;I do agree that TPTB probably don&#39;t see themselves as evil and I&#39;m sure that they have some sort of justification for their deeds, but it&#39;s hard to not despise them from an outsider&#39;s perspective.&quot;</p>

<p>I agree that morals are relative in most cases, but it would be insane to deny that evolution has pre-programmed some very fundamental sense of good or bad into us. For example: murder reduces group cohesion and thus your hunter-gatherer tribe&#39;s chance of survival, which is why almost everyone who isn&#39;t drunk with power is apalled by it. I think that it is far to judge TPTB by these near-universal standards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;oh wackypack, brightest of the topminds! How far have you fallen&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s called sarcasm! </p>

<p>All this is quoted:</p>

<p>In Scripture, &quot;star&quot; can refer to &quot;angel&quot; (Numbers 24:7; Revelation 1:20, 9:1, 12:4; and other places). A &quot;morning star&quot; can be considered to be a good angel, full of light, who does God&#39;s will..</p>

<p>The name Lucifer comes from the Latin lucem ferre or &quot;light bearer.&quot; In fact, Lucifer was anointed as a guardian cherub, and he was blameless from the day he was created, until wickedness was found in him (Ezekiel 28:14,15). I believe that before Lucifer fell from grace, he was a good, wise, and enlightened angel.</p>

<p>It is unclear how long after Lucifer&#39;s creation that wickedness and pride were found in him, and when he envied and coveted God&#39;s supreme and unlimited authority, power, position, knowledge and wisdom. He also had the delusion that all of these traits could be contained within himself, apart from God, and even harbored a self-entitlement mindset that they should be. Consequently, God rejected him, and Lucifer was transformed into Satan: the adversary of God and the deceiver of other angels and of humanity.</p>

<p>Presumably, all of this took place after the foundation of the earth was laid (Job 38:4), since Lucifer was the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, when he was placed in Eden, with every precious stone adorning him (Ezekiel 28:12,13). So this would have been before he, as Satan, tempted Eve and Adam.</p>

<p>Whether his &quot;transition&quot; from Lucifier to Satan occurred before or after the creation of Adam (and then Eve) is unknown.  Perhaps the creation of Adam, a &quot;son&quot; of God, is the event that instilled anger into the mind of Lucifer. He probably felt that God&#39;s attention should be solely on him (pride). Then he perceived that God&#39;s main focus suddenly was turned to someone else, Adam, who certainly was not as magnificent, brilliant, and exceptional as himself. It would have been the classic case of jealousy, which is the anger and resentment that results from being &quot;replaced.&quot;</p>

<p>It also could have been the primary reason why Satan tempted Eve and Adam, in hopes that God would destroy them for succumbing to that temptation. Then, in the mind of Lucifer/Satan, his place as the center of God&#39;s attention and interest would have been restored. If this is so, it backfired on him, because he never has regained his high standing in heaven again. This would explain why he has been on a rampage against humanity since then, as well as why his primary goal was to destroy Jesus—the only begotten Son of God—on the cross, knowing that Jesus could (and would) become the Savior and King of the world.</p>

<p>In any case, once Lucifer/Satan failed to maintain an honorable status, because iniquity and conceit had been found in him, he no longer could be considered to be a &quot;morning star&quot; (other than in his own eyes and in the eyes of those he has duped into venerating him). Ever since then, his goal has been to raise his throne above all the other &quot;stars&quot; or angels of God (Isaiah 14:12,13).</p>

<p>The term &quot;morning star&quot; has been given to the planet Venus, which is seen at dawn, even though Venus isn&#39;t really a star. However, once the sun rises, the light of Venus is overcome by the light of the sun, the real morning star. That is, Venus&#39; light lasts only until the true star, the sun, appears with its extremely bright light. Likewise, when Jesus the Son returns, His true Light will vanquish the false, counterfeit light of Satan, who only masquerades as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 1:14) or &quot;morning star.&quot;</p>

<p>In Old Covenant Scripture, the &quot;Angel of the Lord&quot; is mentioned several places (Genesis 16:7,9,11, 22:11,15, 31:11, 48:16; Exodus 3:2; Numbers 22:22-27; Judges 6:12, 13:3,20,21; and other places). I am convinced that this is the pre-incarnate Jesus. Of course, in the form of an angel or messenger of God, He is the highest and brightest Angel, full of Light. Thus, He is the most brilliant and brightest &quot;Morning Star&quot; (Revelation 22:16).</p>

<p>Lucifer and the pre-incarnate Jesus may or may not have been among the &quot;morning stars&quot; of Job 38:7. Again, I see &quot;morning stars&quot; as being good angels, full of light, who do God&#39;s will. Lucifer and the pre-incarnate Jesus were not the only two good angels, full of light/Light. There have been many of these—such as Michael and Gabriel, for instance. And probably many, if not all, of these angels sang together, and shouted for joy (Job 38:7), when God laid the foundation of the earth (38:4) but before Lucifer&#39;s self-deception and sin changed him into Satan.</p>
