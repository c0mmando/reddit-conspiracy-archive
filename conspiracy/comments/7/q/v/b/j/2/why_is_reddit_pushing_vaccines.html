       Sadly, it’s hive mind at its finest. This isn’t exclusively a Reddit thing though. While sometimes it’s a fallacy, sometimes the truth really is in the middle. All vaccines are not bad or evil, the science itself is quite sound. However, they downplay the shit out of the legitimate cases of  vaccine injury, and the lack of accountability in the industry, and ineffective vaccination rates with some of them. There are certainly some case of foulness abound , but to the masses, it’s never “their” Doctor that’s part of the corrupt medical industry. Only other, bad doctors care more for profit than peoples. Sometimes, they’re correct. Other times....well...

       For the same reason the experts in the field recommend vaccines: they're safe and effective, and save lives.

       Yeah, anti-vaxers will scream
       <em>
        shill!

       and run through the talking points they learned on Facebook or YouTube. But the epidemiologists, virologists, and immunologists who actually study the issue firsthand

       I agree. Vaccines are very effective in preventing terrible diseases turning into epidemics.
       <em>
        Buuuuuut
       </em>
       maybe we could start developing an alternative to trigger auto-immune responses rather than using aluminum and/or mercury. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that that's their only purpose of being in a vaccine.

       ...Yes. Do you have any idea how many potentially infectious agents we come into contact with on a day to day basis? There's a reason why people with SCID rarely get passed the first couple of months. It is a constant, never ending battle.

       You're not fighting the deadliest diseases when given a vaccine. You're fighting their retarded cousins. We have a whole slew of different types of vaccines (live attenuated, inactivated, toxoid, subunit, conjugate, VLPs, DNA, recombinant etc.) and none of them have you fighting the actual pathogen. They're either weakened to the point where they can't do much, or you're given a LITERAL piece of them that can't replicate by itself. They are sitting ducks against your immune system. An APC will stimulate the formation of memory T and B cells geared towards fighting whatever has the antigen the APC picked up. This whole process occurs all the time.

       Yes, but those retarded cousins of deadly diseases still wreck your immune system and keep you down for days at a time for some people. They're not completely benign like we're told.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I feel my own perspective is not being conveyed and is getting twisted a bit so I'll just say, I don't think vaccines are a conspiracy to kill people or anything like that–– I just sometimes wonder if cocktails should be given to small children all at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a crazy question to ask.

       Key word "some people". The amount of individuals that suffer even slight side effects is incredibly low (this does vary from vaccine to vaccine). You can never guarantee 100% risk free in all cases. People are different. Certain individuals may react differently to certain antigens when compared to the general population. Some individuals could have some degree of immunodeficiency and struggle to take down vaccines involving a live virus (usually these people are not administered the vaccine though). These are still fringe cases though.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're question is completely fine. Children do have a less developed immune system when compared to adults. However by the same vein of logic, you could argue that they SHOULD be the priority since they would be the most at risk. It's all about balancing the risks.

       I just wonder if small children should get individual vaccines at a time, rather than cocktails. That’s all. I know it more convenient to get a single shot every 6 months or whatever but I can’t help but wonder if we’re sacrificing safety for convenience.

       Even if you wanted to space them out, 6 months would be overdoing it I would think. B cells begin producing antibodies at around 5-7 days after the addition of the antigen, and the T cells are already out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The longer you wait the longer you'd be susceptible. Keep in mind that the intensity of an immune response to an already encountered antigen is not only MUCH faster, but significantly more intense than the first encounter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want you could always ask your doctor or a practicing immunologist. They've been dealing with this stuff for literally decades.

       I meant these cocktails are spread out by 6 months right now. But perhaps the individual vaccines within the cocktails should be spread out themselves. So maybe one per week or every 3 days or whatever is determined to be safest (without any thought toward convenience).

       No problem. The sad reality is that the public view of vaccines has become tainted in the past 25ish years. Tones of studies have come out showing their safety and beneficial effects, but they don't ever reach the masses. It's starting to have negative effects. Certain diseases are beginning to rear their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real issue though is that nobody bothers to read the actual scientific literature in general. It's all about blogs, news articles and shitty 30 second video summaries on social media. They rarely ever properly portray what was found out and often twist stories to sound more "clickbaity" or to better suit their political affiliation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the real conspiracy if you ask me. Having people think they've got a handle on a whole subject because they read an article on "NaturalHealthNewsToday" or whatever. ALWAYS check the references and find out where the information is coming from.

       It's no more "aluminum and/or mercury" than your salt shaker contains chlorine--they're compounds. And there's no good evidence that they're harmful. After all, thimerosal was taken out of every vaccine on the CDC's recommended childhood schedule, and it had no effect whatsoever on public health. That was no surprise to the experts, who'd been saying all along that thimerosal was harmless.

       Every single medicine can have serious side effects. Even antibiotics and vitamin supplements. If there question was, "Are there potential harmful side effects?", then we'd never set a bone or give penicillin or use vaccines or car seats.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why we ask instead how common the side effects are, and whether the benefits outweigh the potential harms, given their scarcity. And every expert in the field agrees that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the potential, and vanishingly rare, side effects. Just like with penicillin.

       illness in the past had a lot to do with the lack of hygiene.  herd immunity isnt even about vaccinations anyway though.  herd immunity was a term coined to describe the development of natural immunities developed over generations resulting in new generations that wont be susceptible to an illness at all without the use of a vaccine.  vaccines only effect the individuals and are not passed down to children so they have nothing to do with herd immunity

       I'm not sure where that information came from, but herd immunity is a bit different than that. It basically amounts to having a sufficiently immunised group of people, which makes disease harder to spread, therefore limiting contact with the subgroup of non-immune individuals. It's especially relevant to vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be happy to back this up with sources but I'm on mobile, so I'd appreciate it if you google "herd immunity" first before you ask me to do it.

       no, herd immunity is exactly how i explained it.  big pharma has attempted to hijack the term by leaving out the "natural" part that is so important to its definition though.
      </p>
      <p>
       As more people in a society develop NATURAL immunities less people in the society will be born with the susceptibility of contracting deadly illness since tolerance/immunity is passed down

       <p>
        Herd immunity (also called herd effect, communityimmunity, population immunity, or social immunity) is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has
        <strong>
         become immune
        </strong>
        to an infection, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not ...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       nothing in the definition describes vaccinations and although vaccines do provide a sort of immunity it is an unnatural form.  It works, but it does not have the effect herd immunity was coined to describe.  Children are not born immune to polio or the chicken pox because mom and dad were vaccinated for it.  They need to be vaccinated too since the immunity is not genetically passed down.

       The risk to everyone of developing very serious complications from the illnesses we vaccinate against, are increased when herd immunity goes down. Vaccination isn't a failsafe in an individual, and some people cannot have vaccinations due to compromised immune systems, so herd immunity is paramount.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these illnesses are unpleasant, but it is the complications which arise do so with far greater frequency than the side-effects of vaccines, and the complications are far more devastating or even fatal.

       So whilst I wouldn't want to see anyone ridiculed for being paranoid, the basis of their paranoia absolutely should be ridiculed and demolished with evidence, those who cynically and fraudulently prey on the paranoid via anti-vaxxing "studies" absolutely should be ostracised and ridiculed. Meantime it is 100% understandable to politely but firmly ostracise those who refuse to be vaccinated as they pose a risk to those around them.

       They all have a much greater risk of being hurt, and being hurt to a much greater degree, if they do not vaccinate. If they are thinking of their safety, and are fearful of random risk they would vaccinate.

       You are the one who raised fear of risk of side effects as a reason for rejecting vaccinations. This is a bogus reason as the risks associated with going unvaccinated are much greater and much more prevalent.

      <p>
       Nobody can make someone else be vaccinated, but they also don't have to pretend that the decision to go unvaccinated is valid. They also don't have to expose themselves to those who wilfully refuse to be vaccinated or admit them into spaces where they will pose a risk to others.

       tl;dr Mass vaccinations alone didn't eradicate smallpox; surveillance and containment did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Containment meant isolation of patient and vaccination of those who were in contact with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isolation in a separate dwelling while being cared for by someone who previously had the disease is noted as being particularly effective.

       Gee, I've had the flu shot every year for about 10 years now and I haven't gotten the flu, either. So here's to getting my vaccine and never having the flu!
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to think the flu is the worse thing that can happen to you? Ever seen a kid with whooping cough? Ever seen someone suffer from shingles? Any of your older relatives contract polio as a child? Ever known anyone who had to endure treatment for hepatitis? I've seen all those things, and I don't want them for myself or my children. You can have them! I'll get the vaccines, thanks.

       No, that's the problem.  Once eradicated these things are no longer scary because there is no first hand experience and folks then get it in their heads that it's a bad thing because their snowflakes might get autism (/s) and it spreads virally and now we have new cases of these once tamped down diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       So hopefully when a bunch of people die this time, the lesson is learned for a few more decades into the future but, I'm not counting on anything.

       I had shingles a couple of years ago had to have 3 weeks off work on strong opiates. Even with the opiates the pain was agony I was just to fucked to care. I wouldn't wish them on my worse enemy and I'm really scared that I could get them again.

       Every single medicine can have serious side effects. Even antibiotics and vitamin supplements. If there question was, "Are there potential harmful side effects?", then we'd never set a bone or give penicillin or use vaccines or car seats.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why we ask instead how common the side effects are, and whether the benefits outweigh the potential harms, given their scarcity. And every expert in the field agrees that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the potential, and vanishingly rare, side effects. Just like with penicillin.
