<p>I think he’s on to something when he talks about Rothschild Zionism, though.  He goes out of his way to distinguish between Jewish people and Rothschild Zionism which, I think, is necessary but certainly won’t please ADL. </p>

<p>My take is he is handled. <em>Roughly</em> a British version of Alex Jones except he had a starter audience whereas Alex is more of a self-made guy. Jones had a lot of charisma and moxie back in the day when he was doing public access television at midnight. If Icke has any charisma I don&#39;t have the background to appreciate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the stuff he wrote about, and sounded completely crazy, 20 years ago has come to pass: propaganda &amp; high levels of coordination between seemingly independent mainstream media outlets, satanism &amp; pedophilia amongst the elite, the march to an increasingly cashless society, erosion of privacy &amp; civil rights and the &quot;major attacks&quot; to justify them. His contention of a holographic universe has gained credence and the transhumanist movement is now openly underway. The reptilian theory still remains, as Alex Jones says, the turd in the punchbowl. While the hollow moon theory still sounds outlandish, it&#39;s interesting to see how many people are now openly questioning the moon landings. </p>
