       Some of the things he states, without real proof, are so beyond the pale that I just can't swallow them.  I try to keep an open mind but some of the things he says are just plain bat-shit crazy.

       Exactly! But he has been right before. He’s said for years that the media is ran by pedos and now recently we’re finding that he was right.

       I think I like the
       <em>
        idea
       </em>
       of archons and dark energy more than I buy into their existence. I'm not certain of anything, but that's just the direction I lean. Being conscious of the energy I put forth works for the better, regardless of whether or not his words hold any truth, so I don't pay it much mind. I suppose based on my experience, I don't really believe him, but his teachings have had an effect on me nonetheless, simply because the notion behind them is nice.

       Like with anyone, there is always a little bit of truth even amidst a gaggle of untruths. Take the knoweledge with you and see if it falls into place anywhere.  Most of it is probably bs though.

       I like him. His stuff is mythological in scope, but as such his story has 'closure'.
Downside is his mythos is similar to R. Hubbard's dissection of things; attacking beings surrounding humans...then again, Islam has Jinn...

       I think he is spot on with a lot of stuff he says, but i believe he puts the crazy shit in just to make him unkillable.

       He's a nutjob to most so he could never do any real harm but he speaks enough truth.

       This is a metaphor for the fact that these reptiles do not feel empathy like normal people.  Reptiles have a lack of feelings and empathy due to their developmental stage, and when you look at it that way, it makes a lot more sense.

       You shouldn't take anything literally. Consume the information and make your own decisions. There is no pressure to believe someone just because they said it. There is no reason to discredit everything a person says just because you think one thing he says is false.

       Do we get to just make things up now? I never liked this poor metaphor. Doesn't even make sense. Why risk looking like a lunatic for talking about psychopaths. "Hey I know, if I say they're shapeshifting reptilians maybe more people will believe me!"

       I haven't dealt with him for a long time.
So it may be that I didn't realize that he literally means shape-shifter reptiles.

       It's illegal in England to talk about jews in that way. Could be a cover for talking about jews in that way? Or a metaphor? Or he really believes they are shape-shifting reptiles.

       I'm just throwing ideas, but they got murder because they went too far researching. I really like the idea of Icke's reason for talking about reptilians being solemnly as protection. There are definitely some groups that you don't talk about (Scientology, Royal Family as possible examples) and maybe that's why they got killed.

       I like and respect him but don't fully trust him. He's brought some genuine truth forward, but it's mixed up with some wild theorizing that probably even he knows is bullshit. I don't like that he knocks Jesus.

       I think a lot of these limited disclosure types are actually Antichrists, but Icke really took a ton of shit, more than most, and kept pressing forward, so you gotta respect him for that.

       Icke has a huge swell of interest a few years back then it sort of receded. I think there are a lot of valuable ideas there but there’s a lot of stuff that also doesn’t make much sense and it became clear that he was just coming up with larger and larger theories to sell books. The hollow moon theory being an example.
      </p>

       I think he’s on to something when he talks about Rothschild Zionism, though.  He goes out of his way to distinguish between Jewish people and Rothschild Zionism which, I think, is necessary but certainly won’t please ADL.

       a British version of Alex Jones except he had a starter audience whereas Alex is more of a self-made guy. Jones had a lot of charisma and moxie back in the day when he was doing public access television at midnight. If Icke has any charisma I don't have the background to appreciate it.

       A lot of the stuff he wrote about, and sounded completely crazy, 20 years ago has come to pass: propaganda &amp; high levels of coordination between seemingly independent mainstream media outlets, satanism &amp; pedophilia amongst the elite, the march to an increasingly cashless society, erosion of privacy &amp; civil rights and the "major attacks" to justify them. His contention of a holographic universe has gained credence and the transhumanist movement is now openly underway. The reptilian theory still remains, as Alex Jones says, the turd in the punchbowl. While the hollow moon theory still sounds outlandish, it's interesting to see how many people are now openly questioning the moon landings.

       I think David Icke is a fraud.  I do give him props for carving out his own niche in the conspiracy community and making it super profitable though.  I see most "name" conspiracies as vendors and the community as a whole as just one giant marketplace they can peddle their wares.
