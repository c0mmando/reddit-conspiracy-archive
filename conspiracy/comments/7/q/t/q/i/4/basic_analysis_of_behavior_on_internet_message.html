        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So whenever I see a flat earth topic I see the following:</p>

<p>A bunch of people saying “look at ships go under the horizon” and other weak proofs. They use these to bait people into arguing back and wasting time trying to make basic arguments that don’t accomplish much. Especially if the person they are arguing with is a shill.</p>

<p>“You’re an idiot, science proved this years ago.” Science never proved anything about round earth, people have simply been deluded under the name of “science”. Since the conspiracy has lasted so long, you can say that it’s simply “progress.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get these idiot flat earthers.” Covert Ridicule, make sure to cause mental distress for anyone who dares research flat earth and belittle them</p>

<p>“Why would they lie, I don’t understand the motive.” They do know why, this is also bait, but it also serves as mental manipulation to someone who doesn’t understand the flat earth conspiracy that well and might not be aware of motives such as project Bluebeam.</p>

<p>Not only that, but why are people so passionate to derail flat earthers? What’s the motive for posting in those topics if one thinks the earth is round? And to do it repeatedly? The only logical explanation is that the government has paid shills to hide the true proportion of people who understand the flat earth conspiracy.</p>

<p>When I see a topic about aliens, I never see ridicule, overt or covert. Why? Because there are no shills being paid to attack such bullshit. Shills are paid to attack flat earthers. Alien talk is good because it helps to condition them for project bluebeam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree mostly, but</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say with certainty the Earth is flat, though I&#39;m going to say with certainty the (jesuit) globe Earth is a liar.</p>

<p>There&#39;s still other options (concave as one of the big 3, convex flat concave).</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to the possibility the earth is concave, TPTB inverted it (they love doing this) and gave us an entire universe.</p>

<p>The flat Earth would then be another option for TPTB in case people start to realize the world is not a globe.</p>

<p>Point being, it&#39;s not a globe, and there&#39;s plenty of solid science (or lack thereof) to back this up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s try this counterargument, since it&#39;s the one that I found convincing that flat earth is impossible.  (That&#39;s not to say the earth is the shape or size claimed, but it can&#39;t be flat).</p>

<p>Consider three people; one in California, one in New York, and one in London.  Let&#39;s say it&#39;s noon Eastern standard time, and all 3 people are talking together on a conference call via cell phones.</p>

<p>The person in Cali reports that the sun it&#39;s low in the Eastern sky, as it is only 8am in California.  Meanwhile the guy in NYC says he sees the sun directly overhead, because it&#39;s noon.  And the guy in London says, I see the sun low in the western sky, because it is evening.</p>

<p>Obviously all three individuals are looking at the same object (sun, lamp, projection, hologram, whatever -) they&#39;ve gotta be looking at the same thing because there&#39;s only one sun visible at a time from anywhere on earth.</p>

<p>How is it possible that they can see the same object in wildly different positions at the same time if they&#39;re all on a flat surface looking up?</p>

<p>Furthermore they could each watch the sun continuously move across the sky, setting first in London, then NYC, then Cali.  Then tomorrow, it rises over London, but the guys in the US can&#39;t see it yet.  In fact, when the sun does rise over NYC, the guy in Cali still cant see it and the guy in London sees it as high overhead.</p>

<p>Not possible on a flat Earth, under any conceivable physical/mechanical design.</p>

<p>Not saying we&#39;re not being deceived about the shape.  Just saying, it&#39;s can&#39;t be flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I asked my friend a navy SEAL sniper.  I hid the purpose of my question so he didn&#39;t know what I was getting at.  I just asked him a bunch of questions about aiming east vs west or what all the factors were when firing a shot.  At the end I asked him if the Coriolis effect is taken into account at all and he said &quot;no it&#39;s not long enough distance to matter.&quot;</p>

<p>I trust my friend more than some shill video on the internet.  He&#39;s not a flat earther by the way, he thinks I&#39;m crazy but he knows all the videos saying the Coriolis effect are used in sniping are nonsense.  You have to ask yourself why they would create elaborate fake video poofs of something that isn&#39;t true.  This is done much more than you realize.  People who are in on the deception are propped up as experts in that particular field.</p>

<p>This is all besides the point that I know that the earth is not spinning and that it is not as ball.  The Coriolis Effect is just one of those false proofs that&#39;s out there to deceive you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The motive is to make humanity feel nihilistic and insignificant.  If humanity knew that the world was flat and &quot;outer space&quot; didn&#39;t actually exist the whole Evolution lie would be exposed and the creation narrative would be embraced.  The fact is, the motive is to hide direct logical evidence of a creator and for those who still have faith it is to remove any kind of literal interpretation of theological texts.  I was completely agnostic when I discovered the Earth was flat and NASA and other &quot;space agencies&quot; were lying about everything.  That is no longer the case.  There are no agnostics and atheists on the flat earth, only Gnostics and Theists.  There is a spiritual battle going on for souls and the spirit in control of this world is bent on deceiving humanity so that they lose their eternal soul and inheritance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you miss the part where I said I was agnostic while discovering flat earth and fake space?  It has nothing to do with religion but once you come to realize it is the truth, a creator is the only logical answer.  Aliens are clearly a deception when &quot;outer space&quot; doesn&#39;t even exist.</p>

<p>You can start here but I don&#39;t support Dubey on anything other than his FE proofs.  He&#39;s a shill but his FE stuff is pretty good:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ax_YpQsy88">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ax_YpQsy88</a></p>

<p>If you want to do a test that breaks all modern cosmology all by itself simply take a magnifying glass and focus moonlight to cool an object or thermometer.  It works exactly the reverse of sunlight and modern science has no explanation for this.  This is because the moon gives off it&#39;s own unique cooling light.  It is not reflecting anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll look into the magnifying glass thing as this is the first I&#39;m hearing of it. </p>

<p>But let me say that the fact that you &quot;once were&quot; agnostic means nothing in this case. </p>

<p>It appears to me then that the whole FE theory revolves around the Bible and Christians best I can tell. So as a quick mental exercise or fun additional thought let&#39;s estimate: how many people have converted to Christianity and Bible belief FROM OTHER RELIGIONS due to the magic of FE theory? </p>

<p>Not agnostics or even atheists. But how successful is it at convincing all the pagans on the planet who are deeply rooted in their family traditions and belief system to leave those systems and come to Christ and his Bible? </p>

<p>0%? 1% effective? More? Inquiring minds want to know ;) </p>

<p>Further thinking: if the Bible and a guy named Jesus&#39; teachings and commandments are THE way that all humans are meant to live, if it is THE TRUTH......</p>

<p>Why is there so much arguing about it and why isn&#39;t it more popular? Last I checked &quot;the truth&quot; didn&#39;t need defending, rationalizing, or apologizing. It is simply, blatantly apparent, and non negotiable. Easily seen by all. </p>

I know for me after FE and fake space I first became a Gnostic but then once I started actually praying to God sincerely for the first time in my life he made it very clear he was Jesus Christ and the King James Bible was his word.  All my prayers in the past were in the form of &quot;if you are real then do X Y Z.&quot;  This was the kind of prayer where I knew he existed and I wanted to know who he was.  The fact is &quot;seek and ye shall find&quot; is literally true.</p>

<p>As for why people who proclaim Christianity can&#39;t agree there are a couple levels to this.  At the level of true repentant sinners who believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the hearts and are born again in spirit by his blood sacrifice there is the simple disagreements of human pride that we cannot get away from.  Even though we are born again we are still sinners walking in cursed flesh.  It will always get in the way.  Here is a Biblical example:</p>

<p>Act 15:37  And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. 
Act 15:38  But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 
Act 15:39  And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; 
Act 15:40  And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. </p>

<p>Barnabas and Paul had a &quot;sharp&quot; disagreement over a brother who Paul thought was not someone he wanted to bring with him and they parted ways.</p>

<p>The kind of disagreements you are more likely talking about though are the ones that put in place by the enemy.  If the Bible is real there is a fallen spiritual entity that hates humanity who also rules this fallen realm.  </p>

<p>2Co 4:4  In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. </p>

<p>Luk 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. </p>

<p>Satan/Lucifer has been given power here.  He can also give power here to whomsover he wills.  He is also called &quot;the god of this world&quot; (small g)</p>

<p>I think of this place as Manhattan from the movie Escape from New York.  It&#39;s a place for fallen creations of God and it&#39;s run by the biggest, meanest, fallen one of all.  He used to be a King (anointed) cherub, the most beautiful, powerful, top creation of God:</p>

<p>Eze 28:13  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. 
Eze 28:14  Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 
Eze 28:15  Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. 
Eze 28:16  By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 
Eze 28:17  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. 
Eze 28:18  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. 
Eze 28:19  All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more. </p>

<p>When Adam fell, he lost his spiritual crown and he was kicked out of Eden to the place we are in now.  Lucifer now ruled the precipitates and powers again.  He is the one causing all the deception and lies in the world.  He is the one who sets up all the false religions in the world.  He is also the one who has infiltrated the King James Bible believing groups with his agents like Steven Anderson.  So from the outside it&#39;s easy to just see a bunch of confusion but for true Born again Bible believers with spiritual discernment we are united on 95% of things.  Nobody can have 100% correct doctrine.</p>

<p>1Co 13:12  For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. </p>

<p>The entire point of this life is to realize that we are sinners (something God defines and doesn&#39;t tolerate in his presence) and the punishment for sin is the perfect wrath of God.  That ends up with us being separated from him for eternity in a lake of fire.  God knew that we couldn&#39;t make up for sin ourselves so he came to Earth as Jesus Christ and became the final blood sacrifice that washes away all our sins forever (the Lamb of God).  Once you repent of your current sinful state and actually believe this gospel in your heart you will be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>There is nothing that you can do personally.  No good deeds, no works.  You can only rely on what Jesus Christ did for you.  He did all the work.  There is no going to church, there is no giving money, there is no being a good person.  The only way to obtain salvation is by repenting and believing that Jesus Christ died for you personally and was buried then resurrected on the 3rd day.  Every single organized religion is set up by Lucifer to make you think you need to do something yourself to make it.  It&#39;s all a lie.  It&#39;s so simple and easy and that&#39;s what he wants to hide from you.  Lucifer is the the ultimate conspiracy in the world.  He connects everything together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your effort bro. Really I do. But it&#39;s just religious brainwashing. The questions I could ask now are questions that have already been done to death regarding this topic. </p>

<p>If God created everything, he created Lucifer. Why would he create his own enemy? Boredom? As a &quot;test&quot; for humans? If God loves us why play test games with us? Why setup your own kids to fail? You just said that man is an enemy to God. Doesn&#39;t sound so kind and loving to me. </p>

<p>But if it&#39;s all just a big game, a test, what&#39;s my reward? To die and live next to god on a cloud somewhere? A different planet or dimension maybe? Sounds boring TBH. Maybe theres more to do there then? </p>

<p>And if it&#39;s all a big test, that means I have to pass it. But you said I don&#39;t have to do anything. No amount of work on my part passes the test. Doesn&#39;t make sense. </p>

<p>And if all that is just a simple, apparent, obvious, and beautiful truth then why is it all so complicated, contradictory to itself, and need so many explanations. </p>

<p>Truth is simple. When you see it you know it. Christianity just isn&#39;t that way is it? Or it would have a larger conversion rate and retention rate. Once again it appears that FE theory is simple another flavor to Christianity. I dont know any other religious groups in on the FE movement. Reeks of religious fervor, not facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Islam also is pretty big in FE because they use the OT and flat and motionless earth is all over the OT.  FE is also full of just Gnostics who think we are in a simulation or who buy into Hermeticism, New Age etc.  The entire FE &quot;leadership&quot; is chalk full of masonic shills.</p>

<p>Your questions all boil down to free will.  God didn&#39;t create robots.  Not even his cherubs (which look more like this than the Hollywood version: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CgLDD">https://imgur.com/a/CgLDD</a>).  All of his creations have free will to do what they please.  That&#39;s why Lucifer was able to rebel and get booted out of the 3rd heaven.  If you were an infinite being and wanted to hang out with someone wouldn&#39;t you rather whatever you create have the ability to think and choose things for itself?  That&#39;s exactly what he did and his creations chose things of their own free will that he set up rules against but but he didn&#39;t force them not to.  He doles out punishment and humanity is going through a reconciliation process.  I suppose you can think of it as a test but it&#39;s just finally admitting to God that we done messed up.  It&#39;s like a Dad, he just wants to hear that we know we were wrong then we are all good.  If you continue to deny it however, the Dad stays angry.</p>

<p>As for the reward it is very specific what it will be and trust me you don&#39;t want to miss it.  Research the Flat Earth and give it the same credit you give to what you currently believe.  The only way the Globe wins is through mockery and a bunch of pre-programming that causes people to be unable to look at it while being truly unbiased.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moron.</p>

<p>If God is &quot;omniscient&quot; (all knowing), he knows what&#39;s going to happen.</p>

<p>He knew Lucie would rebel. He knows Bible thumpers regularly have affairs, abortions, and diddle little kids. He knows about slavery, torture, mass killings, and sudden infant death syndrome.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s it happen?</p>

<p>How is it free will if he knows what you&#39;re going to do?</p>

<p>You&#39;d really rather accept this conundrum than accept some people made up God for money and power?</p>

<p>And you&#39;re relying on the King James Bible for it? The one that&#39;s 55x mistranslated from its source material? With bonus chapters written hundreds of years later, recounted through myth and legend passed down through thousands of people! Who of course have no ulterior motive to perpetuate a religion...none at all.</p>

<p>You&#39;d rather believe ALL this nonsense instead.</p>

<p>People will take money to lie about the planet being round...but not to make up you&#39;re ridiculous religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, wow. So, wait. Your magical fairy tale book says that people who don&#39;t believe will call it bullshit? But the people who do believe will be &quot;saved&quot;, and have the &quot;power of God&quot;! Well fuck me running, son! </p>

<p>That surely assuages any doubts I had, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not at all really fucking convenient, and one of the very first markers of a cult. </p>

<p>But I see you&#39;re also a fan of the Old Testament! You know what I love about the Old Testament? The ability to throw this truly awesome scene at people like you; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1-ip47WYWc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1-ip47WYWc</a></p>

<p>There are more comprehensive breakdowns of the OT&#39;s more ridiculous bullshit, but that one is my personal favorite. It&#39;s entertaining. Grabs your attention. Isn&#39;t too long. Good stuff. </p>

<p>What this all comes down to, you ignorant chode, is that you&#39;re going to believe whatever you want to believe despite any and all evidence to the contrary. That misery you feel when you look at others who can&#39;t &quot;see&quot; what you see. Can&#39;t understand what you do. It&#39;s because they&#39;re not sick. And deep down inside, you know that.</p>

<p>You&#39;re &quot;different&quot;. You&#39;re &quot;special&quot;. </p>

<p>And you feel that way because you&#39;re sick. You&#39;re not firing on all cylinders. You&#39;re touched in the head. </p>

<p>You dumb, boy.  </p>

<p>You just don&#39;t want to acknowledge it. </p>

<p>That &quot;power of God&quot; you pull to sustain your faith, and extol the virtues of Flat Earth and the Baby Jesus, is called &quot;Denial&quot;. It&#39;s strong. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing, though; You will occasionally run across people like me, willing to challenge your bullshit, try to get you to work out 3rd grade logic all on your own, not for any particular benefit, but just so you realize you don&#39;t have to live your life in the cage you&#39;ve built for yourself. The universe is far more vast and interesting than what you&#39;re religion, whatever it may be, says it is. </p>

<p>You&#39;re God is too small. </p>

<p>But ultimately, we&#39;ll walk away. And if you want to hold on to your self delusion, you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;ve won the day. God&#39;s followers triumph, right? But that&#39;s not what&#39;s happened. Because at some point, I had to make the call that you&#39;re just not worth saving. </p>

<p>Because you&#39;re not worth saving. </p>

<p>How&#39;s it go? God helps those who help themselves. Right? </p>

<p>Pull your head out of your ass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, it&#39;s the history that tells me religion was just a form of control.</p>

<p>Religion to me is a human thought. Something we made up to cope with things we didn&#39;t understand. It&#39;s easier to sound important when you use large words. Important words. Fancy words.</p>

<p>Plus going from worshipping nothing so many years ago and watching religion evolve over time from different religions to becoming so powerful they have their own country and place. Moving from pope to pope who are proclaimed speakers of God. These dudes always need money. Always.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also mention the crusades. Times when killing for God was fine, even though it strictly was said in the Bible to not kill. God didn&#39;t come down to earth and tell these army leaders to go there, they and others decided that. God wasn&#39;t involved in any way except used as an excuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for one, this thing called gravity.  That&#39;s what gives liquids the properties that you&#39;re describing.</p>

<p>And for two, your initial premise that all bodies of water are perfectly level is verifiably false.  There is plenty of evidence to suggest that &quot;sea level&quot; above undersea mountain ranges is substantially higher in surface elevation than &quot;sea level&quot; in other places.  &quot;Sea level&quot; is not at all a uniform measurement across all seas, or even uniform across a single sea.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are definitely oceanic studies using lasers and shit that verify the curvature of the open ocean.  Just because the curvature isn&#39;t detectable to your eyes while you&#39;re standing on the surface doesn&#39;t mean anything at all.  Spheres are locally homeomorphic to a plane, so when you &quot;zoom in&quot; enough on any sphere it looks flat in the locality of where you&#39;re looking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if you understand how science works.  A &quot;theory&quot; is a hypothesis proposed to explain some observable phenomenon.  Science operates by trying to disprove (not prove) the theories that have been proposed to explain whatever phenomenon is in question.  The &quot;good&quot; ones are the ones that so far have yet to be disproved.  The bad ones (like, say the theory behind phrenology, or the theory of spontaneous generation, theory of a geocentric universe) are quickly disproved through reproducible observations and experiments.  Science operates solely by acting to <em>disprove</em> bad theories.  So, the fact that the theory of gravity hasnt been disproved in hundreds of years is a fairly strong indicator that it explains the phenomenon of shit sticking to the earth (not to mention the movements of celestial bodies) in a manner more or less consistent with reality.</p>

<p>Also, we might say gravity is a theory in the same way that anything outside my own mind even exists at all (see Descartes).  The world itself and everything in it - your own body and senses included, exist only theoretically, because there&#39;s no way to conclusively prove that they exist in &quot;reality,&quot; for whatever that term means.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s no true way to verify that anything exists other than my own consciousness, there&#39;s certainly now way to verify conclusively that gravity is a thing.  Of course, this is all moot, because whether or not we believe in the world outside our minds, we have no choice but to operate as if our best assumptions are true (that is, I have to assume that you exist for this conversation to have any meaning).  So, the idea that you personally are a real sentient conscious entity that I&#39;m currently engaged in conversation with is <em>just a theory</em>.  But I can&#39;t just dismiss the apparent existence of this conversation without supposing that you, Reddit, and the earth are all just a figment of my imagination.  But I&#39;m gonna assume that you actually exist, and so does this conversation - to do otherwise relegates me to complete solipsism, a futile position as a philosophical exercise.  If I want to live life amongst humans, I have to assume that certain theories (like, that you actually exist) are true, even though I can&#39;t prove it.</p>

<p>Similarly, it seems very apparent (not provable, just apparent) that objects near the earth are attracted to the earth for some reason.  Whether I call it &quot;gravity&quot; or not is irrelevant.  Empirical evidence is extremely suggestive that some natural physical force is responsible for this attraction.  Physicists call that force &quot;gravity&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s an article on variance in sea level:</p>

<p><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/globalsl.html">https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/globalsl.html</a>. </p>

<p>And apparently lasers follow the curvature of the earth because math/physics.  Specifically &quot;refraction&quot;.  So I don&#39;t have a handy study for that without getting extremely technical.  We can agree for now that the &quot;laser confirmation&quot; of Earth&#39;s curvature is in dispute, and I&#39;ll withdraw that portion of my above comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Four conclusive experiments performed by the top scientists of their day proved that the Sun, Moon and stars revolve around us, and that Earth is the fixed, motionless centre of the universe. </p>

<p>The Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Airy&#39;s Failure and Sagnac experiments scientifically proved Geocentrism and nearly crushed the dying Heliocentric theory until Mr. Einstein came through with his Special Relativity mathematical denial of the proven Aether and philosophically (not scientifically) banished the Aether from study ever since. </p>

<p>These studies and peer reviewed experiments are never covered in any university courses. These conclusive peer-reviewed and repeated scientific results are nowhere debated or denied, merely suppressed and ignored. The fact of the matter is that Geocentrism has been conclusively proven for over a century.</p>

<p>In 1913 Sagnac conducted an experiment to test the speed and constancy of light and proved the existence of the Aether (Disproves relativity) Therefore, The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted using an interferometer clearly demonstrated that the Earth was motionless. The Michelson-Gale experiment detected the Aether/Firmament passing over the surface of the motionless Earth. Airy&#39;s Failure, demonstrated that it is the stars moving relative to a stationary Earth, and not the fast orbiting Earth moving relative to comparatively stationary stars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll check it out.  Do you have any links to the actual publications?  </p>

<p>A follow up question.  If geocentric universe is true, why go to such great lengths to perpetuate a different narrative.  IMO conspiracy theories are strongest when they have a believable motive.  Personally, I think most all contemporary conspiracies can be traced back to elite world domination via global financial control (central banks, Rothschilds, etc).  E.g., easy to explain WWI, WWII, JFK assassination, 9/11 etc as all perpetrated by the elite banking cartel that currently has the world tricked into thinking fiat currency is a viable economic option.  Just about everything goes back to supporting control of politics/media&amp;information/wealth distribution by the same group of clandestine elites that have run the show from behind the scenes for centuries.</p>

<p>But why disguise the shape of the earth?  Where&#39;s the profit?  If not profit, then what&#39;s the motive?  (Genuinely asking).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched the video.  Somewhat compelling.  Certainly not entirely outlandish.  The michaelson-morley stuff and sagnac stuff seem like reproducible experiments, so I&#39;ll give credit there.  I guess I&#39;ll have to check out the Herbert dingle book science at the crossroads.</p>

<p>But again, I have to ask &quot;why.&quot; Science reforms it&#39;s theories all the time, so preservation of the copernican model doesn&#39;t seem like enough motive in and of itself.  Who profits from lying about a geocentric universe?</p>

<p>I mean, the only reason of can think of gets metaphysical real fast, and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m prepared to believe that it&#39;s all demons who just really just want to trick us out of God&#39;s love.  I mean, I&#39;m all for metaphysics, but there&#39;s no way that any particular cultural spiritual doctrine has the story straight.  (I.e. I&#39;m not buying that we&#39;re nearing the end of a biblical 6000 year war between God and Satan).</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s the point of the deception?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because vacuums never “suck” air. What they do is present an empty space and then air pressure forces the air into the vacuum.</p>

<p>Air pressure is not uniform throughout the atmosphere. The lower the altitude, the higher the air pressure; As you move higher, the air pressure decreases. At the upper limits of the atmosphere, the air pressure reduces to basically nil.</p>

<p>And since there’s no real air pressure up there, then there is no force pushing the air into the empty space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want to know what the motive is for people refuting flat earth threads? </p>

<p>Because flat earth has become one of the worst things for conspiracy that&#39;s why. If you ever have a serious conversation with someone about a <em>plausible</em> conspiracy and they want to derail it they will bring up flat earth to draw a parallel and discredit anything you have to say because of the association.  </p>

<p>Flat earth is hands down the most over the top and easily disprovable things I have seen on the internet and that includes reptile overloads living in the hollow earth.</p>

<p>Why do people not wish to debate it on a serious point by point basis? I have on youtube with some video makers and its like arguing with a toddler... a waist of time. I think mods on this sub allow it just on principal to foster an environment of freedom to discuss things. Personally I would be perfectly happy if all flat earth posts were removed.     </p>

<p>First, pity. Next, after you refuse the most basic facts, we are embarrassed to share the same message boards with you.</p>

<p>The theory of gravitation predicts behavior 100% of the time. Nowhere on Earth can you provide an observable, repeatable experiment that defies the theory of gravitation.</p>

<p>Yet on a flat earth, gravitation would fail as soon as you stepped a foot away from the center of the supposed &quot;disc.&quot;</p>

<p>So either the theory of gravitation is wrong, or the Earth is not a flat (or mounded) disc.</p>
