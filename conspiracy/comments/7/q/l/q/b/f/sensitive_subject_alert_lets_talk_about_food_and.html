       Sense this can be a sensitive subject I feel it's important to offer a disclaimer here.  This post is not about the ethics of eating meat, or whether the efficiency of feedlots are worth the consequences.  I am merely wondering what the energetic effect of eating animals grown in the following conditions would have on a human population.  Here are some images I found through a google search.  I didn't visit the websites where the images are hosted.  I am just looking at the images.

       Having looked at the images, how do we feel about eating food like this?  "You are what you eat"  Is there truth to this phrase?  Me thinks there is.  Look at society as a whole.  Fat, complacent, consumer drones happy to live in their little boxes.  We are what we eat indeed.

       Vegan isnt just animal products. It is inflicting the least amount of harm possible. So we try to do our best about recycling and a lot of other things. Some vegans including me don't eat palm oil because it is the cause of a lot of orangutan deaths

       Personally, I’m not super strict on the honey, the way I am about meat and dairy, but my brother did just launch a vegan honey product that’s pretty damn good so I’m using that at home!

       Went to the Del Mar Fair and walked thru the 4-H exhibits. Passing  a blue ribbon Angus Bull I noted he was manacled and had a chain hooked to his nose ring. A beautiful and magnificent beast, perfect really.

       I looked in his eyes, he was weeping. There was more: it was anger, humiliation, and disappointment.

       I've cut back my meat consumption greatly, partly because of ethical issues like this, and partly for my health. That said, I still eat about a serving of meat every day...
      </p>
      <p>
       But what really disturbs me is the kosher and halaal method of slaughtering animals. Its truly brutal, and I will never eat meat that has been slaughtered in this way if I can help it.

       I was under the impression that kosher preparation of meat was supposed to reduce the stress an animal goes under while being killed. The reason for the super sharp knife. Am I mistaken?

       Yea, the knife has to be super sharp and without blemishes. But I think that has more to do with it being a "pure" and "clean" sort of sacrifice.

       As I understand it, they sever the living and aware animal's carotid artery (along with the esophagus and trachea) and then let the animal bleed out. That doesn't sound painless to me, it sounds like a terrifying way to die. The animal is certainly aware of what is happening after their throat is cut, until they black out. I think that stunning before death is infinitely more humane.

       A high level of testosterone in any animal at the time of death will taint the meat, I believe, and a decent butcher would know that and want to avoid causing undue stress on the animal. Bleeding out animals has been practice for a long time and is supposed to be one of the quickest and most painless of ways to slaughter an animal especially when using a very sharp knife (or scalpel as I have also seen used). What I saw from looking at kosher practices and inhumane treatment had to do with the "shackle and drag" method which sounds terrible but was found to be used in certain South American processing plants and not with the bleeding out of the animals.

       Right, this illustrates what I was saying about the animal's meat being degraded by stress previous to slaughter. It seems pretty clear that the animal's psychology really does have an effect on meat quality and it should not be a huge leap to assume that this would also translate to quality of the overall life of the animal. I have a hard time finding good qualities in factory farming.

       Except that stunning can miss, the animals are transported and pushed through an assembly line and they can smell the blood, piss and shit of the sometimes still aware dying cattle. They're very stressed. Chickens get boiled alive often to get the feathers to come off quicker.

       To be fair not all animals are raised in these conditions and with some research into what you are eating and the companies that you purchase from you should be able to eat meat that is given a decent life. And relying on your grocer to choose "good" meats is not enough, you need to research the individual producers.

       It's not just the ethics of mass production and if it is animal cruelty. The waste pools are producing methane gas or contaminating ground water or surrounding farms with e.coli. The labor offenses, against people working in toxic conditions or manipulating disabled or illegal immigrants to work long hours for less than minimum wage. The effect of antibiotics and hormones when you consume the animal product. The amount of chemicals and processing to trick the consumer into eating food that isn't local or fresh, some eggs are months old before they get to the store! The fact that these large agro-corporations kill small independent farms.

       I usually don't buy meat for my home, but I eat tacos at my favorite place often. I am fortunate enough to have a local butcher shop and an italian deli, plus the farmer's who sell at the farmer's market. But only 1 of the 4 cheeses in my fridge right now is local. I usually don't buy eggs, because I get them at a food pantry, along with meat. They're  "waste". I've stopped eating all pork, including bacon, w the exception of sometimes it's used to case sausage. I kept getting a dull stomach and head ache for a few days after eating it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go vegetarian again, but cheese and yogurt really help my stomach stay regular. Vegan is honestly just so expensive and time consuming. And they don't eat honey. Fuck that.

       My real issue with veganism is the massive amount of soy and soy derivatives in the mainstream vegan diet.  Not saying its impossible to be a healthy vegan, but the way its proposed in mainstream outlets is probably not healthy.   I eat yogurt everyday.  I too am lucky to know my source.  Most people can't afford that luxury.

       Absolutely! I am a pre-menopausal woman, I should have limited soy in my diet, to prevent cancers. Corn was the big filler for decades and now everything has soy. That's why we're seeing children, men, women with obvious hormone disruptions. (I mean, beyond the birth control in our water and growth hormones in our food! Yeehaw, it's overwhelming) I should make my own almond milk and if I moved back to the Hippie Valley, I'd have access to more local dairy, including goat cheese where you can go pet the goats!

       I was really surprised that when I moved to the Berkshires that the green/locavore movement never got here. It's sad really. The place was industrially abused for so long that if organic farmers wanted to expand, their land options are limited. GE is still fighting a river clean up they were ordered to do 15 years ago. My dog can't swim in the creek 2 blocks from my house because of PCBs. The EPA utterly failed these people. Cancer and special needs kids are 8x the state average.

       Somewhere last year I started eating less meat, meals now include salmon and on occasion chicken. Can't really eat pork and beef, really fcks up my stomach. Never really ate pork because I saw one getting slaughtered when I was 5 y/o in rural Poland (I wanted to pet it, followed the men and pig and saw its neck being slit. I will never forget the look on its face, the sound and smell. Never cried so much aswell), and after that and seeing Okja I really just can't bear to eat it anymore. Just makes me sad. This whole industry is very... fcked up.

       JERF. Just Eat Real Food. 
Eat naturally grazed beef. Field chickens. Support your local farmer. Avoid non organic at all cost. Literally all costs. You can pay more now for food or pay later for health costs. It’s not the meat but the chemicals in them and in all food (vegetables are sprayed with so much chemical it’s sickening). I’ve seen cave drawings, they carry spears.
