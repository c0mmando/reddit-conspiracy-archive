       How is it possible that a person who works in the White House has such poor opsec that they would even have a spying device like that in their home and then advertise that fact to the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this a conspiracy to leak sensitive info through sheer stupidity or what?
      </p>
      <p>
       How long before Bezos is using shit said by ignorant govt officials for nefarious purposes? Or even "better", how long before Chinese or Russian hackers have an open mic in her house 😂
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't the deep state supposedly after Trump? Why would anyone working that high up in his WH be allowed such a device, even at home? People who work with classified or sensitive info are taught better opsec arent they? For some clearances i know they have to take polygraphs and be evaluated regularly. Wouldnt "hey do you have IoT spying devices bugging your place of residence" be a good question?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: why isnt everyone who works in the Whitehouse using Boeing Blacks?

       Why shouldnt she have it?

        If the cia is going to spy on her its going to spy on her
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Anyone high up enough for top ppl to spy on them isnt safe anyway. She has a cell phone. Thats even worse. Shes also followed by reporters and camera crews
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Yes its stupid. Amazon echo is a waste of money even if it was safe. Are you really so lazy you can't type amazon.com into the search bar? You can't pull your phone out of your pocket check whatever you need to  check?

       Sounds like you should subscribe to r/hacking and r/privacy. There are ways to force mic and camera communications off when needed. Back doors are constantly updated as well. You can force a high frequency next to mic as well if that paranoid and barely puts a toll on battery life. There are ways.

       I am sure the government has special secured networks for their officials to use when off duty. Why not? Anything connected to the internet and turned on, is a security risk for these elected officials, even in the privacy of their own home. So even if she does have the echo, the technology is probably secured by some type of U.S. military security program.

       Even if that's the case, you can secure the network as much as you want. The device's sole purpose is still to send snippets of audio to Amazon, which could inadvertently include sensitive information.

       The secure network is called the sipr. It requires certain security measures.

       Obviously, the idea of "secured" networks is pretty far-fetched in this day and age, but is it not reasonable to assume that governments CAN protect their own officials? I'm no computer geek, but it would seem a little obvious that certain workers are required to follow security protocol when accessing the internet, from anywhere. Example: Hillary Clinton used a private email server, breaking the rules.

       This may not be the movies but there are secure facilities around the world like Pine Gap, Menwith Hill, Area 51, and all those sorts of places that are basically giant SCIFs. Boeing Black is a thing. There is shit out there with regards to computer security that makes the movies seem tame.

       Even civilian security can be relatively high tech. Look at Skyport servers.

       Does the white house press secretary have access to classified info? After all, they speak to the press... so why would they need to know anything classified?

       Maybe not classified, but discussions of how to present matters to the press likely include information not intended for the public. It's probably a minor thing TBH, but doesn't seem great for someone in that position.

       I think the west wing does a good job at showing this. Sometimes they're flat out lied to. Sometimes they're told the truth so they can spin better
      </p>
      <p>
       They do have a security clearance but they're not national security so there isn't always a need to know which is generally supposed to be a requirement and has been more heavily enforced since Manning and Snowden just trolled through entire areas they had no legitimate need to know and thus shouldn't have even had access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus there's tons of people with security clearance in the military that never actually access classified information. Those things are handed out like candy to any 18 year old high school graduate. You could go an entire 6 year enlistment and never have a need to know something so never access a classified document
      </p>
      <p>
       Security clearances are really just indicative of the depth of the background check
      </p>
      <p>
       For my secret they didn't even go talk to my references in person. For my ts people were interviewed multiple times. They don't even polygraph you unless you're in intelligence I didnt get one until a specific assignment

       Any information that a person wants to keep private can be used as blackmail. For example: A person takes anti-depressants, having marital issues, or health problems. These are problems that many people openly talk about in their home, but are fiercely protective of this information outside of it.

       Sounds like you should subscribe to r/hacking and r/privacy. There are ways to force mic and camera communications off when needed. Back doors are constantly updated as well. You can force a high frequency next to mic as well if that paranoid and barely puts a toll on battery life. There are ways.
