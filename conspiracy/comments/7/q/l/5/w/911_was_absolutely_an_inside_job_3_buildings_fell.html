       What kind of cell phone did you have in 2001?
Did it have a video camera?  Think about the tech then vs now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yhea, there are lots of cameras in Washington, but how many of them are pointed at the exterior of the pentagon? Also why would the pentagon record the exterior of their premsis? They had/have cameras at the entrances, as well they have armed security patrolling the perimeter. The FBI has released 3 or 4 videos that they confiscated, that show anything.
      </p>

       with 2 new videos released of the aftermath, and they got voted down pretty quick (probably cause they showed plane parts and no one planting evidence).  Yet invariably in every 9/11 thread these mysterious vidoes come up.  Its bizarre.

       Anyways, there were plenty of cameras catching the missile that hit the pentagon in sept 2001, but as its well documented, FBI went in minutes later and took all the videos they could find.

       The FBI didnt , however, confiscate any video from the Hudson landing.

       You "think" there were cameras that would catch the impact.  That is your opinion.

      <p>
       I gave you a list of the 83 videos they have, that is fact.
      </p>

       I used the cell camera analogy to demonstrate the proliferation of personal recording devices.  I will also add the population density of NYC vs that surrounding the pentagon for your to think about.

       Even the info wars article acknowledges that the tapes probably don't show the plane impact.  SO what do you want here? The link I gave you is the primary source for the info wars article. As a result of a FOIA request (from the owner of that site) 2 of these 84 videos was released in the past week.  So its highly likely as time passes we will see more of these videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I  don't know why they haven't been released all of them.  I speculate that anything of note could be used in the KSM trial, and they could hold something in reserve in the off chance they capture Bin Laidn.  That's just my guess though.

       So you do believe the govt is telling you the truth when they say a 757 flew ground level into the pentagon, and not one eye witness on the bumper-to-bumper rush-hour beltway (200 or so yards away) heard or felt a plane overhead?

       Yeah the dude who saw the plane I think it was a taxi driver like the guy said was iffy on what he saw anyhow. One eye witness is not good enough. I see shit all the time that I swear was there or happened in a certain way but later on i find out my eyes or ears had deceived me.

       Dude, a twin engine 757 flew over the beltway literally a few feet above the roofs of about 100 cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least, there should be 100s of people saying they heard the load roar of the engine shaking their cars and it was deafening.  Some of the cars should have even been blown off the road from the jet backwash.

       Oh yeah I didn't even think about cars being blown off the road from jet backwash. Hell when I have a problem and I have to park my car on the shoulder lane on a major highway I can usually feel my car move when other vehicles are wizzing by at 60 or 70 mph.

       This isnt me, you talk to any air traffic controller or watch the dozens of documentaries on 9/11.  If a plane hit that low on the pentagon (ground level), the backwash from those jets would effect some cars, they did tests in europe with a 757.  forget that, the sound alone, you should have 100s of ppl saying, " I heard a loud roar, like something was gonna crash on me.."

       People still believe that a missile hit the Pentagon? I suppose you're going to say all the eye witnesses that saw the plane are liars and that all the plane parts seen on the lawn were planted there!

       Why do you fucking jump to conclusions, you cockmongering assface? He is just questioning the official story of a plane hitting the Pentagon. No one is saying a missile hit the Pentagon, that is just one random theory. Questioning the weak ass official story is much more important than guessing what may have really happened. God damn you fuckface!

       How about 2 or 3 eye witness video interviews of a plumber going to work and a soccer mom going to the store who claim to have seen a huge 757 scream over the beltway.

      <p>
       Oh what?  you cant find any either?

       Tons of videos for the towers though, theres like 1000s of eye witness video interview accounts of that.

       This is not about the Pentagon. It is about the towers in New York. The Pentagon is a diversion from the truth. The towers is the solid undeniable scientific evidence, so obviously the Pentagon was as well. Debating it is pointless. We know already.

       I think youre lying.  B/c the news would have reported on him (or someone else who saw it)   No eye witnesses on the beltway to be found.  If i saw like a couple of news reports documenting eye witnesses of that day saying they heard this loud ass twin engine jet slam into the pentagon, then yeah, ill believe you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since I cant find any reports, and it seems neither can you, then its as if a missile or something smaller hit the pentagon.

       I cant find "lots" of accounts.  I find the same 2 or 3 witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's the 100s of witnesses?  or at least 10s of witnesses they had the time to interview?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about a witness that was in rush hour traffic, theres gotta be 100 ppl that saw that thing up close from the beltway.  Ill take 5 eye witness video accounts of the interview from the day.  Where are they though?    a friggin text transcript from a pilot? yeah ok,  how about a carpenter or some lay person.  If i get just one interview from some soccer mom or a laborer on his way to work, then thatll be good enough for me.
      </p>

       I assumed these interviews existed. but i cant find any.

       If what youre saying is true then why do we have literally 1000s of ppl being interviewed at ground zero, a place no one would want to be, by every major media outlet, foreign and domestic minutes after the buildings were pulled, yet i cant get 1 friggin video interview of a soccer mom / or construction worker on the beltway that morning that saw a 757 fly ground level and slam into the pentagon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah i guess youre right, so for some reason, no one wanted to be on tv that morning, b/c you know, random citizens on the beltway who see 757s slam into govt buildings hate to be on tv. They must have just wanted to go to work and get their jobs done for the day.
      </p>

       That makes perfect sense....if you have brain damage, LOL!

       Actually, no went to work that day.  Most businesses in the DC metro area were closed for almost a week.  Everyone in their cars in DC wanted to turnaround and go home.
      </p>
      <p>
       The commuters workers in NYC mostly ride the subway to work.  They were on foot walking to work.  Hence, easier for a reporter to grab them than someone in their car on the interstate leaving DC.

       nice text, got any of this on video?  like we have for all the interviews done near the twin towers at ground zero on 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems the handful of eyewitness video is really just interviews done months later.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need same day footage, with interviews of eye witnesses, ive seen none.  Local news and network would have been all over this like they were in NY.

       No one can deny WTC7 fell at free fall speed.  Everyone has seen the video of the guy on tv (silverstein?) saying they were gonna "pull it".  Many witnesses reported a countdown prior to its collapse along with explosions.  WTC7 was demolished.  End of discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If WTC7 was rigged with explosives, which it was, then the other 2 WTC buildings that fell that day(at or near freefall speed)were also rigged with explosives.  And if those other 2 buildings were rigged with explosives, then 9/11 WAS AN INSIDE JOB!

       NIST does, along with most who care to use their brains.  Near free fall and free fall are two vastly different things.  Inside jobbers however use them interchangeable and at parity.

       When were the explosives planted?
By whom?
Why did no one see them?
Why were no explosives found?
Why were no explosives heard?
How were they detonated?
Who detonated them?
Why were then not damaged by the fires/plane impacts?
Why did the collapse start from the top?
Why has not 1 single person come forward to blow the whistle...

       So was it thermit(?), or conventional explosives, since you seem to be hedging with sulpher and explosions.

       Wait, thermite is self oxidizing and ceases reacting once the fuel is gone.  How does it burn for weeks after?

       Thermite heats up quicker than metal cools down, obviously.  The thermite is gone, but the heat is still there, trapped under tons of debris.

       All right, it would be more correct to say that the thermite is not an explosive but is used to cut supporting beams by burning quickly at high temperature, creating a clean break. Thermite is actually a "pyrotechnic initiator."

      <p>
       Because a thermite reaction (as opposed to a conventionally-started fire) is extremely difficult to smother, even under tons of debris. Which would, of course, continue to be the fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The introduction of aluminum (such as the skin of an airplane fuselage) produces a mixture of oxides which
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       create secondary explosions. Further, pouring water (from a sprinkler system or fire hoses) on a thermite reaction only spreads burning fragments. The reaction continues, even under water.

       There are real logistical questions as hundreds if not thousands of these cutter charges would be needed.

       Which bring us to the first and most important point.  There is no evidence of controlled demolition.

       Incredible how you and others find the official story more compelling than the real story. Consider 9/11 not unique to the human experience: it's one among many government actions taken to secure political control since the beginning of time. You know the precedents - Gulf of Tonkin, the sinking of the Lusitania, Hitler burning the Reichstag. If anybody of authority really cared about civilian safety, not only would we have seen first responders receive proper medical treatment but our military industrial complex would be replaced by quality health and education. And Palestinian children wouldn't be sacrificed to ideologies either. Open your eyes, wake up. It's a bigger picture than just steel bending over to fire.

       You can ignite thermate with bundles of Sparklers. It isn't hard. You can ignite it with a magnesium-infused paste that sticks to the beams you want to cut. All that's really necessary is that there be a fire somewhere in the structure, and that the fire gets close enough to the magnesium to ignite it, which raises the temperature of the thermate enough to ignite

        NIST does, along with most who care to use their brains. Near free fall and free fall are two vastly different things. Inside jobbers however use them interchangeable and at parity.

       This pretty poor argument; for one "free fall" is impossible to attain on Earth so yes they are used pretty much interchangably.

       You see the amount of upvotes? All of those people and I realize that 9/11 was an inside job and science says so. Any discussion with you would be like arguing over whether 1+1=2. It does and you can't convince me otherwise. I will openly proclaim it to anyone without doubt.

       While debating if your copy/paste even deserves another reply, I decided I need to point out the fact that I haven't even stated my opinion on 9/11, one way or the other.  So don't tell me what arguing with me would be like when all I'm saying is the discussion about what really happened clearly isn't over.

       Simpler to just use the actual planes. Let's assume that there was a missile. Then what happened to Flight 77? Presumably the passengers would have to be off-loaded--and then silenced, murdered, to keep them from talking. If they are required to be dead anyway, why not just keep them aboard the planes to die in the crashes?

       I am a strong supporter of an international, public investigation into the attacks of 9/11. I do not think the government's account could possibly be true. So much rides on this event. It's time to face the truth.

       The buildings did not fall at free fall speed. look at any video of the collapse of the towers and you can clearly see debris ejected from the buildings falling much faster than the buildings themselves. USGS seismology records indicate that it took more than 18 seconds for WTC 7 to collapse. That's hardly free fall speed.

       Consider this.  NIST actually admits that WTC7 fell at free-fall speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that for the majority of the collapse the upper floors encountered no resistance from the lower floors on the way down.

       No, David Chandler (a high school physics teacher) interprets NISTS 2 responses to his and Jones question to mean something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys completely ignore the fact that collapse progression began 3-4 seconds before global collapse.  By ignoring the collapse initiation (in the mechanical penthouse) all their calculations are non starters.  Even his own model shows "near" free fall for 2 seconds, while ignoring the beginning of the collapse.

       what? you're looking at the wrong information.

       Based on what Chandler brought up NIST changed the data contained in

        their
       </em>
       report!
      </p>
      <p>
       This ultimately shows that for 2.5 seconds the building gave zero resistance to the collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       nobody is ignoring the beginning of the collapse, it's just not the important part of this particular argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       chandler clearly shows exactly what you're talking about in the video.  so what that the collapse was slower at the beginning?  nobody expects the building to vanish instantaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       once it reaches-free fall speed you need to ask yourself... now how is it exactly that for two and a half seconds, a solid structure is offering the same amount of resistance as thin air?
      </p>
      <p>
       ** also, those 2.5 seconds in question are not "near" free-fall speed, they match free-fall speed.  People say "near" free-fall speed to refer to the collapses of WTC 1&amp;2 because they fell within a couple seconds of the acceleration of gravity.  This evidence shows this building matched that speed almost exactly for a period of time.

       I did.  Chandler's question was pretty ambiguous and his commentary spliced into the response threw me.

       <p>
        In a video, it appears that WTC 7 is descending in free fall, something that would not occur in the structural collapse that you describe. How can you ignore basic laws of physics?
In the draft WTC 7 report (released Aug. 21, 2008; available at
        <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/media/NIST_NCSTAR_1A_for_public_comment.pdf">
         http://wtc.nist.gov/media/NIST_NCSTAR_1A_for_public_comment.pdf
        </a>
        ), NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions. During the public comment period on the draft report, NIST was asked to confirm this time difference and define the reasons for it in greater detail.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To further clarify the descent of the north face, NIST recorded the downward displacement of a point near the center of the roofline from first movement until the north face was no longer visible in the video. Numerical analyses were conducted to calculate the velocity and acceleration of the roofline point from the time-dependent displacement data. The instant at which vertical motion of the roofline first occurred was determined by tracking the numerical value of the brightness of a pixel (a single element in the video image) at the roofline. This pixel became brighter as the roofline began to descend because the color of the pixel started to change from that of the building façade to the lighter color of the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       The approach taken by NIST is summarized in Section 3.6 of the final summary report, NCSTAR 1A (released Nov. 20, 2008; available at
       <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201A.pdf">
        http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201A.pdf
       </a>
       ) and detailed in Section 12.5.3 of NIST NCSTAR 1-9 (available at
       <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201-9%20Vol%202.pdf">
        http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201-9%20Vol%202.pdf
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:
      </p>
      <pre><code>* Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
* Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
* Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity
</code></pre>
      <p>
       This analysis showed that the 40 percent longer descent time—compared to the 3.9 second free fall time—was due primarily to Stage 1, which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories of the north face. During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above. In Stage 3, the acceleration decreased as the upper portion of the north face encountered increased resistance from the collapsed structure and the debris pile below.

        Link
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So as it stands the conclusion that the collapse was 40% less than free fall stands. With the logic that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is consistent with the structural analysis model which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above.

       So we either have to assume hundreds of scientists at NIST are willing participants in a massive cover up, or a high school physics teacher is wrong.  Touch Choice.

       Well, you're still arguing that the overall collapse did not equal free-fall.  Nobody is arguing against you, so there really isn't a need to elaborate any more on that point.

       It's not negligible support, it's

       Do you have a case study where a 47 steel framed building burned for seven hours and didn't collapse?  Did it have long span floor trusses?  Just because something happened for the first time doesn't make it impossible.  Do you have an example of a 47 story building being brought down by cd?

       you are absolutely correct that there would be additional force through acceleration, however this force would be mostly negligible due to the short distance the upper floors have to fall. It would take an extreme amount of force to push through steel and concrete and have their impact to any object be almost non-existent.

         forum posters arguing over validity of data, decide that video is wrong due to innacuracies in software, camera angles, points chosen, etc.

        <p>
         forum posters realize NIST concludes the same idea they are trying to discredit. (david chandler also chimes in)

       <li>
        <p>
         some decent arguments, and then the thread devolves into name calling and strawman arguments.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       the only semi-reasonable counter arguments presented in your link are the points that you've just brought up, that the alternate theory is that 'the weight of the walls were heavy enough to push through concrete and steel without stopping'
      </p>
      <p>
       there was also one other theory that someone came up with about the core of the tower being yanked downwards prior to collapse, this theory is not endorsed by any agency as far as I'm aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can believe that the exterior of the structure can just fall to the ground encountering no resistance from the building structure that it was placed on, because it's just that heavy... well, you're welcome to continue believing it.  it just doesn't seem very believable.

       How many other buildings have you seen collapse under the same circumstances as WTC 7? I don't think that many collapses in the history of the world have occured due to the impact from two other, bigger buildings in the same area. How can you judge how a building in that situation is supposed to fall? What are you comparing it to when you say Buildings don't collapse like this?

       Not necessarily, it looks like it was hit but just didn't fall. I am not an architect or an engineer so I do not pretend to understand how the debris would affect a building, nor do I have accurate footage of the rubble hitting WTC 6 and 7 to judge what exactly happened to each. From the pictures it looks like 6 was bigger and maybe had a firmer foundation than 7 which could be why it stood up. A better question would be, what possible reason could there have been for demolitioning WTC 7? What purpose could it server and why not blow the other buildings while they were at it then?

       Certainly there's a great deal of complexity to the physics of the destruction at the WTC that day. Engineers and other experts are better positioned than the average person to make sense of what happened. But I don't think that precludes an average person like you or me from forming tentative opinions. To me it doesn't make sense that the falling debris would have a greater destructive impact on WTC 7 than WTC 6. I am not asking you to rely on my impression, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your idea that WTC 6 might have survived as a result of being bigger than WTC 7, consider WTC 3. It was smaller than WTC 7 and much closer to both twin towers.
       <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/wtc/WTC_ch3.htm#fig-3-7">
        After the collapse of WTC 2, parts of the building remained essentially intact
       </a>
       . The collapse of WTC 1 did a great deal of additional damage to WTC 3, but
       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/?p=1446">
        it did not suffer progressive collapse
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst damage to WTC 7 before its collapse was on its south side. The west, north and east sides had suffered relatively little damage. If you want more information about this you can find videos on Youtube such as
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4SEhMpbo74">
        this
       </a>
       , or
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO_BHMHC2Yo&amp;amp;feature=related">
        this
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the late Barry Jennings,
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQY-ksiuwKU&amp;amp;feature=related">
        massive explosions were taking place in WTC 7
       </a>
       before either twin tower fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that many engineers have made public presentations intended to refute the official theory, while other engineers have come out in support of the official theory.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A better question would be, what possible reason could there have been for demolitioning WTC 7? What purpose could it server and why not blow the other buildings while they were at it then?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't agree that this is a better question. In my opinion, the physical evidence speaks for itself. Further, in the absence of a public confession, any theories about motive can only be speculation. Speculation cannot be proven; it can add no evidence to bolster the case. On the other hand, if you find such speculation unconvincing, that does not change the physical evidence and the conclusions to be drawn from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen such speculation criticized with the argument that inside job conspirators surely would have pulled off such a crime more competently, leaving fewer clues of their complicity. Thus an inside job is not plausible. According to this mindset, a suspect is less likely to have committed a crime the more irrationally the evidence would suggest he behaved. Do you think the blood found on O.J. Simpson's property exonerates him on the basis that he could not have been stupid enough to let investigators discover it there?
      </p>
      <p>
       So although I have some thoughts about why WTC 7 might have been demolished, I do not wish to present them.

       while wtc7 was most likely pulled, the other two did not appear to be.  the north tower had its remaining core still standing after it fell, it wasn't a clean fall at all.    I guess you'll just have to go through a few more weekends of staying up late at night and reviewing the videos over and over until you form your own opinion that happens to fall in line with common sense/physics.

       Look, if you have evidence that a crucial piece of information invalidates the official story, then the official story is invalid. You don't have to provide a detailed account of the resulting conspiracy for there to be a conspiracy. That's methodological, not evidential. "A crucial piece of evidence invalidates the government story" is his point. He doesn't have to give you names and addresses of conspirators in order for his logic to be valid.

       North Tower seems peculiar to me because when it starts falling the top intact portion, the one with the antenna attached, leans strongly in one direction.  One would predict that this portion would increasingly lean in this direction.  However, the antenna actually straightens out a bit on descent, counter to what would be expected.  The behavior seems to indicate that the surrounding air was providing more resistance than the building itself.  9/11 seems to have been path-of-most-resistance day.

       I don't think any choices need to be made, it sounds like we're all saying the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, you're still arguing that the overall collapse did not equal free-fall.  Nobody is arguing against you, so there really isn't a need to elaborate any more on that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The important part of your argument is here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not negligible support, it's
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       support.  No support at all.  And, exterior columns aside, what about interior columns.  Aside from the exterior columns, there were 24 interior steel box columns, and other supports that were solid steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it possible that for that period of time these things just seemed to vanish from the interior of the building?
      </p>
      <p>
       Buildings don't collapse like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget NIST and their computer models assert that the building collapsed due to
       <a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/wtc082108.html">
        Fires &amp; Thermal Expansion
       </a>
       , something that has never before caused a building like this to collapse.  And somehow they managed to come to this conclusion by conducting a 7 year long investigation using
       <a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/wtc_qa_082108.html">
