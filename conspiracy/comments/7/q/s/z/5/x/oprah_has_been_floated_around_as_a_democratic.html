I&#39;m not saying the democrats like Oprah enough to make her a candidate but celebrity support, especially a respected black female, is important to any candidate. Is this a real allegation or a paid attack against Seal. To me, it seems too convenient for everyone except Seal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry, friend. We never had a chance in 2016 to avoid Trump because the media kept the spotlight on him perpetually and the DNC actively encouraged them to do so with the idea that a Trump vs Clinton showdown would be a slam-dunk for Democrats. Pied-piper candidate. </p>

<p>Were it not for those two major factors I doubt he would have gained the momentum he did. If they let the American public ignore his nonsense instead of shoving it in our faces 24/7 he wouldn&#39;t be sitting in the oval office.</p>

<p>That being said - the media clearly hasn&#39;t learned their lesson. For example, they had a collective orgasm when Trump said (or didn&#39;t say) &#39;shithole countries&#39;. A lot of the reaction to his comment was supportive to his comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is this thing called &quot;context,&quot; and the video I posted provides some. She is saying that things are getting much better in regard to racism. Then she says that it won&#39;t disappear completely until people who grew up in that era die.<br/>
It&#39;s a much different statement than what it&#39;s being implied to mean. The really funny thing is that people pushing this old quote as news are saying how &quot;divisive&quot; it is when they&#39;re using a a 25 second clip out of context to intentionally be divisive. These are the same people that call the left &quot;snowflakes.&quot;<br/>
Sorry but the truth is that if someone was raised a racist in a culture of racism there is very little chance they will stop being a racist as long as they are alive. That is what she&#39;s saying and it is true.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem here is that I didn&#39;t say Trump was a racist. You&#39;re using a strawman argument.<br/>
But I&#39;ll help you out. I do think he is a racist. Unfortunately, that is beside the point.  And I don&#39;t think that Oprah&#39;s statement was racist.<br/>
But instead of getting into that, consider your own statement. If you think Trump is not a racist then you definitely can&#39;t think that Oprah is, based on your own logic.<br/>
It&#39;s easier to leave racism out of it and just look at the facts. Oprah started out poor and built a billion dollar fortune using her own talents and intelligence, against all odds. Trump was born rich. He and Hillary share a common ancestor,<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/25/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-are-related-genealogy/"> by the way</a>. You&#39;d have to be a fool to see him as an outsider. Whoever gets elected they&#39;re part of the same families that have held power for hundreds if not thousands of years.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might be literally the only liberal in this entire sub who admits that this sub is <em>not</em> a Trump cirlcejerk. In most threads, the people getting upvoted in the comments are the ones speaking out against trump. The people getting upvoted are the ones saying &quot;This sub is so controlled by Trump supporters.&quot; Then how do those comments get upvoted? They usually respond by claiming it&#39;s because the thread made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but we see anti Trump comments at the top of threads that aren&#39;t even the top post in this sub. </p>

<p>Then we can talk about anti-Trump submissions. These do really well in this sub, which I will prove below. Guess what the excuse is? people claim the submissions were upvoted so high because they were on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Oh really? How did the post make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in the first place if this sub is &quot;controlled by Trump supporters?&quot; </p>

<p>There are a lot more than this, but this is what I could dig up from a quick search. Notice you never see anyone claim &quot;this sub is a T_D circlejerk&quot; in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don&#39;t exist and continue with the anti-<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub. </p>

<p>Pay close attention to the upvote percentages. </p>

<p>If you check the comments of supposedly &quot;pro-Trump&quot; posts, anti-Trump comments reign supreme. There&#39;s nothing really wrong with that, but the people claiming this sub is one giant pro-Trump conspiracy are deluding themselves. Some people try to claim all of this is explained because this or that post hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but that&#39;s complete bullshit. Posts that don&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> are also very anti-Trump in the comments. Anti-Trump posts also couldn&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in the first place if they weren&#39;t heavily upvoted in this sub before they reached <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

<p>To the people who claim anti-Trump comments can be explained because some threads in this sub make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, I&#39;ll show you a thread that is below a 1000 with anti-Trump comments. In fact, many of the posts above never made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but to be conservative, I&#39;ll keep the threshold under a 1000 to guarantee that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regulars are the ones making and upvoting these comments. </p>

<p>Check out the top comment on this 755 upvote anti-Trump post: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76qr7j/just_a_friendly_reminder_that_trumps_labor/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76qr7j/just_a_friendly_reminder_that_trumps_labor/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, wrong party. Won&#39;t get traction. Change the name trump to Hillary to get the conspiracy community to take notice&quot;</p>

<p>Also just pay more attention to the upvotes/downvotes in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> threads from now on.  Pay attention to that  and the propaganda just doesn&#39;t make any sense anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed this as well. I am a progressive that leans very far left, but I have no more love for Hillary/DNC than I do for Trump/RNC. </p>

<p>I, as many fellow conspiracy theorists, believe that the government as a WHOLE is corrupt. That the left vs right/blue vs red paradigm is empty and hollow. It is a method of polarizing the masses to keep them divided and conquered.</p>

<p>I personally feel that the overly partisan comments on these threads are meant to derail topics and prevent real discussion from happening.</p>

<p>But you are absolutely right. According to up votes the majority of users on this sub are anti trump/pro dnc. </p>

<p>Whether this is because the actual community leans left, or because there are companies paying &quot;users&quot; to push a pro dnc rhetoric is another question all together. </p>

I think with the submission statement rules and the two mods that were removed this place is running a lot more smoothly. we used to be bombarded with pizzagate posts and other outdated hillary submissions, especially on days where there was news about trump. it was very obvious. for some reason i think those forces have been weakened or left. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the posts I cited are from 11 months ago, 7 months ago, 3 months ago, recent, etc. The reason I did this is because a counter argument to the point in my post is &quot;It used to be really bad, but it&#39;s all better due to this and this.&quot; </p>

<p>Even if the people who hate this sub believed that, which by and large they do not, it doesn&#39;t stop the constant claims that this subreddit is totally controlled by Trump shills. I&#39;m guessing that a person like you is very unlikely to defend the sub when others claim it&#39;s a trump shill haven. Have you ever defended it using this counter argument? That signals to me that you are looking for a reason to explain the obvious discrepancy between what I have proven and what is claimed about the sub on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Now that you know the posts I&#39;ve cited are from various dates, up to and beyond the &quot;6 months&quot; you have claimed, does that change your mind? </p>

<p>There are some Trump supporters in here, but it can&#39;t even be 50 percent. These posts I cited are upvoted with very high percentages of upvotes. If this sub had 50 percent Trump supporters, it will completely prevent these kinds of posts from happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re talking about the theory that there was another program under MK Ultra called Monarch. MK Ultra has been confirmed, admitted to and well documented. Monarch is not and would fall under the category of conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>They are right, MK Ultra was a HUGE program to explore mind control and LSD was very compelling to the government and experimenting with it was a large part of the program. It ended up being an extremely ineffective mind control tool and often had the opposite effect of opening the mind.  IE: Ken Kesey had never used LSD before he was dosed but his world opened up because of it and he went on to promote the use of LSD for mind expansion and well being. </p>

<p>Not to say the CIA wasn’t absolutely horrible for what they did with MK U because they hurt a lot of people and did awful things, but the supposed program you are speaking of is a theory based largely on claims by Cathleen O’Brien who wrote a book about her years enslaved by the CIA as a sex slave/spy etc... Her claims are severely inconsistent  and those inconsistencies are evident to anyone that has read it with a discerning eye. As well as her subsequent interviews. The book actually reads like incredibly outrageous fan-fiction. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t mean any disrespect, but that statement isn&#39;t actually true.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have access to my personal bookmarks, at the moment, but people have been publicly discussing Oprah&#39;s role in Weinstein&#39;s exploits for quite some time, now -- especially on blind gossip sites and other &quot;conspiracy&quot; forums. For instance, a photo of Oprah personally introducing a young (and rather terrified-looking) Brittany Murphy to Weinstein was making the rounds on the Internet months before Oprah&#39;s infamous speech, and also receiving quite a bit of attention and commentary from readers.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I do agree with your assertion that &quot;trolls on both sides&quot; have been using allegations to tear down their enemies, but I think it&#39;s important to note the fact that, in truth, Oprah <em>has</em> actually been accused of being heavily involved with serial sexual offenders (such as Weinstein and Geffen) for a long time. These accusations did not only begin after her speech. Furthermore, there does appear to be some merit to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you&#39;re totally correct. Thank you for pointing that out, and my sincerest apologies for the labeling error; though the woman in the photo was initially identified as Murphy, it was later learned to have been Rita Ora, instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s really fucked. Damn. Even if someone like Oprah wasn&#39;t doing it maliciously, you had to have heard the rumors about Weinstein, known the backroom talk about him. You have to known and not cared or known and been a part of the abuse. Neither option is great. </p>

<p>But you didn&#39;t notice a real uptick in articles posted here about her negatively after her speech? It seemed like it was literally overnight, I&#39;d read a bunch of articles from MSM sources and conspiracy circles about Weinstein and never saw her mentioned. Suddenly, she was like a kingpin in all this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes; it&#39;s absolutely insane that Oprah was never fully investigated over her &quot;school&quot;, and that she still receives so much respect from people, at large. She&#39;s every bit as fake as the rest of these celebrities and leaders, and has no shame, ethics or self-awareness. It&#39;s maddening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t notice such an uptick in articles, myself, but I don&#39;t doubt you, at all, that it did occur. Personally, I had come across so many mentions of Oprah being involved in illicit activity, prior to the speech, that I honestly just didn&#39;t think twice about it being mentioned, again, following her speech -- though I probably should have been suspicious of it, given the timing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid my personal bias likely tainted my perception of it all, in this instance.</p>

<p>The whole situation really is incredibly bizarre. You have all of these high profile figures, like Oprah, who have been repeatedly accused of corrupt activities by &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, independent researchers, and blind gossip enthusiasts, online. Then, a major incident occurs (such as her infamous speech), and this corruption is suddenly exposed to the general public on a large level. And then...nothing. Though people are still chatting about it, it doesn&#39;t appear that her career has really suffered, and Oprah certainly doesn&#39;t appear to be facing any criminal or civil charges, at this time.</p>

<p>The same thing has occurred with Bryan Singer and other notorious &quot;abusers&quot;. Their depraved acts and corruption have been exposed to the public, but they haven&#39;t been arrested -- or, seemingly, ever been held accountable for their actions. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, other public figures (such as Seal), have been accused at opportune times, but those accusations fade rather quickly, as well.</p>

<p>So...is it all a PsyOp? Or, as you mentioned, just a way for the opposing side to take down enemies? Both options seem plausible -- and both could be occurring, simultaneously. I wish we knew what was <em>really</em> happening, behind the scenes.</p>

<p>All in all, I think you summed it up perfectly with your first sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s really fucked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really, truly is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seal is being accused of groping a woman without her consent, which is full blown sexual assault. Sexual misconduct is anything you want it to be, could just be asking a girl out on a date or watching porn. It’s a purposely nebulous term so that anyone can accuse anyone of it if they wish to smear them or get attention. It’s much easier to do this if you want to smear people, which makes me think, given that he is being accused of actual sexual assault, it probably isn’t a smear campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeh but look at James Franco. The girl accused him of “sexual misconduct” because he got annoyed when at the last minute she decided she wasn’t gonna get nude for a scene, despite it being in the script and despite the fact she had already agreed and signed up to doing it. That’s what can constitute as “sexual misconduct”, and it’s way, way easier to accuse people of that than to invent  sexual assault allegations, which can be fought with libel laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in the Franco example, what got called “sexual misconduct” probably did actually happen. That’s what makes it easier. Sexual misconduct can be anything you want it to be, it’s a totally nebulous, ambiguous term. So it’s easy to find at least one thing that someone has really done which you can call sexual misconduct, even if it was actually very innocuous. But the fact that it actually happened, and the fact that the term “sexual misconduct” is so vague, makes it much harder to fight with libel laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, evidence would be he hasn&#39;t started any wars yet. That&#39;s great for the common man who supply the bodies. He&#39;s executed what looks like a fairly effective strategy to de-escalate the NK issue without military action. He&#39;s calling for the end of global aid that&#39;s funding regimes who support aggression towards the West. </p>

<p>Beyond this though I think he&#39;ll be free to attack the Washington swamp more directly once this silly investigation ends, which is why it&#39;s dragging on forever. Even to have a sitting president critically tweet about the Deep State is a huge improvement over the quiet expansion of unelected power structures we would&#39;ve had with any other president except maybe Sanders.</p>

<p>&quot;Chappelle said on Inside the Actors Studio that the death of his father seven years prior influenced his decision to go to South Africa. By throwing himself into his work, he had not taken a chance to mourn his father&#39;s death. He also said the rumors that he was in drug or psychiatric treatment only persuaded him to stay in South Africa&quot;</p>

<p>pretty sure he actually went to africa</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dave was never compromised in that way. His content today is mostly consistent with his work before he left the Chapelle show. If you watch Dave&#39;s final special, he explains why he left the show. He was afraid that he would at some point be manipulated and coerced by those very people that gave him the show. He was getting too famous, too popular, and by all means, &quot;used up&quot; by comedy central. He wanted to get out before he saw himself go down a path with his career that would have been carved out for him by richer and more powerful people, against his own interests. Perhaps there was a perceived criminal element there, real or not. He also hints at this in said special. Dave is a strong personality with a fierce sense of independence. When he felt he was getting himself into potentially dangerous territory, he got the fuck out. It was a smart move, and it paid off. He got to lay low for a decade more or less, live at his own pace, and escape all that attention. Sure enough, he came back and made 60 Million from a contract with Netflix for some specials. The tone didn&#39;t change too much, his content stayed more or less the same, although it is very apparent that after his first set of specials, and his SNL bit, he received a lot of flak for being moderate, and changed his tune for his second to last special (probably as a concession to Netflix who would &quot;coax&quot; him into taking a &quot;clearer stance&quot; on issues important to their viewers). If anything that is the conspiracy, that Netflix pushed Dave to cooperate with a fixed narrative anyway. We&#39;re not talking CIA MK Ultra mind control techniques, this is the power of money at work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The go-to tactic for one side has always been to label the other side X-phobic or X-ist. Usually they use race, but lately they&#39;ve been using sex. Specifically, they&#39;ve moved past accusations of merely being sexist and have begun crafting accusations of actual sexual misconduct (or, when that doesn&#39;t stick, sexual crimes). </p>

<p>They&#39;ve tested out the process on a bunch of celebrities over the last two years. They got better at it each time. They successfully used the process to affect elections/politics all at once in several states a few months ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean her only known public role was to exploit people on television for profit. Technically Jerry Springer held more civic duty and obligation then Oprah?

<p>Unless I am the sole survivor of the earths dimension&#39;s last shifting, I wholeheartedly feel were all aware what she&#39;s done to make her claim to fame. </p>

<p>She even made her audience pay taxes on her gifts lol- (which were tax wrote off&#39; s for her personal income).</p>

<p>How dumb do you have to be to see she&#39;s not only totally unqualified for the potus status, but that she&#39;s a huge narcissist as well? </p>

<p>At least trump was an International business mogul... Oprah remains to have even piqued my interest for the entirety of my life. </p>

<p>Maybe its because you use name calling as a last resort to conscious debates. Which inherently makes trump seem that much more professional. 
Stick to rationale debate, and there will likely be more civic recourse. Calling a rock a mountain, isn&#39;t earning your position much steam. You haven&#39;t done any independent research, and your sources rely on a bias position. (Which is exactly what lead to trump maintaining office in the first place). So if you want to blame anyone for that, it isn&#39;t unintelligent people that got trump into office, it was unintelligent arguments that lead to his victory. </p>

<p>If you hate him so much, find a good reason why, opposed to a bias one. </p>

<p>That is my advice anyways. But then again you just argued that a performing arts degree, is equivalent to a bachelors in economics. So maybe gain an education so you won&#39;t have to work so hard at sounding smart, because once your educated you will be. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oprah is a far better business person than Trump. Just look at what they&#39;ve created. Oprah has billions and billions of dollars created from nothing. Trump was gifted\inherited hundreds of millions of dollars and made a small (arguable) profit from it. She is far more qualified than Trump. He&#39;s exploited far more people than Oprah, especially if you count both his TV show and real world contractors that he refuses to pay. Add in his inability to speak clearly, mental\physical health, ideas on race, handicapped people, PoW/MIA, and women then he is definitely not qualified to be president.</p>

<p><strong>Trump:</strong></p>

<p>Early life and education
A black-and-white photograph of Donald Trump as a teenager, smiling and wearing a dark pseudo-military uniform with various badges and a light-colored stripe crossing his right shoulder. This image was taken while Trump was in the New York Military Academy in 1964.
Senior yearbook photo of Trump in 1964 wearing the uniform of his private boarding school, New York Military Academy[10][11]
Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Queens, New York City, the fourth of five children.[12] Trump grew up in Jamaica, Queens, and attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, after his parents discovered that he had made frequent trips into Manhattan without their permission.[13][14]</p>

<p>In 1964, Trump began his higher education at Fordham University.[10][15] After two years, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, because it offered one of the few real-estate studies departments in United States academia at the time.[15][16] In addition to his father, Trump was inspired by Manhattan developer William Zeckendorf, vowing to be &quot;even bigger and better&quot;.[17] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son,[18] graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.[15][19][20]</p>
