       .  It's not reddit.com.  It's the whole F'ing thing.  The internet itself.  The forum and comment sections and everything i'm guessing are maybe 1/2 real people,even less.  Shaping what we "know" and what we "believe"...

       Of course that's not all there is. Plato proved this, which is why he's generally considered the father of philosophy. Without Plato's theory of forms, philosophical musings have no meaning because there is no truth outside of your sense perceptions.

       Nor can human consciousness be reduced to electrical signals. Nor would proving that it were caused by electrical signals prove that our perception is not reflective of reality.

       It's easier with people. Machines (assuming that you're referring to AI) aren't fucking stupid, like us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Machines haven't a limit on what they can learn. They can just pick something up, and store it among files in a (probably expandable) storage unit, like a hard drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Machines don't just forget things. They can probably learn
       <em>
        exceptions
       </em>
       to things, may that be good or bad. We can teach machines to disobey previously learned rules. We can depend on the fact that humans are capable of forgetting.

       post about voting manipulation had some really great points:
 "
      </p>
      <pre><code>The number of people who don't read the article and "skip to the comments" is immense, and people who do this register upvotes as some kind of truth rating (as opposed to "content we want you to see" rating). This viewpoint could not be more erroneous, but vote manipulation exploits people who think this way.

People use upvotes as an "I agree" button -- they do, and they will continue to, and no amount of telling them to do differently will change this until you actively micromanage voting privileges, and people who vote this way also tend to read votes this way.

People are influenced by content they see, and are very lazy readers. As such, when they are only exposed to a few viewpoints, they'll just go with whatever they know.

In conjunction with (3), people don't tend to read the whole discussion, so a completely crushing counterargument could be at +1 or +2 forever.

Asch conformity experiment. If conformity pressure can delude someone about the size of lines right in front of their face, they can be influenced by a number telling them that they're disagreeing with 1000 people.

This helps to protect both your account, and the accounts of other users, from administrative shadowbans. The NP domain can be accessed by replacing the "www" in your reddit link with "np".

       I think all we need to do in order to prevent the negative effects of shilling (significant manipulation of opinions) is to spread information about it. Right now, very few people are aware of the huge number of corporations and governments that hire shills. That means most people will trust claims made on the Internet. They won't check sources for example. They will trust and be influenced by an apparent consensus on a topic. All we need to do is spread this information:

       "Why do you think you're so important that someone would pay somebody to argue with you?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Where do I sign up to get paid to post on reddit?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The last one is a really subtle lie: if you think shills exist at all you're paranoid and you think everyone is a shill. That line tends to confuse a lot of real people who aren't familiar with the methods that shills use (see "The Gentleman's Guide to Forum Spies" on the sidebar). Once you learn to recognize these methods, it becomes crystal clear who is honestly discussing things, and who is being disruptive and deceptive.

       I looked it up and it's just state employees that are banned from climate change and it's various terminology. So at least it's confirmed you are not a florida state shill.

       That's pretty much what the sources say. Not illegal, but banned and could cost you got job if you work state level. It's not just one phrase, global warming and other terminology is also banned.

       Yeah, it's bad. The brigading, especially. I get the most harmless things downvoted, all it needs is to possess a bit of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Takes a special kind of anal retentiveness and warped worldview to be one of them. It's baffling what would cause them to become such small, shitty 'human beings'. We should be thankful to lack such a combination of lesser qualities. I would pity them if they didn't suck so gd much. As it is, they are the biological, or code, equivalents of stepping in dog shit.

       We at least appear to be outnumbered because of bots, but the voting anomalies are so obvious to anyone who has spent time in conspiracy before the election. I optimistically hope that real users outnumber the paid posters.

       That is why it is important to at least learm the usernames of everyone in the community. After I did that, I started identifying quality peoplepeople malomg the whole experience better. And I agree, at least half the users are not here for thebright reasons. Probably more like 2/3 are bots and shills, it's terrible.

       Sometimes it feels like us Player Characters are up against NPC's, but we are spread across multiple servers isolated from each other.  All the while we have to do the same fight against the NPC's (AI, Shils, Bots).  Dividing and conquering us.

       This goes beyond simple shadow banning. More of a regional or geographic shadowban. I'm pretty sure the internet is being sectioned off into different smaller groups at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially when it comes to the smaller sites like Reddit. That's why us real users never seems to get much traction.
      </p>

       You telling me in the English speaking Western world this is it? What we see on Reddit Conspiracy. Probably 60-80% astroturf/shill accounts so that leave what a couple hundred actual real people. Should be more of us.

       Remember, most of reddit is lurkers that don't even sign in. And most that login rarely or never comment. That effect is probably more pronounced in a sub like this, where many people wouldn't want their account to be associated with crazy conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the people you see in the comments section are perhaps 1% of those that are reading, and even this may be manipulated (as membership numbers have been manipulated elsewhere on reddit).

       This is the battleground for the hearts and minds of the public. And this is where we are currently winning the information war.

       Facebook confirmed they create bubbles for people.  It was made very obvious by the most recent presidential election.  People on the liberal spectrum were completely caught off guard.  The algorithms kept them in their bubble and they were content to be there.

       I'm genuinely curious though. Do you tend to agree with the people you identify is quality? It's important to also recognize and consider the view points of people who have thoughts different from yours. I find people are awfully quickly to accuse someone that disagrees with them of being a shill/bot/paid/whatever, but rarely do they accuse someone who agrees with them.

       The people who I know are real and have opposing views are by far the most important to me. This idea that opposing viewpoints are classified as shills by us normal users is an actual shill talking point though. Look, I have been here a long time. I know the people that have always been here. And it is from that group that I most heavily rely on. I'm not going to say that I completely ignore new accts (although I mostly do), or accounts I have never seen before (like yours). But I really rely on the old school regulars for my reference points.

        I find people are awfully quick to accuse someone that disagrees with them of being a shill/bot/paid/whatever,

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is some truth to this, but it's kind of a meme that the shills came up with. Follow a shill account and see how often then hint at other people being shills, and then compare it to a real person. In particular, notice how frequently the shill makes obviously wrong accusations of someone else being a shill, compared to the real person. In other words, most of the time that the real people accuse someone of being a shill, they actually are a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The views that someone holds are not a good way to decide who is a shill. The way they argue is a much better indicator. Do they share facts and treat people fairly, or do they always use deceptive rhetoric?

       I identify shills by trying to discuss the ideas...  A non-shill can respond to an opposing viewpoint with discourse.  A non-shill can elaborate on an issue when challenged to do so.  A shill will almost always become hostile at some point.  Not that this is a foolproof strategy...  but if I've learned anything from lurking the chans for years, it's that the number one goal of a shill is to incite frustration and fervor.  Regular folk want to change your mind, a shill wants you to be mad at nothing (everything?).

       Works pretty well for me, it's not like my list of names is etched in stone but it makes it really easy to see threads flooded by unnecessarily hostile usernames. Very telling to see snarky comments about how dumb this community is with 100 upvotes for no reason.

       But funny you mention that, I was talking to User_name13 the other day about something similar, and we don't agree on a bunch of things, but I got them at like +150 on RES. Everyone calls them a shill, but they contribute more valid conspiracy material here than nearly anyone who has uttered the word shill. I don't need to prove myself to the legitimate users here. They know me and what I do. Right, wrong, or indifferent, I'm just trying to figure out what the truth is.

       It's getting easier to spot their tactics, they try and keep you going as long as they can go waste your time. You'll put up a point, they will come back with a counter point that on the surface has substance but falls apart under scrutiny. You reply with supporting evidence and they then ignore that reply and fall back to a Strawman or some other logical fallacy.

       Lots of people post the same article to /news or /worldnews, especially if anti Trump, then they mass delete the ones that didn't catch on.  I think people co-ordinate on the donald too, but I'd guess they're a little better at working together.

       Over time it’s become really easy to spot the bots/shills. At first I was reading all comments as legit conversation, but then the vegas shooting happened and it was really very obvious who was concerned and who was a bot/shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea, they are very numerous but very weak.  I mean, you gotta be semi brain dead to work for one of these shill agencies, so it doesn’t take much to spot them. What a waste of money tho lol 👋

       I keep seeing these posts. Maybe I'm not "woke" enough, but I have not been able to "spot" or "find" these bots in the wild many times. I called one out once because it was really obvious, but is there behavior to look for?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am "real" in the sense that I am at my desk, hungry, not a program, and leave this building later today. Are the "bots" like A.I. programming scripts you guys refer to? Or is it a slang term for a "shill"?

      <p>
       User 1 - innocuous statement about something
      </p>
      <p>
       User 2 - ACTUALLY here is why you are technically wrong even though this is pure semantics and I'm derailing the original point
      </p>
      <p>
       User 3 - calls out user 2
      </p>
      <p>
       User 4 - Makes a joke at User's 3's expense.
      </p>
      <p>
       User 4 gets upvotes. User 3 gets called wonderful names and downvoted. User 1 was irrelevant the whole time. User 2 gets away with it.

       I'm not accusing you of being a shill. But this is a talking point that shills constantly try to jam down our throats. It's actually shills that usually go around accusing everyone who disagrees with them of being a shill, not the real people.

       The Shariablue shills are certainly the loudest here, but there are literally thousands of organizations with paid shills. The most common are intelligence agencies, particularly US, Britain, and Israel, the political groups, and big corporations.

       I'm not an expert, but I notice these things in users I don't really care to participate with.
1)  People who seem to try and get under people's skin too often.
2)  People who look at a post and try to argue against a very minor part of the post while ignoring the main part of the post.
3)  Character assassinations.   Ignoring all arguments and facts and leaping straight to "That person did something bad, so I'm not going to listen to anything else"
4)  One line comments that aren't on point, just trying to dilute the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to look at it like, we're all in this together trying to find the truth, shills try to prevent honest friendly discussion.

       Even though you mention it's not just Reddit in your post, OP, I will say this.  Reddit has, up until recently, been one of the easiest and most bot-friendly websites.  Reddit, itself, encourages bot development and deployment.

       Yeah, this sub used to know Hillary is a crook but ever since the election, we've been swarmed by people who tell this sub over and over she's a sweet angel and was exonerated for every crime.

       C'mon, now. She's great! Hillary saved my life once.

       A bunch of thugs were beating the shit out of me and probably would have killed me. Then Hillary stepped in and said, "That's enough, boys."

       I'm not going to go back and dig them out but it was an MSNBC talking point, "Hillary is the most investigated" and hasn't been charged as though that makes her innocent. I've gotten comments in that vain at least a dozen times in this sub. Also, "where's the proof?" People ask what proof I have Hillary is corrupt. It's exasperating.

       If you don't think there's voting bots on reddit, look at this post that got downvoted. Hillary Clinton is arguably the most corrupt politician in US history, and people are downvoting someone for pointing that out.

       I think one key is to find the good smaller niche subreddits or forums that aren't on any of the radars.  I love the smaller, innocuous subs I've found over the years.

       When I go to bigger ones like here or r/politics, I just assume it's gonna be nonsense.

       People are dumb and easily swayed. Just think of how many people are religiously pushing for some bill or something to be passed which will have no effect whatsoever. Net neutrality. All it took was for the media to act like Ajit Pai was going to destroy democracy and millions of people wanted him dead. All in less than 3 days, he got death threats at his house and bomb threats. Now, those same people barely remember him.

       What's real? What's not? These are the timeless questions of philosophers. How do I know you're real and not a bot script? Maybe this post has some hidden kind of subversive agenda, I don't know. Maybe you think the same of my reply. It seems like trust in each other in our society is continuing to crumble. My advice is to avoid the fear porn and the divide and conquer strategy TPTB are trying to use on us. Maybe take a break from reddit, social media, television, and radio for a week or two. Sometimes we just need to detox from all the bullshit.

       I was thinking this same thing the other day. It's gonna get way way worse the longer the internet is around, this much is obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree that if it is bad now, it can only get exponentially worse (moores law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Accounts can be created every second and immediately out there spamming things. I'm pretty certain there are bots out there that can fluently speak out certain ideas and messages. They might even be able to engage in discussion with real people, or potentially advance narratives by engaging with other bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking scary time to be alive, when we saw movies about this shit in the 80s it was all techy and super advanced but hardly ever was it imagined as the dark and strange reality that it is. I know this is maybe laughable to some people, but imagine how you are gonna feel doing psychedelic drugs in a world with AI, just how "exiled from the system" you will feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a bad trip to "Bee Movie" one time (hilarious, I know) and felt like a bee trapped in the hive. It's a miserable time and I imagine it is a lot like what using psychedelics will feel like in the future the more plugged in and symbiotic we become with machines.

       Bot messages are relatively easy to spot.  They are either human written messages that are repeated many times (in which case you can search for the message and see if it appears over and over).  Or they are computer generated messages which are easy to spot because their syntex and meaning is "off" (you can see this even more clearly when you read computer-generated news articles and stories that seem like they have been written by a foreigner).

       This has been my thinking for a while now. The ai chatbots that are available to the public are already extremely complex. Considering the military is usually decades ahead with technology it makes perfect sense that most first world countries would low-key have far more sophisticated ai at their disposal.

       If its true then it'd be awfully easy for it to be deployed to sway public opinion and would be far more cost effective and easier to control than getting real people to shill.

       I'm compiling a list of users on Reddit I suspect of shilling and a lot of posters I've marked (especially on subs like the_donald) have very peculiar posting patterns. Some are almost clockwork constant posting with 8 hour "sleep" breaks. Several of these accounts seem to virtually share comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       All hope is not lost though, we can still unravel it. All it takes is exposure. The more people that are aware of it, the less effective the social engineering is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep searching and sharing. You're making a tangible difference even if it doesn't feel like it.

       100% the case. There are live AIs that we interact daily with on this site and others. You can EASILY spot them and confirm. Get into a conversation with a suspected account and give them your version of the Touring Test. They are actually scarily good, but you'll catch them. I'll give you a big hint, their use of nouns is
       <em>
        pronounced
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You will be surprised. Just don't call them out on it here, because the mods will ban you. Keep it to yourself citizen.

       It's interesting. I can remember back in the early 2000s they had those funny 'chat bots where you can message a bot and they would talk to you. They weren't too good at the time.

       There's millions of AI running around the internet, masquerading themselves as real people, manipulating us at every turn.  You're wrong to not implicate reddit, however, as this site's design invites this sort of manipulation.  It's never been easier to create, steer, manipulate, and distort narratives than it is on this site.

       15 years ago I worked for a small-to-midsized computer company that outsourced forum posting which hyped their software to 3 shills based in India. This was done manually, pre-sock puppet software. I often think, what could a truly giant corporation or government do with sock puppet software and an army of propagandists?

       Sadly, I think it's just that half of America is completely uneducated, uncultured and impulsive and addicted to their devices. Look at the comments on your local news station's site. People are jumping at the bit to have their literal retarded comments "heard". Look at YouTube. Twitter. It's narcissistic frenzy.

       I have noticed this (ESPECIALLY on this website) trend you speak of. I will often see
      </p>
      <p>
       User 1 - innocuous statement about something
      </p>
      <p>
       User 2 - ACTUALLY here is why you are technically wrong even though this is pure semantics and I'm derailing the original point
      </p>
      <p>
       User 3 - calls out user 2
      </p>
      <p>
       User 4 - Makes a joke at User's 3's expense.
      </p>
      <p>
       User 4 gets upvotes. User 3 gets called wonderful names and downvoted. User 1 was irrelevant the whole time. User 2 gets away with it.

       I'm not accusing you of being a shill. But this is a talking point that shills constantly try to jam down our throats. It's actually shills that usually go around accusing everyone who disagrees with them of being a shill, not the real people.

       This is why OP is wrong not to implicate Reddit.  Reddit is the ultimate gamification of thought-policing.  Sure, the problem exists everywhere, but nowhere else is it so effective.

       I'm not going to go back and dig them out but it was an MSNBC talking point, "Hillary is the most investigated" and hasn't been charged as though that makes her innocent. I've gotten comments in that vain at least a dozen times in this sub. Also, "where's the proof?" People ask what proof I have Hillary is corrupt. It's exasperating.
