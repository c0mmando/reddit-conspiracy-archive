<p>I’m not buying that those were false alarms. Perhaps they are testing the wares to see what the public will do in an event such as a missile strike.</p>

<p>It could just be a coincidence and there isn’t any way to really confirm but I found this to be very suspicious. </p>

<p>Why is there no code that would need to be punched in?
Passcodes get forgotten all the time, especially if they would only be used once. If there is a actual attack, you have something like 10 minutes. Every second counts in such a situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would think that the same system used to fire the actual missiles would be used to send out the alert for this exact reason. So the NORAD early alert system gets triggered and the protocol gets started. People get called and someone at the alert place gets a call from a predesignated person. The alert guy then uses a key to open a safe and the guy on the phone gives him a code - probably alpha-numeric - and they both read off their codes and confirm. If there is a confirmation of both parties then he breaks the card and now has access to another code. The alert guy then types this code into the system and hits enter. Once he hits enter the alert gets broadcast. </p>

<p>It’s really not that complicated of a system and makes so much more sense then the system pictured. It insures no one hits a wrong button and only takes a few seconds to do properly when implemented. Why wouldn’t we use the same system for alerting people as we do for actually firing nukes? If the argument is the “time” factor then this system takes less than a minute. About as much time as it takes to read through the options and close a button. </p>

<p>One of my major fears is that the more the media blows up about fake bullshit and lies about him, and the more they cry wolf about the &quot;evil and scary&quot; things he has done (when he has done nothing truly of the sort... yet)... the more people will ignore them or not believe them.

    <div class="md"><p>It does sound different, but it could easily be Lazarus just doing whatever they can to spread fear. Perhaps the Japanese system was more difficult to hack into, so they did this instead. Who knows, but the fact this was different to the Hawaiian incident in no way lessens my suspicions that Lazarus, or some other hacking group, is doing this. Whoever it is, I think someone is purposely activating these false alarms. I seriously doibt this is just a coincidence, and I seriously doubt it’s very easy to accidentally set off an alarm such as this.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fact that it wasn’t the official alarm system this time makes me think that it’s very unlikely that an actual missile was launched. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NORTH KOREA HACKED THEIR SYSTEMS.  I guarantee it.</p>

<p>I thought this when I first read about the Hawaiian false alert.  The explanation that came out is just not believable to me.  That message can go out to all of Hawaii with just one false click?  Bullshit.  Don&#39;t believe it.  Systems like that have fail-safes.  Someone would have had to type the specific message.  And why not use the SAME SYSTEM to alert people to the mistake? Why did it take FORTY MINUTES to get the word out.  But mostly, I don&#39;t believe the story and I am convinced the alert system was hacked by North Korea.  They certainly have the capability.</p>

<p><em>Hears Japan has false alert the next day.</em></p>

<p>I have long wondered if the Bush administration was in on 9/11 or if we were genuinely attacked by a sophisticated organization which was able to deflect onto groups like Al Qaeda. The apparent cover-up in the aftermath makes it seem like the government was in on it, but there are a number of alternate explanations even for that behavior, most of which are still shameful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. Was a bit much. You need to read between the lines. It&#39;s not all black and white in this world and the media long time manipulated us to keep calm and let the elite (the few thousand people who own 80% of the world&#39;s money) keep doing, and stealing the hard earned money of all.
This attack would start things like a domino, if North Korea got attacked by the US, partner country&#39;s would, too and so the other way around. And the people are distracted again(sounds brutal, but this is how it&#39;s is). The elite can earn money again from the suffer of civilizations. Like hundred of years before.
About Iraq, it&#39;s just the same like with Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and so on. Always trying to change regimes, who not follow as wanted. Obey or get your dosis of democracy (its not a democracy if you forced to, democracy is when the power comes from the people and not the other way around). 
But as you can see, it&#39;s not working anymore, neither in Venezuela nor in Syria nor Iran.
Ever thought about, that USA having the highest amount of debts. But still running, or try to run the world. There is a big picture if you follow the money. And it&#39;s not easy to keep up with all the lies, intrigues and manipulation some groups in the government doing for years...and still try. Not trying to say it&#39;s all bad and conspiracy, but ask yourself the question... Who profits? Who earns money with it... Who got the power? Cui Bono? </p>

<p>Hope I could answer some of the questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if we are actually experiencing an increased flux of asteroids or cometary debris? I know that meteors have the potential to give false positives to missile detection systems.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been drawn to the theory that something is periodically disturbing the Oort cloud and causing a shower of comets and debris to rain on the inner solar system every now and then. The most likely candidate is an undiscovered ice giant ejected long ago to a distant elliptical orbit, with perihelion defining roughly the outer edge of the Kuiper belt and aphelion defining roughly the inner edge of the Oort cloud. The most realistic model that I know of places the orbit around 13,000 years and currently approaching aphelion. Maybe the big conspiracy is that the government has known that this period of high comet activity is coming and kept it secret to avoid mass panic. Surely most of the big ones are still unlikely to find their mark on Earth and we couldn&#39;t stop one if we tried anyway. It&#39;s fun to speculate that perhaps secret societies have kept track of this information since the last comet strikes collapsed the global civilization some 11,500 years ago. </p>

However I do find it extremely disconcerting that two separate, erroneous warnings were issued by two very close allies for terroritories very close to each other, in such a short period of time, during high tensions with a foreign enemy and which mistakes have NEVER OCCURRED BEFORE. From what I&#39;ve seen it&#39;s also very hard to accidentally send an alert because there are many fail safes to ensure it doesn&#39;t happen. </p>
