<p>We started to get a lot more informants and infiltrators into the organizations, and then we knew what really was going on. And that&#39;s been really, really successful as a tactic, to infiltrate. And you can see how successful that was in places like, you know, the Republican National Conventions in both New York City and Minneapolis, where we even got people to - you know, we were able to encourage people to do things like, you know, do acts of violence, which then would make it possible for us to come in and sweep the streets and bring in large amounts of SWAT team tactical police.

<p>While I am willing to entertain the possibility of crisis actors I think it is a serious concern when we talk about the scale of some of these events and whether or not it is reasonable to conclude crisis actors could be used effectively for large crowds and still remain convincing and quiet. You links don&#39;t really address that adequately for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s since been deleted, but there was this thread: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ubn6p/keep_your_eyes_open_vegas/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ubn6p/keep_your_eyes_open_vegas/</a></p>

<p>The dates given were Aug 25-27th, but maybe that&#39;s when they had &quot;orientation&quot; and not when the event actually was.</p>

<p>*Note, I live in Vegas and my company put out an internal employees only email (So not some huge thing to gain sympathy or publicity) that a co-worker died at the shooting. I also know people that were directly affected by the tragedy. I do not condone the threads saying this was fake and there was no blood and no one died. Were there actors? Maybe. Was it pre-planned? Possibly. I&#39;ve seen evidence to suggest it was, but there was definitely a shooting with bullets and dead people. </p>

There are literal spies following people around, trying to gather information about potential leakers, blackmailing them, threatening them, etc. Some of the ones getting threatened might see taking a deal as the only good option. They get left alone, they aren&#39;t tracked anymore, they don&#39;t get exposed with blackmail, they don&#39;t have to deal with fake news about them published in tabloids, they don&#39;t have to worry about a frivolous counter suit, and they don&#39;t have to go through a long legal process to get compensation.

<p>Look it was the route 91 on 10-1. 911-01. A number sequence of infamy. Of course our missing hero Jesus C. Is the mocking of Christ to bring it full circle.

<p>The “evidence” to date has been indistinguishable from Hollywood moulage, as is the case in all these events where footage “leaks”.

<p>I’m quite familiar with Tina’s story already.</p>

<p>Tina Frost, who defied doctor’s expectations by being able to leave her bed, walk around and even <em>prepare cookies</em> just five weeks later?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/ac-tina-frost-update-20171107-story.html">http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/ac-tina-frost-update-20171107-story.html</a></p>

<p>An incredible recovery after being shot in the head and having an eye surgically removed, for sure.</p>

<p>Incidentally, every one of these bizarre events has incredible, some might say <em>implausible</em> recoveries. Mostly this kind, in fact.</p>

<p>During her miraculous recovery Tina Frost was “visited by Hip Hop group the Jabberwockies” in hospital. This was a nice <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> reference, for those who understand the significance of this common <em>phoney fake show</em> red flag.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/ac-cn-frost-update-1021-story.html">http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/ac-cn-frost-update-1021-story.html</a></p>

<p>Tina Frost also had a GoFundMe page set up by the morning of October 2nd (the event occurred the previous night, October 1st. Truly this was an amazingly lucrative and level-headed financial decision in the wake of such a tragedy, because donations poured in. It reached the $50,000 target within hours, $500,000 in less than 10 days, and currently it stands at over $600,000. This remarkable outpouring of money is, of course, held “in trust”which is another common theme for donations from these events. For those who understand the legal conditionality of trusts, this is another huge red flag.</p>

<p>But I digress :)</p>

<p>I mean come in you have to be a total idiot to believe that, if you want to think it&#39;s a false flag at least be rational about the actual victims. Maybe the story is fake or it&#39;s a false flag and it was really someone else or at the very least the victims were killed separately.</p>

<p>That’s an extraordinary claim, and it came before mine so let’s prove that one first.</p>

<p>Where is the evidence for it? All I’ve seen is media reports (can’t be trusted) and your internet anecdote about having attended her memorial.</p>

<p>Do you think that’s enough “evidence” to support the claim? Can you even prove <em>you</em> attended?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they have more than one entrance, or maybe this was taken before the majority of the patients came in, or maybe after it was cleaned up? You&#39;re starting off with the idea that they hired a crowd of crisis actors, but the conspiracy just keeps getting bigger and bigger. Now an entire hospital is in on it, doctors, nurses, paramedics front desk people, administrators, accountants, janitors, etc. I can understand the idea of hiring a crowd, but how do you handle the hospital staff? It&#39;s pretty easy to place an ad and find your best candidates for a crowd, but with the hospital you&#39;re dealing with a set staff. How do you know who would be receptive to a pay off and who wouldn&#39;t be?</p>

<p>Also what about all the witnesses? Surely not everyone at the concert could be crisis actors, unless the venue and concert planners are all in on it too, and they somehow sold all the tickets to the actors, and hired nothing but actors for employees.</p>

How many people with a medical confession were there within the crowd, would they be fooled also that easy?
Perhaps the hoax-thinkers then claim the whole crowd was paid, then the Police was paid, the Hospital stuff and other emergency responders were paid, at least they end up that the whole area of Las Vegas was paid and eventually the city of Las Vegas is just a potemkin village.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s more than logical, that you can&#39;t fake injuries or deaths with hundreds of emergency and first aid medical responders. </p>

<p>Firstly with 30.000 People at the concert and a few more in the surrounding area, it&#39;s highly possible that there are many People with some medical background (army, doctors, nurses, etc.) among them. How will you fake those injuries for them? First of all with all the people surrounding them how would they do the make-up for those wounds, with no one noticing them?
Well and even untrained people that take care of the injured can figure out if there is only something that resembles blood on the cloths and skin of those people or if it&#39;s actually bleeding. Also shot wounds don&#39;t bleed more or less heavy and then suddenly stop bleeding within a manner of seconds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and it would lead them to the spree killer coerced into doing it.  Crafting a fake motive for one guy is again easier than faking the entire thing. I think it goes without saying that you don&#39;t let the guy get taken alive.  Also are people not constantly investigating all these other events now?  Better someone investigating an actual grieving family than pulling on loose threads like the crisis actors would be.<br/>
These are just thoughts, not trying to make any claims about what people think.  I just keep thinking up cheaper easier ways of doing these things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay But serious question, Am I the only one that finds it a little slimy/disgusting that these kids who have been through a trauma are getting blind support for whatever it is they say and are making the new circuits smiling and taking pictures and doing interviews? I am all for better gun control (Thorough background checks, Age to Own at least 21 across the board, mandatory training + CHS cert, gun safe inspections etc) but something seems wayyyyy fishy about how all this just too off and just two children seem to be the head of all this. Condolances to OP, reddit haters are pretty nuts. Don&#39;t let that silence you!</p>

<p>We started to get a lot more informants and infiltrators into the organizations, and then we knew what really was going on. And that&#39;s been really, really successful as a tactic, to infiltrate. And you can see how successful that was in places like, you know, the Republican National Conventions in both New York City and Minneapolis, where we even got people to - you know, we were able to encourage people to do things like, you know, do acts of violence, which then would make it possible for us to come in and sweep the streets and bring in large amounts of SWAT team tactical police. It was really effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know someone that actually died, you&#39;re the one spouting extraordinary BS so you should be the one providing extraordinary evidence... but you don&#39;t have shit.</p>

<p>Jennifer Irvine from San Diego. Is she fake?? What about her Thousand+ Facebook friends?? The hundreds of people that went to her public memorial?? Is it all fake??</p>

<p>I mean come in you have to be a total idiot to believe that, if you want to think it&#39;s a false flag at least be rational about the actual victims. Maybe the story is fake or it&#39;s a false flag and it was really someone else or at the very least the victims were killed separately.</p>

<p>But to outright believe no deaths occurred makes you stupid as fuck if not downright a little evil yourself. </p>

<p>The dates given were Aug 25-27th, but maybe that&#39;s when they had &quot;orientation&quot; and not when the event actually was.</p>

<p>*Note, I live in Vegas and my company put out an internal employees only email (So not some huge thing to gain sympathy or publicity) that a co-worker died at the shooting. I also know people that were directly affected by the tragedy. I do not condone the threads saying this was fake and there was no blood and no one died. Were there actors? Maybe. Was it pre-planned? Possibly. I&#39;ve seen evidence to suggest it was, but there was definitely a shooting with bullets and dead people. </p>
