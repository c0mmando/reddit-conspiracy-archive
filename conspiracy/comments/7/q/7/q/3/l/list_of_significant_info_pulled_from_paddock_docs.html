       After reading the 300+ pages of affidavits, as well as going over comments on here, I figured it may be helpful to have a list of info all in one place. I tried to keep the stuff we already knew off the list (wire transfer, player's club card, etc.). I did include the extras I had on the apartment complex which is not in the affidavits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here you go:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paddock’s email address,
         <a href="mailto:centralpark1@live.com">
          centralpark1@live.com
         </a>
         , was associated with a previously owned apartment building located in Mesquite, TX. The unknown correspondent (possibly Paddock),
         <a href="mailto:centralpark4804@gmail.com">
          centralpark4804@gmail.com
         </a>
         , also appears to be linked to the building.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paddock purchased Central Park Apartments (CPA) located at 4804 Via Ventura in 2004 for approx. $8 million. The building was sold for a loss in 2012 for $5-6 million. This explains the origin of the email addresses listed above.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Despite the fact CPA was sold in 2012, both email addresses were still active and in use 5 years later.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ownership records for CPA are registered to a HOUSE in Henderson, NV solely owned by someone named Connie (aka Kay) McCain. It is not known how she is related to Paddock or CPA. But, it’s possible she also had an email address associated with the complex. Records can be seen here:
         <a href="http://www.dallascad.org/AcctHistory.aspx?ID=381527200A0020000">
          http://www.dallascad.org/AcctHistory.aspx?ID=381527200A0020000
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         On July 6, 2017 the following correspondence took place between
         <a href="mailto:centralpark4804@gmail.com">
          centralpark4804@gmail.com
         </a>
         &amp;
         <a href="mailto:centralpark1@live.com">
          centralpark1@live.com
         </a>
         :
        </p>
        <p>
         CP1:   try an ar before u buy. we have huge selection. located in the las vegas area.

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paddock purchased a substantial amount of firearms and accessories out of state or online.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         MariLou Danley’s email address was
         <a href="mailto:marilouroses@live.com">
          marilouroses@live.com
         </a>
         . Both email addresses were registered to Microsoft (live.com).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Danley “spontaneously” admitted her fingerprints would be on the ammunition USED DURING THE ATTACK. Her DNA was also collected.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Found in the hotel suite were:    range finding devices, suitcases pre-loaded with high capacity ammo, a set of body armor, an apparent homemade gas mask and glass cutters.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paddock had at least one pre-paid cell phone (in the room). They found three phones total: two which were unlocked and contained nothing of note. The third was locked.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paddock’s Instagram account: stephenpaddock47. Danley appeared to have FOUR: Mariloudanley, Mariloudanleyy, Mariloudanleypaddock and marilou.danley.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Danley’s F/B page (marilou.danley) settings were altered at 12:30am on October 2. She deleted it at 2:46am. Apparently, Paddock's name was not released to the public for another hour. Which means, Danley most likely knew Paddock was involved in one way or another.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paddock purchased an EOTech 512.A65 Tactical Holographic firearm accessory on Amazon on September 7, 2017.
        </p>

       If I missed something or didn't get it right, let me know and I'll edit it. Feel free to post theories, etc. based on the totality of the list.

       I couldn't find where it said there were seven cell phones and devices in there. But, the local NBC channel said seven based on the docs. I'll add a note or change #10 if someone can help me out.

       Right. That's the report I was referencing. But, I could only find that one story. No others to back up the 7 cell phones. And, I didn't see that ANYWHERE in the documents (which is where they say they found that). I'm just wondering if someone else caught it. Otherwise, I think they're mistaken.

       The emails are a big red flag for me. In another thread someone said maybe multiple people accessed the account and were sending messages to "themselves" to preserve anonymity. I definitely think it lends credence to the "gun deal gone very bad" theory.

       Just my humble guess, but with an arms deal gone bad, it's possible it was a situation he felt he wouldn't be able to just walk away from so he decided to take his own life and make a spectacle of it in the process.

       This is what I keep wondering about. SlipperySix suggests maybe Paddock realized he was screwed in this deal, but shooting out the concert just seems like an outcome nobody would ever come to. I wonder about the logistics -- multiple guys in a room, a tense situation ensues, then one guy starts shooting not the other guys but a crowd across the street, and everyone else stands by. Just an odd scenario to imagine

       Let's say Paddock works for FBI or CIA or someone and if it is a gun deal gone bad then that agency has to cover their tracks. So they decide to spur of the moment shoot up the festival and make Paddock look like a "lone wolf nut job" and they think no one will question it, because these shootings happen all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't sound likely at all to me, just throwing it out there.

       The building bought in 2008 was sold to him by a real estate firm of which I am affiliated with. We were all super freaked when his name came out. From everything I have heard, he seemed like a normal dude, without anything too questionable financially that would prevent or hold up the deal.

       This is great information. I'd actually like to speak with you about this more because I'm trying to follow the money in regard to his real estate holdings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you talking about the Central Park apartments? If I'm not mistaken, he bought it back in 2004. If that's an error please let me know so I can fix it.

       Also, let me know if it's ok to PM you. Even to just pick your brain a bit about real estate in general. Don't need any personal information. Just a perspective.

       Sorry, I meant 2004. Unfortunately, I did not have affiliation with the company when it went down. I have only heard about it after we were contacted by the FBI which was right before his name was released. I have not seen any of the paperwork on file regarding the sale so I don’t know if I have anything of value to give. Everyone was pretty freaked out and this topic is taken pretty seriously. I just know what I have heard from the two that primarily dealt with him during the sale process, and that everything seemed normal at the time. There were no red flags during the time of purchase from what the firm was privy to. Extraneous finances, if there were any, I cannot speak to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do remember the day this came to light I found it really odd he owned property in 2 towns by the same name. Everyone on this sub later that night kept dismissing that fact as a misconception, that people were getting the cities confused, but I knew that was not the case. What I wonder, is there any foreseeable reason why someone might intentionally live and own property in two cities by the same name but in different states? Perhaps there is a reason for this, but perhaps it was just chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is very odd, I do know that. People at the office were very freaked by this. They had no idea, as I am sure was the case for many people who knew him loosely.

       Could you provide any details of the actual real estate deal? Did it make financial sense as an investment? What kind of cap rate on the property? Did he take out a mortgage? IIRC when he sold the building in 2012 he lost about $2mm. Honestly wondering if the property was appropriately managed or if we was just pulling money out of it.

       Most of what I know about it is from the man who dealt with him during the sale had to say. I have not pulled out the file. This firm does not do shady business, I can say that. At the time, the investment was sound and logical. I believe the consensus was the lost money was due to the housing bubble timing of when it was bought and sold. But I have not heard anything but very brief speculation on that. There might be more to consider there, like what you mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sorry I don’t know more about it. The guy who dealt with Paddock has been pretty hushed about it, which makes sense with him having to deal with the FBI and it being his business and all. But he did say he was shocked, that the guy seemed perfectly normal and his finances seemed to be in good order. No red flags from what he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock and the event are definitely off. We are being lied to about some stuff. And I wonder how strait his finances actually were in reality.

       Multifamily prices are influenced more by rental income and the gross rent multiplier, so I find it very odd the property dropped in value so much unless he did absolutely 0 maintenance/management. I would assume prices would have stabilized by 2012 when he did take a loss on the building vs when he bought it.

       That is true. But it also depends on the area and how greatly it was impacted at the time... which is something I am going to look at tomorrow. Some areas recovered quicker than others. And some people never fully recovered their loss in property value, regardless of area. One thing that comes to mind about loss of value, just because I have seen the issue before with another property, is if the building was constructed using “Chinese drywall” which was a cheap sub par drywall that causes residents to become ill. Perhaps that could be the issue here, it needing replacing. But it’s been a few months since I heard the details of the property. I can’t recall if I ever heard when it was built.
      </p>
      <p>
       With so much weird stuff around and about Paddock, I think it’s something that should be further looked into for sure. I do know the FBI looked into it, but lord knows we aren’t going to hear about it from them.

       I actually had to correct a mistake in regard to the sale. He actually made money on it (see above). Texas and California are much more difficult in regard to finding property records and I had miscalculated the sale. My apologies. I did also add a link for the Henderson, NV home.

       Always a possibility, but I don't think so, the recent doc dump pretty much proved he was an arms dealer.

       I don't know if it proved it (I've taken issue with people using that word since I started watching YouTube). However, I believe it's a more likely scenario than it was just yesterday.

       Thanks for posting this. I'm not sure what I think about it but I don't​ believe we should disregard it at this point. Hoping we get the LVMPD warrants next week so we have access to more.

       But advertising what, and why to two email addresses, seemingly linked to the same physical location.

       These seem more planted than anything, because they don't make any sense.

       And (what I feel is most important) how'd they come upon the emails if they didn't yet have the warrant...?

         What is a "substantial" amount? Also, it's quite common to purchase firearms online and have them transferred to a local FFL.

       Great job.  Wanted to go over the real estate transaction.  I'm not familiar with all the records, but generally, the tax value is reset to the sale price when a sale takes place.  This happened in the 2004/2005 timeframe when the appraised (taxable) value was reset to $6 million.  This seems indicative of a sale of the property for $6 million.  As the only sale was in 2004 (to Paddock), it seems like he bought it for $6 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next time there is an abrupt change in the appraised value is 2013 -- which corresponds with the 11/21/2012 sale of the property.   There is price is $7,300,000.  It appears that Paddock sold for $7.3 million.  This gives a "profit" of $1.3 million from the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying your numbers are wrong, but I can't follow how you arrived at them and when I look at the appraised value, I get different numbers.

       Texas and California make things more difficult in regard to finding deeds and property records. The auditor websites are set up differently. So, I was unable to find the deed for both sales. My numbers are based on the article below:

      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, after re-reading the article, it appeared he sold it for 9.45 million. I corrected it on my list. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I also added the link to McCain's home records.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've actually been digging a little deeper into the properties he owned and his known associates. It's taken me quite awhile. I wasn't sure if any of it would even go anywhere. Turns out the CPA property is relevant to the case! Even if this lady has nothing to do with any of this, I still feel like my work hasn't been for nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again. And, BTW... I've been trying to figure out the tax value on those records as well (my husband and I are looking for a house so it's helpful). I don't truly understand it but a guy (I think on this thread) said he would be willing to answer some questions for me.

       Some good info that that Reuters article:
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen Paddock sold the complex in November 2012, for $9.45 million: $1 million more than he paid. His former wife, Peggy Paddock, and his brother Eric were partners in the venture, although the brother declined to say what share of the proceeds they took.
      </p>

       We gotta keep digging on the real estate stuff because it doesn't look like he made anywhere near as much money as people were thinking.

       Sorry. I suppose I can't link the actual page for the property. I'm going to take it down I guess because otherwise people will have to put in the address for the records.... Or do you think I should list the addy and keep it up? I'm kind of hesitant about posting all this public info on this lady if she isn't involved. Not sure...

       Always a possibility, but I don't think so, the recent doc dump pretty much proved he was an arms dealer.

       Thanks. I might do so just to get some insight into how to proceed further with my real estate search in different states. I am pretty good at finding this stuff but some states are more difficult than others.

       Ill dig for it, was on Reddit. Basically, his account was fagged multiple times as fraudulent, but would be unlocked with none of the normally required documents to prove identity.

       I think anon has it right, whether or not it was a guess, or inside info, no idea. But the only time there are so many inconsistencies, is when some incompetent government agency is involved.

       Right. That's the report I was referencing. But, I could only find that one story. No others to back up the 7 cell phones. And, I didn't see that ANYWHERE in the documents (which is where they say they found that). I'm just wondering if someone else caught it. Otherwise, I think they're mistaken.
