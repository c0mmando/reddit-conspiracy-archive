<p>I see a lot of theories on here about the Hawaii missile alert and their theories. A lot of the theories are claiming that a missile was actually shot. This could be possible but why didn‚Äôt the other island alerts go off at Guam, Midway, or any of the other Pacific Islands. 
The official story is that a worker accidentally hit the wrong button causing the alarm. The result in being a false alarm. However, I think this is a cover up. </p>

<p>My theory is that there was a malfunction in the missile defense system (NORAD). This malfunction may be due to the system actually being down. The military does not want the rest of the world to know that the warning system is either down or not working properly. So they go with a story that people believe. ‚ÄúA person caused the error.‚Äù This indirectly implies that the automated system is still up and running. </p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts and theories. </p>

<p>TL;DR the automated missile defense system failed/malfunctioned and they blame human error to cover it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So a news report I read about Canadians in Hawaii stated that after the alert they could not make any phone calls and their text messages to loved ones were not delivered until after the alert was lifted.  Is there a practical reason why this emergency alert would kill civilian cellphone capabilities?  I would expect the Network would be able to handle the call volume, or at least text messages, and still allow emergency responders to communicate.  It is concerning to me that in the event of such an emergency I would be unable to contact my family and say goodbye.</p>

<p>I think network capacity could handle the load if it was reduced to just sms.  </p>

<p>Power systems and such do a form of triage when under high demand.  At the facility I work at when an interruption or period of extreme demand is initiated the plant prioritizes critical systems automatically and near instantaneously.  Explosive gas detection is near the top and remains unaffected.  Is this technology not available to communication networks? </p>

<p>I feel it might be an old protocol that hasn&#39;t been revisited in light of new technologies / algorithms.  The system could be flexible enough to adjust permissions on the fly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked on the Deathstar(AT&amp;T) 2000-2005.  Although a lot of  newer facilities exist now,  there are still many parts of the US that  rely on old facilities that  just can&#39;t handle the  traffic when everyone tries to  call home at once.  This happens today in areas of a disaster such as hurricanes, floods, mass panic, etc.  The system literally does well to  manage up to a point,  past that, the  network switches can&#39;t handle the  traffic.  Since some  areas might be  serviced by  multiple generations of  switch in the  central office,  they aren&#39;t  even provisioned through the  same legacy systems.  The newer switches are  certainly more  robust and  able to  switch traffic rapidly  but the  old ones  don&#39;t always play along. </p>
