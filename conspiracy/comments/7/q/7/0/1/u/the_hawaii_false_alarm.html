    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How hard?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Effectively impossible via any technology known or reasonably speculated to exist.  Land based countermeasures would have to be deployed from close to the target, and would be big and noisy.  There&#39;s no evidence of a laser based defense system capable of that scale, no known orbital countermeasures, and I don&#39;t believe the naval rail/gauss cannons have yet been equipped for this task.</p>

<p>Also, about a dozen different nations would have noticed and freaked the fuck out.  So it&#39;s basically certain that there was no missile.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bluff?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  NK will never, ever, make an initial strike.  The notion that they would as preposterous, fear mongering, and an absolute lie.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Self Destruct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theoretically, but again it would have been noticed by a dozen nations, they would all be freaking out, and we&#39;d be in armed conflict already.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>38 minutes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It didn&#39;t.  There was a notice out that it was a goof within minutes.  The emergency broadcast update was probably delayed while they made absolutely sure that there was indeed no missile,and received authorization.</p>

<p>If this was an &#39;intel&#39; based warning that turned out to be false then the 38 minute time span makes sense but again why wouldn&#39;t the president say anything? </p>

<p>And maybe doing nothing is the best thing that trump could have done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Chain of command and all that.</p>

<p>But how much time was there between when the alert happened and when the president was notified? I&#39;m going to guess way less than 38 minutes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok your ability to defend him is endless. </p>

<p>Trump makes comments on things he should not all the time. He brags about the size of his nuclear button. He insults opponents. He has childish nicknames for almost everyone. The examples are endless. In fact when he talks about the investigation of his campaign he SHOULD NOT say anything but he constantly does.</p>

<p>So this one time that he doesn&#39;t have anything to say doesn&#39;t seem strange to you? </p>

<p>This is why trump supporters seem to have no standard of accountability. They believe whatever he does is fine. Depending on what he says and the times when he changes his mind about something they change with him. Sometimes believing it was the truth all along. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. But of course it would appear that way to you. </p>

<p>I would have nothing bad to say about what he was saying if it was true and appropriate.</p>

<p>How often are his statements both true and appropriate? </p>

<p>His twitter right now... the first thing is A retweet about Hillary Clinton&#39;s emails. Seriously!!?</p>

<p>The second is a retweet about it fusion gps. His comments about the investigation into himself could be seen as obstruction.</p>

<p>Next a retweet about dick durbin that is misleading. </p>

<p>Next a stock market retweet taking credit for an economy that&#39;s been growing since 2009. </p>

<p>Now a list of his original tweets. 
1. &#39;Fake news&#39; regarding the book about him. 
2. &#39;Democrats are all talk and no action&#39; he&#39;s talking about the meeting that didn&#39;t go well, where he is alleged to have called some places &#39;shitholes&#39;
3. Literally only the words &#39;America first&#39;
4. Again democrats are all talk
5.taking more credit for the economy. Saying jobs are coming back to the USA. 
I&#39;ll admit that the economy has continued to do well, but it started way before he was president. He mentions the &#39;tax cut&#39; but it&#39;s pretty well accepted that the tax changes will increase the deficit and will mean an actual tax increase for most Americans. 
6. Mlk day proclamation-the content is fine even though most people believe he is racist
7. He&#39;s basically denying that he said shithole. </p>

<p>So for me 2 out of the 10-11 tweets I have no problem with. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>There’s a lot of things going on behind the scenes you aren’t noticing. This tweet is because Judicial Watch got a ruling that the FBI has to speed up in releasing the emails. It’s actually relevant right now. The FBI has been politicized too a higher degree, and it’s coming out that the way they originally handled the email investigation was egregious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats are all talk and no action&#39; he&#39;s talking about the meeting that didn&#39;t go well, where he is alleged to have called some places &#39;shitholes&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which he denies, along with 2 senators that were in the meeting. I
Shouldn’t need to remind you that Durbin has lied in this exact same way before. And also I’m glad that he is letting us know how the immigration talks are going. I’m not sure why you have a problem with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Literally only the words &#39;America first&#39;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a little useless, but again I’m not sure why you would have a problem with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He mentions the &#39;tax cut&#39; but it&#39;s pretty well accepted that the tax changes will increase the deficit and will mean an actual tax increase for most Americans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is false and a bunch of nonsense. There is no basis for it. Stop lying. And again, not sure why you have a problem with him tweeting about the economy. It’s not like the MSM has covered the economy basically at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mlk day proclamation-the content is fine even though most people believe he is racist </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the tweet is fine. He isn’t racist by the way but you won’t believe that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s basically denying that he said shithole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As are Cotton and Perdue. And he should give his own account of what happened somewhere. He chose to do that on Twitter.</p>

<p>I don’t see how you have a problem with almost any of these tweets.</p>

<p>Hypothetically:</p>

<p>What if the sex assault charges were true? Or even what if he just paid off accusers?

<p>I don&#39;t even care if you respond. I just want you and other supporters to ask your self these questions and be intellectually honest enough about the answers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will admit there aren&#39;t many things that trump has done that I agree with/support. It feels like even when he starts to do something that I would support the way he does it is a huge turn off. I can&#39;t think of an example but I remember feel this way a few times. If I&#39;m honest with you though I don&#39;t feel like he has accomplished very much at all in general and the few things he has I don&#39;t agree with. 
Getting out of the TPP is maybe the one thing I can say for certain that I&#39;m happy about. It bugs me that he wants to take credit for a strong economy like he caused it. It&#39;s literally been growing at the same rate since 2009. You can just google the &#39;Dow jones average for the last ten years&#39; and see it. So I can give him credit that he hasn&#39;t fucked up the economy yet, but it really grinds my gears that he pats himself on the back so hard for basically doing nothing. And I think the new tax plan is going to be a bad thing for most Americans and we&#39;ll see how it effects the economy. </p>

<p>&#39;Refusing to debate theoreticals&#39; is a common stance for trump supports because they don&#39;t want to have to commit to a standard. So many people want to just support trump regardless of any legal, moral or ethical guidelines. </p>

<p>I mean you have people saying stuff like if the president does it, it&#39;s not illegal. Regarding a few things, like conflict of interest, emoluments, obstruction of justice, etc etc.</p>

<p>I would love to hear trump supporters just be able to say, &#39;if the president broke the law he should be impeached.&#39; And be able to stick to it. Not many will, because most believe he has already committed crimes and literally don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>Is it okay for the president to lie? 
Is it okay for the president to break laws? 
Should the president respect all portions of the constitution? </p>

<p>These are not hypothetical questions. I am asking if supporters are willing to hold the president to any standard at all.</p>

<p>The mueller investigation is going to last years. I&#39;m not in a hurry. I&#39;m surprised there&#39;s been so much progress already. To have 2 convictions and 2 guilty pleas is amazing at this point. And I am curious what information they got from those 4 people for the downgrading of the charges. The plea deals had to have big results. But we won&#39;t know for a while. And that&#39;s ok. Why is the president so scared of this? What are republicans fighting it so hard? I think when the dust settles we&#39;ll see exactly why they&#39;ve been obstructing it all along. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because people were saying things like it was obstruction of justice to fire Comey. He was Constitutionally allowed to do that. It is well beyond stupid to say something like that, yet every week we get a new stupid refrain coming from people who want him impeached.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again with the stupidity. It is not obstruction to launch other investigations.</p>

<p>Yes!!

<p>Again, Trump is Constitutionally allowed to fire the FBI director, and that was the whole deal about Comey saying he was not under investigation when Trump fired him. It is patently insane to say that episode was obstruction of justice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Descases ago I worked customizing and implementing customer service and telephony integration systems. One project involved a paging service that sent emails, pager alerts and outbound prerecorded messages to certain groups of people from lists set up by the organization. The amount of things the operator would need to do to release the messages out to devices were way beyond any possibility of “pushing the wrong button”. This was a relatively open system in terms of the type of industry it could be implemented in, but still relatively low tech and unsophisticated, although 100% software based apart from the already in place standard protocol telephony devices. This was at least 25 years ago. I can’t imagine the security levels that must be in place at this level. In my mind “some dude pushed the wrong button”  seems like a laugh in your face type of explanation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a cut and paste from a longer reply that I did earlier explaining how the system works:</p>

<p>Easy to accidentally send a false alarm, since the box is set up to send a preconfigured alert. Not so easy to retract an alert because there is no procedure to do that. Normally you just send out an alert and it expires by itself in an hour. Say, a Flash Flood Warning or a Tornado Warning. (There is a laundry list of different alerts that all the agencies and organizations handle - mostly weather related, but a few interesting ones like Radiological Hazard Warning and Nuclear Accident Warning.) Anyway, you send out your warning and it has a start time of when you activated it and an automatic end time (expiration) of one hour later.  (In certain instances, the alert will be pre-configured to expire in a different amount of time from 15 min to 3 hours, but that is rare.) There really isn&#39;t a procedure to retract an active alert. It can&#39;t officially be done at all with the equipment we use. (Otherwise, say we had the President activate the Emergency Action Notification... a bad guy could then falsely cancel the alert, rendering it useless.) They had to somehow manually notify the sending agencies to manually put out messages that tell everyone to stand down.</p>

<p>An example of this: As part of the activation of IPAWS, the highway reader boards displayed the original alert. There was no way to shut them off. They had to have the state emergency management organization contact the highway department and get them to manually reprogram the boards and display a second message, letting people know that the first message was a false alarm. It was a complex problem with a lot of headscratching.</p>

<p>I am making some educated guesses about how their system works and how the different agencies talk to each other, because it&#39;s slightly different from state to state.</p>

<p>EDIT: I am finding out a little more about how Hawaii IPAWS interfaces with the military on the island.  They have the normal drop-down menu to select the type of alert.  Among the choices are &quot;Missile Alert&quot; and &quot;Test Missile Alert&quot;.  The employee was apparently about to perform a test drill and selected the wrong entry from the drop-down menu.

    <div class="md"><p>I am guessing here...</p>

<p>The &quot;Missile Alert&quot; is actually coded as a Civil Danger Warning (CDW) code (or possibly a CEM Civil Emergency Message) which would immediately trigger all the filters and hit all the cell phones, TV stations, radio stations, cable TV, highway reader boards and everything else within earshot.</p>

<p>The &quot;Test Missile Alert&quot; was probably supposed to be coded as an ADR Administrative Message or a DMO Practice Demo Warning.  There are a couple of odd codes that we don&#39;t use very often. These would not get past our filters, and thus would only be logged by our equipment with no further action. It wouldn&#39;t get out to the cell phones, tv and radio stations, highway reader boards, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think your onto something but I don’t think Trump is any more than a figurehead in this. I think there’s some social experiment going on here, a test of the emergency system that trump “constructed” in a way to understand human behavior and measure the impact of an emergency situation of that magnitude. 
Someone made the point prior that Hawaii is a nice little controlled environment to such an experiment. That makes sense. Logically and in relation to current climate between NK and the US, Hawaii is the most benign option due to its isolation and similarity to possible target locations in the mainland. Hawaii’s population density is ~222 people per square mile and the US’ population density was ~91/sq mi in 2016; this makes Hawaii reflective of possible target California at 251/sqmi. This experiment could never be completed in, for example, Southern Califorina. People would drive straight down to Mexico, can you imagine that nightmare? 
I just hope the US govt and military are able to compile enough data in order to implement some plan of action. </p>

Hillary Clinton received an intelligence briefing in April 2011 from Sidney Blumenthal, who just happened to be working in Libya with an ex-CIA operative on a $10,000 month salary paid by the Clinton Foundation, informing her of the gold dinar currency plan, as well as the location where the gold and silver reserves had recently been moved to, along with more explicit descriptions of where exactly in the country that location fell.  6 months later Gaddafi was dead and Hillary was bragging about it (we came, we saw, he died, ha ha ha)</p>

If your argument is that this is not real escalation, I would agree with you, but it might suffice as plausible deniability were some rogue intelligence faction to launch a missle and blame it on NK, which is theory #4.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most likely scenario here is that a deep state false flag was planned to attack Hawaii and blame North Korea - which was either called off or thwarted. If a missile really was launched and shot down every developed nation would be tracking it, I doubt it could be covered up. The possibility of it just be a &#39;mistake&#39; is unlikely but I suppose plausible. The idea of it being a mistake that took 38 minutes to discover and retract just doesn&#39;t seem plausible to me. </p>

<p>the last thing the war mongering neo cons in Washington want are peaceful negotiations between north and South Korea. You can be they&#39;re hard at work attempting to sabotage those negotiations, and if all else fails, I don&#39;t think a false flag is out of the question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how many nations have the ability to identify and track a sub launched missle from anywhere on the globe with no advance notice? I don&#39;t know, but wondering if the list is any longer than us, Russia, and maybe Israel?  Would the European countries have it or would they rely on us for it?  And if someone else did identify it, would they necessarily say anything about it publicly and incur the wrath of whoever launched it?  Again, can&#39;t say I know, but definitely wondering about it...</p>

<p>If deep state has no qualms about disintegrating 3 buildings in Manhattan and killing 3k+ people, I wouldn&#39;t put it past them to actually launch a missle in a limited nuclear strike on a relatively small island, especially if they are under a systemic coordinated attack, and they have a madman close by to blame it on - sounds pretty much exactly like something they might do.</p>

If that button gets pushed accidentally, what would be more time critical than getting a false alarm message out?  wouldn&#39;t they have trained specifically for this possibility?  these are all obvious questions, will we ever see any answers to them?

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it might just be a mistake. In the Navy, we were visiting a foreign country and had the president of said country coming aboard. We were (as we’ve done numerous times now) told to play the local anthem for the country through the ship’s external and internal speakers as a nice gesture. Well, someone decided not to check the CD player and a damn 3 Doors Down song started playing instead of the anthem. Boy were the CO and XO pissed off.  There are idiots everywhere. Can’t rule out stupidity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Copied my response from above. </p>

<p>The Q phenomenon is where you&#39;d probably get most of it.  <a href="/r/CBTS_Stream">/r/CBTS_Stream</a> is the largest subreddit covering that.  Q is a person or group of people who posted /pol then on 8chan.  They are thought to be very close to the president or military intelligence.  They asks a considerable amount of leading/socratic questions and those questions tend to be somewhat coded.</p>

<p>For balance, others think it is a detailed LARP or psy-op.</p>

<p>You should find things like spreadsheets that list all of Q&#39;s communication (along with the communities answers to his questions) in that subreddit, perhaps in the sidebar.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, the thought is that NK is basically not what it seems in the news, but a front for the more nefarious aspects of the US Deep State apparatus...especially branches of the CIA.</p>
