<p>EDIT: If a missile was being shot at my country, I would first try to intercept it to prevent casualities.<br/>
If I would succeed, I would keep it a secret, because this enables me to blackmail the country who did it.<br/>
A purposeful attack which has been parried is an embarrassment to the attacker.  </p>

<p>Especially right now, when there are close to 10 000 indictments and Trump is closing in on the deep state.<br/>
War with North Korea at this moment would draw the highlight away from Democrat corruption,<br/>
which is probably going to be soon revealed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re absolutely right, I’m not arguing the merits of the points made. By calling them names and ridiculing them you’re taking away from the point you’re trying to make to correct them. Not every participant here is a native English speaker, so you should really kind of try to work with people trying to do their best to communicate what they mean. What you’ve been writing, it really does make you look bad in the end. </p>

<p>If I used the type of language you have been using to communicate with the previous commenter, what I said could’ve been written as “you’re an ignorant bigot who can’t understand everyone doesn’t speak native English and even those who do may not be studied enough to communicate as well as you. You make for an even funnier replacement to the 8pm network sitcoms. Thanks for making me laugh so hard. I’m printing this to show all the guys at work on Monday, they’ll have a hoot!!!!”</p>

<p>I hope you can understand I am trying to use these words to illustrate my point and not actually using those words against you. I am simply seeing an excellent point be diminished by unnecessary insults and ridicule. You’re obviously a smart person, be above these behaviors. I mean to help. No hate. </p>

Use a US or Foreign sub to fire a missile at an economically insignificant (in the grand scheme of things) off the mainland.

    <div class="md"><p>I just think it wouldn&#39;t be possible to hide the evidence from the rest of the world of said missile interception or launch for that matter.  I could entirely see this either being a stupid mistake and the person that fucked up not having a clue of said fuck up until the shitstorm on social media.  I could also see it being some kind of political statement by someone that could give two shits about his/her job and just wanted to make Trump look bad (golfing).   </p>
