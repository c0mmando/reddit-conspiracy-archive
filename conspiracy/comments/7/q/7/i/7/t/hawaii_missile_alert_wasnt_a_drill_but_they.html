       Title says it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: If a missile was being shot at my country, I would first try to intercept it to prevent casualities.
       <br/>
       If I would succeed, I would keep it a secret, because this enables me to blackmail the country who did it.
       <br/>
       A purposeful attack which has been parried is an embarrassment to the attacker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially right now, when there are close to 10 000 indictments and Trump is closing in on the deep state.
       <br/>
       War with North Korea at this moment would draw the highlight away from Democrat corruption,
       <br/>
       which is probably going to be soon revealed.

       Theories are not opinions, opinions are opinions.

       A theory is formed based on evidence/observation/experimentation.

       if you're going to go around trying to correct people, it's probably best to have a basic understanding of English. Otherwise you just end up looking like a complete dumbass.

       You’re absolutely right, I’m not arguing the merits of the points made. By calling them names and ridiculing them you’re taking away from the point you’re trying to make to correct them. Not every participant here is a native English speaker, so you should really kind of try to work with people trying to do their best to communicate what they mean. What you’ve been writing, it really does make you look bad in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I used the type of language you have been using to communicate with the previous commenter, what I said could’ve been written as “you’re an ignorant bigot who can’t understand everyone doesn’t speak native English and even those who do may not be studied enough to communicate as well as you. You make for an even funnier replacement to the 8pm network sitcoms. Thanks for making me laugh so hard. I’m printing this to show all the guys at work on Monday, they’ll have a hoot!!!!”
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you can understand I am trying to use these words to illustrate my point and not actually using those words against you. I am simply seeing an excellent point be diminished by unnecessary insults and ridicule. You’re obviously a smart person, be above these behaviors. I mean to help. No hate.

       Anyways my point is. Hey-you’re right, ok? But talking to some people is just fucking pointless.  By arguing with crazy people you will cement their ignorance, muddy the waters, anger yourself, and just look crazy yourself.

       I think it much more likely that it was a hacked message or false alarm - than a downed missile.  Why would a country need to be blackmailed?

       Look if actual missiles had been in the air N. Korea would have been leveled by now. This was clearly a massive fuck up.

       Some larper on 4chan (not the Q guy) is saying he works at a HI AFB and was ordered to call it real.

       To reply directly to your comment, what if there was a missile, and we didn't level NK.....what does that say?

       Hypothetically - it could have been “Cabal” assets of the US MIC trying to initiate a false flag attack to distract and pull us into a war. Use a US or Foreign sub to fire a missile at an economically insignificant (in the grand scheme of things) off the mainland. Why wouldn’t NK target Los Angeles or Dallas or whatever, something more significant if they truly wanted a “first strike” scenario to majorly impact and cripple the US

       I just think it wouldn't be possible to hide the evidence from the rest of the world of said missile interception or launch for that matter.  I could entirely see this either being a stupid mistake and the person that fucked up not having a clue of said fuck up until the shitstorm on social media.  I could also see it being some kind of political statement by someone that could give two shits about his/her job and just wanted to make Trump look bad (golfing).

       I'll be interested in how many lawsuits will be filed from "mental duress", etc., how many more children were conceived today compared to last year, how many addicts relapsed, how many virgins lost their virginity, etc etc etc
