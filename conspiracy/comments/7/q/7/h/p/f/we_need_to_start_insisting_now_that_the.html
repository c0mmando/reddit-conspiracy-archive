       I watched another of his videos and was unsure because the full video is members only... he talks about his he is ok with people disagreeing with him on dinosaurs, evolution, flat earth... I can find the he believes dinasaurs are a fraud, he mentions evolution is a fraud so I thought he was flat earth  but can’t congirn that without paying him...
      </p>
      <p>
       What little I could gather from his site he clearly has a poor understanding of fossil dating, doesn’t believes in atoms, seems to be against evolution... and not sure about the whole flat earth thing...

       "33 proofs the earth is not flat" is sarcastic. I am disappointed I must say.

       Its hard too actually evaluate ideas behind a pay wall... but his dismissal of carbon dating because he claims it “can’t be verified” and atoms might not exist ignores tons of math and science and geology. Carbon dating can be verified using geologic principles like real rock layers and arctic core samples.For anyone who studies college level physical chemistry, physics, math etc atoms are pretty compelling. For people who do chemistry or biochemistry or physics their work and observable pheromona seem to fit with our understanding of atomic theory although quantum theory did upturn quite a bit of science. He simply seems ignorant or contrarian... just because he doesn’t understand a concept doesn’t make the concept wrong... but I wouldn’t know because I would have to pay him to see all his arguments...
      </p>
      <p>
       And since he is not a scholar of ancient Greeks, and as far as I can tell has nit visited archeological sites, read the works of sncyrnrs Greeks, studied contemporary sources in the original language why should I find his claims compelling and pay this guy to tell me how to think?

       Also, atoms are a model, an abstraction. They don't exist stricto sensu; an "atom" is mostly empty space, made of few/distant
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle">
        elementary particles

       You clearly aren’t a scientist. No scientist thinks we have perfect knowledge. We are only beginning to understand quantum and sub atomic interactions. We still don’t have a unified theory of physics. What we do have is mathematically derived hypothesis that we can test with experiments and predict the observed results. This has allowed us to create models for how atoms behave and even approximate models of molecules. Now these are models and visualizations but the models largely work and are continuously refined and updated. We can see cellular level objects with electron microscopy and smaller objects with X-ray crystallography. They can
detect sub atomic particles in large colliders. I don’t mind people questioning, but it bothers me when people question when they haven’t developed and understanding of the centuries of mathematical, physical and chemical theoretical and experimental work that has been done. Simply these equations allow
us to create nuclear power plants, modern polymers, modern medical imaging, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a difference in science between testing and challenging theories and claiming that since the theory isn’t 100% worked out that the whole thing is garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this Jon Bon is a cheap dirty salesman, he even has a couple condescending  video about how  conspiracy theorists don’t like him... so he can distance himself from the fringe and be the real source of truth... this guy is money grubbing snake oil salesman...

       I actually am, but I have graduated a long time ago, which as you will see will make you more humble about what you think you now. My advice is don't tell an older colleague you think you have "developed an understanding of the centuries of mathematical, physical and chemical theoretical and experimental work that has been done."

       I don’t have an personal knowledge of centuries of learning and my understanding of quantum is pretty limited as it does not directly affect my work... I do know that in my little corner of science phsyfiak and chemical principles have held up and while they are continuously tweaked I can reasonably say atoms likely exist and from my understanding and talking to friends in related fields things like evolution, carbon dating, plate tectonics, etc have largely held up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that much of what we know evolves and changes and that things understood as fact even a decade ago are overturned, but so far atomic theory has evolved but held. Sure sting theory fell apart and we have really a limited understanding of how orbitals and individual atoms interact.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don’t know why you think I am your junior. I have been working in science on a post grad level for the past decade... for all I know you have some Bachelor of Arts science from some second rate university 5 years ago and work in some unrelated position...

       A few quotes for you to ponder my friend.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.
        <em>
         (Charles Darwin)
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.
        <em>
         (William Shakespeare)
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance.
        <em>
         (Confucius)
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.

       Thank you for the condescending quotes... that are out of context and don’t apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t disagree that people should question what is taught, but they should also use empirical questioning to evaluate their line of questioning...   not simplifications and intuition.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mistake me as confident or unable to ponder other hypothesis... I am not a blind follower and I am not at all confident in human knowledge as theories get tweaked and overturned regularly. But I also don’t accept any random persons musings or inturions as particuarly valuable input unless they can produce empirical and vetted evidence for their reasoning... basically the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I accept that I won’t be able to personally get every piece of human knowledge myself. Some is beyond me. I am not smart enough. I cannot understand a lot of cosmology. I don’t get a lot of hawkings work or work at cern. But I do trust that peer review has vetted these ideas and as such will text and challenge them to see if they bear out... but I know I cannot retest every theory or principal. That would be onerous and paralyzing... sometimes you have to trust others too...

       I can't see his arguments since they are behind a paywall... hence the accusation of a dirty snake oil salesman... But I am not a physicist or geologist or or paleontologist. I did once cover carbon dating in physics courses and it seemed to largely make sense at the time. The professors and books made no secret that there are inaccuracies and challenges. I covered enough geology to recognize plate tetonic theory seems to make sense. And I know enough chemistry to understand the basics of fossil creation. I know a fair bit about biochemistry and biology and statistics to appreciate and understand evolutionary theories. Putting it all together, the case for dinosaurs and the various eras, supported with other data regarding climate and atmospheric conditions in different eras it all generally fits.

       I have no interest in my amateur knowledge stacked up against his amateur knowledge except mine tend to be backed by the plethora of scientifically derived data.

      <p>
       What bothers me is his free videos providing no evidence, making bold faced claims, and then trying to get you to pay money to see his supporting data. Why would I pay some nobody money to hear him lecture on areas where he has 0 credibility and expertise...

       A variety of methods, from geological strata and formations to mineral composition of surrounding soil etc. Its not perfect... you are dating things that are millions of years old but it can help get a ball park... There are some compelling fossils, with dates the largely fit what we know about plate tectonics, geology, evolution, and carbon dating... for sure details of such creatures do evolve... things like coloring, feathers, behavior, intelligence are very hard to extrapolate. Appearance can be hard to recreate without seeing the musculature or often a complete skeleton... but the disparate pieces of the fossils fit to support dinosaurs and other life forms that preceded earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why I struggle is with why people doubt that creatures might have predated man and the many have gone extinct and that these creatures being earlier in the evolutionary tree and evolved under different conditions might have looked very different from modern creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be the height of hubris to think that humans somehow had to there from the beginning rather than part of a prolonged evolutionary process from single cell organisms to modern day creatures with many dead ends along the way and that to get to the complexity of modern humans it would take evolution millions of years?
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you arguing? That dinosaurs are less old or older than scientists claim, or do you just believe carbon dating inaccurate? But then what about earlier methods like geological strata? Or evolutionary studies? Or that where we find certain dinosaur fossil fits plate tetonics? Or do you just believe that its all a carefully orchestrated hoax?

       Good to hear. Thanks. I didn’t watch it in full but it seemed his “33 proofs the earth isn’t flat” was sarcastic / dry humor. Anyway even if he was, that wouldn’t invalidate everything he says; people can be wrong on one thing and right on another.

       What is up with that website?  Am I doing it wrong, but when I opened up a topic from the forum, you only see one reply.  Then you got to click on the next reply to reload the page, etc.  Any way around that, as that is annoying?

        Compilation of chambers and tunnels under the Sphinx points to a very real 'Hall of Records'. Many of these tunnels were originally shown and then never brought up again by Zahi Hawass, the 'gatekeeper' of mainstream Egyptology. News to me! [x/p /r/holofractal]

       Zahi is out of his original job yeah, but he's the head of the science committee on the project that found this cavity in the great pyramid. He's already saying it's nothing. I wish this guy would just leave archeology alone.

       You're too hopeful. When they did that survey of the Sphinx and found cavities underneath, Hawass himself went in, didn't take pictures, veiled the dig so no one could see, said "there are caves but they're natural formations, guess that settles that" and has prevented anyone else from looking ever since. We're not gonna get to see.

       I mean shit, they won't even let that team who used the robot to explore the shafts in the main chamber back into the great pyramid to do more work on that new room

        But Zahi Hawass, who heads the ScanPyramids science committee overseeing the project, said there was no new “discovery”. He said he had met other scientists from ScanPyramids who “showed us their conclusions, and we informed them this is not a discovery,” he told AFP. “The pyramid is full of voids and that does not mean there is a secret chamber or a new discovery,” he said. “The project has to proceed in a scientific way that follows the steps of scientific research and its discussion before publication,” he added.

       I totally agree...but good luck getting Egypt to do that.  Egypt has 0 motive if the truth doesn't line up with the excepted narrative.  On top of that other governments like the US wouldn't like the truth to get out if it disagrees with there established narrative.  I personally think the Pyramids are pre flood tech.

       This is why I mentioned Lehner - he was sponsored by the Cayce Foundation which could be used to twist his arm but I don't know if he is still in charge of the Eg. Ant.

       True enough and I agree with you problem is I'm so jaded right now I wouldn't even trust a live stream that could be faked also if they really wanted to.  Damn the paranoia but I have 0 trust in just about any government right now.  But I hope it happens and I'll watch abet with a skeptics eye.

       Yeah - hear ya and could echo everything you say - were it not for the recent release of the UFO video by the Pentagon I would have considered this endeavor a total waste of time but now, well, you know, its remotely possible and I don't have anything else to do so I figured, what the hey, might as well give it a shot.

       That report freaked me out...not that there is UFO's OMG ok we've known that all along...what freaked me out is the sudden change in stance of the government for no apparent reason.  I'm military and it's people like me who get killed in these Alien invasions faked or not. I really don't trust my government anymore Trump or not they all work for the same elites.  I myself have a lot of stored positive karma points also. Me thinks we will be needing them sooner than later. But who knows that's just a theory....a Conspiracy theory. LOL Love Game/movie theory guy on youtube.  Back to the asteroid chair if it turns out to be that....I'm going to be double skeptical about it...why would you put a important chair that every ruler in Egypt would have to sit in after death in such a hard place to get access to...this smells.  Also this news came up right after the US government disclosed there belief in UFO's.  If I get recalled to active duty over some Alien farce I'm going to be pissed.

       There is some evidence to suggest that some of the erosion on the Sphinx and the Pyramids (of Giza at least) may have been caused by water and not just wind and sand, and if I remember right, also suggests that they are
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       older than the narrative suggests.

       I personally believe they were used for ceremonies and initiation into hermetic mystery religions and the like. You should check out Manly P Hall's discussion on it

       If you're not into an hour long video, here's an excerpt from his book
       <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta09.htm">
        The Secret Teachings of All Ages
       </a>
       which I highly recommend if you're in to this kind of thing
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the King's Chamber was enacted the drama of the "second death." Here the candidate, after being crucified upon the cross of the solstices and the equinoxes, was buried in the great coffer. There is a profound mystery to the atmosphere and temperature of the King's Chamber: it is of a peculiar deathlike cold which cuts to the marrow of the bone. This room was a doorway between the material world and the transcendental spheres of Nature. While his body lay in the coffer, the soul of the neophyte soared as a human-headed hawk through the celestial realms, there to discover first hand the eternity of Life, Light, and Truth, as well as the illusion of Death, Darkness, and Sin. Thus in one sense the Great Pyramid may be likened to a gate through which the ancient priests permitted a few to pass toward the attainment of individual completion. It is also to be noted incidentally that if the coffer in the King's Chamber be struck, the sound emitted has no counterpart in any known musical scale. This tonal value may have formed part of that combination of circumstances which rendered the King's Chamber an ideal setting for the conferment of the highest degree of the Mysteries.

       I've heard about the water erosion evidence before. Extremely interesting stuff. Joe Rogan had a couple of podcasts with Graham Hancock and Russel Carlson that touched on this a bit and were super interesting to me anyways.

       Yeah I was being purposely vague about it...I'm a christian but not one of those bible thumper types.  I personally think that a flood happened like the bible says but I don't believe that those people weren't Tech advanced like our history books say.  Who knows what the pyramids were for they could have been power stations but to say they put a single ruler in there as a grave...is asinine.  There is a cover up going on. Bible also says there were giants back then and there is evidence supporting that.  So yeah just another dude looking for the truth the more I dig it seems the less I know.

       Unless we get people like Hancock, Dunn and Bauval on board - that's the only chance we have - remember, that's what the Disclosure people said until the Pentagon released that UFO video - if its gonna be done, now is the time - perhaps someone could consider presenting it to the UN somehow...

       It’s my understanding that the Hall of Records is supposed to rival the library of Alexandria as a repository of the knowledge of humanity, in a time before books were widespread. The thought is that if the hall of records and library at Alexandria had not been lost, we would have landed on the moon in the 1500’s.

       Guy by the name of Ralf Ellis thinks he found the location for the Hall of Records using the Fibonacci Spiral and I think he is right cause another author targeted the same location and went to check it out and they had fenced it off.  It is a little ways off from the pyramid - scroll down a couple pages...

       The thing that troubles me with that book is that it says “Anti-chamber”, instead of Antechamber. If this was even halfway credible, a basic spelling / grammar check or editor would have caught this... :/

       Wild thought but even if you found a callus book I still think the moon is farfetched. We defiantly needed and industrial revolution just to see that possibility future. I’m curious though as to who else got close to one and fell before they had a chance to push further. Remember we split atoms before space, so who knows what order another empire would have tried.

       Instead of retyping it all you can find what I think at the Thread below which directly led to this thread on Reddit but I will summarize.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Book of the Dead indicates a chamber similar to the Grand Gallery that the funeral procession would have taken on the way to the King's Chamber. That thread contains the pics which I don't know how to imbed here.

       In down with them making a little money to fund the Livestream and dig off live streaming.
      </p>

       I'd pay quite a bit for the opportunity honestly as long as they had multiple cameras and I didn't have to worry about the feed being cut once they get to the interesting stuff.

       If it does fit the "establishment story" you will claim the stream was pre-recorded or faked. Or that they removed the artefacts before the stream.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a live stream will do nothing to prevent those things.

       Really, genius?  Who the hell are you to judge me.  I have spent the last fucking decade trying to convince the revisionists that any theory of the pyramid must fit the Context which is what the Egyptologists themselves insist on.  I wrote a reply to the person who proves the 'helicopter glyph' at Abbydos is not a helicopter or UFO that his judgment is correct so don't sit there on your fat lazy ass and try to tell me and everyone else what I will, or will not, conclude from whatever is discovered you worthless piece of shit - you are part of the problem so STFU!

       they just need to drill a small hole big enough to fit a small robot with a high def camera in. Then have it broadcast live to the world. Im sure the CIA has just the bot for the job. if not, this kind of thing is not that difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could easily run a line up to the mouth and broadcast the feed from the robot to the router via bluetooth, wifi, or most likely zigbee given its range, might need wifi for the high def though.

       it will obviously be recorded if they ever do try and get into it, you really think they would miss out on that documentary $$$ and publicity? you dont live in the real world if you think they wouldn't do so. the likelihood of them ever excavating it is extremely low, decades of more scanning is needed before they even contemplate trying to "explore". many archeologists firmly believe that we shouldnt touch anything until we have a proper plan and have run through tests and simulations, so we can can decrease the likelihood of catastrophic failure.

       Yeah - there's a rumor they were digging tunnels above the Antechamber between 1997-2004 which, if true, means they won't even let the blimp robot in cause they would find the recent excavation and have to explain why they kept it secret for over a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that begs the question why they let them do any type of testing there at all..

       The thing that troubles me with that book is that it says “Anti-chamber”, instead of Antechamber. If this was even halfway credible, a basic spelling / grammar check or editor would have caught this... :/

       True enough and I agree with you problem is I'm so jaded right now I wouldn't even trust a live stream that could be faked also if they really wanted to.  Damn the paranoia but I have 0 trust in just about any government right now.  But I hope it happens and I'll watch abet with a skeptics eye.

       Good luck finding what John le bonn believes in that entire extensive post... he doesn’t believe in flat earth or that earth is a round rotating planetary body orbiting the sun... but become a member of his site and read 50 entities and you will find out!
