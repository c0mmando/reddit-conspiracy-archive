    <div class="md"><p>What’s sad is that a lot of the artists and art “aficionados” don’t seem to notice what’s going on. I’ve had friends try to explain why some pieces go for so much as artists and it’s laughable. Squiggly lines on a white canvas or garbage arranged in a particular way will never be worth millions, unless it’s being used as a way to hide millions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No shit.  A Jackson Pollock painting going to millions?  It’d not particularly old, it doesn’t show extraordinary artistic ability...it’s just a random ugly ass painting that people have decided is now worth an exorbitant amount of money.  </p>

<p>Does work great for laundering money.  Want to funnel millions to someone off the books?  But a shitty painting from them for the amount owed...and now in the “industry” the painting has an agreed upon base price.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With Jackson Pollock in particular, that’s not true. Art is definitely subjective so if you don’t appreciate his work then that’s alright, but you should consider the amount of time it probably took him to complete some of those paintings. Look at his painting No. 1. The layering there is pretty complicated and wasn’t accidental. Think about it in regards to the colors used. Also, a lot of his work was a result of technique influenced by body movement. It might not be visually appealing to you or maybe you’re not a fan of Abstract Expressionism or evocative artwork that lacks a subject, but there are these things called the elements and principles of art that guide critique, thereby helping to attribute value to what’s considered “good art.”</p>

<p>Is there laundering going on? Absolutely yes, it’s a great cover because it’s totally subjective. But you can’t say a child could do what Jackson Pollock did. They could make something similar and arguably “better” from any one person’s point of view, but children lack the discipline and mental capacity to create something that would match or replicate the thought and intention behind some of his paintings. There’s a reason he’s a respected artist. I might call it refined vision.</p>

<p>We’re talking about reselling art in suspected laundering cases though, which clearly has potential to inflate the price for any number of reasons, nefarious or not. That doesn’t have anything to do with the artist.</p>

<p>tl;dr Value is always subjective but there are ways to objectively analyze art. Don’t shit on Jackson Pollock, a respectable artist, because rich criminals think they’re sneaky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA and Modern Art has little to do with Money Laundering. It was about promoting Abstractic Expressionism over Soviet Realism, believing that the vibrancy vs dogma would win over the European intellectuals to the West.</p>

<p>They did this as well with Left-Wing journals (no one is making money there) and conferences. Side note: my pet theory is Clinton was in England for the CIA to go to these conferences and observe various protests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the gist of it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An ex-CIA operative, Steven D Kelley, claims that the knighting of Sir Paul Getty was payment for services rendered in building the Getty Center Museum complex and the massive deep underground facilities beneath the Center. This man purports that the Getty Museum is situated over a vast tunnel network and massive underground facility designed to house the British Royal Family in the event they should need to go into hiding. The operative also claims that there are thousands of children being bred and held captive under the Getty Fortress and used in breeding programs, satanic ritual abuse and then harvested as food, adrenalized blood elixirs and bone marrow stem cell crops. Please see the bottom of this article to sign a petition, organized by Kelley, to request that the United States Marines raid the Getty and free these captive children.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Since Darwin and Freud, there has been a complete “revaluation of all values.” Everything has been turned upside down. We can mostly attribute this parlous state of affairs to the machinations of organized Jewry, in particular to a group of revolutionary thinkers known as the Frankfurt School.  (For a detailed introduction to the ideas of these neo-Freudian Marxists, most of whom were Jewish refugees from Hitler’s Germany who fled to America, see Chapter 5 of Kevin MacDonald’s The Culture of Critique).</p>

<p>Just as one of these Frankfurters, Theodor Adorno, set out to destroy Western music, assuring the world that atonal music was a good thing because it was discordant and ugly, others in the group set out to destroy art and push it to its reductio ad absurdum: lights going on and off  in an empty room, unmade beds with condoms and bloodstained panties strewn around, and sealed cans containing the artist’s own excrement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched a documentary on Netflix about the ridiculous sums of money art is worth nowadays. It was enlightening as to the total lack of oversight over the industry, as well as the way it runs.</p>

<p>It is an industry that is relative only to the super rich and powerful. </p>

<p><a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gagosian-fundraising-auction-hillary-clinton-627395">Here</a> is a link to an article about one of the most powerful art collectors in the world auctioning off some of his pieces to help fund the Clinton Campaign. If anything, this goes to show that politics is already tied to art on some level.</p>

<p>There is a lot of potential digging that should be done on this subject, but with the lack of oversight and the multitude of purchases done to anonymous buyers/sellers would make it almost impossible to trace. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the perfect way to move gigantic sums of money around.</p>

<p>Jeffery Loria, MLB owner, made his fortune in art dealing: </p>

<p>“In February 2017, it was reported that Loria had been in negotiations to sell the Marlins to the family of Jared Kushner, son-in-law of President Donald Trump, and that the parties came to &quot;a handshake deal&quot;.[26] At the same time, the Trump Administration was working to name Loria Ambassador to France.[28] In response to those reports, Kushner announced that his family would not buy the club if Loria was appointed to the position.[29]” </p>

<p>You know the Kushners are the dirtiest family around, so this Schmuck isn’t far behind. </p>

<p>Wow wealth circles are indeed just a web, especially for a certain type of person. I need not say more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Art used to be supported by royalty and the church. Then it became support by the bourgeoisie. That led to a huge change of aesthetics. One things you must understand is that art is funnier than it might seem at first. It’s a hidden joke you can get in on, and sometimes a hidden joke mocking the patron.</p>

<p>Here is a great example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apparently, when the Pope saw the finished portrait, he exclaimed, somewhat disconcerted: &quot;Troppo vero!&quot; (&quot;all too true!&quot;), though he was not able to deny the intrinsic quality of the portrait as a masterpiece.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Innocent_X">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Innocent_X</a></p>

<p>The World Wars is what makes this aesthetic change. Look at Dada and the art of the time. Thing of what patronage means as Europe is being destroyed.</p>

<p>People will note that the CIA heavily funded Modern Art. It should be clear the reason for doing so: they thought Soviet Realism was a very dull aesthetic, and that to promote Contemporary American Art, they would win over intellectuals towards the side of the West.</p>

<p>Aside: In the Burton movies, the Joker seems to have some interesting connections to the CIA. Their is a brief glimpse of a newspaper involving testing LSD on soldiers in Vietnam. Then there is the museum scene, think of that as talking about the CIA and Modern art.</p>

<p>Now, thousands of dollars is not laundering much money, but let’s say you meant to say Millions. Fine Art could be used to launder money, but to start doing that you need to have clean money with which to buy the initial art ... or a gallery that takes cash (some do) ... but that could setup some questions when it comes to provenance, and is the gallery owner going down for you? Also, an auction usually involves a 20% cut for the artist on top. Meaning if you pay $10 million for a piece of art, it really costs you $12 million. Let’s say you sell that for $20 million a few years later at another auction. There’s a fair amount of taxes involved. Now the thing about laundered money is by nature of being cleaned, it’s taxed. It’s just that this particular way of laundering money adds another 20% to it.</p>

<p>Now in addition to the gallery fee and taxes, you have to make it worth more money. Greasing the art publicity machine is going to cost you some additional cash. You also have to know how to do it, which you probably don’t. You’re going to need a good crooked specialist. You’ll need to find that person, and then pay them. They’ll probably want a percentage of the sale rather than a salaried fee (that’s how salesman work.)</p>

<p>Selling your $10 million piece for a crookedly inflated price of $20 million might only net you an additional $1 million in clean money. That’s a lot of work.</p>

<p>I’d talk more, but I think instead I should open it for questions and comments.</p>

<p>Buy a painting for 1 million and Loan it to a museum.  That&#39;s a million that you don&#39;t pay taxes on.<br/>
The painting advertises itself at the museum and increases in value.<br/>
The owner takes it out of the museum and auctions it off for an exponential profit with a negligible tax.</p>
