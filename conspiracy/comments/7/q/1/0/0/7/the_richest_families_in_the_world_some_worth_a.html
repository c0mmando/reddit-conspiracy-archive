       They acquired money through a voluntary exchange of transactions. If it is acquired illegally, then I agree. Otherwise what you're suggesting is immoral and based on jealousy.
      </p>

       Edit: Just because 2/3 people in a room vote to take the third guy's money, that does not make it moral.

       Nothing to do with "jealousy," just a realization that most of these families did not earn the wealth themselves, but on the backs of thousands and thousands of people who actually did work and not just sit at a desk and make decisions.  Just because one wants to live in a society that is fair and just does not make one jealous of the cowards at the top.

       But those people that are sitting in desks are doing so voluntarily. They could do something else if they wanted. You have a very simplistic way of looking at the world.

       Should we live in a society that is fair to you? We'll use u/K722's system of distribution. I'm sorry if I come across as a jackass, from my point of view you're a thief.

       Should we take Bill Gate's wealth? Well, no. Him being wealthy helps all of us. Now we get to use a cool computer, and he donates a significant amount to charity.

       You're thinking about things all wrong. We all need to have a collaborative thought. Meaning we all think what is best for everything and the whole. Bill Gates along with the others need to dismantle their wealth and distribute it evenly amongst society in an orderly fashion. We need to do what's best for human beings and the Earth as a whole not just these certain families. This shit goes way deeper than the ego.

       So, what's best for society is theft? Bill Gates has given the world an immense amount of value back to society through his founding of Microsoft. Not just from Windows and how that has affected the world, but all the people employed by Microsoft, or the people that got bought out.

       Once you start stealing money from people who build opportunity for others, you start down a path that will lead to despair and anguish.

       Robin hood was about robbing the tax collector, not the trader.

       I don't think you should be lecturing people on morality or sympathy. You're the one toting about saying we should strip people of their wealth. You have no idea what effect this would have on society, preciously because you don't empathize with your employer when he/she signs your check.

       If you want to live in a fair and just society, start by being the change you want to see, act fair and just. Taxing wealthy families just "because" isn't a good enough reason. You have to prove that they broke the law, otherwise you're even worse then you assume them to be.

       It's probable that these same people set up this system to make this possible. Hence they made the rules to fit their own purpose. To me it's morally grotesque that these people have horded so much unnecessary wealth. As for any jealousy, there is none. Personally I'm prefectly happy with where I'm at in my middle class income. The problem is that this throws the entire world economy out of balance and puts the people at the top in full control. Along with the economy problems it also fucks with the emotional state of humans and the harmony in which we peacefully co-exist.
   For instance this extreme distribution of wealth leads to unfair proportions, which illicits negative emotions and thoughts from those who got the "tiny piece of cake". This then leads to a hostile community and a shit ton of negative emotions such as jealousy, envy, and hatred. That then leads to robbery, rape, murder and do forth. So no it's not a jealousy thing in the least bit, these people are very seriously throwing all of mankind into a huge shitfunk.

       They don't horde the wealth. How much does it cost to employ 5,000 upper-middle class people? Most billionaires would be broke in a matter of weeks if they had to handle payroll at that scale out of their own pocket, not to mention retirement plans, or benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       These wealthy families, and corporations are giving careers, houses, cars, benefits, vacation time, basically a stable life in modern society in exchange for voluntary labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides can benefit from a transaction, and mostly this is what happens. Very seldom do people return items, or experience buyer's remorse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find a way to negotiate with them, but the moment you apply coercion, either by taxing the money, or taking it to be redistribute, you are violating the non-aggression principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       By not following the non-aggression principle you invite hostile communities, theft, rape and murder. Wealth inequality in and of itself isn't immoral, and doesn't cause these things.

       Looting the unethical rich is fine by me, because people like Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Soros the Rothschilds and their kind deserve prison, not mansions.

       But its important to remember that these people are rich either through asshole governments that could be overthrown by the people or by assholes who dont care if they fund dlave labour with their iPhone purchases.

       None of you at understanding this at all. The system in place that allows these people to gain such wealth and power is the whole problem. Stripping these families of their wealth and bringing them down to a normal person level is the start of the solution. We need to balance the world's wealth.

       this is the problem with that system - it leads to imbalance and then to a small set of actors telling everyone else how to be.  and those small sets of actors tend to perpetuate their power.  to fix it you have to build a system of collective effort where everyone gets the rewards of the effort.  yeah people will say "that's communism!".  whatever.  there are ways to do it that still maintain the competitive ratchet effect.  what we don't want is what we have, because it should be clear to everyone where it leads.  and the people who are invested in the status quo have also hoarded the military power.  so we just have to stop enabling their machine.  we start by taking control of our food supply and gain self-sufficiency.  what other choice is there?  it's follow these corrupt shitheads or go our own way.

       We will head to that point eventually. At this point there is capitalism because we are not yet self-sufficient. Technology still is rapidly improving, and we will (soon) reach a point where robots will take most of our jobs. In Europe certain countries already talk about a basic income, which everyone would receive working or not working.

       If one family has a few trillion, why on Earth would you need that much.  Hell if you have 100 family members and give each a couple billion and you still have trillions left.  Jealousy...no.  Grotesque greed where there are people starving, sick, homeless.  I think of all the funding towards cleaner sustainable energy and better overall quality of life for all.  No it is not jealousy, this borders on cruelty to humanity (my opinion).

       I just think some sensible progressive taxation, corporate taxes and regulation would at least spread the wealth of our society so that all could share in the prosperity. I don't think it's much of a stretch to notice that the laws/regulations etc. are tilted to consolidate power and wealth and serve those that have it.

       Should we take Bill Gate's wealth? Well, no. Him being wealthy helps all of us. Now we get to use a cool computer, and he donates a significant amount to charity.

      <p>
       People being wealthy is not a conspiracy.

       If you want to live in a fair and just society, start by being the change you want to see, act fair and just. Taxing wealthy families just "because" isn't a good enough reason. You have to prove that they broke the law, otherwise you're even worse then you assume them to be.

       The OP doesnt realize that the masses who unthinkingly buy from shithole companies like Amazon, where everything is slave made Chinese shit, make it worse for everyone.

       The super rich like Bezos and his kind would not have been rich to begin with if we lived in a truly capitalist society with a truly free market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looting the unethical rich is fine by me, because people like Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Soros the Rothschilds and their kind deserve prison, not mansions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But its important to remember that these people are rich either through asshole governments that could be overthrown by the people or by assholes who dont care if they fund dlave labour with their iPhone purchases.

       And alot of the rich people who do help, they do it for the tax benefits. So in reality, their donations and contributions are for them and their personal benefits. Helping the people who need it is 2nd or 3rd.

       Yeah you're completely wrong. The inequality does cause these things and it always has. Open your eyes buddy these people are demolishing your asshole as we speak.
