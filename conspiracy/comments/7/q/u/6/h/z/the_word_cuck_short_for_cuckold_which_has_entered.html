        Testing firm DNA Clinics, which is part of the Salford-based BioClinics Group, analysed 5,000 results selected randomly from between January 2014 and June 2016. Nearly half of men who take paternity test are not the real father

      <p>
       Personally I see this as the result of getting rid of family values, tight knit community, Christianity (with all its faults at the very least held communities together and taught morals/values) is resulting in a "whatever goes, sleep with whoever, whenever" type of Nu Society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Result, at least in England, is that almost half of all men are raising someone else's kid and dont even know it

       If you're taking a paternity test, then there is an implication that the wife, at least, wasn't faithfulp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of the dozens of couples in friends with, that have children, there have been no paternity tests because they have monogamous, healthy and happy relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrast that to couples in daytime television talk shows, and I can believe 1/2 of them have different results.

       Likely there's a fair bit of selection bias given that most people won't bother opting to have the test done unless there's some suspicion already there. If you take a random group of Maury guests over 80% come back as not the father.

       The sample group is exclusively people who have asked for a paternity test. People who ask for a paternity test are doing so because they are suspicious the real father might be in question. The vast majority of families would not be getting a paternity test done.

       You're incorrectly looking at the stats.  It's over 50% of men who submitted the testing.  The men who submitted are ones who likely (and ultimately correctly) believed the kids weren't their own.

       The above sentence is a social construct. I remember when I was a kid and was throwing rocks at a squirrel and ended up hitting him and knocking him out. He wasn't dead, but i stood there w a bigger rock ready to kill him. I stood there and felt and knew he didn't do shit to me wrong, and I shouldn't kill. That was within me, it was constructed or taught to me to do or not do this. It's called a conscience

       Never said they did. But they clearly do teach a set of morals and values. Really gets my goat when people look at shit other people do wrong in the name of religion, and blame the religion. It's like a killer who breathes air, so everyone gets pissed at air

       But without these beliefs they wouldnt be doing these things in its name would they? You speak about how it teaches a set of morals, in these morals they also condem people for being gay... It also teaches if you don't follow all the rules blindly you will spend eternity in torment... How moral is that? You cant just pick the good stuff, ignore the rest and claim it teaches a good set of morals.

      <p>
       And the point you made about the squirrel proves what I am saying, YOU decided not to kill it, not your religion... and if the only reason you didnt kill a random innocent animal is because you are worried about what your God thinks of you that tells more about you than any religon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religon just cant stop sticking its nose in, look at stem cell research... how long was that held up for? Mostly for religious reasons claiming we souldn't play god. Think about how fast tech has come along in the last 50 years...Imagine where we would be today if for 500 years we werenn't living under the tyrany of the churches supressing scientific thought and discovery. 
This is what annoys me about religon, the damage it has done and continues to do to our species is unforgivable.

       People do stupid shit in the name of whatever their brains justify it as. An Atheist can justify lying, stealing, murder as there being "no God and no Karma." A jealous boyfriend can justify a murder because "he loves her and needs to protect her." Same shit, different day.

       Religion is part of the human psyche, its in the subconscious. For some religion is nature and being outdoors, for others its drug addiction, for others its porn, and for others its the traditional ones. Its always going to be around, so instead of fighting what wil always be, maybe have some healthy acceptance of things

       How is my criticism irrelevant, you keep talking about Buddhism and yet they are busy trying to wipe out the Muslims in Myanmar. You say tech wasn't stopped? And it was held up and repressed for 500 years!!! closer to 1000 years if you are talking about Muslims. Stem cell research was effectively stopped for over a decade because of pressure from religious groups. But all that is fine cos "stuff is still moving forwards"? 
The three Abrahamic religions all speak of an eternity of torment or damnation for not following their creed. What is moral or good about that? And lets not even get started on the way Muslims treat people that live in their theocracy. 
You seem to think I have a hard-on for picking on the Catholic Church, while a lot of what they have done over the years sickens me they are not my focus of ire, religion as a whole is. Although their continuing instance of telling people in Africa that condoms are a sin is nothing short of despicable.
You keep using this "if there was no religion people would still..." It is such a hollow argument. Sure they would. But we wouldn't of spend close to 700 years shutting down all scientific thought and calling it hearsay... I don't think it is possible to overstate the damage that did to us, who knows what was lost. And yes people would still be doing horrible shiit to each other but they wouldn't have spent the last 2 thousand years systematically trying to wipe out the people that didn't agree with them. 
I have no problem with people that wish to worship, whatever God they wish to call theirs. But I really dislike this inability from many believers to admit to the fundamental problems with organised religious institutions.

       You have to understand global civilization, history, track records, the underlying mentality of culture and civilized to understand that influx and increase of islam/muslims in any country, ends up very bad for the previous people/culture religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would have to go into a massive history lesson here for you to have the context:
      </p>
      <p>
       For example in many Muslim countries (now as recent as Libya, slavery and selling/buying slaves still exists) Actually the Ottoman empire used to kidnap and enslave Europeans:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/mar/10/20040310-115506-8528r/">
        https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/mar/10/20040310-115506-8528r/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Tried to invade Europe many times and got pushed back as well, and is generally seen by Buddhists as a rabid dog. One prominent Buddhist monk says this about Islam:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You can be full of kindness and love, but you cannot sleep next to a mad dog. If we are weak, our land will become Muslim." -Ashin Wirathu.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so they have an understanding of how dangerous this arabic cult is, and have decided to go to extreme measures to make sure they are not invaded by this danger that is stuck in 3rd world mentality and does allow for equality, freedoms, womens rights, and so on. So if violence is required to fight against something like this, its going to happen. Peacefully standing by want prevent it

      <p>
       Arguable at best. In Religions we have the arising of knowledge, logic, studies, schools, learning, Alchemy(early chemistry) and so on. On one side you can say it was held back but an another, why then didnt other countries where religions were different or non-existent, why wasnt there a 500+ rapid evolution of science?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say that even if there wasnt religion, we still would have to wait to get to where we are today

       Not in Europe, China and other countries, it continued there. Like I said, science evolves too and finds a way around blockages.

       They also talk about love, grace, forgiveness, education, growing, etc at least Christianity does. The Eastern version of Christianity even talks about Spiritual Enlightenment. Cant say the same for islam and the jews

       Those places are true shitholes and they are deevolving. So what, let those place continue to be shitholes where they constantly kill each other over 3rd world problems. Countries are like people, some are advanced and moving forward, while others are shit and are deevolving. Obviously muslim countries arent and never will be hubs of scientific advancement, so why worry?

        You keep using this "if there was no religion people would still..." It is such a hollow argument. Sure they would. But we wouldn't of spend close to 700 years shutting down all scientific thought and calling it hearsay
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You dont know that though. Like I said earlier, maybe evolution itself is behind why the great industrialization started in America roughly 150 years ago and we would have to wait that long anyway even if there wasnt religion around.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is so much more grander than just "because religion", because again we can look at islands, other cultures, other countries where maybe there is less religion going on, and we dont find any of them 500-1000 years ahead of where we are today. So moot point

       Its not a hollow point, you just dont seem to understand the complexity of the human psyche, the subconscious, the collective and so on. Humans naturally seek out to be part of a culture, movement, group, belief system. So like I was saying, even if there was no religion, humans will create them in other forms and there's really no getting around it.

       You just sound so better and trapped in the past. Do you understand that crying and bitching about something you cannot go back and change is useless? And if you understand human psyche that they will still create religions no matter what, that trying to stop this is also futile?

       You are here now, existing, have a good 4-6 decades of life left, and in this short flash in a pan, you have various technology, cars, internet, etc all of which is continuing to evolve by people, engineers, companies which arent being stopped by religion. Chill out man

       People these days want to wipe out other groups of people. There are militant atheists that want all of X groups wiped out. There are liberals that want all republicans wiped out and killed. This is already in human nature, we live in an idiocracy.

       Maybe learn to let go? Buddhism has some awesome teachings about this. It sounds like youve created in your mind this issues that you have with others and you have invested a ton of emotional investment into it. This is whats cool about some religions, is that they teach you things that science doesnt, like how to no longer hold on to things
