       I admit that is more of a speculative thought than an actual conspiracy but it has been on my mind for several years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ancient Sumerians were an incredible people that produced many of the hallmarks of human civilization. From sophisticated architecture in the form of ziggurats to what is considered the first form of written text and first written law system, they were an incredible society. And yet, compared to the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, their recognition by the public is almost non-existent. Oh sure, if you have a good understanding of ancient cultures you are probably familiar with the Sumerians. However if you ask the average American citizen to describe these people they would struggle; however they would provide a decent response if asked to describe the big three I previously mentioned. I can personally tell you that my first introduction to the Sumerians was at age 15 in my AP World History course and I was a bit disturbed that I had never heard of them until that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also consider that the ancient Sumerians are credited with creating the Epic of Gilgamesh: one the oldest if not oldest written story and arguably the oldest written superhero tale.  I highly recommend this great work that also delves into the second chance of humanity after a great flood. Despite this, ask yourself how many television shows, movies, and works of fictions have explored the Epic of Gilgamesh compared to the numerous retellings of Heracles or other ancient heroes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit that it is possible that the Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians receive more attention because their cultures are more “marketable” than the Sumerians although that raises the question of why this is the case. For a civilization that many historians agree were pivotal for human development, it is more than odd that the public conscience (at least in the west) pays little attention to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a deeper reason for this? Is there a deeper reason why other ancient contemporaries are often ignored by the public?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: In addition to the Sumerians, other validated contemporaries (sorry Atlantis) often ignored are the ancient societies of Southern Asia, such as Mohenjo-Daro, and the ancient civilizations of Northern and Western Africa.

       Tbh it's just to keep the European egotism strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       No history that contradicts europens egotism gets much mainstream love.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you can't white wash Ancient Sumerians and push Christianity at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       To much work for keep their propaganda in check its much easier to peddle religion and European revisionism.

       I don't doubt that as being a huge reason. Still its odd that a story like  Gilgamesh receives little public attention.

       Gilgamesh would be a Babylonian retelling of an older Sumerian myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read Enkidu as Gilgamesh's shadow-self. It's said that Gilgamesh is half-man, half-god, but our Greco-Roman concept of deism misleads us here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most intriguing--when Gilgamesh dives down into the lake and retrieves the immortal plant, a snake comes ashore and steals it back. My reading--the Babylonians had lost the powers of the sacrament, having severed their ties to the Mother Goddess Tiamat (who is slain by Marduk, in the same fashion that Indra slays Virtra; Yahweh slays Leviathan; the Olympian Zeus slays the serpent son of Agathe Tyche).

       Sumers were Aryan, or at least the leadership was, so any blow to euro-ego would be due to mis-information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest, yea, propaganda.  None chance the current powers that be want the plebs talking about Sumeria.  We might learn their religious practices, cult leadership, and other things that still exist today, albeit hidden.

       What is ngl?

      <p>
       Sadly not at hand.  I'm kinda old and just recently discovered one can "Save" youtube videos.  Digital documentation is not my forte.
      </p>
      <p>
       The euro revisionists do not like this because it puts Aryan as a Asiatic race, not a "euro" race.  Another reason I think Sumer gets sidelined.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Indo-Aryan or proto-Indo-Aryan spread out of the Caucus mountains, including south into Sumer.

       This seeming conflict is resolved if you understand that they are telling the same story from different perspectives. Moses was not copying the Sumerian accounts, he was refuting them. The book of Exodus makes this very clear, with God directly judging the Egyptian Gods, such as blocking out the sun and proving his superiority to Ra.

       No, I mean that 100%. Many of the public "Christian" figures are dark occultists fleecing people for money. Televangelists get millions of dollars, tax free, and all they have to do is tell people what they want to hear. Do you see where this could go wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Schuller, Normal Vincent Peale, Pat Robertson, Benny Hinn, all masons. I'd estimate that at least 75% of the Christian leaders you've heard of are masons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remembering that Jesus is "the stone the builders (masons) rejected" you can see why they do such a shitty job of representing him to the people.

       If they were somehow sincere your objection would work. I'm saying that most of these guys are not even trying to be Christians, they're "wolves in sheep's clothing" just like the guys that crucified Jesus.

       One of the biggest "Christian" networks is called "Day Star," which in Latin translates to Lucifer. If that weren't bad enough, their logo is a fucking broken star, which comes straight from dark occult rituals.

       You mean Thutmoses, of course, right?  Moses is a pseudohistorical fairytale.  A gross distortion of actual events, used to control people through false religion.  His character existed long after their migration out of Sumer anyway.  The one called "Abraham" is the one who had the most direct ties to Sumer, but even that story is most likely twisted beyond recognition.

       That the book of Exodus is cryptically based on the actual historical Exodus of the Hyksos from Egypt, around ~1500bc.  One of the (adopted?) Thutmose brothers (pharaohs) was at the head of their Exodus, and they verifiably destroyed Jericho before the Bible version people even made it that far.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plagues were a religious reimagining of the consequences of the Eruption of Theras, from about the same time. ~1500.  Ash in the water.  Animal ecosystems dying off.  Illnesses from the fallout.  And they never crossed the Red Sea.  It was the Reed Sea, which not-so-coincidentally happens to be right on their way to Jericho, one of the first Canaanite cities they sacked.  Later "historian liars" would merge this story with the beginning of the intermediate dark ages, which ravaged Canaan and the other empires around 1200bc, but they're two separate episodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even better, this ruling "family" of Hyksos even came back into Egypt a few hundred years later, and took over for a dynasty or two.  During the 1200's, they reestablished their rule over Northeast Egypt, with very David and Solomon-like monarchs on their throne.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last section there gets fairly speculative, but most of this is based on multiple historical records and archaeology, unlike the Bible, which tries to present itself as it's own authority, even though it wasn't officially compiled/plagiarized until about a thousand years later, in (new) Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only people could realize that their precious bible was (centuries later) plagiarized by the same ruling families that continue to torment us to this day.  :)

       Ok, I think I see what you're refering to. That's the wrong timeline I was referring to. The reason that the Jericho burning looks to be too early is because Egyptologists are wrongly dating the Exodus in the 1200s, because their dates for the Egyptian dynasties are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all comes down to several problems in the timeline of the Egyptologists, who have large gaps in between dynasties that they assume without evidence are much longer than they really were.

       is one of the leading scholars arguing this general line of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you accept this timeline, the Exodus happened in the 1400s, and the burning of Jericho is exactly when it was supposed to be. There are a lot of other historical events that match up exactly with where Moses and Joshua say they happened, so it fits the available evidence better unless your presupposition is to automatically ignore the bible as a historical document, which is a separate problem entirely.

       I see the Bible as a deliberately distorted retelling of history.  It was made as a religious tool to rule over eager fools, who were promised wealth and a new home in their "promised land", as they left their exile in (new) Babylon.  So they "rewrote" actual history to give themselves an excuse to reinvade Canaan and steal others' land. (sound familiar?)
      </p>
      <p>
       It was based on actual events which were ancient even to its writers.  But many of the critical details are deliberately twisted to obscure the actual identity of the people(s) it writes about, as well as their crimes and motives, like regular genocide and complete destruction of cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked through your earlier link a bit too.  It's weird, seeing people get so close to the truth, but missing it completely.  It's got some good stuff, but other sections I disagree with too.  Thanks.

       Every religion gets taken over by dark occultists who start to turn the teachings into symbols that only the initiates get to understand the true meaning of. The Bible talks about this in some detail, calling it Mystery Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever sat down and objectively considered the evidence both for and against the claims that the Bible offers a distorted view of history? I've found that most people are surprised at how much archaeological and historical evidence there is supporting the text.

       I should add...  I think the popular timeline is off too, obviously.  But I see Thutmose' Exodus and the "Joshua" conquest as two separate events, mashed into one story for later generations, separated by a "40 year" gap of hundreds of thousands of people wandering aimlessly through a desert without food or water.  The Hyksos Exodus was very destructive (i.e. Jericho), but it wasn't until the 1200's that the middle East hit its true dark ages.  I suspect, speculatively, that it was David/Joshua/Psusennes who was responsible for the second larger and much later wave of destruction.

       I didn't hope to convince you of the veracity and historicity of the entire Torah in a single comment. Just to throw out a theory that also solves the seeming contradictions between the Moses and the conventional Egyptian timeline that much more closely follows the text we have.

       Yeah.  I don't mind the discussion, though.  I disagree strongly with putting any faith in the bible, so to speak, but it does have some historical value, even if it's grossly distorted.  The "big events" happened, more or less, but the characters/motives/timeline of the Bible flat out contradict what we find from more ancient texts and archaeology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we're probably close to the same page, but the biggest hangup here is that you talk about occultists hijacking religions, when I think they've been writing the religions themselves, all along.  Especially all of the abrahamic religions.  But the Greek and Roman pantheons were heavily influenced by them too.  I'm not just talking about Jews here, either.  Hyksos are more diverse, and include many of the bloodlines we now consider European.

       The Bible is noticeable because of the very divergence from these ancient mystery religions that you noted. It says there is one Most High God who created all of the lesser gods, and that he alone is omnipotent, omniscient, and so on. There is no initiation required to understand the hidden meaning behind the symbols, and it is written down rather than passed along to the initiates from mouth to ear.

       Really depend on what you mean by "Jewish." Esoteric Judaism is evil personified, but that is actually a mystery religion having its origin in Babylon like all the other mystery religions.

       The Mystery religions derive from the consumption of a psychedelic sacrament. When a sacrament was consumed, it was said that souls of the dead flowed through the living. Chthonic rituals were founded on this annual, and communal practice. After the end of the 'Golden Age' civilizations, these rituals were privatized.

       Babylon is not the source of Judaism. It's more historically accurate to say that Zoroastrian, Sumerian, Phoenician, and Egyptian myths influenced the Jews. You should read Joseph Campbell's "Occidental Mythology" or Karen Armstrong's "A History of God."

       With the possible exception of the Zoroastrians, the Jewish writings were only influenced by these systems in the sense that they are written in direct opposition to them. The book of Exodus is pronouncing God's superiority over the lesser Egyptian gods. Later, it becomes clear that these are not gods at all, but created beings pretending to be gods.

       I'm familiar with the theory that Judaism is merely a development or iteration of the religions of that time, but reject it. I would argue it is a continuation of the older tradition written in the books of Job and possibly Enoch, as well as the preaching of Noah.

       This post interests me as I've been trying to read up on civilisations that pre date the Sumerians. Just been getting really into real history from before that time. I was reading something the other day that basically said that garden of Eden story came out of the last great cataclysm. Also interesting how many unrelated societies have a great flood story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's more about pushing the hot new thing, which for a long time has been a belief in a single god and creating factions not unity. As we move forward, I can see monotheistic societies getting the same treatment as humanity moves into the "we are all one" global consciousness mindset.

       That's good point. If I not mistaken, I believe that there is mention of some flood event in Hindu text. You also have Native American mythos of the earth being on the back of a giant turtle swimming in an infinite ocean.

       Regarding the flood myths, there's some interesting stuff on Youtube about the idea that the earth was hit by a series of floods and storms around the end of the last ice age and all these flood stories are actual history that's been distorted over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do a quick check on Pre-Adamite civilization.  The channels "Ancient Architects" and "Bright Insight" are my favorite because rather than talk about aliens visiting earth, they focus more on the idea that humanity created a fairly advanced global civilization that died out ~10K years ago due to either a single cataclysmic event or a series of back-to-back disasters.
They point to similarities between the Giza Pyramids and Central American pyramids as well as similarities between stone cutting techniques in Machu Pichu and Giza as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       They point to examples of disasters such as the 2005 tsunami that killed 200K in Indonesia and Phillipines, 2006 earthquake that killed 60K in Pakistan, and 2010 tsunami that killed 16K in Japan (Fukishima is still abandoned) as a modern-day example of how a chain of disasters that could've disrupted a key points in this hypothetical global network and led to economic collapse which could have led to societal unrest and possibly breakdown of social order.

       It's more the story of Noah, which is probably describing events that happened during the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas">
        Younger Dryas

       . Most likely there was a comet that hit the earth, suddenly melting the ice caps, creating tsunamis that destroyed most of the cities, and nearly wiped out humanity entirely.

      <p>
       Many accounts describe humanity being saved in a boat, while some others describe people hiding underground. So it seems like there were a few clusters of survivors, who then told their descendants about how they were among a handful of survivors to a great cataclysm.

       There is a conspiracy to cover up all of ancient history. The main thrust of the story is that humans evolved slowly from monkeys, gradually becoming more technologically advanced until we arrive at modern times, the apex of knowledge and civilization. And that is completely false.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that humanity experienced a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas">
        massive cataclysm
       </a>
       that destroyed most of human civilization. This is recorded all over the world in stories of a great flood that nearly wiped humanity out in antiquity. The dark occultists know this is true, but they don't want anyone else to know, so they dismiss these stories as myths.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can look at sites like the Pyramids and Sphinx, which are far older than the time of Khufu. Or Gobekli Tepe, which is thousands of years before agricultural civilizations are supposed to have existed, yet there's simply no way it was constructed by primitive hunter gatherers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that humanity was advanced in the past, and much of this knowledge was wiped out by cataclysm. People rediscovered this knowledge, and concealed the knowledge in mystery schools such as Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mystery schools have degrees commemorating the rediscovery of this knowledge, such as the Arch of Enoch when the survivors of the flood find an arch created by Enoch with the secrets of geometry and other pre-flood knowledge written on it. Or the story of the Templars finding secret knowledge hidden under the Temple in Jerusalem. These stories may or may not be literally true, but they represent the very real historical rediscovery of ancient knowledge, and its concealment from the masses.

       At this point, we can't expect anything other than things made of stone. We have a number of these, but they are also being systematically destroyed. Remember how ISIS loved to blow up everyone's cultural monuments? Do you remember where ISIS was active and how close they got to sites like Gobekli Tepe?
      </p>
      <p>
       It also appears that the world was much colder before the cataclysm, so the ice caps were larger and the ocean levels much lower. In other words, most of the buildings are probably underwater.

       Certainly more advanced than the earliest civilizations in our written history. Hard to say definitively how advanced they really were, but you can look into things like the inscriptions that are alleged to represent flying machines. Without better archaeology, we're basically left speculating about the stories passed down from the mythic era.

       Think if you will that their advancements were just different from ours. I think they had advanced spiritual knowledge that translated into doing things we can achieve through technology. Perhaps their understanding of the human mind and it's capacity was more developed than our own.

       Don't know the truth, don't know the past. I can only assume. But if I assume it makes an ass out of me. So I position myself to a place of not knowing. And since I don't know, I can see all theory and not concluded.  I can accept that I don't know. With that acceptance I am open to hear all the possibilities.

       The jump from monkey to man is a complete change in category, not iterative improvements to an established form. Going from a "common ancestor" to A. Afarensis is mostly an increase in cranial capacity, but going from that to a human being involves developing whole new categories of behavior:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The exact criteria for membership in the tribe Hominini under the current understanding of human origins are not clear, but the taxon generally includes those species that share more than 97% of their DNA with the modern human genome, and exhibit a capacity for language or for simple cultures beyond their 'local family' or band. The theory of mind concept—
       <em>
        including such faculties as empathy, attribution of mental state, and even empathetic deception
       </em>
       —is a controversial criterion; it distinguishes the adult human alone among the hominids. Humans acquire this capacity after about four years of age, whereas it has not been proven (nor has it been disproven) that gorillas or chimpanzees ever develop a theory of mind."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae#Extant_and_fossil_relatives_of_humans">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae#Extant_and_fossil_relatives_of_humans
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just scratching the surface. Not only do humans have culture , language, and capacity for deception, they have teaching of skills, music, art, comprehension of abstract concepts, and religion. These things don't come from iterative developments of small mutations that confer reproductive advantages, nor do we see evidence that this is in fact what happened. What we do see in the fossils is humanity showing up largely in their present form without a missing link.

       This is incorrect. The model suggests a common ancestor between humans and other primates. It's not semantics. Referring to the common ancestor as a "monkey" is like saying your father is your brother. It's just wrong.

       All of this ONLY came about due to our ability to communicate on a complex level with one another. Language allows for the passage of knowledge from generation to generation without it needing to be ingrained within our genetics. It's all from a build up of knowledge through successive generations.

       The argument is entirely empirical. The evidence does not support Darwinian theory regarding the origin of humanity, so we reject it. I'm genuinely not sure why you're having trouble with this since you seem to have a worldview of scientism, which prides itself on devotion to empiricism.

       And this is just ludicrous. You haven't explained the origin of language (because it cannot be explained by Darwinism), and you haven't proven that language, alone, causes monkeys to develop culture, carve religious statues, and start painting on the walls of their caves.

       Read "Fingerprints of the Gods" and "Magicians of the Gods" by Graham Hancock. He pretty much covers everything from the Younger Dryas comet impact and subsequent floods to all the other random cover ups in archaeology and history. It all ties together and is extremely fascinating. Of course, mainstream archaeology has been ragging on him and his ilk for along time, but it seems like every few weeks lately new evidence has been coming out and verified that back up many of Hancock's claims.

       To focus of Sumeria would risk exposing the fact there was a global sea power with buildings/outposts/cities around the world, that traded with indigenous cultures around the world, and had advanced tech, at a time in our Evolution when we'd be using stone/bronze tools.

       It up-ends any cultural equality movement if there was a race of blond-haired, blue-eyed Sea People who were the leaders of the various "brown" races from Middle East to Far East to the Pacific to the Americas to Northern Africa.

      <p>
       The peoples of the Americas describe the race as blond.  The blond mummies also suggest blond hair.

      <p>
       I am assuming Sea Peoples (I'm using a fairly broad term here, perhaps there were more than one) were the Aryans.  There certainly seems to be a Sea Peoples, multiple groups agree on this.  There certainly seemed to be Aryans.  Both had blue-eyes.  Blond and/or red hair comes up often too, but perhaps for a different group of blue-eyed folk, not Sea People.  Sea People seemed advanced.  Aryans seemed advanced.  Hence the assumption.

       Not really, no.  I think the Aryans were some sort of survivor "race" from before the great geological turmoil(s) of the flood(s).  I think we/they had advanced tech, perhaps not digital, and these folk were the inheritors of this knowledge, thus able to start the post-flood era with a tech-level higher than most.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kinda think they, along with the other major races, were more or less homogeneous.  At least at first, post-flood.  The Aryans seemed to be the most advanced, so no doubt they spread their genes.  Not too sure the pre-Mayans and the peoples of the Indian subcontinent interbred with any regularity.  Open to all ideas tho.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aryans also seemed to be kept distinct in these old records.  Like the writer was of a different race than the Aryan/Sea People/ruler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Story lines jump out of clear history and into more murky Emerald Tablet stuff, but in some stories the Aryans were brought here/sent here/came here as a relatively intact race, mingling with the advanced primates on the planet (creating the modern-day homo sapien).

       Where's your evidence that the Aryans were more technologically advanced than anyone else? The Egyptians and Sumerians do not speak an Aryan language, so the idea that they're ruled by Aryans doesn't hold much water.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Emerald Tablets you're bringing up only relate to the Hermetic philosophy of the Neo-Platonists and the beliefs that they preserve from the early Egyptians.

       It is written that The Sumerians needed to suspend gold ore in their atmosphere to protect them from the harsh influences of space as they travel around in orbit.

       When you realise that many parts of the Bible (particularly Old Testament) are just retellings of Sumerian writings with different names, then you can wonder, what else in there is made up also? Then consider the big three religions in the world recognize the Old Testament, Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Then you can see why a subject like this would be supressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the followers of a religion will go to such lengths as to kill people who practice other religions/ways or live in specific areas considered "holy" then supressing historical information doesn't sound too far out there.

       It's obvious that the both the Bible and the Sumerian myths are based off the same events. The Sumerian myths were passed down and eventually the stories Changed drastically from what actually happened and the Old Testament was written by men inspired by God and tells the correct history of these events.

       This is only plausible if you're arguing against the age of the Epic of Gilgamesh.

        this
       </a>
       you can use the bible to calculate when (approximately) the flood wouldve happened (2350 ish BC). The Epic of Gilgamesh takes place in ~2700BC and the oldest surviving full copy of the story is from 2000 BC, with found fragments that are much older.

       I'm not an expert and I'm just spitballing, but I think the Bible and Sumerian tales should match up. IIRC Abraham (father of Jews/Muslims) was called out of the city of Ur, a sumer city, basically at random by God so he would have known Sumerian history. The first 5 books of the bible containing the earliest history of earth were written by Moses, a descendant of Abraham and would have been passed to Moses verbally from generations past.
      </p>
      <p>
       One pre-flood story that backs Gilgamesh is how angels had children with human women creating "great men" that are also referred to as giants. Gilgamesh and Enkidu very well could have been some of these demigods.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the bible is to be believed, pre-flood people were regularly living 900+ years. The amount of knowledge, culture, and society that could be built with that long of a lifespan is astounding. To say humans were advanced prior to a global cataclysm only makes sense from a biblical standpoint. I think this part of history is not talked about because it raises too many questions for the mainstream scientific narrative, not too many questions for the 3 big religions.

       The problem is, most of us have not read books any more than 50 or 60 years old. The copies of the bible we have read are only a few years old. We may
       <em>
        imagine
       </em>
       that these must be copies of 'ancient' texts, but how do we really

         5 . I dont think its as much of a conspiracy as it is general mix of the ebove points. Plus if humanity knew how many times it came to extinction, how many times leaders of worlds commited mass genocide (eve though we have some understanding of past 2k years, great empires lay in ruins today.

We write the 3rd century BC - in the west rome will start the punic wars which will end in disastrous battles with up to 140000 people in the field (romans &amp; punic forces combined)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the east we have the warring states era in China where 600000 Qin soldiers invade Chu which had about 500000 soldiers in the field.
      </p>

       History is written by the winner and europe always traced its roots back to Greece and Rome - not to Babylon or China. In the recent years
       <em>
        Global history/studies
       </em>
       emerged to tell the story of those forgotten (well, the warring states are anything but forgotten in China - just we don't learn shit about it) or ignored.

       Pretty much all of history from ancient times, all throughout the middle ages and even modern times makes so much more sense if you factor in the eurocentric erasure of Central Asian / African contributions to human history. Let alone what was happening in India or China.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever wonder why even the most educated people seem to think all of human history started when Plato and Socrates sat around in togas inventing civilization. It's because history is written backwards, people basically invent history to explain how they ended up where they are now. So most of this ancient Greek/roman stuff was invented during the middle ages / crusades / renaissance to explain their own history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also ever think about how our middle eastern history seems to go Alexander -&gt; Julius Ceasar -&gt; Mohammad. That's a thousand years of history deleted in favor of the classic east vs. west conflict we see constantly repeated to this day. Even terror groups like Is.is are  carefully engineered not only to genocide eastern people (Sumerian descendants) but to even smash their historic sites into dust.

       I always found that kinda of ironic. The people who re-discovered ancient Roman and Greek society and promulgated their importance were the descendants of the pagan and Gothic people who essentially put in the final nail of the Roman Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something else I have also found odd is that when it comes to theatrical/film interpretations of ancient Rome/Greek, actors are asked to speak with British accents, even if they are not British. I can't think of a single major film that utilized Greek or Roman/Italian accents.

       Unfortunately the New Age freaks are asking for it in the way they have blatantly dramatized their case based on extreme misinterpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure academics changes slowly,   as in the case of waking up to the problems of Bible interpretation,  but overall,  its been a very healthy skepticism and has in the long run gotten us closer to our history,    rather that wild claims and unreasonable assumptions that prevail in the New Age take on the Sumerians.

       I thinks it's more a factor of how very, very, very long ago the ancient Sumerian empires existed (4500 BC). Cleopatra and the glory days of Rome (30 BC) were closer to our day than the days than they were to the creation of the Pyramids (2580 BC). Sumeria is twice as old as the pyramids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where know where Greece, Rome, and Egypt are, and how their cultures, architecture, and language influenced the modern world. Those civilizations are now modern day nations. Sumeria is not only not a modern nation, but the region has played host to dozens of other massive nations throughout history.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a function of time, and what people can see, relate to, and identify with, nothing more.

       I once saw footage of Zachariah* Sitchein* (transcriber of the sumerian tablets) at a freemason ceremony wearing the whole "white gloves /red apron, tuxedo" garment, and when he and others realized there was a camera they all covered their faces,  so?  He illuminati as fuuuuccckkk, in my book :) idk,

       I believe it's ignored because their stories talk of aliens, humans being nothing but a slave race and the religious control system in place falls away. These are topics that are easier to ignore or ridicule as fantasy than they are to answer the questions they bring up.

       If you even bring up that they were a real people some people will become vehemently angry with you. I included their culture in my science fiction book and I got clamped on by the government hardcore. There IS something to the idea that they don't want it studied, and it's not just that we are conducting war in that part of the world. When you begin to look into their actual practices in reality, the ideas behind their "List of Civilized Kings" (not even talking about weather or not it's a real list with real dates, just begin to discuss the idea of why they might have such a list.) It's all attacked instantly. I get headaches just thinking about writing a purely historical text on the subject because of how hard it's oppressed.

       Gilgamesh would be a Babylonian retelling of an older Sumerian myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read Enkidu as Gilgamesh's shadow-self. It's said that Gilgamesh is half-man, half-god, but our Greco-Roman concept of deism misleads us here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most intriguing--when Gilgamesh dives down into the lake and retrieves the immortal plant, a snake comes ashore and steals it back. My reading--the Babylonians had lost the powers of the sacrament, having severed their ties to the Mother Goddess Tiamat (who is slain by Marduk, in the same fashion that Indra slays Virtra; Yahweh slays Leviathan; the Olympian Zeus slays the serpent son of Agathe Tyche).
