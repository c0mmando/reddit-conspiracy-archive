       S: I think he must have some pretty high connections if he is getting this kind of defense from the media who have been attacking everyone no matter their stature or offense. I wonder if it has to do with his race, religion, family origin, or NBC, or what. In no way do I believe the attack media is all the sudden changing their agenda based on anything honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying he should be demonized either, I'm not a witch hunter... I just want to know why he is getting preferential treatment.

       Or maybe the girl just didn't like his tact and wanted to join the victim movement, regret and abuse are way different, the way I understood it he took her on a date and she returned with him and instead of going for a back rub (that she wanted i guess)he pointed at his junk. Maybe not the smoothest but I think the girl just regrets the fact that after he gestured his Johnson she stuck it in her mouth by her own decision and regrets not making him work a little harder.  It is nothing like the Weinstein fuck me or fuck your career tact and deserves to be removed from that category of abuse.  Witch hunts will always effect the innocent.

       That's really the same level of some of the Franco shit though. You have to admit he's getting a bit of a special exception. It's very rare for anyone in Hollywood to get defended from allegations.

       A lot of this is allowed in the media to create confusion for men on how to make a move on women.
      </p>
      <p>
       More likely, these stories are a cover for Ansari and Franco for the real, dirty stuff they have to do to make it in the industry. Keep the public's focus on this he said/she said stuff, create gender conflict, and keep eyes off the pedophile rings which are literally the life blood of Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Focus on harmony with the other gender. Focus on uncovering the real truth. Don't be misled. It's all collapsing soon.

       If you look at Eliza Dushku or that Olympic lady from yesterday, that was straight up molestation/rape.

       This is someone who kind of wanted to bone a celebrity and he was bad at sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling where you're going with this, so I'll include Jian Ghomeshi

       as an example, which happened well before the #metoo business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now he, was a piece of work who actually abused women during sex and used his power as a celebrity (It's Canada, we do have some) to hurt women. Including the part about his therapy teddy bear having to be turned around because "Big Ears Teddy shouldn't see this."

       Submission statement needs to be in a comment man. I manually approved this post, but I don't know if that will prevent the SS bot from torching it.

       It's all about scrambling things up so bad that the public doesn't know what to think so they ignore it. It's also been a strategy of three media to focus on innocuous sexual "misconduct" to stay away from the truly insidious pedo stuff.

       His situation seems different than any others so far. Just sounds like a shitty date for her. She was hoping for more of a relationship, he wanted a hookup and was kind of a jerk about it.

       Because he didnt do anything criminal? I'd assume thats why it wasnt a real news agency that broke the story when the rumors and innuendo had been swirling around for a while.
 I mean just look at the article, its like a parody
