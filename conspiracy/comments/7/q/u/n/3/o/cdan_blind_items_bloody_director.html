        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/todays-blind-items-bloody-director.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/todays-blind-items-bloody-director.html</a></p>

<p>This A list director has not been seen very much at all over the past few months. His name has been in the news a lot, but appearances have been few and far between. I think what happened in the last week or two is going to drive him even deeper underground.</p>

<p>Several months ago our director was overseas. While there he did what he always does. He had sex with a bunch of guys and didn&#39;t really ask how old they were. One of the boys he had sex with was way underage. Like 14 or 15. Apparently the director met him at some club where you are supposed to be older. There is CCTV footage of the director and the boy at the bar and then at a table and then making out in a hallway outside a restroom and then in a VIP room at the club and then the two taking turns orally satisfying each other in this VIP room.</p>

<p>The CCTV footage then shows the pair leaving the club together and getting in a car. Four hours later the boy showed up at a hospital with a smashed face and broken jaw. Apparently the work of the director.</p>

<p>Apparently the boy is a relative of someone who knows a lot of things about a lot of people all over the world and made possible a lot of people all over the world knowing a lot of things that were secret.</p>

<p>That relative did what he did best and hacked into the CCTV system at the club and outside the club and even street CCTV cameras to trace the path of the car carrying the director and the boy. He then e-mailed the director what he had found and said he was going after the director full force. The director freaked out and went into hiding for a few days before emerging for a week or so. He then went into hiding and has not really been seen.</p>

<p>Shortly before the holidays, the director was confronted by the relative right outside the home of the director. The director bolted inside his home and locked the door. Within a few minutes of that, the director received an e-mail which contained the same CCTV footage as well as hundreds of photos and videos of the director and his friends naked and having sex with boys and teens and legal teens. It was a who&#39;s who engaged in what would be months and months of headlines. The relative wanted to meet the director. The director reached out to a few people including the source for all of this to me. That person has not engaged in any of these activities but is a big time fixer. The fixer said there was nothing wrong with meeting the relative. Just do it in an open place and assume you are being recorded.</p>

<p>Of course our director didn&#39;t listen to the advice and did what he wanted to do as always. He met the relative in private because he didn&#39;t want to take a chance that someone would spot him in public and ask questions and then ask questions of the relative. Even the fixer doesn&#39;t know exactly what happened next, but the relative was killed. Apparently the director did a good enough job of making it look like a suicide. The thing is though there are a lot of people who are very powerful who are now making it their cause to find out what happened to the relative. It is not going to take them long to at least see the director was in close proximity to the relative. I&#39;m not sure whether they will find the proof he killed the relative, but it wouldn&#39;t shock me if something turns up. That relative was all knowing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>James Dolan was a co-creator of the whistleblower submission system SecureDrop along with Aaron Swartz, who killed himself in 2013 following prosecution for an alleged criminal hacking incident. 36-year-old Dolan, who reportedly also took his own life, joined the Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) after Swartz’s death. The circumstances of Dolan’s death are yet unknown, however the FPF reported that he had been suffering from PTSD since the Iraq War.</em></p>
