        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From the first day I&#39;ve been obsessing over the door to room 32-135. The police released audio of the use of an explosive breach to the media so quickly that it seemed outrageously odd to me. To reiterate - you could hear the explosion. Then pictures surfaced and it looked the door was in tact - no signs of an explosive breach. I googled and youtubed the results of explosive breaches and wasn&#39;t able to find anything that involved an explosion and then anything close to an in-tact door. </p>

<p>Now the police report has more pictures of the door: </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/3GgMS">https://imgur.com/a/3GgMS</a></p>

<p>Picture 1 shows the door on the floor - taken what I assume to be after the event but before the initial close-off of the crime scene. The door seems to be reasonably in tact. While it IS a pretty low quality image - I would still think we&#39;d see some kind of markings for the cluster of bullet holes seen in picture 3 but I don&#39;t see anything... </p>

<p>Picture 2 and 3 show the door with bullet holes and blown into what looks to me like quarter pieces of the door. It doesn&#39;t look like it could be the same door as the first picture. </p>

<p>Finally, picture 4 is from shortly after the event. Door is on it&#39;s side behind the existing door - it doesn&#39;t look like the same amount of damage as pictures 2 and 3. </p>

<p>Anyway - I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m getting at or what this all means but I really wanted to post it to get it out there and get other people&#39;s thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The labels on the pictures are incorrect.  Those are 2 different doors.  One is the entry door which contain 2 double doors.  The other is the door to the small suite -- that is the door that connected room 135 to 134.  The fact that is has bullet holes in it explains exactly what happened and why Paddock decided to kill himself when he did.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pic 1 and 4.</p>

<p>Look at the left wall in the first pic. Now look at pic 4. </p>

<p>Pic 1 has the drywall and door frame moulding still up. Pic 4 has drywall and moulding removed for some reason. We were told he was drilling in the wall by the door for either a camera hole or rifle hole but it just seems odd the inconsistencies about the wall in general. No moulding, no drywall in the pic with police tape up. </p>

<p>Also, thats not &quot;hundreds of rounds of ammunition&quot; fired down the hallway at Campos. There is only a dozen or 2 dozen bullet holes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look  at the bottom left on picture 4 you can see the tape going around the molding and onto the wall..</p>

<p>The door being busted in half is odd but you can see the damage that leads to it falling apart when it was obviously moved.</p>

<p>Could be shitty picture quality but I can&#39;t  see and bullet holes in picture 1</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They stated he fired 35 rounds.  These created over 200 impacts.  That is, when 1 bullet is fired, it enters the door (1 mark) exits the door (1 mark) impacts the wall (1 mark) if it doesn&#39;t further impact, that is 3 marks for 1 bullet.  If it ricochets, then it makes additional marks.  If it hits a light fixture and then lodges in the wall, that is 2 impacts (plus the 2 when it went through the door).  No magic, no real mystery.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking at this I have to say that photos 3 and 4 are two different doors. Unless some how the bullets went in from the outside and took a hard right only to be expelled on the other side of the door. </p>

<p><strong>Photo 3</strong> appears the the bullets were fired right at the belt line/middle of the door where as <strong>Photo 4</strong> looks as if they were fired from eye level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What doesn&#39;t make sense to me is the door in photos 1 &amp; 4 look like the door is in relatively good condition (i.e. one piece) and you can tell it&#39;s the same type of door in photo 2 &amp; 3 because of the metal arm on the top and the fire exit info on the door. Now correct me If I&#39;m wrong, but the photos that OP provided are a mix of &quot;official&quot; photos and &quot;leaked&quot; photos. 1st photo (official) and 4th photo (leaked) show the door in 1 piece. The other photos (both official) show what is supposed to be the same door, broken up. Now if I were the government, I&#39;d wanna keep consistency so I would make my &quot;leaked&quot; photos match my &quot;official&quot; photos so it looked more realistic. What we have here is a royal fuck up due to photo 1 2 and 3 (all official) prove that at some point the door was broken. Why was the door broken and if so, why was tagged evidence compromised? Conspiracy maybe? </p>
