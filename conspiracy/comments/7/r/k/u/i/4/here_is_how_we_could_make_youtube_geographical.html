       Unbeknownst to many of our American friends, Youtube employs a team specially dedicated to censoring certain videos in certain parts of the world. As a European, it is not rare that, when trying to follow a Youtube link posted by a fellow redditor on this sub, I get a message "This content is not available on this country domain" (there seems to be different messages, sometimes you can see the video title, sometimes you cannot).
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed Google thinks it is a good idea to help tyrannical governments enforce its different
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9">
        legislations on lèse-majesté
       </a>
       . Insulting "kings" and "queens" is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial">
        typically not the only type of content
       </a>
       that may be blocked. Obvious wrong-think videos,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwp7tVZuXKM">
        such as this one for example
       </a>
       , are blocked in more than a dozen European countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       But much more mundane ones,
       <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Uyar0goYMdU">
        such as this one
       </a>
       , are blocked too. As you may see in this example, this is not even about historical revisionism: it merely describes an open secret, a truth nobody can possibly deny. Of course, Youtube also bans the occasional
       <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=E0_BZphQ7Qo">
        revisionist old lady
       </a>
       or
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1efQPJz0dQA">
        even famous documentaries
       </a>
       (this version is a mirror, it is not the one blocked, I cannot find the blocked one as is doesn’t even show up in Google searches from where I am).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I come across such a banned video, I usually use the
       <a href="https://polsy.org.uk/stuff/ytrestrict.cgi">
        Polsy Youtube region restriction checker
       </a>
       to count the number of countries in which it is banned, and post a comment giving that information out; I also add the hooktube link so that Europeans may see it (if you didn't know, change "youtube" into "hooktube" and you'll be able to see any blocked Youtube video, wherever you are). This is a manual process I cannot keep up with, as the quantity of such videos seems to be growing fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What I suggest is this
       </strong>
       : we could develop a bot that would check, whenever someone posts a Youtube link, whether the video is banned somewhere. If it is, it would reply to that comment (or OP), stating, "This video is banned in X countries" (X being the actual number, counted with Polsy), "here is an alternate link to watch the video” (with the hooktube link).
      </p>
      <p>
       This would have two main benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         It would draw attention to the censorship, and to videos that are banned. This way, even Americans who aren't subject to such abject censorship may know the content is probably interesting.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The bot's code would of course be made available open source, and would probably interest other subs; in the bot message's footer would be credit to hooktube, Polsy, and the r/conspiracy community that came up with the idea; thus it would draw additional free thinkers to our sub.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       An important note: I am not necessarily a WW2 historical revisionist myself – furthermore I despise Nazism for the collectivist ideology that it is. However I think all ideas should be allowed to be expressed,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       the ones we intend to combat. Furthermore this isn’t the only type of content that is censored, although it is the most obvious for me in Europe. As I said in introduction lèse-majesté is typically blocked in countries that have such legislations too, and others are too:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7_epvNbaPQ">
        here is an example of a video blocked in the UK.
       </a>
       I also think the truth wouldn’t need to be defended by public violence, and that what is illegal to say, everywhere and at any time, has a high likelihood of being true (i.e. a king that one can’t legally mock is probably a jackass).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never developed a Reddit bot, but I figure it wouldn't take me more than 1-2 days writing something in Python. If someone with more experience wants to do it, please be my guest. If nobody volunteers, I will do it in the forthcoming weeks. I could also easily host it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have submitted this idea to the mods, and they told me I should ask the community; if the response was positive, they would allow it on the sub. As the quantity of censored Youtube videos is quite huge, and as this quantity seems to be growing exponentially, this means the bot would be pretty active.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here I am, asking you. Is this a good idea? And if so, how should we call our little friend?

       I'm not a programmer myself, I barely know some basics. But youtube api is the only way to get that restriction info. If you're gonna be requesting/scraping data all the time from polsy site, they will probably block IP or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another good site I just discovered is
       <a href="https://unblockvideos.com/youtube-video-restriction-checker">
        https://unblockvideos.com/youtube-video-restriction-checker
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there is some useful info below "YouTube Video Restrictions - API" and "Limits is 1000 YouTube video IDs per IP Address per day. "
      </p>
      <p>
       So the way to do this I think would be to get the json data from the request and then use some bot to reply in the thread.

       Cool. Thanks for the tip. That's probably how Polsy does it. Indeed thak makes the bot even easier to develop, if I don't have to scrap the Polsy cgi (and thus get their authorization). I'd still provide the polsy link though, for the cool map they have. So the only thing left would be to familiarize myself with the reddit api, but I'm pretty sure it's quite simple, and I know there are plenty of examples in Python.

       Yeah I've noticed so many videos starting 2018 are now banned in the EU, must be some new law, but I can't find anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially videos that contain stuff about WW2 and the rise of nationalist movements back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       The countries where usually videos are not banned are UK, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Spain.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can check where it's banned here -

       Yes, now that the pandora box of censorship is open, it is becoming more and more ubiquitous. Every regime will soon be able to obtain from Youtube that it blocks the content that disturbs them. Also as people are waking up, and the truth is spreading, I expect this to compound the arbitrary blockings. Also disturbingly you can't seem to find a video that is blocked in your country if you search for it (whether on YT directly or even on Google if I'm not mistaken) - so you'll only realize you can't access it if someone provides you a direct link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time to Streisand this policy.

       Probably on youtube only (for now), I've also noticed the results when searching with various VPNs and then changing them, result order changes and some have disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good thing people are starting new alternatives, like decentralized d.tube (which is the most recent yt alternative), bitchute and pewtube.

        Good thing people are starting new alternatives, like decentralized d.tube (which is the most recent yt alternative), bitchute and pewtube.

       Most definitely! The only trouble as I understand it is that video hosting sites are rarely - if ever - profitable. Youtube operates at a considerable loss for example.

       So unless there's big money behind, these sites can't survive. But if there's big money there's also usually big censorship. But censorship is okay, because it can always be circumvented; we just need to be made aware of what's being censored.

       I agree with the idea of this bot... but I just had to comment on this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and that what is illegal to say, everywhere and at any time, has a high likelihood of being true
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Murphy212 is a convicted pedophile that raped 6 month old babies."
      </p>
      <p>
       That statement is illegal in many countries. Does that make it likely to be true?

       Well it is not illegal
       <em>
        a priori
       </em>
       , I would have to sue you for defamation, and I would win only if you couldn't give evidence for it, and if I could convincingly argue the statement was done in bad faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I agree with your general sentiment; there must be exceptions; hence my qualifier "high likelihood".
