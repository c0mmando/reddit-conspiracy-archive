       This could be said about Christians who celebrate Christmas during the Roman pagan festival Saturnalia, which is the holiday honoring Saturn, even though this date for Christmas conflicts with the biblical description of the birth of Jesus.

       But honestly, followers of neither religion "worship Saturn" and that is really a pretty dumb comment to make. And who cares if they did, why is any one made up anthropomorphized deity and better than another.

       What the fuck are you talking about? I never said anything about inventing a religion? Let me try to spell this out for you, because you seem a bit slow. You made up some stupid shit about the Jews worshiping Saturn, so I pointed out that the Romans had a holiday on the Winter solstice (Saturnalia) during which they actually worshiped Saturn. Then Christianity became popular in the Roman empire so they created the holiday Christmas, also on the Winter solstice, so they could continue celebrating their pagan holiday, but instead it was supposed to be a celebration of the birth of Jesus. However according to the descriptions in the bible of the alleged birth of Jesus, it could not have taken place in December, so therefore Christians that celebrate Christmas on December 25th are observing the celebration of the birth of their supposed savior on a day that is only holy to pagan religions.

       That being said, who cares, its all dumb bullshit anyway.

       So you don't believe in Saturn, but the Jews are evil for worshiping something that doesn't exist, which they don't even fucking actually worship? How the fuck does that make any sense? Even if they did "worship Saturn", which they don't, how is it different from any other religion which all worship different made up gods and mythological figures.

       As the only free democracy in the middle east and a firm ally of the United States, Israelis will always be my friend. This sub is full of anti-semetic bigots. Take a trip to Israel and see the people, then go to any other country nearby. How far do you have to travel away from Israel to get to another livable country? They have made the desert bloom, while others have infought and brought their countries to ruin. A peaceful one-state Israel is what the middle east needs.

       The other Arab nations are free to take in the Gazans, but they refuse, encourage them to overpopulate, and live in poverty just so they can be the puppets of the Arab states in their petty fight with Israel. Gaza is 100% an Egyptian/Syrian manufactured problem that they should own up to.

       I keep saying what? I posted one reply to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not agree with what the Israeli government is doing in regards to the killings, land grabbing or segregation directed at the Palestinian peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also do not agree with the US government building over land set aside for indigenous Americans, bombing foreign countries or blocking people from certain countries from entering this country. The US is a predominantly white Christian country... does that mean all white people are bad, or all Christians are bad? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then why do the actions of the Israeli government and Israeli military to you mean that all Jews are bad. There are many Christian or other non-Jewish citizens of Israel as well, and many of the Jewish citizens of Israel do not support the actions of their country just as many Americans do not support the official policies of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Singling out an entire religion for the actions of one country's government and saying that all the people of that religion are bad and they are to blame IS bigotry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Palestinians sided with the NAZIs and Axis powers in WW2 and through their loss in WW2 they lost parts of their land, and then lost more land after they declared war on Israel in the 1948 war... that's how war works. If the Palestinians had remained neutral in WW2 they would still have their country, if they had accepted the UN partition plan, they wouldn't be in the situation they are today. Both sides are equally to blame for the conflict in the region.
