       Posted this as a comment reply, thought I'd make it more public to reach more people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, we have iodine in table salt. Nowhere NEAR the amount our bodies require to combat the aggressive use of toxic halogens in our wonderful 1st world country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I firmly believe that 99% of the "problems" humans create are just the result of a reduced capacity to think clearly. Caused by the many toxins that bombard our bodies and brains daily, along with the plethora of misinformation being spoon-fed from birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the book "Iodine - Why You Need It, Why You Can't Live Without It"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Bromine was discovered in 1826. Bromide, (the reduced form of bromine), is rapidly absorbed in the intestinal tract. Bromine lies just above iodine in the periodic table. Because the size and weight of bromine is very close to iodine, these two items can compete with one another for binding in the body, especially in the thyroid gland. Bromine, being of similar size and shape to iodine, has the ability to bind to iodine receptors in the body. However, bromine should be considered a toxic element to the body and needs to be avoided. When bromine binds to iodine receptors in the thyroid gland, it disrupts normal thyroid functioning. Iodine is utilized by the thyroid to make thyroid hormone. When bromine replaces iodine, the thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland can be brominated rather than iodinated. My experience has clearly shown that bromine toxicity leads to a plethora of thyroid problems, including autoimmune thyroid illnesses such as Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s disease as well as hypothyroidism. Since iodine and bromine compete with one another for absorption and receptor binding, the body can only eliminate bromine if there is sufficient iodine available. Bromine intoxication (i.e., bromism) has been shown to cause delirium, psychomotor retardation, schizophrenia, and hallucination.1 Subjects who ingest enough bromide feel dull and apathetic and have difficulty concentrating.2 Bromide can also cause severe depression, headaches, and irritability. It is unclear how much bromide must be absorbed before symptoms of bromism become apparent. The symptoms of bromide toxicity can be present even with low levels of bromide in the diet.3 Keep in mind, that when the body has insufficient iodine, the toxicity of bromine is accelerated."
      </p>
      <p>
       "There is no known therapeutic value for bromide. Therefore, any level of bromide could possibly cause problems. You can see, from Figure 19, even before the patients took iodine, they were excreting too much bromide. After taking 50mg of iodine/iodide their bromide excretion increased nearly 50% from the baseline. Ingesting iodine caused the body to excrete larger amounts of bromide. This small study illustrates the detoxifying effects of iodine. Why are bromide levels so high in so many people? The next sections will answer this question in more detail."
      </p>
      <p>
       "BROMINE ADDED TO BAKERY PRODUCTS Bromine is a toxic element and has no place for ingestion in man. Bromine is considered a goitrogen, which is a chemical that causes a goiter of the thyroid gland. Bromine interferes with iodide uptake and utilization in the thyroid gland.10 11 There is no reason to use bromine in a medication and certainly no reason to use bromine in a common food source. In the early 1960’s, iodine was used in the manufacturing process of bakery products, including bread, as an anti-caking agent. One slice of bread contained up to 150μg of iodine, which was the RDA for iodine. In 1965, The National Institute of Health reported that the average iodine intake from bakery products was 726μg of iodine per day.12 Some researchers felt that this amount of iodine could cause problems with the thyroid gland. Due to the erroneous concern of getting too much iodine from bakery products, iodine was replaced with bromine in the 1980’s.13 This was a tremendous mistake. As can be seen from previous chapters, the amount of iodine in the bakery products was not even close to approaching a toxic level. The replacement of iodine by bromine not only increased the incidence of iodine deficiency, it also increased the levels of bromine in the population. This single act of replacing an essential element–iodine–with a goitrogen–bromine–might be responsible for the rapid decline in iodine levels we have experienced over the last 40 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       FLUORIDE Fluoride, like bromide, is in the family of halogens. For over 50 years, the American Dental Association has advocated the addition of fluoride to drinking water as a preventative measure against dental cavities. However, there is much evidence to suggest that fluoride added to the water supply is ineffective at preventing caries. A study in New Zealand found that there was no difference in tooth decay rates between the fluoridated and the non-fluoridated areas.16 This study has been repeated elsewhere. Many European countries have recognized the fallacy of adding fluoride to the water supply and have stopped the practice. The fluoridation of the water supply has been based on terrible science and is causing much more harm than good. Fluoridation has been linked to dental fluorosis (discoloration of the teeth), hip fractures, bone cancer, lowered intelligence, kidney toxicity, and other negative effects. There have been no studies which prove that long-term ingested fluoride has any positive effect. Fluoride is known to be a toxic agent. Fluoride has been shown to inhibit the ability of the thyroid gland to concentrate iodine. 17 Fluoride was first reported to cause thyroid problems in 1854 when fluoride was found to be a cause of goiter in dogs.18 Research has shown that fluoride is much more toxic to the body when there is iodine deficiency present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many commonly prescribed medications contain fluoride including the popular SSRI antidepressants such as Paxil and Prozac. Interestingly, there have been reports of this class of antidepressants increasing the risk of breast cancer.21 Many medications that contain fluoride have been pulled from the market due to serious adverse effects. These include the cholesterol-lowering drug Baycol, Propulsid (for stomach ulcers), Posicor (anti-arrhythmic), Astemizole (allergies), Omniflox (antibiotic), Fen-Phen (weight loss) and many others. Fluoride is still used in many medications, as seen in Table 9 on the next page. I believe that no medication should contain any toxic halogen, fluoride included. Interestingly, many fluoridated medications have been recalled due to an increased incidence of serious adverse effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       CHLORIDE Chloride, like iodide, fluoride, and bromide is from the family of halogens. Chloride is an important element in the extracellular fluid. There is a large amount of chloride found in the body—approximately 100gm. Chlorine (the oxidized form of chloride) is added to many products including the municipal water supply as well as to swimming pools and hot tubs as a disinfectant. It is also used as a whitener. However, chlorine is a toxic element. A byproduct of chlorine use is the production of dioxin. Dioxin is one of the most toxic carcinogens known to mankind. It does not readily break down in the environment. Chlorine and its byproducts have been linked to birth defects, cancer22, reproductive disorders including stillbirth,23 and immune system breakdown. Americans are exposed to a high level of chlorine and chlorine byproducts that are toxic to their health. This includes being exposed to the steam of the dishwasher when the door is opened after cleaning (chlorine superheated and combined with detergent). In addition, the widely used sugar-substitute Sucralose (Splenda®) contains chlorinated table sugar. No one denies the importance of having clean drinking and swimming pool water that is free of bacteria. However, there are many safer alternatives to disinfecting water including the use of iodine, hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet light, and ozone that could be substituted for chlorine.
      </p>
      <p>
       FINAL THOUGHTS We are in the midst of a cancer epidemic. At the present time, one in three Americans will get cancer. Cancer is not caused by chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery deficiency. Cancer is a multifactorial illness that will only be conquered when the underlying causes of cancer are properly thought out and thoroughly dealt with. There is no doubt that our exposure to toxic chemicals is increasing at the same time our nutrient status is declining. Is it any wonder that cancer rates are reaching epidemic proportions? Currently one in seven women (14%) has breast cancer and one in three men (33%) has prostate cancer. Iodine deficiency coupled with the increasing toxic load in our bodies could explain a great deal about why these cancer numbers are so high. Iodine supplementation has multiple positive effects on the body. These positive effects are found in many different illnesses from fatigue states to autoimmune disorders and cancer. It is important not only to ensure adequate levels of nutrients in the body, but also to help the body utilize these nutrients by enhancing the detoxification mechanisms. Iodine supplementation will not only provide a valuable nutrient for the body, it will also aid in the detoxification process of the body. The next chapter will give you information about detoxification. I believe ensuring an adequate iodine level is a crucial factor to helping you achieve your optimal health."

       This reminds me that I need to restart my Lugol's Iodine solution regime.  Great post and I agree that most Americans are deficient in iodine.  When I was researching it a few years ago, I ended up telling my neighbor about it one night and she got some Lugol's solution and within a week she was buzzing around, full of energy, clear thoughts...and she was able to stop taking her thyroid medication....after 10 years of taking it daily. Very interesting, also, is that it seems to be getting harder to find 'iodized' salt...most store shelves have an abundance of sea salt, which does not contain iodine.

       You definitely want either sea salt or pink Himalayan salt. Then supplement with iodine. The table salt we generally use is synthetic and not well-accepted by our bodies. Pink Himalayan salt contains like 50+ trace minerals that a typical diet will not include.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best practice (for me): Put 1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon of pink salt per gallon of distilled water (getting your own still is better than buying it in plastic jugs) With about 5-10mg of iodine. Then it's already in your pure water WITH electrolytes + trace minerals

       That's sodium salt - nobody should have that. Salt is essential, but not just sodium salt, other salts too. Something like sea salt which contains them all is relatively ok.

       It states clearly in your link 'contains 100 ppb'. You feel free to eat it but lead is not safe at any level. Also, why are you so abrupt and argumentative? Perhaps you would do better changing your circle of associates?

      <p>
       Factory salt is artificial and made with chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sea salt comes from oceans which are highly polluted (likely even more lead).
      </p>
      <p>
       And salt is necessary. Animals lick salt for a reason.

       Factory salt is mined. All salt is NaCl, the same as if you did make it in chemistry lab. Pink salt contains infinitesimal amounts of lead. Here is an analysis:

       NaCl is all the same regardless of its source, be it mined or evaporated. If one makes it in a chemistry lab, it's still the same. Sea salt may be enhanced by included bits of whale shit or seaweed particles, but otherwise it's the same chemical.

       I believe it relates to the structure and the presence of preservatives...  sea salt and even “pickling salt” have no added iodine or preservatives and thus dissolve in solution readily, table salt does not.  Also has to do with the crystalline structure, manufactured salt is in tiny cubes because by manufacturing it in ideal settings it take the most stable structure.  If you notice natural salt is basically flakes, a much less stable structure.  I am not deeply knowledgeable about chemistry but you can read about crystal structures and molecular stability from a variety of sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or just see it yourself...  get two glasses of room temp water.  Measure out table salt in one and sea salt in the other.  Observe how much sea salt vs table salt dissolved readily without agitation or heat.  Now think about the fact that your body absorbs things by dissolving them into solution.

       Salt is a preservative, so it doesn't need preservatives. It naturally forms cubes when coming out of solution due to its molecular structure. As far as dissolving, with it all being exactly the same chemically, I would expect it to dissolve the same. Regardless, except for pretzel topping, all the salt I eat is already dissolved in the food.

       Well, generally iodine and some other chemicals are added to prevent clumping (more-so than preservative) and
       <em>
        importantly
       </em>
       to prevent excess water absorption.  Think about that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, and I don’t know who you are or what your education level is, so don’t take this as condescending or snarky, it is usually taught in elementary chemistry or “general science/physical science” (in high school) that there are
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       factors that affect any given substances solubility.  The chemical ability to dissolve in a given solvent (water in the general case) and
       <em>
        crucially
       </em>
       the physical properties of the substance.  More surface area=greater solubility, if you think about this it is pretty intuitive:  if you put a 10 gram block of something (salt for example) in water and also put 10 grams of the same substance in powdered form, which dissolves faster?  Salt dissolves in water by attraction of polar molecules (the dipole property of the H2O molecule gives it the title in chemistry “the universal solvent”). For this to work, water molecules must contact salt molecules.  The larger the surface area of the salt, the more water molecules may come in contact with salt molecules and “pull them away”.  Cubes have a very low surface area by volume compared to, say, irregular flakes (as sea salt is shaped) therefore despite the chemistry being the same, physical differences change the solubility (just like how hot water dissolves more solute, temperature is a physical, not chemical, property).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another angle to think of this from is that commercially manufactured table salt has a design spec.  That design spec is not on solubility, thus bioavailability, but rather the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       .  Commercial table salt is optimized for packaging and storage, which essentially means it is designed with the manufacturer and seller’s interest in mind, not the consumer.  This means that it is designed, as much as possible, to
       <em>
        resist
       </em>
       solubility in water.

       Regarding solubility, the food we eat is not crunchy. Commercial salt dissolves well enough. Maybe this pragmatic viewpoint comes from being a degreed engineer :-)

       Crunchy?  I am confused by what you mean there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming you are not a computer engineer, I must question you on your claims based on what you say your degree is.  Maybe not all universities are the same, but as I have a BS in Civil Engineering and took the FE, how are you questioning very simple principles of chemistry?  While not all engineering divisions at my university required progressing into organic chemistry, all required a full course of general and the FE exam tests it for all concentrations (that is from a US perspective but I am of the understanding all countries have a fairly similar threshold).
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know whether or not table salt is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       adequately bioavailable, but the discussion is about how it would differ from natural forms being the same chemically.  I would assume you understand that the perfect cube structure of table salt is a combination of molecular proclivity to that form and ideal conditions to do so.  Naturally formed salt is crystalline in structure due to its molecular properties but rarely in perfect completion of this.  Further, it the solubility should be no surprise at all.

       I think buying an osmosis filter is the best route anyone can take if they can make the investment. Buy that and a couple of Yeti tumblers (or the sams club knock offs as the yetis are ridiculous) and you'll never buy bottled water again.

       Fun fact: Japanese cuisine is mostly seafood, giving the average civilian 8-14mg per day of iodine. They are known to be HARD workers. Literally go until they fall asleep, so that says something haha. But yeah I wouldn't go more than 10-14mg (based on body weight), that's where hypERthyroidism begins. 2-8mg is ideal. Look into it though and trust your gut.

       The problem with thyroid meds is that it actually shuts down (takes over the work) of the thyroid.  People with hypothyroidism or Hashimoto's have a sluggish thyroid or one that won't work at all, so doctors throw synthetic thyroid at them.  They very often kill the gland and going off the meds is worse.  Your neighbor sounds lucky.  Another thing that helps keep the thyroid healthy are the D vitamins, but doctors would rather throw the synthroid at you.  I know several people who have kept their deficient thyroid gland fit by just taking an larger dose of vitamin D3.  I think the US doctors vitamin D daily dosage is too low.  Thanks for the tip too, I will have to give it a try.

       I’m getting my thyroid levels tested for the first time in my life as I suspect my super slow metabolism has a root cause. Been taking iodine recently. I suggest anyone who is sluggish, lacks motivation, has dry skin, and irregular movements (heh) get blood work done with your next physical.

       Take vitamin D and also Selenium - both good for keeping your thyroid healthy.  If your T3/T4 are good but your TSH is a little elevated, don't let them just stick you on synthroid.  Do the research first. Also know that even physicians are changing the norms for TSH because they're not sure. Fun Fact:  selenium, which helps keep a healthy thyroid, comes from soil rich in selenium.  The northern part of the US has little to no selenium in its soil.  Many other states are low in it as well.  No selenium soil, no selenium in plants, no selenium makes its way into our meat products, etc.

       Holy crap, thank you for telling me about this! Highest concentration I've found yet! You can go up to about 10-12mg per day before it starts affecting your thyroid negatively. You should go for (what myself and others have found) about 4-8mg per day.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's the 2146 mcg (2mg) per drop tincture, then I would do 5 drops per gallon. That way, if you just have 2 glasses of water that day, you'll get 2mg of iodine, which is a good minimum. If you drink the whole gallon you get 10mg, still within healthy range.

       "By the time a man is 60 years old, it’s almost certain he has at least a low level of prostate cancer.....Depending on what study you look at, the chance of a man being diagnosed with prostate cancer sometime in his life is about one in five or six. That’s a sobering number in itself, but here’s something more to think about. A recent autopsy study on the incidence of prostate cancer shows that it is present even in men as young as 20."

       Drink lots of as clean as possible water to dilute that stuff out, as clean as possible, forget the (non chelated) minerals, water is to clean the body not feed it, get your (chelated) minerals in healthy food.

       Interesting that you mention this.... I had dominos pizza few weeks ago and got sorta sick from it, stomach ache and migrane. Was looking up possible reasons why, since it has happened more then once, and saw how bread that isn't baked properly can have bromine in it and cause you to have low iodine. I think this may have been the cause as well as explain some other issues.... they say if you have tiny red dots on skin it can be the reason why too, which I have noticed like 2-3.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bought some iodine/kelp solution, its like 200mcg per drop. Supposed to drink water with a few drops every day. So you have tried this and seen good benefits from it? What all has improved? Any other important supplements?

       I've been doing 1-4mg per day, helps a ton with energy levels and clearing brain fog. I wonder if bread is "bad" for you not because of gluten, but because of bromine.

       I'm sure plenty of people have gotten confused and thought it was gluten allergy. Prob common in fast food places like subway or pizza shops where they store bread for long periods and have to bake quickly. I'm cutting down on my bread anyways... and corn. Its so hard to avoid corn syrup.

       So then, what kind of Iodine do I need, and how much do I need to take daily? The answers seem to vary wildly and each have their own followings.

       Good info, since I was a kid Chinese gov. forced salt producer to add iodine into it, probably that's we are so smart ! Later the gov. felt like "oops, we messed up, these peasants are too smart now" and then they regulated, restricted and discouraged the practice.

       I believe it relates to the structure and the presence of preservatives...  sea salt and even “pickling salt” have no added iodine or preservatives and thus dissolve in solution readily, table salt does not.  Also has to do with the crystalline structure, manufactured salt is in tiny cubes because by manufacturing it in ideal settings it take the most stable structure.  If you notice natural salt is basically flakes, a much less stable structure.  I am not deeply knowledgeable about chemistry but you can read about crystal structures and molecular stability from a variety of sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or just see it yourself...  get two glasses of room temp water.  Measure out table salt in one and sea salt in the other.  Observe how much sea salt vs table salt dissolved readily without agitation or heat.  Now think about the fact that your body absorbs things by dissolving them into solution.

       Well, generally iodine and some other chemicals are added to prevent clumping (more-so than preservative) and
       <em>
        importantly
       </em>
       to prevent excess water absorption.  Think about that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, and I don’t know who you are or what your education level is, so don’t take this as condescending or snarky, it is usually taught in elementary chemistry or “general science/physical science” (in high school) that there are
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       factors that affect any given substances solubility.  The chemical ability to dissolve in a given solvent (water in the general case) and
       <em>
        crucially
       </em>
       the physical properties of the substance.  More surface area=greater solubility, if you think about this it is pretty intuitive:  if you put a 10 gram block of something (salt for example) in water and also put 10 grams of the same substance in powdered form, which dissolves faster?  Salt dissolves in water by attraction of polar molecules (the dipole property of the H2O molecule gives it the title in chemistry “the universal solvent”). For this to work, water molecules must contact salt molecules.  The larger the surface area of the salt, the more water molecules may come in contact with salt molecules and “pull them away”.  Cubes have a very low surface area by volume compared to, say, irregular flakes (as sea salt is shaped) therefore despite the chemistry being the same, physical differences change the solubility (just like how hot water dissolves more solute, temperature is a physical, not chemical, property).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another angle to think of this from is that commercially manufactured table salt has a design spec.  That design spec is not on solubility, thus bioavailability, but rather the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       .  Commercial table salt is optimized for packaging and storage, which essentially means it is designed with the manufacturer and seller’s interest in mind, not the consumer.  This means that it is designed, as much as possible, to
       <em>
        resist
       </em>
       solubility in water.

       Crunchy?  I am confused by what you mean there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming you are not a computer engineer, I must question you on your claims based on what you say your degree is.  Maybe not all universities are the same, but as I have a BS in Civil Engineering and took the FE, how are you questioning very simple principles of chemistry?  While not all engineering divisions at my university required progressing into organic chemistry, all required a full course of general and the FE exam tests it for all concentrations (that is from a US perspective but I am of the understanding all countries have a fairly similar threshold).
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know whether or not table salt is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       adequately bioavailable, but the discussion is about how it would differ from natural forms being the same chemically.  I would assume you understand that the perfect cube structure of table salt is a combination of molecular proclivity to that form and ideal conditions to do so.  Naturally formed salt is crystalline in structure due to its molecular properties but rarely in perfect completion of this.  Further, it the solubility should be no surprise at all.
