       I know that we're constantly emitting radio waves along with having sendt interstellar probes etc detailing where we exist in the galaxy.

      <p>
       I occasionally think about the unsavory possibilities of the Fermi paradox.

       I'm going to absolute ignore the facts that both Hawaii and Japan had false missile alerts go out in the past week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guys and gals, I feel half crazy but would like to submit the possibility that we're under attack from a hostile alien species that's launching rocks at us in the hope that they'll get lucky.

       If they have the technology to get here, they probably have been here forever and have had plenty of time to destroy us.

       There's not going to be a fake alien invasion. If anything, the aliens are going to save us. But more likely they'll just keep observing while we destroy ourselves.

       Yeah, the only problem with that is if they were from another solar system they had to have figured out how to travel between solar systems in a relatively fast manner. Even if they were just hurling big meteors at us from another solar system. I mean they would have had to plan the attack long ago. Also for what reason would they attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Resources would be the number one reason I could think of but from the stance your coming from that wouldn't make to much sense. So perhaps they are trying to quill a threat that isn't so much of a threat now, but can be in the future.

       Not saying its true, but what if its like the nibiru scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown-dwarfs with planets that orbit it very closely capable of supporting life? Im sure everything would grow in darkness, but with the heat from the infrared its theoretically possible?\
      </p>
      <p>
       Couple that with 99% of stars in our galaxy are/were part of binary systems, and i mean it is technically possible.

       We can already reliably land stuff on the moon or mars etc. If another civilization evolved differently to the point that they have slightly better engineering/maths but lesser war capacity (like no nuclear weapons for example), then maybe they think "let's destroy the threat"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the problem is where we define "advanced". I think similarly developed civilizations could have strengths and weaknesses just like a first year grade school students does.

       Have you ever read the book? It's great too but completely different in tone.

       its more of a philosophical examination of citizenship and service. It's funny how they can be so different but still so good in their own ways.

       Give it a read, you'll enjoy! Just remember it is not a satirical take on fascism but almost even the opposite: an examination of a citizen's duty to society and how to best serve.

       interesting. i live in britain, but there's a post on this subreddit from about 2 hours ago, about the direct energy weapon pics on 8chan and someone on 4chan had said for people in michigan to look at the sky the night before.

       They talkl about the "Animus" threath which are basically cyborgs that want to harvest our genetic material.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have
       <a href="http://2012portal.blogspot.com">
        http://2012portal.blogspot.com
       </a>
       which talks about the "Archon invasion of 1996" and the "Chimera group" (which sounds alot like the Animus described in the links above).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you can check out the channelings from
       <a href="http://lawofone.info">
        http://lawofone.info
       </a>
       search "orion" for information on the negative beings. The orion federation is a network of various ET species from the Orion star system that were conquered by some maurading civilization millenia ago, and they have been at work subverting Earth based institutions for many thousand years. These I believe are what the 2012 blog calls the "archons". They are what David Icke calls the "reptilians", and what David Wilcock calls the "dracos".
      </p>
      <p>
       Corey Goode talks about these groups plus AI that are controlling the dracos; this seems to be similar to the "animus" discussed in the first links and the "chimera" discussed in the 2012 blog.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which of these are disinfo / making shit up? Maybe all of them. But they do have similar overarching themes. Those are as follows:
The galaxy is composed of many different beings; life is plentiful. Earth's life is relatively "late to the game" so there are many species that have already figured out space travel and have been influencing us for a while. For example, the being that is channelled in the law of one stuff is purportedly from Venus 2+ billion years ago. These ETs that have been visiting have a wide array of agendas. You can imagine a hierarchy that represents the degree of power for various entities. On Earth the top of the hierarchy are the aristocrats and their court factors. This hierarchy extends to the galactic and universal hierarchies. Just above the Earth hierarchy you have beings that are slightly more technologically advanced than us, and that extends upwards to the leaders of the Orion federation and beyond. The highest are what A.R. Bourdon calls the "hyperversals" which are beings that are able to both transcend our physical universe and can travel via thought AND are have survived since previous iterations of the physical universe (Ie they were able to survive the previous "big crunch" or the end of the last universe and portal into this one). These beings are concerned with two things: limiting the use of "electrogravity" (which is how many of these craft are powered that can get here and even exceed light speed) and managing the "real estate", ie making sure habitable planets aren't destroyed or abused by less evolved beings. Thus, they manage the hierarchy in a sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to the "good" forces which would like to see humanity succeed in wresting control of our resources from the "elites" and becoming responsible galactic citizens, you have your "evil" forces which would like to enslave us and harvest our genetic material. This is already going on to some extent, although we are in a critical time where our fate will be decided by our actions over the next few decades. The evil forces such as the orion federation, the chimera, and so on are mostly based in underground bases; either re-using bases that were created thousands of years ago back during Atlantean times or creating new ones through their control of the military industrial complex. Their control is accomplished through promises of information and power to various elites who are predisposed towards power over others. They seem to have even implanted a sort of "religion" that has satanic and/or luciferian overtones amongst these elites in which they believe they will be rewarded a powerful position in the "new world order" once humanity has been fully enslaved. This of course has not been going to plan since there are many agendas at play and the populous remains difficult to control due to their many religions and belief systems. However, this does explain the terrible things that have been done to the population such as genetic experimentation, human trafficking and sacrifice, psychotronic weaponry, pollution in food and water systems, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to answer your question, if these various sources are to be believed - yes we are under attack. But not in an overt way, it is more of an infiltration. Although some of the above sources claim that there is a war going on in sublunar space between positive and negative elements within the military industrial complex. This is why we saw all those satellite launches recently and there have been many reports of meteors and loud booms. This is also why you are seeing the outing of several powerful actors and CEOs due to sexual misconduct. The recent "UFO disclosures" are possibly a part of this war as well. These disclosures are expected to continue. The important thing is that if we are being infiltrated, its hugely important to understand their methods of control. They want to basically make us robots - so all of the technocrats that are pushing for the "AI singularity" are unwittingly following the negative ET agenda. It is important regardless of whether or not aliens are here for us to maintain our sovereignty, so we must oppose attempts at making us machines and embrace holistic approaches to health and nourishment.

       It does make me wonder just how advanced secret tech is. Someone posted here recently saying that we already have interstellar travel capability. If there is such high tech being kept secret we could be intercepting attacks.

       I'm still not convinced that the ability to attach rockets to rocks and roughly aim them is considerably more advanced (in the big scheme of things) to us, especially if they keep missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, that's a very good point. I'm assuming that the publicly known tech level is the most advanced. You remind me of something a military person once said, that the military is basically always at least 10 years ahead of what's publicly known and available. That was a long time ago but if true then, the lead could have gotten even greater.
