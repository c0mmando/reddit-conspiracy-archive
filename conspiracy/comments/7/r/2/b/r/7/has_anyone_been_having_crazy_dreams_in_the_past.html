The past few days I&#39;ve been having these insanely realistic and fulfilling dreams; in waking up and throughout the day I can remember them in full detail, which is not normal for me. Wondering if anyone else has noticed this. I asked my brother and he said the same thing has been happening to him since 2 or 3 weeks ago, he says they&#39;re so intense that he looks forward to going to sleep every night just for the dreams lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im curious are you in situations where you learn things about yourself? I feel like my dreams are trying to teach me to be a better person. For example last night i dreamt I was riding in a school bus with my old basketball team and the bus took a corner hard and rolled and crashed, and I was the first one out and opening the back hatch and helped everyone out. Idk if it means anything, but I mean it made me feel good about myself, and it made me determined to help/take action if I&#39;m ever in a situation where people need help</p>

<p>I&#39;ve take breaks many times and every single time I stop, the following weeks I tend to have VERY vivid dreams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does. Also something that helped me lucid dream is having a &quot;trigger&quot; for realizing you are dreaming. The key is to do this trigger periodically throughout the day to test if you are dreaming (even though you know you aren&#39;t) that way when you are you will do it out of habit. For example, my trigger was turning a light off and on. If you are dreaming, you can&#39;t &#39;tell difference of brightness levels, so nothing will happen while dreaming. So throughout the day I&#39;d randomly flick a light switch on and off knowing that I&#39;m not dreaming, but just to get in the habit. Then when I did it in the dream nothing happened and I was suddenly conscious while dreaming!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been having intense dreams for years. I can even remember some of them from years ago, probably because I think of my dreams every morning after I wake up and some of them just touched deep down into my heart and mind.
The one that hit me the deepest was the dream I had after my grandpa passed away. In my dream I saw my grandpa in a ship, telling me &quot;Did you know that I&#39;m not actually dead?&quot; Then I followed him around and he was moving pretty fast. Finally he went up to the sky and as he went, he said &quot;I will be waiting for your mom&quot;. This was 5 years ago, and recently I found out my mom actually wanted to suicide after grandpa&#39;s death, but decided not to because she still has a family that cares about her. Still gives me the chills everytime I think about it...</p>

I do believe all it is, is that as it &quot;thins&quot;, as you say, we become more in tune with the harmonics of the next realm of existence. This allows us to better detail information back to own objective awareness using the most familiar symbols we&#39;ve grown accustomed to, that of 3d space-time happenings, that we experience in our dreams.</p>

<p>do you have lavender in your fabric softener ?</p>

<p>if no then ignore , if yes then please read</p>

<p>hi , im one of those people who research odd wiv3es tails ..</p>

<p>few years ago i remembered from my youth hearing about old ladies and lavender to aid sleep .. 
suffering from sleep disorder and having spent 10 years on sleeping pills i decided to give lavender a go ...</p>

<p>my god ...</p>

<p>i bought a bottle of lavender oil and put 10 drops into a spray bottle with water , shook it , sprayed 5 or 6 times onto my pillow and went to bed ..</p>

<p>i was out like a light .. wow .. fantastic .. </p>

<p>kept doing it .. my dreams ..</p>

<p>after 1 year doing this my dreams were starting to be a second life ..</p>

<p>i love going to bed now knowing i will fall asleep in seconds and my dreams will be like a second life .. i have learned not to try to control my dreams and just dire it through because when i try to control it i wake up ..</p>

<p>my dreams are so real . i can feel things . i feel pain .. and have woke up quite a few times in pain from things in my dreams ..</p>

<p>lavender needs researched IMO so if your parents use it in fabric softener with it in it you may want to buckle up for one hell of a ride </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% yes. Lavender and chamomile are proven to have calming effects on both humans and animals. I use lavender spray on my pillows too and my dogs bed. and also if you grow lavender in your garden you&#39;re doing a HUGE favour for the bees (help the bees, you help the earth) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Basically since the start of the new year I’ve been having vivid dreams that feel like reality. They all seem to mimic real life, as if I’m experiencing living life on a regular afternoon or evening except there are slight differences. It’s almost like I am witnessing an alternate reality in some other universe that is close to ours but slightly different. They feel so real in fact, that when I wake up I sometimes have trouble differentiating whether or not something that occurred in the dream actually occurred in real life. For example, conversations that I remember clearly from the dream but never happened in real life. Or text messages that I sent but never actually sent in real life. It’s been tripping me out</p>
