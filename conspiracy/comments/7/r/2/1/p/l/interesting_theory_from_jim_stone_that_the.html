<p>If this is true then Trump will be in a quandary about what to do. The media can be relied on to hush this up, but will Trump forgive Israel for actually attacking the United States? </p>

UPDATE: NEW EVIDENCE!!! WITH VERY GOOD REASON I REPEAT: ISRAEL IS NOW SHORT A DOLPHIN 2 SUBMARINE AND ANYONE WITH A DIFFERENT STORY IS FULL OF IT.
READ IT AND WEEP ISRAEL, YOU&#39;RE AS GOOD AS BUSTED.
QUESTION: What nation could launch a nuclear warhead at the United States and get away with it? Come on folks, put your thinking cap on. Waiting . . . . . . waiting for an answer . . . . . . waiting . . . . . . .OH, I GOT IT!!!! ISRAEL!!!!!</p>

<p>They needed their false flag and world war 3 to shut Trump down now that he&#39;s the Orkin man after the critters. HEADS UP FOLKS, IT MAY BE GETTING HOT OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW SOON.</p>

<p>You had better make sure you can at least keep a light on, I did not post that nifty little oil lamp for no reason. HERE IS THE REASON:
Pacific Command detected a missile, those systems DO NOT EVER SCREW UP, which means they shot it down, and it took them 38 minutes to confirm they destroyed the sub and another missile would not be launched, as I reported all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would actually be easier for you to visit a fake domain name than a fake IP address. Domains can be taken over, it happens fairly often. You can’t really make an IP address point somewhere else without access to someone’s ISP unless you’ve managed to actually gain control of their server, in which case the domain name would be compromised as well.</p>

<p>Just saying it’s silly to not want to click an IP address. It’s like security theater. Clicking only on domain names doesn’t make you more safe. Clicking on only certain domain names makes you marginally more safe.</p>

<p>Use something like uMatrix and you don’t have to worry about any of this, since scripts will actually be prevented from executing.</p>

<p>But here’s a domain name if that helps:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.destroythedarkness.com/">http://www.destroythedarkness.com/</a></p>

<p>Note that this probably isn’t a “known to you” domain name, but also that by following this rule you will limit yourself to mostly MSM and MSAM (mainstream alternative media, which is basically MSM with a slant).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol no problem, glad I could help! Definitely check out uMatrix as well for desktop browsing. It disables all script and off-site resources by default until you manually allow them. Makes it damn near impossible to get a virus from a website.</p>

<p>NoScript used to do the same thing, and presumably it still does. It’s a bit more complicated though since it requires you to enable each specific script rather than each serving domain like uMatrix. I switched a while back when NoScript became tedious. It is probably more secure than uMatrix though.</p>
