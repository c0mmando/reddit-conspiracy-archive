    <div class="md"><p>Actually, the thought process is simple. Dealing with a grown, mature adult woman is too much for the mind of a pedophile. They want something they can pick up and split in half. A fleshlight won&#39;t do, they want the edge of ruining a child&#39;s life and pretend that everything is fine. This is where the ship sails. This is where they can&#39;t be saved.</p>

<p>It’s not true as far as I’ve seen.  I haven’t seen anything backing up the claim but it is true I have seen a lot of articles that just say it.  Unfortunately those articles are from sketchy sites that use other sketchy sites to back up their claims and I just plain don’t think they have any integrity beyond what’s necessary to get more clicks.  I’ve been looking for actual evidence of a specific claim, that of the hard drive, because there’s other conspiracy theories that rest on that, or use that claim, as evidence of wrongdoing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I think people are getting confused by this because the MSM reported that a hard drive was missing. </p>

<p>First off, just because Yahoo News! reports a hard drive was missing doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re investigative reporters who figured this out on their own. Second, just because it said a hard drive was missing doesn&#39;t mean there was only one computer. They took the good part of the story and either didn&#39;t know about the other laptops or chose not to include that information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, i&#39;m sorry to say that they were duplicated in Utah and stored for eternity and also over at GCHQ and somewhere in Oz, too, to be used as future kompromat. Best you can do is reform and try not to have any loud viewpoints. I know it&#39;s chilling, but thats the price we paid for freedom. At any minute, waves of ISIS and russians and alqaedas and north koreans are gonna come across the ocean and do bad stuff. </p>

<p>technically, the only way it could be done was to scrape everything and apply search capability and keyword flagging. I would have done it. I&#39;d do it again. Ensure your country has an economic and military and diplomatic edge for the foreseeable future? If you&#39;re a patriot, it would have been your idea. </p>

<p>Constitution? What good is it if the white house has a Soviet candidate and the economy is drained into other countries and our hegemony is undermined? You want an end to peace and local skirmishes becoming regional all-out attrition? Without this Pax Americana, you&#39;d all be unironically Sieg Hieling and the entire Asian landmass would have been glass from siberia to india. </p>

<p>Or would it have been Chairman Mao?</p>

<p>History happened and it&#39;s trajectory has inertia. looks good for America, what with crypto undermining the attempts to undermine the petrodollar, and combo with shale and fracking, we decimated the opposition financially and then we hit them while they were down and caused an Arab Spring. Looking good, women are driving, going out alone without permission, and even Saudi Arabia had to deal with budget cuts. BRICS can suck a dick, we&#39;ve had contingency plans for a hundred years about this moment in time. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve seen Star Trek. That Federation was the USA adding another 212 States. It&#39;s Manifest Destiny 2.0. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone wants you to have an emotional reason to be outraged and think Paddock was a bad bad man. Why?</p>

<p>Paddock shoots up these people. That alone makes sufficient argument. He shot, killed, and maimed hundreds. Positive thoughts to the friends, family, and recovering in the healing ahead. -- There is no reason to layer on the additional point. </p>

<p>That extra tidbit is unnecessary, unless a growing population question the official story. Following up with the child porn bit is a way to force your head back underwater and hold it there. No thinking. No questions. Obey. </p>

<p>Does this provide footage of weapons moved?</p>

<p>Does this clarify activities through bank transaction metadata?</p>

<p>Does this address the multitude of other theories floating around?</p>

<p>We have all these industry leading domestic spying techniques. Nothing occurs that is not documented, analyzed, and explored. You can&#39;t drive a vehicle through a city without being captured by license plate readers and cellphone gps monitored along the way. </p>

<p>If this guy is an arms dealer, how did he operate out of Vegas hotels unknown to anyone? With all the domestic surveillance capabilities this guy was not on the radar and followed closely? Why? Or was he operating in official approved capacity in some way? What sort of background would have approval to sell arms in population centers like this? Do such roles also run child porn websites as a honeypot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading that whole thing i am wondering is this guy tech savvy? Why is he using so many different search engines? Im assuming the different computer come with different search engines but common bing search quarries who the fuck uses bing? Why not google everything? But then he uses an incognito browsing window? Does he really think that will hide his search results? Why is he worried about hiding those, lets call them “innocent” search’s, innocent considering the guy allegedly left child porn blatantly on a computer somewhere? Then why get rid of the hard drive? Why not just burn the whole fucking thing? Why not get rid of the computer? What was on that hard drive? For someone who’s not coming across as too tech savvy why google how to remove a hard drive. Then go though that kinda difficult process for a non tech savvy person. Where the fuck is the hard drive. I would assume this guy would put it in the toilet or something thinking it would destroy everything on it right? Just like how using an incognito window hides all your search results right? In that report they for mail address stickers my theory is that hard drive had some really important information on it that someone somewhere wanted from him. And he mailed it. I bet there is a video of him dropping off a little package in the mail at some-point before the shooting.  And for someone who doesn’t care about child porn being found (if true) that hard drive must have some really crazy shit on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Total jew production from start to finish. Does the same company manage the productions for both conservatives and liberals? Somethings they can never account for : Sheriff Lombardo , the esteemed police officer he apparently is, had practically no info available on him anywhere on the internet immediately following the massacre. That has changed a bit since then , so now we have a few more, probably, hastily written articles filling that void, as it always fishy why a top LV police official would have nothing , not even attendance at a public event or quotes from a speech he made etc. </p>

<p>Then there was the acting, watch the sheriff go through the motions of grief and despair at the pressers after the event. He was no professional police officer and even made some faux pas, seemingly all down to the sheer horror of the event, which put the whole investigation into disarray and that was the goal from the very start. Move onto the doctors involved in the ER efforts to save the many victims. Same deal as with the sheriff, not one iota about them or where they went to school and most importantly zero feedback or ratings from patients they had treated in the past. Look up any physician and you can be certain there is plenty of reviews about their performance over the years &amp; bear in mind the ER doctors interviewed were seasoned individuals and hardly just out of medical school. </p>

<p>It can go on and on. Though one thing is for certain, the LV massacre has become pure kabuki theater &amp; will go on and on forever using all kinds of shock tactics to keep the public interested. There was the Philippines connection, the money laundering, the exotic girlfriend, the many and too many guns for one person at that age and that level of fitness to carry out, the Isis connection, the gambling and the painkiller addiction and now child porn all inserted into the veritable smorgasbord of vice and depravity.</p>

<p>From <a href="/u/Forthewolf_x">/u/Forthewolf_x</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks like there were four separate laptops:</p>

<p>Inside the bedroom were several empty ammunition boxes, live rounds, loaded rifle magazines, duffle bags, suitcases, two laptop computers (one of which was broken and missing the hard drive),</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>Computer forensic analysis of a Dell laptop Model E5570 revealed numerous internet searches for open air venues. Additionally, several hundred images of child pornography were located on the computer’s hard drive. The investigation into the source of these images is ongoing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about anybody else but there are 5 or 6 computers in my household right now. If you want to include tablets/phones it brings my total up to 9-10 devices. Paddock supposedly had multiple residences which would likely have a computer at each, I would. When I travel I take my primary laptop with me leaving other devices at home. Is it really so unfathomable to consider that the hard drive from the laptop in Vegas is still &quot;missing&quot; and another laptop/computer had CP? Personally, I find the CP revelation convenient and suspicious but also not unfathomable. Especially if you believe the Deep State recruits operatives with skeletons they can easily exploit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Room service always asks how many are dining so they give you the right number of utensils and condiments. Every time I&#39;ve ordered room service I always add one so I have extra in case I drop something or want more mustard or something. So that&#39;s not anything to consider. Also he could&#39;ve wanted to stock up with an extra meal or two considering he was modding the room with wires and holes and didn&#39;t want to have room service come by with guns spread across the room. </p>

<p>Also, he checked into one room days before. And the other was comped to him for the weekend. So I&#39;m not sure if the two hotel rooms was planed or not. Maybe he wanted the suite but still wanted to get there earlier then the comped room?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>look at the reports for the 27th.  He returns to his room at  7am after gambling all night.  He orders 2 entrees at 4pm which appears to be when he woke up.  30 minutes later the hotel staff cleans the whole room and the staff reports Paddock was the only person in the room. </p>

<p>If you are thinking the person who was eating the second entree was in the other room (32-134) remember Paddock reserved that room from the 29th through the 2nd. He wasn&#39;t able to enter the other room for 2 more days.</p>

<p>it&#39;s the fucking information age bruh, you gotta get a hand|e on html and python by age 16 or you really can&#39;t even navigate the web safely. I mean, how are you gonna b0t comment and sh1|| if you don&#39;t have 40 instances of s4ndboxle running 40 pr0ckzies and logged into reddit, using reddits API from the bottom of every page, lmao, and scanning for whatever keyword I want and dumping a prepared comment from a pool in a big .CSV of prepared counterpoints. 40 upvotes, 40 downvotes, 40 comments, I even offer to sell my warez, if you got bitcoin or even DOGE nowadays. DM for more information if you&#39;re trying to get cyberpunk like John Connor (in Terminator 2 though, I think he h4cked an ATM with a fucking Atari 2600) or if you just want to get on par with the other actors in your playing field, you will have to modernize your skill set. Thats a real true FACT. </p>

<p>If you want to get cyberpunk like Rick Ro$$ U|bricht, that costs extra, but of course I can show you da wae.</p>
