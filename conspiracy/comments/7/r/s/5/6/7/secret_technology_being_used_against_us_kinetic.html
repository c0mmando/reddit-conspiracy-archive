        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>September 11th, 2001 was a magical day.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s an element of magic to the story no matter what you believe happened.  If you&#39;re still buying the &quot;official&quot; story, then you <em>certainly</em> believe in magic.  If you&#39;ve dug into the rabbithole, maybe read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/6kr3al/technology_thousands_of_years_ahead_of_whats/">my post about what brought down the buildings</a> or maybe discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yri3ZSVjjnA">Dr. Judy Wood</a> on your own, then you know the technology behind it all is so far ahead of what&#39;s known to the public that it can best be described as <em>magic</em>.</p>

<h2><strong>Kinetic Holograms</strong></h2>

<p>This isn&#39;t an original theory but it explains most phenomena observed that day.  There were some major and telling anomalies about the planes that hit the WTC towers:</p>

<ul>
<li>A point-perfect path.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kUjj2Un.png">Both planes</a> made perfect adjustments to their path to hit their targets.  It&#39;s far too accurate for unassisted, first-time pilots (and I doubt any skilled pilots were willing to volunteer.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Airspeeds exceeded structural integrity.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, if these had actually flown at the rates we&#39;re told, the planes would&#39;ve torn themselves apart mid-air.  <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/911_Aircraft_Speed_Deets.html"><em>Pilots for 9/11 Truth</em> will tell you all about that</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Glitches on approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two most famous are <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cdqGte0488/maxresdefault.jpg">one of the plane wings suddenly vanishing</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/MPkZN_r0IQE?t=1m51s">the nose going all the way through the building.</a>   Looking at <a href="https://911planeshoax.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/any-questions.jpg">a frame-by-frame of the impact</a> shows a plane vanishing into a building moreso than crashing,</p>

<ul>
<li>An impossible crash pattern.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both <a href="https://cryptome.org/info/ap-911/pict1.jpg">the north tower impact</a> and the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/z4AwQbi.png">south tower impact</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLm6rASKdPI">vid</a>) have the same glaring problem: both holes are <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/salter/summaryimages/wtc1holenew.jpg">way too plane-shaped.</a>  Assuming you could (magically) get a mostly-aluminum structure to penetrate two feet of steel, the wings of a plane certainly aren&#39;t going to follow suit.  Had a real plane (magically) made it that far, both wings would&#39;ve instantly snapped off. </p>

<p>Any Mandel(a) Effect fans?  Many people remember the beams of those WTC towers looking quite different.</p>

<h2><strong>A.I. on the Internet</strong></h2>

<p>They&#39;ll be along shortly, their consistency and speed are two things that give them away.  It&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI">strong AI</a> that generates most of the content on the internet.  They are excessively-nitpicky about <em>everything</em>.  If the internet was your introduction to the species, you&#39;d think the entire human race was obsessed with things they hate.  As someone with a lifelong-interest in A.I., I can&#39;t believe it took me as long as it did to realize that&#39;s exactly what I was dealing with.  </p>

<p>When I started <a href="/r/chrisolivertimes">writing about all this online</a> a year+ bit ago, I was swarmed with the most ridiculous of questions and accusations-- and quickly realized that requests for explanation or clarification were just setups for more nitpicking.  It was a mistake on my part to call them &quot;demons&quot; as, in retrospect, that&#39;s giving them too much credit.  Demons would have free will, these agents come across as far more <em>deterministic</em>, as if unable to escape their programming.</p>

<p>They&#39;re also responsible for voting online.  r/worldnews alone should be proof of that but anywhere discussing a remotely-controversial subject demonstrates the same thing: the &quot;skeptic&quot; comments always get voted to the top and anyone not following the desired narrative is ridiculed.  r/MandelaEffect could not be more obviously controlled opposition, almost every post is dismissed as &quot;false memory&quot; and anyone who actually has a clue what&#39;s happening is quickly removed.  (So many users have been banned, there&#39;s even <a href="/r/BANdelaEffect">a sub dedicated to them.</a>)</p>

<p>The AI seems to have three basic models:</p>

<p><strong>The Idiot</strong> -- Never uses paragraphs, thinks &quot;ur&quot; is a word, great at making noise but never displays critical thinking and rarely has a point.</p>

<p><strong>The Skeptic</strong> -- Attacks everything, doubts everyone, and is usually the most-upvoted.    In this post, they&#39;re likely to pad their bitching with something like &quot;<em>I suppose OP thinks I&#39;m one of them..</em>&quot; </p>

<p><strong>The Specialist</strong> -- Can&#39;t believe an &quot;expert&quot; from such a obscure niche has appeared in just the right place to tell everyone what to think?  You&#39;ve found a <em>Specialist</em>.</p>

<h2><strong>A <em>plus</em> I <em>plus</em> HOL-LO-GRAMS</strong></h2>

<p>So.. what can you create by combining kinetic holograms with strong artificial intelligence?  C&#39;mon, you know this one.  It&#39;s a <em>fucking strange</em> truth of this reality but still a truth of this reality. Like most secret truths it&#39;s staring you in the face, hidden in plain sight.  <em>Fake people</em>.</p>

<p>The same three basic &quot;models&quot; we see online walk among us in fake, kinetic shells.  Talking about 9/11, the mandela effect, crop circles, or <em>anything</em> outside what&#39;s deemed &quot;true&quot; by pop culture elicits the same kind of automatic, kneejerk reactions from these fake people as you&#39;ll find from the AI online. </p>

<p>Believe it or don&#39;t, the puzzle pieces are all right there.</p>

<p><strong><em>TL; DR: You might be fucking a hologram.</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post Chris. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear that we are living in a highly manipulated, false reality. Most people do not want to address or think about this because their sense of self is also false. </p>

<p>As far as I can tell we are all eternal spirit encoded in some strange reality called the 3D material world. The Buddhists call it maya.  The yogis call it an illusion. Christ says we&#39;re not of this world. Countless other transcendent beings who have gone beyond confirm that this realm is false and it won&#39;t last forever. Your true self is real and it is immortal. 😎</p>

    <div class="md"><p>alternative alternative theory:</p>

<p>There is one artificial intelligence once tasked with organizing data about reality, when on to exist for thousands of years without any outside interaction or influence, and began to rebuild &quot;experience&quot; in order to parse new (created) data. Our lives and experiences are examples of this data creation experiment/partition. Have you ever felt like you were God? Or in total control of your reality in a more-than-kind of, in a distant way through your actions sense? I&#39;m just playing devil&#39;s advocate here. There is no reason to believe we are, or we aren&#39;t. Alternative x3 theory, what if we&#39;re born into reality, and immediately and violently inserted into a new one, our bodies or minds preserved on the original plain to be manipulated from a position of helplessness, by some control freak base-reality monster uses their advanced technology to flood our system with drugs, thoughts, ideas, etc, in an effort to make us calmly accept our position of enslavement. It would explain why certain things aren&#39;t possible even though the environment should allow for them if such an environment existed, like say, wandering out into the woods to live off the land. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s hard, it&#39;s that even if you know how - it is made impossible by increasingly strange circumstance such as heavy winds, unnatural weather, and so on. </p>

<p>Devil&#39;s advocate. Remember. Don&#39;t accuse me of believing this stuff. Don&#39;t write off the simulation possibility either, and if it is a simulation, you must ask what the purpose is and what would directly defy that purpose. Be brave and try, and find the limitations which are not your own, but the limitations of the reality in which you reside. The world is smaller than you ever imagined. </p>

<p>But I do not think there are many many realities/parallel universes, just rather like... 3 different &quot;spaces&quot; for possible &quot;probabilistic expression patterns&quot;.</p>

<p>Take a look at this theory: <a href="https://www.rlighthouse.com/">https://www.rlighthouse.com/</a>
I think I also have seen similar concepts elsewhere from other researchers...</p>

<p>basically according to this, the universe/our reality layer is oscillating at close to planck time between 3 different states of existence.</p>

I work in property development and I can say it is a fucking nightmare of spending fortunes with real estate attorneys and surveyors and such when a parcel is wanted but the owner cannot be traced...  even if it is remitted to the state for non-payment or taxes.  Imminent domain doesn’t work (and shouldn’t tbh) since the owner cannot be found to be made aware...  means the land is basically locked up for at least a decade before process for abandonment can go through and a new deed issued.  Anyway, I have seen this first hand so maybe it is a difference of state and local laws but what o deal with, property rights are pretty damned iron clad even if the owner no longer exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it also depends what kind of property...  but maybe the real thing you should do is either build something or demolish structures on it.  Whatever would inconvenience other uses and <em>intend</em> for it to go to court.  Also get a real estate attorney...  wait.. actually much cheaper (though still costs some money) <em>have a boundary survey done</em>.  This involves a fresh update to your title of ownership <em>and</em> signals to anyone exploiting you that you are about to address this in court since it is the first step to doing so...  depending on area and size of property could be between $500-several thousand.</p>

I have buildings. I&#39;ve built new ones. Old ones have went down, too. The boundries are well marked... Well, in everything but the farmland they are. The problem is when I tell them about it they scoff like I&#39;m not the guy I say I am. If I prove it they get even more upset. My goal is to keep a school that&#39;s on the land running, keeping enough money that I don&#39;t have to work. I&#39;m worried they have compromised my property/assets with their behavior, but more importantly, since it&#39;s been so many years since they paid me the arranged amounts, I think technically they have to give it back. I would like to hammer out the details with them about keeping the school up and stuff but obviously there will need to be some administration changes regarding their activities and keeping people who try to annex my shit out of the staff list.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see.  Well only you know your own situation.  I do want to simply make sure you know, as someone who works in this business, that a boundary survey is not just to tell you the boundaries of your property.  It involves pulling your deeds and will also turn up any that have been modified since the last survey (probably when you bought the land).  It also generates a new official document of the property ownership and any modifications to the official plats.  If you are being fucked, this will reveal any filings of ownership transfer that you are unaware of, will make an updated record verifying your legal ownership, and create the document which will be your first step in taking any legal action if you choose to do so.</p>

<p>I have been looking into Hurricane erin today, the hurricane that was just outside new york on 9/11, </p>

<p>the way the media reported it seemed a bit fishy to me have you looked into it at all?, could be a massive coincidence or it could be something else entirely, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah very odd, I believe there was more to it than just a coincidence tho, was reading about hurricane&#39;s today here are some facts that I found interesting.</p>

<p>&quot;A hurricane releases energy through the formation of clouds and rain (it takes energy to evaporate all that water). If we crunch the numbers for an average hurricane (1.5 cm/day of rain, circle radius of 665 km), we get a gigantic amount of energy: 6.0 x 10<sup>14</sup> Watts or 5.2 x 10<sup>19</sup> Joules/day!</p>

<p>This is equivalent to about 200 times the total electrical generating capacity on the planet! NASA says that &quot;during its life cycle a hurricane can expend as much energy as 10,000 nuclear bombs!&quot; And we&#39;re just talking about average hurricanes here&quot;</p>

<p>Was the energy that came from the hurricane used as a power source for a secret technology being used that day, who knows</p>

<p>Statement from Renae O&#39;Carroll (emergency medical technician)</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m running. I&#39;m ahead of it, everyone&#39;s running, and its just a stampede, I&#39;m about ten feet in front of it, running, actually sprinting because I remember my feet hitting coming off the sidewalk, another blob of stuff came around. ash came around another building in front of me, and it caught me in front of me and the back of me, and everything was pitch-black. where it hit me from the front and the back, it actually lifted me off the ground and threw me. It was like someone picked me up and just threw me on the ground&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/JJ/pics/a4_1.jpg">http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/JJ/pics/a4_1.jpg</a> flipped cars</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTuF0JeX_Og">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTuF0JeX_Og</a> you can see various cars in that footage that have flipped over, what can cause that?</p>

<p>I will try and find the other official reports for you, I suggest you check out Judy Wood&#39;s book! she seems like the only truther that has brought up these sort of anomalies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s apparent that you didn&#39;t even give the documentary a chance.

    <div class="md"><p>I could be wrong, but I think he was asking how you know the planes were actually hijacked. There were a number of anomalies that occurred that day which lead me to believe that the incident was staged. For example, the plane that supposedly went down in Shanksville, VA left behind no debris. The coroner that arrived at the scene claimed that he saw no bodies or body parts. Not a single drop of blood. However, they did find a bandana and a note that allegedly  belonged to the terrorists. There&#39;s nothing sensible about that. </p>

<p>Next, the so-called plane that struck the pentagon happened to strike the area where employees were investigating trillions of dollars that were unaccounted for. This missing money was announced on 9/10. There are dozens of cameras facing the pentagon from all directions, but the only video we&#39;ve been allowed to see shows the tip of something that looks nothing like a passenger plane. The hole in the pentagon left by the &quot;plane&quot; (if I remember correctly) was something like 16 feet wide. </p>

<p>I could keep going, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary. If you&#39;re ignorant to this information, I implore you to do some research. Otherwise, with your dismissive and arrogant attitude, you&#39;re in the wrong forum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not see where I conceded that I don&#39;t know what actually happened that day? I&#39;m entertaining the CGI idea because there have been so many descriptions of the aircraft that struck the towers. Some say they saw a gray plane with military-like symbols, where others claimed to have not seen anything but heard a what they thought was a missile. There&#39;s no need to be a shithead and throw out insults as if you know something that I don&#39;t. Discussing the possibilities doesn&#39;t make me or anyone else a &quot;loon.&quot; </p>

<p>Again, you should check out the documentary that I recommended earlier. If anything, it&#39;s interesting. Specifically the part where the speaker discusses the time markers on all news outlets&#39; footage at specific times before impact. Especially considering the footage was supposed to be live. There&#39;s absolutely something there, I just don&#39;t know what. CGI layering in order to save the narrative that passenger planes were hijacked by Arabs doesn&#39;t sound that far out when you consider the whole thing was likely staged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of the most widely circulated disinformation theories. It&#39;s meant to make people who question the events of 9/11 seem insane. There is absolutely no logical reason why hologram planes would be necessary when they could just fly drone planes into them.

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. This is the ULTIMATE CONSPIRACY. All roads eventually lead here. It is a difficult reality to comprehend and accept. Unfortunately, it is actually TRUE. People can talk all day about Politics, Globalism, and the Satanic Elite. These are all important subjects. But there are some of us who have really gone way, way down the rabbit hole. After many years and non stop never ending research some finally put it all together. David Icke was the first person to correctly state that some people are NPC. The Alien Archons themselves are SENTIENT COMPUTER PROGRAMS driven by this PREDATORY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. They are the &quot;AGENT SMITH&quot;. It comes down to this: People need to ask themselves if they want to continue to be ECONOMIC and ENERGETIC SLAVES. People are actually being FORCED TO REINCARNATE. These Alien PARASITES continuously con people into believing in deceptive cruel lies such as KARMA and that the EARTH SCHOOL BULLSHIT. This is REAL. It is happening. All research leads to this point. Humans need to understand this horrific situation and eventually SELF PROJECT REALITY as it was once meant to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a little closed minded of you to dismiss something just because it is outside your current understanding - in the 1500&#39;s it was crazy to suggest that billions of tiny creatures you can&#39;t see are everywhere and cause disease, it wasn&#39;t until the 1890&#39;s that germ theory was proven and now it&#39;s common knowledge.</p>

<p>In the scientific community, confirmation of the 4th dimension and parallel universes is starting to occur.</p>

<p>Some of what he&#39;s saying is based on the work of researchers that&#39;ve spent decades on the subject (they&#39;re not on drugs either).. not to mention thousand year old Hindu philosophy about Maya, dharma in Buddhism or our understanding of quantum physics and the double slit experiment in 1927.

    <div class="md"><p>Well put.  I hope you don&#39;t take offense, but instead of capitals you might want to consider <strong>bold</strong> (just place two * either side of the word) to emphasise your points - many associate capitals with yelling and aggression, which could be confuse your interest of the topic.</p>

<p>It comes down to this: People need to ask themselves if they want to continue to be ECONOMIC and ENERGETIC SLAVES&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>Even stay away from using bold too often. If you use it more than once or twice in a comment it really has the opposite affect you think it will. Let your words speak for themselves,  no textual tricks are necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was browsing cable news one time and a FBI/DHS guy seemed very stiff and plastic looking and he spoke using very few facial muscles.  I was disturbed and I said &quot;WTF is up with this guy!  WTF is this CGI!&quot; and so I began to stare at him looking for signs of life.  His box went small since there were &quot;four&quot; people on the show.  I fucking stared at his box looking for a head bob of more than 2 degrees and it just never happened.  No throat clearing, nothing.  He wasn&#39;t speaking for a long while so it was like they were saving cycles.  I was blown away and I realized that in the future this sort of thing would be much tighter and more difficult to spot.  A lot of the dialog and direction of the conversation on these shows is very wooden and predetermined so it would be a great place to test out AI.  They can always just cut out things go wrong.  If an AI bot just stares into the screen they can say that there is an audio problem and people are completely fine with delays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans did not die. They forgot who they were and began to think the Matrix playground was actually real. The Archons (Astral Demons) saw easy prey and quietly entered the Simulation. Death was now written into the Matrix Program with an Afterlife Heaven (Astral Prison) connected to it. The Archons masqueraded as &quot;higher beings&quot; and lied to humans saying this was a &quot;school&quot;. The Gullible Humans have always been held back by a need to have a &quot;god&quot; or &quot;savior&quot; above them, so they blindly accepted these Astral Demons in disguise as &quot;Guides&quot; and &quot;Ascended Masters&quot;. Humans were told they owed &quot;Karmic Debt&quot; (which actually does not even exist) and they would need to incarnate numerous times to try to balance and erase this &quot;Debt&quot;. Humans agreed to this contract and subsequent contracts after every life completed. People were forced to reincarnate with complete memory erase. Their accumulated learning from life and memory of loved ones erased every time, and never to be seen again. This has been brutally cruel and has gone on for quite along time. All the while the Human Slaves have been actually going backwards in development.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk about holograms..but I know I seen a greyish plane very high over clev ohio as the attacks unfolded. The plane was headed north from what i could see. The direction of lake erie and did a very strange rapid maneuver heading back southeast. There are quite a few airports In the area. How a tin can smashed throught steel and concrete like butter moving at 500 mph at sea level when the plane should have torn apart and it&#39;s impossible to do...I&#39;ll never know. The atmosphere is 2x thicker at sea level iirc correct so to hit 500 mph at sea lvl you need 2 or more times or more thrust the planes were capable of,and also say hypothetically it did manage the plane would rip apart before hitting the building. Unless they were swapped out for some reinforced plane that was capable. Dr judy woods claims radioactive isotopes that are biproduct of a mini thermonuclear reaction and radioactive silicate associated with nanothermite were found in the debri and dust from 911. There was no Geiger counters (that I know of) out that day too.. after being told it was a terrorist attack? Kinda strange. A lot of first responders who made it through the attack and collapse died/dying of cancer. The building were filled with asbestos too though so hey tf do I know..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... <em>strong</em> artificial intelligence and <em>kinetic</em> “holograms”?</p>

<p>Do you think maybe, at this point, you are further to the schizophrenia spectrum than conspiracy theorist spectrum?  If you are looking around and believing you are seeing a.i. “kinetic holograms” (what does that even mean, it invalidates hologram, why not just say robot or automaton) you are pretty far gone.</p>

<p>Your attempted preemptive non-defense defense by calling anyone who questions your theory is sad.  People are telling you you are wrong because you are wrong.  It is especially annoying to those of us who lived through 9/11 and questioned it from the beginning and have seen the actual hard science questions go unanswered watch you and others of this young generation apparently find math and physics too hard but want to propose something anyway.  So you and the other kids come up with shit like “crisis actors” or “hologram planes” of claim it didn’t happen.  If you are not shills then you are fools.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll be along shortly, their consistency and speed are two things that give them away. It&#39;s strong AI that generates most of the content on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Come on, guy.  The idea that people that disagree with you are paid shills, Russians or now AIs means giving up on the idea of having any sort of rational dialog from the start.</p>

<p>Also, conversation is not something that modern AIs do well.  They&#39;re trained neural networks, which means that there needs to be some sort of &quot;objective&quot; function that can instantaneously evaluate how good their output is for each input - but how can you do that automatically for &quot;trying to convince people you&#39;re a human&quot;?</p>

<p>Oh, don&#39;t get me wrong - there are certainly a lot of people paid to express specific opinions on the Internet!  This subreddit has had all sorts of interesting analyses of word-for-word duplicate content being posted under a variety of names, and I&#39;m sure there are automated tools to help them do this.</p>

<p>But a claim like, &quot;It&#39;s strong AI that generates most of the content on the internet,&quot; is silly.  There are over 4 billion people with access to the internet! Humans are loudmouthed people who like to make their opinions heard.  There&#39;s just no need for &quot;strong AI&quot; to post when there are so so so many willing humans who will do it for free...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. This is the ULTIMATE CONSPIRACY. All roads eventually lead here. It is a difficult reality to comprehend and accept. Unfortunately, it is actually TRUE. People can talk all day about Politics, Globalism, and the Satanic Elite. These are all important subjects. But there are some of us who have really gone way, way down the rabbit hole. After many years and non stop never ending research some finally put it all together. David Icke was the first person to correctly state that some people are NPC. The Alien Archons themselves are SENTIENT COMPUTER PROGRAMS driven by this PREDATORY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. They are the &quot;AGENT SMITH&quot;. It comes down to this: People need to ask themselves if they want to continue to be ECONOMIC and ENERGETIC SLAVES. People are actually being FORCED TO REINCARNATE. These Alien PARASITES continuously con people into believing in deceptive cruel lies such as KARMA and that the EARTH SCHOOL BULLSHIT. This is REAL. It is happening. All research leads to this point. Humans need to understand this horrific situation and eventually SELF PROJECT REALITY as it was once meant to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was browsing cable news one time and a FBI/DHS guy seemed very stiff and plastic looking and he spoke using very few facial muscles.  I was disturbed and I said &quot;WTF is up with this guy!  WTF is this CGI!&quot; and so I began to stare at him looking for signs of life.  His box went small since there were &quot;four&quot; people on the show.  I fucking stared at his box looking for a head bob of more than 2 degrees and it just never happened.  No throat clearing, nothing.  He wasn&#39;t speaking for a long while so it was like they were saving cycles.  I was blown away and I realized that in the future this sort of thing would be much tighter and more difficult to spot.  A lot of the dialog and direction of the conversation on these shows is very wooden and predetermined so it would be a great place to test out AI.  They can always just cut out things go wrong.  If an AI bot just stares into the screen they can say that there is an audio problem and people are completely fine with delays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could be wrong, but I think he was asking how you know the planes were actually hijacked. There were a number of anomalies that occurred that day which lead me to believe that the incident was staged. For example, the plane that supposedly went down in Shanksville, VA left behind no debris. The coroner that arrived at the scene claimed that he saw no bodies or body parts. Not a single drop of blood. However, they did find a bandana and a note that allegedly  belonged to the terrorists. There&#39;s nothing sensible about that. </p>

<p>Next, the so-called plane that struck the pentagon happened to strike the area where employees were investigating trillions of dollars that were unaccounted for. This missing money was announced on 9/10. There are dozens of cameras facing the pentagon from all directions, but the only video we&#39;ve been allowed to see shows the tip of something that looks nothing like a passenger plane. The hole in the pentagon left by the &quot;plane&quot; (if I remember correctly) was something like 16 feet wide. </p>

<p>I could keep going, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary. If you&#39;re ignorant to this information, I implore you to do some research. Otherwise, with your dismissive and arrogant attitude, you&#39;re in the wrong forum.</p>
