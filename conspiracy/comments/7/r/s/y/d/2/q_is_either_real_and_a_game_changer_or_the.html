       Q began posting in October about the US military planning for the past 3 years and now executing a counter coup against the Globalist Oligarch's who have infiltrated our government.  Q supports many beliefs about our world previously referred to as conspiracy territory.  If Q is real our societies accepted view of our world is going to change drastically.   Better still if Q is real, then the world wide network of bad guys is being destroyed.  The Q counter Coup is called the calm b4 the storm and its bigger than anyone party or candidate since the Globalists are of every political group.  The proof that Q is real has been piling up and is considerable at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a Daily Coin Writer giving his thoughts on Q after reading some of his posts:
      </p>
      <p>
       ttps://thedailycoin.org/2017/12/14/trump-really-draining-swamp/
      </p>
      <p>
       We are so used to Washington being corrupt and seeming to be able to do nothing about real problems.  What if this is because the government is no longer trying to fix problems but serving the globalist agenda to destroy America?  And what if the military is taking them out?
      </p>
      <p>
       So here is a summary of links that show evidence, though not conclusive, that there really is a counter- coup called CBTS &amp; that Q is the approved publicist for the administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tweets that confirm Q

       35 news events that appear to confirm that we are at war with the globalists and fit with Q's narrative and at times that he seems to predict in advance of them happening:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading Q and the answers that have been found to his questions is the only way to get a real opinion of Q. Reading these summaries only can give you an opinion about if it might be true. Reading him is the most convincing evidence itself. he is impressive to say the least. Enlightening, complex, comprehensive. Military and Intell retirees all confirm: Q is real.

       Q is an intelligence agency psy op.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's positive PR for trump and sessions, it's a large scale distraction that makes conspiracy theorists think that somebody is "handling things and taking down the deep state", so we all just watch from the sidelines and sit on our asses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Q psyop provides false hope for people, and it merges the truth movement with support for trump and the conservative side of the paradigm.

       Nope!  Where is your proof?  What are u proposing there is to do about Globalists that learning about them through Q prevents us from doing?
       <br/>
       You do not equip people with info about the problem and stir them up if you cant deliver on the promise.  That would backfire pretty hard. They are raising expectations and we will hate them if there is nothing to show for it.  That could result in Trump not getting re-elected.  If no Q we woudl all just be content with a little.

       Ok, so you made a post asking people what they thought of Q.

      <p>
       I gave my analysis (which is shared by many users here). Then you tell me no I'm wrong and where's my proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about where is the proof that this guy has predicted ANYTHINGS yet? The fact that he's obsessed with getting us to trust sessions and trump is garbage and that alone made me skeptical of him.

       Did u miss this one?  &gt; Here's a list of times trump and Q seemed to be collaborating on his and DJTJR twitter posts. This post is about a month out of date and there are more examples that have happened since then. Also both the FBI and DOD have made twitter posts that seem to collaborate with Q.

       Here's one thing he predicted pretty well:  He told us there would be a false flag.  Referred to it as fireworks.  Turned out to be a failed bombing attempt in New York that did look a bit like fireworks.  He also mentioned BDT which is the abbreviation for the bombers nation of origins currency, which had just announced it would be changing to Cryptocurrency.  How did he know about the bombing coming, that the bomber would be Bangledeshi and that the bomb would fail?
       <br/>
       They are not going to come right out and verify this guy.  It would cause a panic, which is the thing they claim to be concerned about.  What do they call it in PR -a soft reveal?  Give people time to adjust.

       It's ok, we can defeat and expose the New World Order without help from political demagogues and anonymous users that only serve to distract us. We just need to unite under similar ideals. Being divided on Q and Trump is what they want.

       This is still, after a year, the only argument pro trump cheerleaders like yourself seem to parrot out there in his defense. He didn't single handedly kill the trans pacific partnership dude, but it sure did boost his anti establishment image.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about some of THESE pro establishment moves he has made. Can you explain any of these?

       Here are a few concerns I have with the trump presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was financially bailed out by Wilbur Ross, A Rothschild consigliere in 1990, after his failing Taj Mahal project.
When questioned why he helped him, Ross said; "the trump name is still very much a future asset for us"...

       How is his Rothschild connection anti establishment in the slightest? Aren't the Rothschilds the evil English banking dynasty?

       Also, trump made Ross a cabinet position. Why was this a good move?

       After singing the harms of Wall Street and corrupt bankers, he makes several Goldman Sachs and wealthy billionaires his cabinet members. The point is, he lied to you, turned around, and "got the band back together" so to speak, appointing many of the former bush era cronies in positions of power. Why is this good for us ? Do you trust a Goldman Sachs cabinet? Explain.

       Why did trump meet in private, and visited the home of known globalist Henry Kissinger? These first 3 alone are fucking incriminating as shit and, reveal to me, a very establishment friendly puppet. Can you explain this? Are you OK with this and why?

       Trump often discussed his plan to defeat the "terrorism boogeyman" in ISIS, and often cites his willingness to, as he put it, "bomb the shit out of them and take the oil". Why is he pushing the fake terrorism boogey man to accelerate more illegal war?
Also, why after claiming terrorism was bad, and that Saudi Arabia was a known funder of terrorism (and potential 9/11 involvement), why did he do a multi million dollar arms deal with Them?

       You would agree that the CIA is a globalist and evil intelligence agency, correct? Why Is trump saying that the CIA is "great" and "terrific"? Why did he say that he was behind them "1000%"?

       Why was his Bombing of Syria a strategic move for the betterment of US citizens? Was it not allowed to occur under false pretenses?
Also, after criticizing Obama's policies, how are the continued drone strikes helping make America great again?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally (I will be editing more, stay tuned), also after criticizing Obama and his waste of taxpayer money to fund vacations and golf trips, is trump already golfing almost every weekend and wasting over $400,000 dollars A DAY for security at the Trump Tower? How are these acceptable to you? Why are you willing them slide.

       So the Calm Before The Storm is made up of bipartisan members and 18 DOD generals.  If you want to see them there is a video in my post about trumps tweets farther up in my comments in this post.  Trump is at a photo op in Wh and he is with 18 generals and a few civies and all their wives.  He says to the press, "Do you now what this represents?"  He goes on to say: "the Calm B4 the Storm".  Asked what that is he says "you'll see" It was posted on twitter and  Potus retweeted it.  Watch the video and here how awed his voice is, then watch his face after the press asks him what he means. Is he suddenly aware he said too much or is he about to cry?  You have to see it.

       So among the CBTS team are a group of people who have flipped on the globalist agenda.  Most of our government and elites have had some awareness or contact with them though not as extensive as those who generally become POTUS.  Just like in organized crime the greatest asset to taking out an organization are those who turn against the organization who have insider knowledge but are now committed to taking them out.  This is achievable because many good people have been forced to do bad things in our gov.  Only 10 people know the whole plan.  These people who have flipped will be essential to convincing the American people that Trump is not taking out political enemies to consolidate his power in a coup.

       Saudi Weapons deal came after SA changed heirs to the thrown and arrested the previous heir and 19 other princes who were aligned with the globalists and controlling Us and British politicians.   The old king resigned soon after.

       If you had read Q you would have known both of these facts.

      <p>
       For the first 10 months of Trump's presidency he had to play along to stay alive( CIA comments, and many other confusing signs happened during that time.  Q has told us that the white house and AF1 were booby trapped to kill on command by the globalists henchmen, the CIA.  So Trump did not use AF1 but uses his own jet which has been painted to look like AF1.  Maralago is a safe fortress for Trump to retreat to and so is AF1.  5 previous assassination attempts/ have been connected to the globalists of presidents alone over our history.  Congressmen have also been killed.  So now that hte white hosue has been cleared of hidden booby traps and Trumps plans and traps for them are all set in motion we can now look at what he is doing.  Around 6000 arrests of pedophiles, arrests for MS13 the satanic gang used by politicos and CIA to commit crimes have been arrested in mass numbers.  83% increase over Obama years. Number 2 guy on East Coast arrested in Connecticutt last week.   Those CIA poppy fields that earns the CIA 500,000 a year in drug income have been bombed and the crops destroyed.

CBTS is where Jerome Corsi is and where the rational people seem to be. The former boards mentioned are full of Clowns that clown people into labelling themselves a pedo...

       All the Q people on r/calmbeforethestorm post like this.  r/cbts_stream can be cool too, but has had some problems.  I think any sub that has a lot of Trump people you pay a price for criticizing Trump.  They really don't like that.

       We are working together and so we act more professional.  Also, we finally have reason to hope as a result of reading Q.  The world is going to be sooo much better in a few years.  Imagine the federal banks all gone!  What happens to the National Debt if it was accrued through blackmail, assassination, extortion and corruption of every imaginable sort.  That money was never given to us but we pay interest on it as if it was. Our national Debt is currently sitting at 105% of our national GDP annually.  I've started looking at how big a nations debt is and considering how free they are to act against the federal bank masters relates to how big that number is.  But it's not a full proof system.

       I grew up right in the belly of the beast, in London. I always knew there was something wrong and so studied my country´s history. Then I studied the language, and the meaning of the words we use in English, then studied all about the power of the man over the person. You would be shocked at what I´ve learned over the years. Do you know about the act of parliament passed in 1666? Right as the Great Fire Of London started in Pudding Lane, Parliament passed a law that declared every man, woman and child dead and ordered all property in the country be moved into a government controlled trust. That was the beginning of the deception that we face today. Slavery continues with the birth certificate. I have prayed for this coming storm and have felt it brewing for a very long time, now. Debt isn´t real, not anymore, not since Trump destroyed the Rothschild cartel.

       It is said that Jacob was involved in that, although it is only speculation. Jacob hasn´t been seen in public since though and they only released 3 of 4 names. What do you think? Also, look at Lynn de Rothschild on Twitter, her erratic behaviour. Q released a list of every Rothschild controlled central bank. I believe that every country will be given the opportunity to create their own national currency, a world wide agreement. The people will be free of debt. All debt.

       I think that something has happened but I don't know what. Aggravating. In the past I believed if I scoured the alt news and MSM I would have enough clues to figure it out and get at least a fuzzy picture of the truth. That is gone now. I never really got just how evil the real power behind everything is. So my reasoning was always completely wrong. I assumed they wanted to squeeze us financially not bankrupt the whole country.

       Speaking of which did u see there are new Q posts. They dropped between 2 and 3 east coast time.  He talks about the memo and that there will be no free passes. He predicts the investigation will move back under sessions control if I understand him correctly. Issues a threat to Jack Dorsey and s bunch if others by initials also. Have to figure out who they all could be. Q says to them: "do u know we know?  Do u know we hear all. Do u know we see all"  &amp; "Fear the storm" and "no one gets a free pass". Wow Q embodying an avenging angel. 
He calls out @jack (Jack Dorsey) and then Initials are MZ, (mark Zuckerberg facebook), ES(Eric Schmidt google), then JB (Jeff Bezos) So far 3 tech ceo's maybe all the rest will be too. Here's the others that I don't know:  EM(Elon Musk) SH?? Then MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holy %#&amp;$ He just called out the most wealthy Tech captains and MSM chiefs and told them no deals for any of them.  God I hate to rejoice but oh let it be true that our media could be free of censorship. How can anyone not live this mission.

       JB = Jeff Bezos, EM = Elon Musk, MZ = Mark Zuckerberg, ES = Eric Schmidt and SH is the CEO of Reddit. Can justice really be served?? This is biblical, books will be studied about this for hundreds of years and we are a part of it!

       This post proves that all these race wars (BLM) and class wars (antifa) are nothing more than nonsense and we need to see that! People need to wake up to the manipulation we are suffering, all this division we face is manufactured so that the people are not united. The government fear a united people, and they should.

       It's like OP didn't even glance at what you wrote. You listed all sorts of things Trump has done that show he's part of the establishment, even though the list could be 20x longer, and he just goes "Well, Trump said Calm before the storm, that's code speak!"

       I did address them.  I responded to several of the specific statements. Do you see there are over 100 comments on here?  Do you get how much time it takes to respond to all this?  For you to assume and misrepresent what happen I hope means you just missed my comments rather than trying to misdirect people.  If you oppose the views presented and have to make stuff up to counter it then that says something.

       There were two different weapons deals.  If you go aback and look at it Trump made an earlier trip to SA not long after he took office.  On that trip he and the Saudi royals danced a sword dance together.  This is what Saudi's dance b4 going to war. No previous president on a visit has danced this with them. This was the beginning of the plan to take out the globalist princes and replace the crown prince with a reformer.  Trump made and alliance with them back then but a new alliance that protects them and they agree to give up their control of our American politicians/  From Bush on down they have had immense control over many American politicians including every president since Bush1.

       The poppy fields used to belong to the RC´s. In one Q post he said
      </p>
      <p>
       [R] - NO
Bombs away
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this made reference to the refineries that the RC´s built in afghan, right next to the poppy fields. They used to ship opium to Europe and refine it here but since the 2003 invasion, the RC´s built refineries right there and shipped the refined product out instead. This is a huge reason for the opioid epidemic as the big pharma first get patients hooked on Oxi and when their supply is cut off the patients turn to heroin to compensate. Trump bombing the refineries is also the fight against the opioid epidemic.

       You need to look at what he is doing now.  I do not support his declaring bankruptcy by leveraging his companies so all costs get written off in bankruptcy.  It's immoral, not smart.  It's easy to see the way to break the law to your own advantage not brilliant.  If he has had to resort to this to remain a wealthy man then how good of a business man is he? Unless he is wealthier than we think which is what his fanboys think.  I do not know.  Trump is not the issue its what he is doing now about those who tried to destroy our country and raided it like their own personal piggy bank.

       I think it's a less a case of him being a Russian agent and more that he was in bed, in a business sense, with some really shady Russian oligarchs looking to launder their ill gotten gains into safe assets in the West.

       Its not going to happen.  Its been 14 months looking into this story and it just keeps back firing on the dems. If you ocnt know how then you need to watch different news.

       Mueller is trumps man.  Mueller was the delivery guy who accompanied the uranium to Russia.  Trump and Mueller met the night before Trump was sworn in.  They claimed he was being considered for head of a 3 letter agency but Mueller had already exhausted the terms allowed to run that agency.  So what was the meeting really about.  Many people who are not bad but took orders from bad people and did bad things have been offered deals to flip on the globalists controlled politicians at the top.  Is Mueller one of those people?  In exchange for being let off the hook for his participation in Uranium1 is he running a fair investigation into election tampering and colluding with Russians.  A lot is going to come out.  This memo that is to be released within the next two weeks is just the beginning.  Clinton is nothing if not thorough and she had that election rigged 10 ways to Sunday.  The Military unrigged the voting machines on election night. They went to Obama and told him if he declared the election fraudulent they would take Clinton by force but that she would never be president.  He called Clinton and told her to concede.  Instead she and her cabal have launched this effort to invalidate the outcome of the election and the Russia collusion was part of that effort.  You will see her in a jail cell in the not to distant future.  This all from Q.

       See what happens when we step out of the idea that we know what is real in our world.  Its very threatening.  It is the storm.  Feel that wind blow.
       <br/>
       Whats crazy is thinking that we know what is really going on in our world. We have a press with a seemingly unlimited capacity to lie to us every single day but we maintain the idea that we will be able to read between the lies and have s reasonable idea of what is real.

       So Isis numbers have gone from 40,000 to 1,000 in 1 year.  During the campaign Trump said he would finish them in a year.  The globalist opposition candidates rebutted that this would take 5 years.  If he is under their thumb then why did he kill Isis.  The bombing of Syria over the past year has taken out Isis. Troops remain to secure Syria.  If he is planning to continue the war in the middle east then where are the drums of war we always see for years before we commit to a bigger war?  There are other explanations for what you are seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump played along until the plan was set and the trap was sprung. The Asia trip was when China finally committed to taking out the Globalists there and partnering in checkmating North Korea nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korean missiles are in the hands of the rogue CIA who were conceived of by the Rothschilds and has always exceeded its mandate and budget through additional funding/orders by the Rothschlds. Ask yourself how they suddenly have the tech to launch a viable Nuke at the US, when we were told just last year that tech would take 5 years for them to get.  Those Nukes hold all of the citizens of the world hostage unless the leaders of each govm't does what they are told.  NoKo had viable nuke missiles for years under the control of the CIA.  The failed launches were theatre.  When Trump talks to Noko he is talking to the Rogue CIA who world for the Rothschilds. This is why Asia was so happy to see Trump.  He wants to fight the CIA who has been controlling that region through the threat of North Korean nukes, subs and army since the old dictator died, maybe longer. This is what Q has said is happening.
       <br/>
       CBTS is very real.  there is no other explanation when you really look at all the evidence.  They can not come out and declare it yet.  the globalists still have power and all of us as its hostages. there is so much more than I can put in any post.

       read my comments on this post.  I am here to offer what proof their is that Q is real and I have a lot to post.  I can not prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt because  they are only putting out a soft reveal not a strong confirmation to keep from panicking people. But what i have collected is substantial.

       CDAN is great.  I love reading the comments over there.  I'm not gonna take their word on Q.  I don't have a belief either way in regards to LARP but regardless Q is getting people to think and focus on some worthy people/areas.  Could very well be PR but I;m ok with that if it means more crimes and criminals are exposed.

       People are being targets of a PR strategy to maintain their support for Trump that can involve the president. just remember that we were targeted before by a number of fake accounts and news during the presidential campaigning.
       <br/>
       at this point they have a good profile of us and know that people here are prone to fall from confirmatory bias and that if they compromise enough people here they can bury any divergent narrative that shows up.
       <br/>
       Do not forget that this community was instrumental in his victory and that, at this point, it congregates a BIG and VOCAL part of his support base.

       That´s an incredibly ignorant view on things, you are just dismissing all the evidence? It would be an incredibly stupid stunt to pull if Q was a LARP, don´t you think? I mean, it really wouldn´t take long for people to realise the con if there was one but again, you are just dismissing all the evidence? Where are all the crooks, then? Why is Twatter so quiet? Why are they not crying that Trump is racist for making government close down? Why did all the CEO´s around the world just suddenly up and resign? You should try to see it as the bigger picture.

       I've been loosely following him from the begining. There were so many things he got right but could have been coincidences, especially considering his style that gives plausible deniability, but they kept on happening. The coincidences kept piling up.

       An obvious larp, but the question is why. Just attention seeking, or something more?  The question format is meant to draw people in, and it's a good psy op trick. I just don't see what difference it makes to draw in a few thousand people who don't matter in the end anyway.

       To counter the MSM message and do a soft reveal of the counter coup so that people have an alternative explanation than the one the MSM will give if anyone in politics is arrested.  There are some 2500 or more sealed indictments on the national pacer system.  There are going to be a large number of arrests at some point here.

       One of Q's early posts state that there will be large number of arrests and that they are concerned about how the MSM will portray that to the normies.  The Globalists have a very well funded and large propaganda machine in addition to our MSM and they have paid rioters many times in an attempt to create civil unrest.  Innocents have been injured in those riots.  This is the reason Q posts.  The counter coup will be scary, like a bad storm, at some point.  They want a remnant of people who can provide an alternate explanation to the MSM lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So at least 13,000 individual users on Reddit who have bothered to sign up for a Q related sub.  Many users on other Social Media are also believers.  So If a similar number were on facebook groups, instagram, 4chan, 8chan, Twitter and that other big one.  That is an average of more than 75,000 people who are passionate enough to be involved in a sub.  Now if we imagine that they have each told just 5 people enough about Q to get he basics of it that is 400,000 people.  Is that more than 1% percent of the US population.  That should be sufficient to spread the word quickly when arrests start happening that these people are bad actors who should be arrested.

       Also, not every subscriber is actually a person and when you refer to multiple social media groups it seems you are assuming each person discusses things on only one instead of where it is more likely many of those users are also member of the various other groups so it’s not as many unique people as you seem to suggest.

       True, but I accounted for only 13,000 on reddit rather than adding the total of the 3 different subs.  I also kept to 13,000 although other platforms like Facebook might have many more users.  I also did not count Voat at all.  If anything I undersold the number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to look at the size of the community is two days ago they were able to keep # trending all day on Twitter.  It was 5 different hashtags picked in advance and 1 or more were trending form like 7 am till 9 pm when twitter crashed.

       have you heard that there are an unprecedented number of sealed indictments in the pacer system nationwide?  There are like 9400 sealed records and its unknown how many of them are indictments and how many are other hearing related to those indictments.  In a  normal year the number of sealed indictments are around 250.  A few  of them have unsealed and one was for the president of a company that transported Uranaium in the Uranaium 1 investigation and some others were for sex traffickers.  There are I imagine at least 2000 more.  Sealed indictments are used for organized crime group like the Clinton cabal/globalist network where there are a large number of defendants and they don't want other members of the group fleeing when one is indicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these indictments were found when Q talked about arrests.  More were found when trump changed his location code while tweeting when he was on the Asia trip.  When Pacer was searched for indictments in the towns his location was set to they discovered large numbers of indictments and eventually someone searched the nation.
       <br/>
       Q has listed people who will be arrested. Gitmo has been reorganized to add more rooms for high level detainees and secure listening rooms for phone calls by inmates.  They increased the capacity for high level detainees from 750 to 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the people that have been named as targets are all the Clinton cabal, McCain, Soros, and the Rothschilds.  There will be other Senators and Congressmen.  The less guilty were allowed to resign but 1/3rd of our government will be removed when it is all done.  He has also said the Pope is a procurer of children for the Rothschilds and other globalists but whether he would end up in an American jail or not I can not being to know.  These people will be tried by military tribunal like the Nazi's were at Nuremberg. They will be named as enemy combatants.  What happened in Saudi Arabia will happen here, Europe and Asia.

       There are 10x's the normal annual number of sealed indictments listed on the national court records system.  This is a public service website that lists every indictment in the country.  There are the 5 different investigations going on the Clinton's.  The Gitmo renovations are also factual and can be found in the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are the airport shutdowns and planes turning around.  There were like 5 days over a 10 day period where there were multiple airports shutdown for multiple reasons.  On one day there were 5 in the US and 5 in Russia.  Another day there were 7 in the US.  None of them were weather related.  Often the shutdown was especially related to international flight terminal.  During the same time period, there were about 6 planes that turned around mid-flight, all of them were international flights.  Multiple reasons were given for these turn arounds.  One flight made everyone sign non disclosure agreements b4 leaving the plane.  This all in the regular press.  During this time period, there were 3 American private aircraft crashes of planes traveling to other countries. The passengers were Ceo's and their families. Q was posting about bad guys trying to flee the country because of Trump's executive order which has a very wide scope for who it applies to.  If you have not read that EO yet, it talks about seizing the assets of any international or national person in government, or business in the US who has committed human rights violations.  Asset seizures often takes place before arrests.  13 names of international criminals were named in the EO.  6 of them have known ties to the Clinton's. 1 is a Pakistani Dr who was arrested for organ trafficking and kidnapping in Pakistan.  Another 39 names have been added to the EO but have not been publicized.  If that EO is not meant to cover American politicians and Corporations then the EO would not specifically say it can apply to those people Both before and after that EO came out there was a shake up with a large number of CEO's stepping down from corporations in America. 
There are also the rumors from the George Webb type reporters that say there are several members of Congresses names in those sealed indictments. Some for sex trafficking/ child rape and one for cocaine trafficking.
       <br/>
       Oh and hen there is athe rashof moon boots on 3 members of congress.  Both Clinotn's and McCains appeared after they were mia for a day or more. Clinton started wearing hers the second day of her supposed European leg of her book tour which ended after day 3 after she went missing on day 2.  Clinton wore her's for at least 8 weeks and has not been seen in public without it for like 11 weeks now.  She claimed she broke a toe which is a 4-6 weeks injury. Mccain was wearing his for a torn Achilles but 3 weeks into wearing it he was pictured wearing it on the opposite leg.  Now a 3rd congress men has a moon boot on and no explanation for hers.  Do these boots cover up ankle security bracelets.  A photo of Abedin might show the outline of an anklet under her pants leg.
Then check the twitter for like 7-8 politicians who all stopped commenting on twitter about the 19th.  After like 2-3 weeks of nothing from Clinton hers suddenly came back to life but only to make canned type of tweets that were likely scheduled months earlier for the book release of a book etc.  None of these politician's have commented on the budget gov shutdown, the memo or even sent out a happy new years/Christmas tweet. Then there are the massive number of congressmen retiring or resigning 30 Republicans and maybe 15 democrats.  When has that happened before.
       <br/>
       And the 6000 sex traffickers and 1000's of gang members who were arrested will likely result in someone rolling on the elites.
       <br/>
       Off the top of my head this is all that came to mind.

       Unless I'm mistaken, they don't switch your ankle bracelet between legs so if McCain had it on a different leg it would have been visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress.  What is it you are trying to say?  Are you trying to say that McCain is wearing an ankle bracelet and the prediction is he will be arrested(or already is if he's wearing a bracelet)?  Or is McCain and the ankle bracelet speculation?  If it is speculation, then what exactly is the prediction?  Not including speculation, just the actual prediction itself.

       Q stated during the first few weeks of posting the McCain was a target of the investigation.  He talked about McCain claiming he had brain surgery to explain his week long absence from the office.But when we looked at the type of brain cancer he has it is not one tumor but several small tumors throughout the brain and it takes months to recover from that surgery not a week or two. He also talked about the surgery supposedly happened at the mayo clinic where there are a lot of globalists on the BOD and maybe McCain is on the board as well.  He also talked about McCain's foundation inherited all the Clinton foundation donors when they dropped the Clinton foundation post election fail.  McCain is on the foreign affairs committee for the senate.  I think that is the name of it.  Getting late here so no time to verify.   I don't think Q said anything about ankle monitors but he did say that these people are unable to leave the country or something vague.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not say they don't change ankle monitor bracelets to a different leg.  They do have to be changed from time to time.  I image they would irritate old thin skin and that McCain is a big baby and as an elite I am sure he can get any accommodation he asks for.

       Ok, so this is a verifiable claim made by Q?  I'm asking if Q specifically said he was a target and has been/is going to be arrested?  And which investigation is a he a target of, Mueller's?  So this means that if it turns out McCain isn't the target of the investigation and isn't arrested, then I can assume Q is bs?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm looking for a definite claim made by Q of something that definitely hasn't happened yet.  Something that when it happens I can say "Oh, Q said to expect this exact thing so now I know he's legit!"  And by exact thing I mean something along the lines of specifically McCain getting arrested for something, not something as vague as some politicians will be arrested because that can be fulfilled by anyone.

       I think there are two things that I can point to that also come close to proving Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) look at the Q posts be4 the arrests were announced in Saudi Arabia.  Q was asking us about SA, though he did not come out and say there would be arrests.  But how could he without tipping them off? The House of Saud was one of the 3 families Q points to as controlling the world.  After those arrests, Assange posted on twitter "is there a word for what just happened in the US: The puppet has grabbed the hand".
      </p>
      <p>
       2) 1 month ago I posted a keyhole graph on Q's twitter impressions.  Keyhole is an online site that you can use to track that stuff.  Q posted a congratulations post on 8chan saying we had reached 2million.  He then posted same day or next day 2,4,6,8. He had already taught us about keyhole.  8chan started tracking on keyhole twitter impressions and it was at 2million.  Then suddenly it went straight up to 6 million at the point the graph was posted at 12 midnight. If 8chan had posted the graph at 1 am would it have been at 8 million?  Did they post it and I just didn't see it because I went to bed and so much was happening in those days with daily new posts that the community just moved on to the next post.  I did not go back and search for it.  Wish I had.  Hard to keep up with Q.  So the question is can twitter impressions go straight up form 2 million to 6 million with out bots being involved. Who would have bots and desire to push Q, if not Q and the storm? This happened a day or two after Q's posts.  Was it related?   I tried to post a link to it but I just checked my copy of it and it 404's.

       Oh as far as the resistance to Q by shills:  I post on WOTB frequently about Q.  Its my home sub but not exactly fully on board the Q train.  Two of the mods there have posted about how intense the "reddit Minders" are on anything posted about Q.  They see early flurries of down voting they associate with the minders and then subs recover when actual viewers upvote.  They even stickied one of my posts there because they wanted to counter the efforts to censor Q related posts by the minders. They have commented that the minders are really closely monitoring the Q subs.  They find it remarkable and makes them give Q serious consideration.

       The Q team is achieving the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Bolstering support for Trump and other politicians
       </li>
       <li>
        Crowd sourced content development (memes)
       </li>
       <li>
        Crowd sourced delivery of such content
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The evidence above would support the hypothesis that Q is an insider whose purpose is to run an inexpensive, targeted, and effective PR campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually quite genius.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing I find funny, is that those who follow Q interpret their mission as slowly "redpilling normies" before the details of what Q claims is true come out in order to mitigate blowback.  What is funny is that the interpretation of the blowback is a scenario where liberals/democrats/whatever take to the streets as they might think that Trump is committing a purge of sorts.  What is way more likely (if all of this is true) is a scenario where right-leaning folks take the law into their own hands and violently target anyone they think is a perpetrator.  Like McVeigh or the unabomber.

       I'm not saying that if Q's claims are true that the white hats wouldn't be pursuing lawful justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just suggesting that if it is all true, the likely blowback from releasing this information is a scenario where people (independently of Q and team) seek unlawful justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been thinking about this a lot recently as I have been reading up on Waco and the OKC bombing.  It's pure conjecture but I do think that it is likely that the powers that be factor this into their decision not to release information regarding government corruption / conspiracies to the public.  It's not that they are concerned about large public demonstrations, it's that they are concerned with individuals / small groups committing criminal violent acts in retribution.

       I think you're on to something but I see it the other way. As in this could all be to slowly reveal the crimes and raise the public's awareness of them. If they got justice without this then CNN or whoever could spin it and paint Trump as mad with power taking out his political enemies. Then the bad scenario could happen to the level you say but from the other side.

       (C) Q is an inexpensive, targeted, and effective PR campaign to boost support for Trump/others while vilifying their enemies.  (Some of Q's claims may still be true under this hypothesis).

       Here's a list of times trump and Q seemed to be collaborating on his and DJTJR twitter posts.  This post is about a month out of date and there are more examples that have happened since then.  Also both the FBI and DOD have made twitter posts that seem to collaborate with Q.

       Q is obviously just some dude fucking with people. I don't see what's so great about him. I've seen lots of people say things like, "Q is opening people's minds even if he's not lying!" Which is both sad and false. It's sad because you shouldn't want to follow someone who is lying to you. And it's false because the only people who were following Q were people who were predisposed to that kind of thinking already, and--surprise!--they're people who support Trump.

       I'm an ardent Berner who only voted trump b/c I live in PA and I thought the world would end if HRC became president.  PA was a toss up and I knew my vote mattered in a close race so I could not protest vote for an independent.  Many democrats did the same here.

       I myself think it is possible that Q is an AI but I had not considered that it might be a rogue AI.  Often Q posts something and then Trump posts something that relates on his twitter soon after.  You can see 15 examples of this in my post on trumps twitter.  So for your hypothesis to be true the AI Q would have to have control over Trumps twitter and Trump would have to be okay with that or unable to stop it. There is no way that trump would be unable to stop it and so if then he is okay with it then Q is not a rogue.

       I don’t understand the fixation with whether Q is ‘legit’ or not. The information contained in his posts is fascinating and stands alone regardless of his identity. The most recent post I read floated the idea that if Uk agents monitored trump at the request of the US, did Teresa May know about it and if not why not? It goes on to query what the implications would be if she did know. Those are damn  interesting questions to ponder and I don’t care if they came from a government insider or psychic sally

       That is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       the way this should be viewed. Instead, everyone just vacillates between thinking Trump is literally Jesus or literally Hitler, instead of just reading the posts, suspending belief or disbelief, doing some research, and integrating what you learned into your worldview.

       All the retired intell poeple and well known leakers have come forward to say Q is real. Thomas paine, White house Anon, Meganon, Robert David Steel, Col Potter, Infowars Guy, Steve Pieczenik, and Jerome Corsi have all confirmed Q.  The military retirees confirm the type of codes Q uses are consistent with US military code and that Q is legit.

       Seeing as how you’ve given nothing but an unverifiable claim, what is there to decide?  I don’t see much difference between you and a kid on Xbox who tells me his dad works at Microsoft and he’s going to ban me, at least with what you’ve offered.  I know you don’t care but I’m still going to point out to anyone reading that there’s really no reason to believe your claim.

       I can respect if you don't want to give details but could you at least say whether it happened before the first tripcode Q appeared, or after? I could totally imagine that they (= POTUS et al.) would post a Q-like post(s) for shits and giggles but I have really, really big troubles to accept that it's POTUS and the admin running the whole tripcoded Q(s) operation NOW, or previously on 4ch.

       I agree that reading Q’s posts happens to be one of the best ways to determine their validity, though I came to the conclusion they’re talking out of their ass and doing cold reading to scam the hell out of people.  If Q is honestly trying to expose something, then this is a horrible way to do it.  Basically they’re just toying with people but they offer some comforting lies in a digestible format, leading people to trust them because they can make Q say whatever they want.

       That does not explain his prediction of the New York Failed bombing and his nationality.  It also does not explain the 20 times that Trumps tweets have mirrored Q's posts often 10 minutes after Q post.  It does not explain Trump telling the press this picture of 18 generals from DOD represents the Calm Before The Storm.  It does not explain the heavy unprecedented efforts to shut him up in 4 and 8chan.  Its just not possible and if you read the links I posted in the initial post I am sure you will agree.  All the examples Ive used here are in those links.  This really is a counter-coup by the US military to end the globalists control of our government and destruction of our nation.

       What prediction?  All I’ve seen out of Q is vague posts that are just cold readings, a tactic used by many con men.  Have they ever said anything clearly and concisely, outlining a prediction so there’s no doubt about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m curious about those times Q has preceded a Trump post.  The only one I’ve seen, which was passed around here for a short time as proof, turned out to be bogus.  I can’t remember the specifics, only that the people spreading it were using two different time zones to make it seem like Q’s post occurred earlier on the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m also curious about the efforts to shut him up.  Are the admins, mods, or whatever they’re called on 4&amp;8chan deleting his posts?  Are they deleting his replies?  Or are people just disagreeing with him or not believing he’s legit?  If it’s the latter, that sounds less like an effort to shut him up than it sounds like people engaging in critical thinking instead of just assuming he’s real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you say that these will be answered through your links, but after looking through them I didn’t see the clear answers I was expecting.  Or, at least, I didn’t see them on my initial cursory read through.  I can look more in depth later on, and I will.  It just seemed like conjecture and doing nothing more than shoving actual events into a vague statement and saying it was a prediction.  I’d like to believe, but I’m not going to turn off my skepticism or critical thinking.  Those two things make me very sure Q is either a larp or a directed propaganda tool.

       What prediction:  I think the strongest one is the New York City bombing.  I have detailed it all out in that post and the link is in my post above. There are others but often the timing is so close that I think the New York bombing is harder to explain away.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the tweets there are maybe 20 or more occurrences.  I have detailed out about 15 of them.  Others have done a better job of posting the exact time stamp of the posts and tweets. And they are all legit.  Again, the post i made of the first 15 times is above.   Around the time i stopped tracking it Q was really getting specific at pointing it out and we just had to verify and those happened after I stopped bothering with it so the best and most clear of those are not included in my post.  Those records were documented on 8chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Efforts to shut him up were like nothing I have ever seen before.  Yes his post were deleted on multiple occasions.  At other points. Shills were posting other threads before the thread was filled.  This gets threads banned on 4chan.  The shills were so thick that like every 4th or 5th post was legit and the rest were total junk.  People typing text from novels into a post and posting it over and over.  This is really problematic on 4chan because the threads have a pretty limited amount of content space and then you have to open a new thread. They were having to open like 8 threads a day when 8 threads would have been months worth of space for any other poster.  Then the normal attack posts were virulent. At times they altered his posts. Then finally they cracked his trip code or his code he posts under, which can't be done with a home lap top. It takes serious like CIA computers weeks to do. Then they took control of the thread he posted on by compromising the operator of the thread.  After the community left the thread because it was announced it had been compromised, they continued to keep the thread running and posted disinfo saying Q was a a Larp and we were all being fed disinfo and the new thread was a fake.  They did that when he left 4chan and when he changed threads on 8chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I;m sorry my posts don't give more exactly details like when his post came out and when the story hit the news.  I tried to do it some and I did it a fair amount but it was just a lack of time.  I had watched it all happen for 6 weeks before I recognized that I needed to start recording it all because it was more than anyone would be able to remember. Going back and trying to retrace my steps was very time consuming and I was also trying to keep up with the new drops.  So they are not prefect.  if you look at the comments from others in the post you'll see the critical thinking or group think on the posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can not say enough that you will not find a smoking gun that conclusively beyond nay doubt proves CBTS is real.  If they did that then this would be a reality and a panic could ensue.  Its clear that they are trying to get as much done behind the scenes b4 it is verified.  Its is clear they are not willing to absolutely confirm it but also very clear they want it out there as a rumor that will contradict the MSM narrative. 
Yep its a lot of innuendo but pretty substantial innuendo at places.
I don't think we have long to wait for it to be proven one way or the other.  Q's most recent posts say the storm is just about here. He says this memo release will be the beginning of Normies Eyes opening but that it is just the beginning.  Much more to come.

       I think Q Brings us together to fight for a common cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we all want the bad people out of the government?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we all want to see what we all feel and know in our hearts that there is seriously some sick and messed up people and things going on in this world?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we want the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we want to be safe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we want to have more money?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow, Looks like we all have a lot in common.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q wants us all, to follow our own hearts and minds to stand together, let the world know we have a voice and we demand to be heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow, Look at that, You want the truth and you want to be heard too?
      </p>
      <p>
       That wasn't so hard was it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The plain fact is this: We just want the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q is our voice. A link that brings us all together, and We are given a chance to let our own voices be heard cause honestly the world sucks pretty bad. I never though my one little voice is worth a damn till I got on Social Media and found millions who all speak together and it's amazing the changes we are already making. This is history in the making.

       Also, not every subscriber is actually a person and when you refer to multiple social media groups it seems you are assuming each person discusses things on only one instead of where it is more likely many of those users are also member of the various other groups so it’s not as many unique people as you seem to suggest.

       I want to add this but I want to make sure I understand what you are suggesting.  Do you mind expanding on your thought?

       With ACH, hypotheses need to be mutually exclusive. However, a single piece of evidence can support multiple hypotheses.

       I can respect if you don't want to give details but could you at least say whether it happened before the first tripcode Q appeared, or after? I could totally imagine that they (= POTUS et al.) would post a Q-like post(s) for shits and giggles but I have really, really big troubles to accept that it's POTUS and the admin running the whole tripcoded Q(s) operation NOW, or previously on 4ch.
