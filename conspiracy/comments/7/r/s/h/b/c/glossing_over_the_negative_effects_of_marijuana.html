       I’m not entirely sure if this is the best place to post this. Ironically I am high right now so probably also a little paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a daily marijuana user. One thing I’ve noticed over the years as weed becomes more and more mainstream is the lack of education from supporters about how to responsibly use it. 
Despite marijuana being great and all that, if you smoke weed a lot you are most likely increasing your risk of lung cancer similar to cigarettes. Incidentally I could not find a very reliable source article for this claim from google search results. Most articles seemed to be from blog sites.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also having started smoking around the age of 16, I wish I had known that doing so could affect the development of my brain. In fact this article equates persistent adolescent marijuana use to that of prolonged lead exposure. even in your early to mid twenties it can affect your brain growth and has shown to lower your IQ.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Now, here is what my high, paranoid, lead poisoned brain has been kind of freaked out about.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if there is actually some sort of conspiracy by the US government to intentionally get the citizens of this country to habitually use a drug that is known to:
      </p>
      <p>
       relax the user
      </p>
      <p>
       make them less prone to violence
      </p>
      <p>
       Lower their IQ
      </p>
      <p>
       potentially shorten their lifespan
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially make us more docile and manageable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know. Tell me I’m crazy. Please.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR the government wants to smoke weed because it makes us stupid docile sheep.

       No. It's a drug like alcohol that impacts your cognitive ability in a negative way. I'm for legalization, but be aware that it isn't good for you, especially if you do a lot from a young age.

       I agree there are negative effects but it's impact on cognitive ability depends on the person and situation. Yes it hinders brain growth if your Brian isn't fully developed. Some people are more prone to fall into a pit of laziness and demotivation. In my experience it has expanding the way I think and let me see things more for what they are. People I know that smoke are more open to discussing different world views than people that don't. I think it can be a great tool for self reflection as well. I don't think it is even close to being on the same wavelength of alcohol. Alcohol shuts down your ability to think and you are way more prone to making terrible decisions that you wouldn't make sober. Cannabis will make you ponder thoughts you wouldn't have sober. I think that is a bad thing.

       Nothing is good for you without moderation. I can kill myself by drinking too much water.
I don't have the mindset that smoking a joint is a healthy activity, but to compare THC to alcohol is a joke, how many THC related deaths do we hear about?

        Cannabis use has been shown to impair cognitive functions on a number of levels—from basic motor coordination to more complex executive function tasks, such as the ability to plan, organize, solve problems, make decisions, remember, and control emotions and behavior. These deficits differ in severity depending on the quantity, recency, age of onset and duration of marijuana use.

       I'm pretty sure this is common knowledge. Also, thinking you write better while high does not mean you actually write better while high.

       We have been getting a steady stream of suspicious accts posting negative shit about marijuana for the last couple weeks. I am highly skeptical of posts like these, but you appear to be speaking from the heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree there are drawbacks to chronic chronic use that we should be considering. But as a long term and former junkie of all stripes, MJ is by far and away the least harmful way to change your state of mind. In addition to that, there are many proven medical benefits to many of the constituent components.

       Another thing, the government backed anti MJ propaganda has been going on for a loooooong time. I am highly skeptical of any of the studies perfomed by them. You see a common pattern. Any drugs that the govt wants us to shun have studies proving it makes you stupid and unable to perform sexually in some way. Every time, bad drugs make you grow tities and you can't get your dick hard lol.

       The medical effects are from cbd and not thc. Thc is basically a mild form of acid. It acts on the 5ht2a receptor which is the same one other hallucinogens bind to, and is likely responsible for psychosis and mental illness. Which is why most anti psychotics acts as a inhibitor on that very receptor. Point being, thc is a pretty strong drug. Cbd though, I agree has many beneficial medical effects. Thc, not so much.

       I dont entirely disagree with you. But there are documented synergistic effect of thc and other cannabinoids.

       The psychosis bit at the end it propaganda though. I would read more about the subject though. You have injested and integrated government nonsense into your mind. I don't know if there are psych docs out there specializing deprogrmming this nonsense exist yet. But we need them.

       Its not propaganda, its basic biology and neuroscience. I suggest you do some googles on the 5ht2a receptor and how it is involved in psychosis, hallucinogens, psychiatric illnesses, and - THC.

       Hey dawg, I've been smoking pot regularly since I was 14 and I'm anything but a stupid docile sheep.

      <p>
       The government already has things that AREN'T weed for all of the things you listed.

       Relax the user/Make them less prone to violence ---&gt; shouts out to pharmaceutical Anti-anxiety drugs and opiates.

       potentially shorten their lifespan ---&gt; shouts out to cigarettes, alcohol, stress, expensive healthcare, and the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially make us more docile and manageable ---&gt; see #1.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, marijuana effects everyone differently. If you find yourself being more docile and you don't like it, take a T-break. The fact is, pot was prohibited in this country because it promotes exactly what the government doesn't want you to be like: more compassionate, more reflective, less materialistic, less likely to fearfully swallow down every bit of propganda they push, AND it's very effective at fighting different symptoms the pharm industry makes millions selling ineffective drugs to treat. Alcohol companies are threatened by it's rise, paper/cotton are threatened by hemps utility. Ruthless capitalists and money are what kept pot surpressed for so many years, and the only reason it's becoming more prominent now is because different ruthless capitalists have realized how much money they can make from selling it.
      </p>
      <p>
       US is a corporation, charged with the management of all the other corporations. Weed will be corporate soon enough, so they're clearing a seat at the board room table for whoever eventually subsume the market share. Shouts out to weed lobbiests.

       up until that I do agree, Cops do not purposefully kill people. They are not all evil. The Police Force is not deep state, could they have deep state operatives hidden within their ranks yes but that could be said about any organization especially ones funded by Taxes.

       That’s why I said there was no reliable source. When I posed the search for “lung cancer related to marijuana use” it was all blogs and non-scientific articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may not have made it clear, but the point I was trying to make is it seems suspicious that there are no peer-reviewed studies made readily available to the public that point in either direction on the issue.

       Spot on man, long time user here. I believe it can be good if used sparingly, like once a month or less.

      <p>
       Once you start smoking multiple times a day it starts to be seriously detrimental in every way. You get stuck in that high state of mind, which is very different from sober state of mind. It's emotionally addicting, I have had to watch my brother destroy his life because of pot. It makes you lazy as hell on top of all of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it does have its mind expanding and inspirational uses, but those thoughts must be put into practice in a sober state of mind.

       Yes, there are people like you who have the self discipline to make it work. Good on you. I would guess that you don't stay high from morning until night every day like some do though, as a means to escape or forget about their troubles. I guess then it depends on the person and therefore isn't necessarily the weed itself that is the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also people who can have a drink or two of alcohol regularly and have the discipline to not let it get out of hand. But then there are those who use it as an escape and it ruins their lives in a similar way.

       I do most days, morning to night if I’m home. I don’t carry shit around with me or anything as I live in an illegal state. I don’t view it as a way to escape either, I fully appreciate both state of minds and try to have the best day regardless.

       As a LONNNG time pothead, I truly and honestly don't really think it does much for pain. Which is weird. But that is only based on my own experience, having been through injuries and the like, smoking before during and after, I didn't notice it doing much for pain at all.

       And of course it would be better than opiates. I just don't think it actually kills pain, its just more of a distraction... like if you broke your leg and think a bong rip is gonna help with that... good luck to you.

       Nah I don't think you are realistic at all. I have an autoimmune disease that without cannabis would be a regular 8 on the bullshit pain scale. I've done long term opiates. It sucks. You seem like someone that wants to make cannabis seem evil. I'm out of patience for the day though so find someone else I think.

       It has only negatively affected my life, it's not evil, it's just a drug. and there are a lot of people who would agree with me there. and that is my experience with it. On the other hand, I'm sure it helps many people including yourself. It seems to affect everyone differently. It's just my own experience that is all.

       Yes, as a daily smoker myself in my teens and early adult life, some 15 years ago - it definitely stunts your development, maturity and you are "stuck" in a teen mentality. It took me years to get to my actual age once I quit. And I thoroughly regret smoking and doing drugs in that critical age of 16-23. Which is of course the age most people experiment. I think it took a good 5 years to find my place in life as an adult as I was confused for far too long. Not sure there's a conspiracy here though. Well the conspiracy might be that far too many stoners are oblivious to the harmful effects of weed. Potential harmful effects anyway.

       I think a lot of people abuse weed and are in denial about it. No, it isn't gonna lead to a crippling addiction that will kill you, but it can make you demotivated and it sure helps you numb your feelings so you can avoid dealing with your problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think cannabis is a beautiful drug with a lot of medicinal and spiritual uses that really have the power to help people. But if you were like me and smoking every night in order to shut down whatever is going on inside of you...thats abuse. It's abuse and it isn't going to do you any favors. I think a lot of people do this, and they rationalize it by saying "at least I'm not getting drunk or using opiates!" But have you tried just, you know,
       <em>
        just being sober and clear headed for long periods of time?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I am pro-legalization and there are many, many people who benefit from using it. But I think chronic smokers would do well to take a hard look at their smoking habit and analyze why they do it and what they really get out of it.

       I know where you coming from OP, that marijuana 200 years ago had known uses, and that TPTB of thaose days made it illegal in order to trick us into thinking we had a choice

       In the book, Brave New World, the dystopian autocratic government uses a chemical known as Soma to pacify to population, it causes swaths of people to become euphoric and begin to have orgies. Pretty nightmarish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine this my fellow tokers, imagine a thought-police bureaucracy that tried to enforce marijuana  consumption - if a well-mannered and well-dressed bureaucratic lackey was sent to your house every week to take a piss test, failure to meet the consumption quota meant that you will be threatened with being charged with a crime and your living conditions get downgraded to 3x2 meter cell with 3 low calorie intake meals everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       We wouldn't accept it i think, because pot isn't potent enough...So this theatre we see with drug policy politics is to give us the illusion of escape, kinda like inception y'know? Its a trick to make us think we set out of our own free will and volition - to pacify ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing is clear i think, habitual use of marijuana causes total dream amnesia...marijuana smokers do not
       <em>
        dream

       I'm sure you know those people who delay everything to "get high first". I wanna eat but first we gotta get high, I wanna listen to this record but I need to get high first, I know we're late for the movie but I need to get high first etc...

      <p>
       In addition like any other product we also have to watch out for GMO/Chemicals/Adulteration etc.

       I feel marijuana should be used for medicinal purposes. You wouldn't take a blood pressure pill if your blood pressure is fine. If you have a lack of appetite or nausea from a chronic illness, marijuana can help. Also, I feel if prescribed, micro dosing is the best way to use it. I've known people that get so high, they just veg out and are worthless. This is abuse. If used properly, it can be beneficial.

       TL;DR the government wants to smoke weed because it makes us stupid docile sheep.

      <p>
       I admire the way you thought this through.

      <p>
       But the drug you seek is
       <em>
        Benzodiazepines
       </em>
       .

       Society hasn't recovered from the 60s weed panic when boys grew long hair and didn't get jobs at the factory. Look at Jeff Sessions and shit. They can't control cannabis. They never could. That's why it's illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you steep out of the box you get a pharmaceutical handcuff as a routine thing. They can't really control that, either. But it's enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed does have negative side effects. So does coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's not the key to controlling anything but cash flow.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course the government is in on that./

       I'm not a subscriber here but I'm a new Medical Cannabis patient formerly sober lifer.

       I think it's just because of the immense medical pros, or high kids being stoked to be high. We're getting into a time of more awareness about responsible cannabis use instead of "DARE" type lessons at least in Canada. I think that's important anywhere. We need more research with cannabis, the various cannabinoids and strains.

       That said, it appears to be anti-cancer and an antioxidant which would theoretically extend your life. While smoking had some carcinogens, it's still less than smoking and not a huge deal in comparison. Edibles or oil carry none.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm keeping a close eye on news as legalization rolls out here because I'm skeptical.

       The only "bad" things about marijuana is that it will destroy the pharmaceutical industry, it will destroy the cotton industry, and it will destroy the oil industry all while making those who smoke it have an higher quality of life.

       I agree with you on all notes. I'm a long-time smoker as well, and for the last few years I've strictly vaporized and it's improved my health in several ways. I've always been very vocal about the fact that most of the health issues related to smoking center around the byproducts of combusting any carbon material, and it amazes me how many people truly believe that "no, weed can't give you lung cancer, it fixes cancer". That being said I think the ground made on decriminalization and regulated legalization is fantastic, and it likely won't stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       But education needs to be increased tenfold for sure. There's a sadly surprising number of news stories of suicides related to edibles, and it leads me to believe that most of the public seems to think that that 150mg Incredibles bar is gonna be like the shitty pot brownie their friend made a year ago that likely was no more than 10-20mg.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree wholeheartedly on the last bit. I think it's something that TPTB has never been against -- marijuana has been illegal for other reason$. But that wasn't a construct they could keep up in today's cultural climate, and so they take their "loss". One more vice that makes people generally lazy and unable to make social progress.

       Keep doing the good work man 👍

       My background: originally I was a paramedic. Then I was an environmental chemist and microbiologist for about 20 years. I tell you this so you understand the context I am coming from. Drugs of abuse were not my specialty professionally, but I was an avid hobbyist.

       I am not a neurologist though, but you are right?
