       Anyone watch it, he talks about the Hollywood “scandal” and at one point says “what if these rapes aren’t even the worst going on here”.. he kept bringing up how something is wrong with Hollywood right now and he wouldn’t tell the reason he left a 50 million dollar deal.
He told a story about a book called Pimp - tldr version is that it’s about a pimp that does really fucked up and malicious shit to “break” his prostitute so she serves him..  he goes on to say “that’s how the game works folks”
      </p>
      <p>
       All the main sites can talk about was that he was “transphobic”..

       I haven't watched it, but Dave Chapelle is one of the most insightful dudes on the planet if one takes the time to listen to him.  That said, he can be a little cryptic.  But anything he has to say, I'm all ears.

       It was totally cryptic man, the way he he said the “what if the rapes aren’t even the worst that’s going on” I knew right away he totally knows.. he just can’t straight up say it, he’s such a down to earth dude..he was talking about how now more than ever it’s important to talk reckless or his kids won’t know what free speech is. He’s absolutely right, and what these tabloid websites all got from it was he was transphobic.. god these people are so thick.

       I dont think it was the cryptic, really. He turned down large sums of MONEY and walked away with his credibility/soul in tact. He didn't want to be bought like the prostitute was. He even said something to the effect about how his movie How High ended up being something he didn't want/expect it to be
      </p>

       Everyone that gets air time gets paid, and if they fit the buyers bill they can keep getting paid. We're just being curtailed to. Follow the money.

       The story he told was that the prostitute was made to believe she killed someone when it was the pimps friend just acting. I'm wondering how that relates

       My interpretation was that Comedy Central made him feel like he was responsible for killing his own show and made him feel guilty about it. But that they weren’t really hurt by it at all because they milked the fuck out of him (the “bottom bitch”).

       Nah I bet it goes deeper and the story is more about the kind of blackmail/extortion that people (the pimp, Hollywood) are capable of. Don't try to put the puzzle together when you're missing half the pieces.

       I think you hit the nail right on the head with it being a metaphor for how Hollywood uses blackmail/extortion. Atleast that's what I took from it.

       So Chappelle is getting paid now. And appears on CNN and all the other propaganda shows.. What’s he getting paid and what did he pay in to be a part of the inside crew.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Chappelle is a phony now.. lost his mind when he got too close to the MK ultra type of shyt. Now he’s just vanilla and will never let out any secrets or push against the main stream narrative.

       It was cryptic, well I took it that way. He was gonna mention his reasoning why, but used this story The Pimp as ametaphor. Did they make him do stuff he didn't want to do &amp; they tried blackmailing him?

       what i took from it was he was on the precipice, people were trying to get him into those compromising situations in some way but he recognized how spooky it was. with the metaphor from the pimp book, i think it would be like if the girl, instead of calling the pimp when she thinks she has killed the guy (or maybe when the last job is so unusually sketchy), instead dips out completely and catches the first flight to africa. just my guess..

       He keeps talking about walking away from 50 million dollars. I mean we see and hear celebrities all the time talking about money this and money that - but listen, $50 MILLION dollars is a big fucking deal, it's HARD to walk away from that kind of money. What in the world could make a dude walk away from 50 mil. Think about it.

       Probably about that programming program used on people, monarch. Where they traumatised people because that kind of abuse creates vulnerabilities and breaks people. Their soul is broken and weak and the person holding the so called leash USE PEOPLE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Current relevant news: breaking and trendinf recently is a story about a family that had people handcuffed inside their house and they looked starved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Begins the curtains things happen hard to fathom. People can be Controlled. There are many degrees to this. Most people can relate to the level of control where they've seen it in family dynamics, bullying, blackmail, etc. Think of how small they start. How the littlest things influence another's behavior. How they can stack and build upon each other in amount , in degree,  in severity, extremity, in unimaginability, unspeakability...

       This is a very real possibility, he shrouds it all in comedy but if you've seen some of his older stuff AFTER Chappelle Show ended, there are a few very telling videos out there, captured on small shows with cell phone cameras or whatever. He looks, acts and feels absolutely devastated when he starts talking about "stuff", he NEVER mentions what it is, just dancing around it. I know Dave wants to talk, but he has a family.

       Two different points, the way I understand it. 1. We all know some directors and producers have parties with 13-15 year olds doing drugs. We have heard these stories a million times. Its weird none of them have come out with the #metoo stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second point: Chapelle hinted that he had a contract that said he was owed a certain percentage of what his show made. When it made way more than anyone expected they tried to buy him off with the 50 million.

       That's what I got out of it at least.

       Katt Williams spoke about this on some radio show, apparently according to Katt (haha, yeah well..) Dave should have gotten the better or half part of 500 million from the show.

       I respect your position. Maybe he is a two party shill- I hate politics as a team sport as much as anyone.  But, I think he's one of the more intelligent comedians out there and I like to believe I can entertain his ideas without succumbing to them.

       Im in a social circle with friends that know Dave. Here’s what happened with Comedy Central. It’s a long story but to give some facts. The honchos at CC were threatened by Dave’s popularity and were concerned that Dave would either leave CC and/or start to use his comedy as a platform to influence his following on political/social matters. They first offered him to ghost write the scripts for Chappelle Show, which he declined. Then they wanted to modify the show and limit his creativity, he declined. Then they offered to buy him out of his contract. The offer was 10% of his gross Sales revenue of the show, which at the time was above $500 million. His contract stated royalties and 20% of direct sales of Chappelle merchandise, which at the time would include dvd Sales, syndication, all that had his name on it. CC honchos refused and black balled him from being involved in the show, while they racked up even more money. This was the third season when shit went south. They told him if he didn’t get in line with the program and take the offer, that he would never work again in Hollywood. This started the smear campaign and his departure to Africa to recover from the stress and find himself again. This is why the story of the pimp is told. The studio tried to break him, and right when he was down they tried to sweeten the deal by paying him $50m which seemed like a ton of money, but in reality was a fraction of what he was legally entitled. The sneaky bastards were able to smear his name to make it look like a breach of contract that he did drugs and was unstable, nullifying their offer and his potential earnings from the show. Similar to the prostitute who goes to deliver a message and realizes the guy is dead but in reality it’s all a hoax. They set him up from the start as soon as they had recovered their costs for the show. If he fell in line they would continue to make tons of money at a fraction of what they had to pay. If he didn’t they wouldn’t have to pay shit and still own all the rights. His lawyer fucked him to because they didn’t advise him on the clauses in his contract. There’s more to it, but that’s the gist.

       Kudos to Dave for not wanting to water-down his show, he was doing some of the most edgy and groundbreaking stuff for the time.  "Mind of Mencia" that was the replacement program goes to show the Suits didn't have a clue what they were doing.

       UK guy here. All his stuff is worth watching. His earlier stuff is on YouTube which is hilarious. His 4 new stand ups are on Netflix. The last one of the 4 is imo by far the best (the one that OP is talking about). Nothing I can say would do it justice. It should be required watching for everyone.

       There is one video 4-5 hours long shot in a comedy club, he just rips it man. I haven't seen it now in a few years but I remember it was dope as fuck, not "FUNNY" you know what I mean, just Dave Chappelle social commentary which is extremely captivating. As far as I know he just showed up there and ripped the whole night and morning and nobody left the place.

       He’s not a clone lol.. he left cause shot got crazy.. they started spreading rumors that he smoked crack, I honestly think he feared for his life, why else would be uproot his family and just leave.. he turned down his show and they got very mad cause that’s a lot of money the company lost.. Hollywood is very very sick, and he keeps bringing that up in the special.

       A distraction from what, though? They say any attention is good attention in showbiz because it puts you in the spotlight, so one would assume that once criticism started to come out people would be intrigued to see what the controversy is sbout and start watching the show. Unless putting the attention on Chappelle was an attempt to distract from something different and unrelated. But what, though? What happened right around that time? If, though it really was just criticism of a joke, why is that not allowed? It doesn't have to be a love it all or leave it all type thing and besides, I can't think of a single group who doesn't act offended and persecuted at times. Hell, the emotion in comments crying about white genocide or the disappearance of white folk on this site, you'd think the commenter was the last of a handful of whites fearing for their liv3s. Relax Willy Whitebread, our skintone isn't disappearing. Everyone is a sensitive snowflake, now a days.

       Yep! I heard that.. talking about Martin Lawrence.. this is speculation but I really feel like when you get a giant Hollywood deal from certain companies, you gotta play ball with whatever they say, you are just a glorified prostitute.. it’s a shame for the people who never spoke up because they were honestly probably threatened.. everyone getting mad that no body said anything.. I wouldn’t be surprised if death was used as a threat.. i think a huge change is happening and this year shit should start coming out.. one can hope

       The fact that that chappelle says something along the lines of "what if the rapes in Hollywood weren't the worst things going on?" really made me think that he knows some darker info... I hope he one day comes out about it but I understand that might piss a lot of higher ups off. Of he went on to expose the really dark shit he would possibly be killed or framed.

       He's kinda talked about why he walked from the deal before and other people who know him have said similar things.
      </p>
      <p>
       They pretty much tried to alter his contract so instead of 2 odd seasons for 50 mill they could get him to do 10 or so. How they were legally able to do this I don't know. I suspect he could have fought it in court but chose to walk. They pretty much instantly started trying to lander him as a crack head and a bunch of other stuff.

       The story Katt Wiliams said is that he had a pre-existing contract which said he basically gets half of what they make, after the seasons he already did they projected the following one would make 500mil which would have been 250mil for Dave. They basically said that "the contract doesn't account for the show making this amount of money - so we will give you 50mil instead of half" and he walked away.

       Nah Katt Williams spilled the beans on the situation a few years ago. Chappelles Show made 500 million, Dave was contracted to get half of that. They said his contract is void because he made too much money, offered him 10% instead - the 50 million deal. He walked away because of that.

       This was one I remember too.  I think he touched on it on inside the actors studio.  His gripe was about the feminizing black men.  Think Tyler Perry, big momma's house, White Chicks.  He said that was one of his lines he wouldn't cross.  He wouldn't dress as a woman for entertainment because they never ask white people to do this kind of stuff.  Then he went on talking about how they tried to trick him by giving him a much worse version of the script first, so they could pass him the one they wanted after.  Can't blame him.  He had a line

       There are dozens of (white) British comedians that have dressed up as women. I agree with him choosing not to do it but not because it "feminises black men" but rather it shows a lack of creativity and nowadays is generally a symptom of a failing comedian.

       I remember that episode. He also sidesteps his conversation to add how weird it was that, after he declines dressing as a woman, how quickly they write up or have yet another version which still basically comes down to humiliating the actor in some way.

       In his story about the pimp, it's clear he's the "bottom bitch" in the analogy. The real question is if she got spooked because of a dead body, what did Chappelle witness?

       He was at the end of the road, after just two seasons. So comedy central said “dave look what youve made if you walk away now youll ruin it all!!!”
      </p>
      <p>
       But really he was being held against his will in a fucked up contract and it was really comedy central ruining/“killing” his show. While telling him he did.

       Well, it totally adds up that they wanted to make him think that he was obligated to make him money by holding him to a contract and giving him just enough to keep going. A contract that they were hoping to void.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like the other half is hinting towards them doing some unspecified fucked up blackmail shit. Which, if the story is true about them actually trying to keep $200 million owed to him, doesn't sound all that implausible, does it?

       The post made it make sense, all tin foil hat style. But it was like how Bohemian grove does a "mock" child sacrifice and he may have attended thinking it was just the thing the elite did so he went along with it and after being there and passively standing by as this "fake sacrifice" turned real it scared him to the point he just said fuck this im out and that was what they held over him.

       I also don't remember exact words right now but he said something akin to, and this is not a quote: "I want to spill the beans, I got a good feeling tonight... But we'll see, I don't know if I can talk about this shit". But of course the whole Pimp story was already supposed to be part of the set, I mean it's not like he made that shit up on the spot - his man had the book and everything.

       I think he witnessed what they did to other celebs in terms of blackmail so he knew they meant it when they said they would ruin him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason he left the country was the started saying he was a crack addict etc. By leaving and refusing all interviews etc he did his own damage control in a way. The media quit with the stories as soon as they realised they could only push it so far.

       I've watched it. As far as I can tell he likened himself to the prostitute. He walked away from the money because he couldn't be tricked into longer servitude to things he didn't want to do like the prostitute was.
      </p>

       He wanted to make people laugh and be happy but not be forced into doing certain skits or jokes that weren't really him to get those laughs/emotions. I have a lot of respect for this dude.

       The overt message is still a pretty simple metaphor where Dave is the prostitute. But what is the message even deeper? I think the dead body is something we don't know about.

       Dave isn't shallow, look at any of his jokes, by the time this man is done with a joke you've already forgotten how it started, and then it hits you when the punchline comes in - everything he just said for 10 minutes comes rushing back and its fucking glorious. Dave is not about shallow shit.

       Ok so mayyybe when Dave’s ‘mileage’ was up, and they couldn’t get him to trick no more - that’s when they tried to put the proverbial dead hookers in his trunk, but Dave, already knowing they were pumping him - didn’t go for it..

       You're right, he did, but sometimes when your immersed in something you don't see it the way you're meant to even if its being spelled out right in front of you. Its kind of just captivating to watch/listen without making any of the connections or analogies that Dave was making.

       Yeah but why would he be so INCREDIBLY hesitant to talk about it? He has talked about this a million times but always with this dirty mirror you can barely see through. I don't buy it, I think there is much more to the story than this.

       I kind of agree with you. I wasn't trying to say anything profound here... but I did watch this with my girlfriend and after it was over she asked me what I thought he meant by it. So I figured other people may not quite have gotten it either
      </p>

       The deeper meaning can only be speculation aside from the things we already know for sure. But I am pretty sure there was something deeper than the analogy he made.

       You missed the point. It had nothing to do with him not wanting to do embarrasing jokes. It goes much deeper than that. Think about the story of the pimp and the hoe more closely. He made her think she murdered someone so that she would feel guilty and do more work for him. Does that sound like a story he would tell if they wanted him to do embarrasing jokes he didn’t want to do?

       Again, wasn't trying to act like I knew exactly what he was saying. I was just drawing lines to obvious connections. Nothing profound there.

       Regardless, he was trying to be manipulated to do something he didn't want to. We can sit here and speculate for days but that is all it will be. Speculation.

        Chappelle had a contract to receive half of what was made on his show. The show ended up making 500 million. Comedy Central turned to him and said that he made too much for the contract to work, and offered him 10% instead. Thats why he left. Thats what his pimp analogy is all about

       Not really. These last few specials and especially this last one he's really been hinting at something fucked up happening and that's what made him cut out to Africa. Where as before he made it seem like it was more like a business decision.

       Kaepernick proved that racism is still prevalent in America to the cost of his lucrative career. Is it MLK-type shit? No. But he sacrificed fame and money when most don't.

       If you haven’t seen the special, watch it. Classic Dave. I actually like it more than his last Netflix Special. He always throws out hints about how “they” will come and get him. He even insinuates that that’s what happened to Kevin Hart with his recent cheating scandal.

       Yeah I found that story about The Game very interesting and I'm not sure he was being exactly coy with telling why he left the show. I think at the end he felt like those above him were trying to break him and make him their dancing puppet. We see this is true with people like Weinstein and others in power. I think it's safe to say those in power in Hollywood are just pimping their bottom bitches.

       Dave has seen the shit we all speculate is going on in hollywood. No doubt in my mind. Hes able to say the most serious shit and people laugh it off, he said something along that line in the special. Hes dropping truth in every story, but most people think hes joking and laugh it off.

       The contract was one part but also he was sick of doing racist skits. His mom is white, he grew up with white friends, and Comedy Central just wanted wanted him to do coonish race skits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comedy Central is owned by Viacom. They also own MTV and BET. Comedy Central's target demographic is white college kids who grew up on MTV and guys like Eminem; corporate driven 'black culture'.
      </p>
      <p>
       After he quit, Comedy Central eventually brought in Key &amp; Peele who are like Dave's replacements. Their gimmick is that they're 'white' black guys as opposed to ghetto black guys. They do a lot of race skits and pandering to their target audience.

       And? Look I hate Hilary but we can’t have this child like team sport mentality by judging people on that.. I know lots of good people that voted for Hilary.. I don’t agree with them but they are humans too and they got caught up in the news narrative. We need to stop this dividing bullshit, we all want the same thing out of life.

       Yeah he may not have to be honest, I heard from Roseanne Barr that lots of celebrities can’t openly speak about their beliefs because of this. Isn’t it strange how “picture perfect” they made hollywood and celebrities seem. I saw through that bullshit and that’s why I wasn’t surprised what happened. But It’s only the beginning those people will look like saints when the true monsters are caught. Here’s to wishful thinking and hoping the pedos go down.

       He was very open, he knows what goes down and he knows the rapes are mostly woman with buyers remorse.. doesn’t make hem okay. I feel bad for the woman who accepted this and let it happen but they probably were threatened. I have a bad feeling about Jennifer Lawrence though.. she blew up so quick and you gotta wonder.

       About Jennifer Lawrence, Hollywood isn't the only place you can fuck your way up the ladder. "Our god" etc... She definitely fucked her way to the top and we won't hear a peep from her (please correct me if I'm wrong).

       I’m aware, I’m very heavily into occultic Teachings. It means hidden but the term is still used the way wrote it. I’m currently reading “The Secret Teachings of All Ages” which is all about secret societies and the occultic.

       Shit, that's like Baby Driver, where the kid thinks once he's paid his debt, he's free, but then they threaten his girlfriend instead. And it's such pervasive leverage. If you have a conscience, you're not going to let your loved ones get hurt.

       Oh yeah, watched the Bird Revelation a few times now, will watch it a few more of course. Everyone on the internet seems to be missing the point. They think how we are all enslaved to the system etc is what Dave mean't. Are you fucking kidding me?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dave is talking about some naaaaaaasty shit, what the fuck is worse than rape and shit? I think we should take Pimp story to heart, the whore was conned into thinking she'd killed someone - THAT's how the Pimp got her mileage up. My opinion is that Dave left the country because he was asked to join in on some initiation shit which included pedophilia or killing or whatever, probably some of the worst shit you can imagine. And he bounced. I think that these elite motherfuckers probably though Dave could easily be swayed - nah-ah, bitches.

       It wasn't even supposed to be a special. Three specials is what we all heard he signed up for, for 20 mil a pop at that. And when it was announced a few days before they put in on it's suddenly TWO specials, one of them being the god damn revelation.

       He's spoken to this a few times before this special. In interviews he basically said he didn't want to become Louis CK. You take $50 million dollars and then you have to do what you are told. This leads to censorship and a watered down finish product that you aren't proud of. So he walked away. Funny that once he walked main stream media portrayed him as crazy and had gone off his rocker because he wouldn't sell his soul to the industry.

       The other metaphor he alluded to was the end of apartheid in SA. To paraphrase Dave "when an entire system is corrupt then the people who adhere to the system and are insentivised by the system are not criminals, they're victims, and that the system itself must be tried. And the only way to figure out what the system is is if everybody says what they did"
He was using the story in the context of the sexual assault scandals in hollywood, but I think it applies as a metaphor to the industry as a whole. Especially how all the moving parts of "the system", the media, government etc, all need to be visible. And the people who work for the system, support and idolise media, celebrities, politicians, are the victims, not criminals. It's not their fault the system is corrupt, they just need to be shown what the system really is for everyone to figure it out.

       He was at the end of the road, after just two seasons. So comedy central said “dave look what youve made if you walk away now youll ruin it all!!!”
      </p>
      <p>
       But really he was being held against his will in a fucked up contract and it was really comedy central ruining/“killing” his show. While telling him he did.

       There are dozens of (white) British comedians that have dressed up as women. I agree with him choosing not to do it but not because it "feminises black men" but rather it shows a lack of creativity and nowadays is generally a symptom of a failing comedian.

       I remember that episode. He also sidesteps his conversation to add how weird it was that, after he declines dressing as a woman, how quickly they write up or have yet another version which still basically comes down to humiliating the actor in some way.
