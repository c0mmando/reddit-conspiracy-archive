<p>The Post Office loses $2.5 Billion each year delivering mostly junk mail.  It of course has expense problems (inefficiency, large gov&#39;t pensions, fuel cost etc) but it also has no idea how to price their services for these junk mail producers that abuse the system.</p>

<p>Of course junk mail is also incredibly &quot;Non-Green&quot; as billions are wasted on the disposal of this ancient marketing practice.  Yes, I know direct mail still works with a low (say 3%) response rate but that is again just indicative of the low cost they are taking advantage of via tax payer funds in the post office.  It is a drain on our tax money and resources. </p>

<p>If a company wants to send junk mail via a private carrier than be my guest (good luck getting the gravy train rates at the post office though).</p>

Getting their ROI less attractive while making the post office profitable on the mail they deliver is the goal.   I get the volume will impact total revenues but the post office will had to adjust.

<p>Actually junk mail is what helps pay our bills. We lose money every year because we have been forced by congress to pre fund our pensions 75 years in advance. Setting aside money for employees who haven&#39;t even been born yet. We also haven&#39;t been funded by taxes since the 70&#39;s.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a real conspiracy involving the post office.

<p>My point was that it helps pay the bills, it&#39;s part of a larger picture. You say people don&#39;t want their junk mail but when our supermarket circular comes in late we get a ton of phone calls from people asking where the hell they are. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure what you mean you are not funded by taxes? Who do you think picks up the tab for a 3 billion dollar annual loss? Amazon? FedEx? No It goes into our budget deficit (I.e. tax shortfall)...which is all of our public debt (the tax payers). The only way to not involve the tax payers is to make the post office breakeven, and the involves raising prices (like this) and cutting expenses (a separate discussion).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I say we&#39;re not funded by taxes, I mean we haven&#39;t been funded by taxes since the 70&#39;s. Our operating expenses are fully funded by postage, that&#39;s a fact. We&#39;re only losing money on paper, because of the pre funding. It&#39;s like losing money to yourself.  No offense but it&#39;s obvious you did zero research for your post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for it.  Raise all rates, and specifically target junk mail because nobody wants it and its a waste of time and resources.  Congress always kicks the can...the post office should be breakeven with all expenses included...12 cents for non profit junk mail is ridiculous. .it means I get 75 letters from scam charities every month. :/ </p>
