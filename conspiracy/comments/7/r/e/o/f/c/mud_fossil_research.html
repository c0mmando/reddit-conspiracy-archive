       The very basic theory goes that the ground we walk on is made up of the petrified corpses and mineral saturated ruins of giant creatures and the buildings they lived in. Perhaps our close ancestors sought out these petrified remains for spiritual reasons and because of their extensive internal spaces.

       The researcher who I have come to respect the most goes by the name of Wise up. Wise up shows us a back ground in architecture and construction is all it takes to up end the mainstream archeological paradigm.  It's key to figure out what lies by omission have been committed and go back and relearn basic topics in their completion.
      </p>
      <p>
       One phrase he always repeats is that "nothing is carved, everything is built"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this side by side really hammers this point home

       The mainstream calls these sites tombs in spite of no dead bodies ever being found in them.

       In that video Wise shows us how ancient peoples constructed their monuments no differently then our engineers today. He goes so far as to suggest that all we know about construction has been back engineered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wise isn't afraid to take on the larger megalithic community and call out the bullshit they have been getting rich peddling.

      <p>
       Wise shows us Megaliths are actually bits of pre flood megastructures that have soaked up minerals while submerged in muddy water or imprint fossils of these structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many aspects to petrification that people don't seem to be aware of. For example
       <a href="https://professorelliot.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/petrifaction-as-preservation-girolamo-segato/">
        in the 18th century a man was turning dead bodies to stone
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomorph">
        An infiltration pseudomorph is when one mineral or material fully changes to another and maintains its shape
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gembone">
        A gem bone is when a fossil absorbs mostly precious minerals think crystal skull
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_fossil">
        trace fossils are when the object leaves an imprint in its surroundings
       </a>
       .

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmb0CSXF53w">
        Electric Transmutation
       </a>
       suggests that heat from plasma discharge can speed up fossilization significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this culminates in a re-understanding of geology. It calls into question what we call megaliths, monoliths and even some
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0Hm8KFQ8C4">

       In many of his videos he shows us clear evidence that the established chronology is all wrong.

       This is fascinating. Any thoughts on the geologists who say that we can't run out of oil, that either the earth has as much oil as water, or is constantly replenishing it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see how that would be a conspiracy, b/c if either of those were true, it could be majorly detrimental to the price of oil.

       Don't they do that with diamonds? I'm not too educated on the subject, but I've heard that diamonds aren't the rare commodity they're made out to be in order to jack the prices up so it would make sense they would do that with oil.
