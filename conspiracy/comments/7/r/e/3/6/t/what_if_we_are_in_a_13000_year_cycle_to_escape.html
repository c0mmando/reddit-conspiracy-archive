<p>What if we are in a ~13,000 year cycle on earth and every 13,000 years earth moves through a world-ending meteor shower and human civilization has to constantly restart from scratch each iteration.  Each iteration humanity is given 13,000 years to evolve enough to escape earth and hence the cycle... thus far we’ve failed every time and remain stuck on earth.</p>

<p>Interesting movie plot at least :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good guy.  I couldnt see it in the same light after reviewing the meta studies produced by Oreskes and gang.  I have an engineering degree and am pretty well equipped to analyze such papers.  They are highly deceptive and in favor of &quot;anthropogenic global warming&quot;.  Tactics such as binning, and definitions of bins are subverted for this purpose as well as ignoring bins outright that voice no opinion on that matter. </p>

<p>If anyone wants to check me, first study their charts in the papers and reflect on them deeply without taking any position on that matter.  The Oreskes paper is a good place to start.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got to understand that there are two fundamentally different parts to &quot;the science of global warming&quot;.  There is 1) the physics and chemistry of greenhouse gasses and 2) the predictive climate modeling.</p>

<p>Part 1 is absolutely rocky solid.  You just can&#39;t argue that certain gasses don&#39;t slow down the transmission of infrared light.  Part 2 allows for some argument and invites all sorts of FUD from both sides of the aisles.  </p>

<p>I think it is very unfortunate that people who stand to gain or lose from global warming legislation have worked so hard to muddy the water with panic inciting claims with part 2, casting doubt on the fundamentals of part  1, or shifting the focus away from the  very reasonable and well-supported work in part 2 to focus solely on the doomsday hurricane stuff.</p>

<p>The bottom - line is that part 1 is real.  And part 2 is doing a pretty good job of predicting the future.  You&#39;re either ignoring it or focusing solely on the people making irresponsible, panic inciting claims.</p>

<p>Conduct research into the theory that our galaxy, as a whole, has a &quot;central sun&quot;, the gravity of which is so massive that it causes all star systems in the galaxy to &quot;spiral in&quot; and then &quot;spiral out&quot; through and/or near the center. </p>

<p>It is theorized that Earth goes through this process roughly once every 127,500 years. </p>

To entertain it for the sake of discussion: Does it mention anywhere how to escape this supposed matrix which appears to be described as almost completely controlled by reptilians/greys?

<p>Disturctive?  Really.  Who types up a message of such real importance without proof reading it.  Sounds like a paranoid schizophrenic.  In his reality all that stuff he is claiming is real.  Not in the collective reality at least going by physical embodiments and manifestations.  Who believes this account is foolish just as it would be going by the words of religious texts is. </p>

<p>Theres too many well formed web kf lies in this world, fellas, that need discovering and exposure.  This one doesnt even seem to be well formed...</p>

All life on earth is dependent on the planet to survive. Going out to space leads to death as a biochemical entity, pure and simple.

<p>The meteor shower they are talking about in that article happens every year </p>

<p>Why is the answer of &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7re36t/what_if_we_are_in_a_13000_year_cycle_to_escape/dsw81cy/">why 13,000 years</a>&quot; an article that has nothing to do with 13,000 years and a yearly event? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying the article says anything about 13000 years dude you&#39;re not understanding the point here. </p>

<p>&quot;13000 years ago&quot; comes from our own knowledge from ancient history of the cluster of comets that caused a mini ice age and devastated the earth, this article is simply saying another strike of a cluster of comets is very likely soon. Hence the OP post about there being a 13000 time limit to escape the earth before asteroids hit and it&#39;s reset and we have to try again. </p>

<p>The comment replying to it links to that article as the reason why.</p>

<p>I commented, &quot;What does this have to do with 13,000 years?&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>So what does the article have to do with 13,000 years? </p>

<p>Why was that article linked as a reply to the question of &quot;why 13,000 years?&quot; </p>

<p>The point is my question of what that article has to do with 13,000 years. Nothing else. It is literally that simple. Do you understand now or should I just ignore you for failing to follow along with 1 simple question?</p>

<p>THE REASON IT ANSWERS THE QUESTION OF &quot;WHY 13000 YEARS?&quot; IS BECAUSE IT SHOWS ANOTHER LETHAL ASTEROID STRIKE MAY OCCUR AND IF IT DOES, IT MEANS A 13000 CYCLE WILL HAVE BEEN COMPLETED SINCE THE LAST GLOBALLY DEVASTATING ASTEROID STRIKE.</p>

<p>Also 13,000 years ago is when something smashed into the northern ice cap causing the Younger Dryas period and creating the massive deluge that raised the ocean levels by like 300 feet. Whole lands were lost, civilizations wiped out.</p>

<p>13,000 years is also the halfway point in the precession of the equinox.  Also represented in ancient monoliths like the great pyramid, even though they had know way of calculating it back then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The basic Myth Arc of the game (which only begins to take shape in volume two of the trilogy) is that the Milky Way is a farm for a synthetic race of unfathomably powerful aliens. They go out into intergalactic space, sleep for 50,000 years, and then come harvest the biological and synthetic civilizations that have sprung up in their absence... for genetic variety to make their own species stronger. They subsume all intelligent life, erase all evidence of said life, and then retreat once more.</p>

<p>They leave FTL portals for Milky Way aliens to find once they master inter-solar system space travel, and a big ‘ol city sized space ship that these portals all kind of lead to. This is all to direct and guide the development of Milky Way species in certain directions and locations, for ease of harvesting. This city-space station almost inevitably becomes a capital for one or more Milky Way species or inter-species alliances, since they have no idea why it is the FTL portals or the city are actually there. </p>

<p>The Milky Way is their Petri dish. They’ve been repeating this cycle for millions of years.</p>

<p>As part of their reproductive cycle, every once in a great long while(it&#39;s pre-scheduled can&#39;t remember how many years), they come back into the galaxy and harvest every planet with intelligent organic life using the various species as building blocks to create new members of their race. There machine intelligence but their bodies are a weird sort of hybrid thing. The process is messy and results in the utter annihilation of every species they come in contact with.</p>

<p>Then, after they&#39;ve wiped everyone out, they seed the galaxy with artifacts meant to trick future technologically advanced civilizations into developing their technology along established and predictable lines so that they know what to expect and how to counter it the next time they roll into town.</p>

<p>For example, there&#39;s a galaxy spanning network of faster than light &#39;mass effect&#39; gateways, discovery of which almost always results in a species fully embracing &#39;mass effect&#39; technology and immediately ceasing research in other less compatible scientific/technology fields. But, surprise surprise, The Reapers built and maintain that particular network and basically use it to funnel species down pre-approved technological and physical channels that aren&#39;t a threat to them. Imagine if a malevolent race that had a device that could shut down or hijack any device powered by nuclear fission/fusion at will went around conveniently placing working &#39;ancient artifacts&#39; designed to help people reverse engineer that technology and you basically have the idea.</p>

<p>I never played the last game of the original series so there may have been some big disclosure beyond what I&#39;m describing, but that&#39;s what I&#39;m remembering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because at a certain speed matter becomes vaporised on impact with another object. A meteor hitting earth at 40 times the speed of a bullet won&#39;t leave behind much to excavate, it will make a crater but since it was so powerful it created an ice age and vaporised on impact there won&#39;t be much evidence. A slower moving or smaller meteor WILL leave behind evidence especially if it wasn&#39;t powerful enough to wipe out the earth. Go back to school mate you&#39;re just embarrassing yourself.</p>

The article has absolutely nothing to do with 13000 years it only gives information on a current event, I never once said it mentions 13000 years. The 13000 years comes from a different source. Joining the two sources of information together you get a cycle of 13000 years between asteroid strikes. You still won&#39;t understand it even after this but that&#39;s okay.

<p>&quot;Why every 20 years?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because look at this article he just murdered again today.&quot;</p>

<p>You still didn&#39;t get it you retard.

    <div class="md"><p>The article is the whole reason why the 13000 year cycle can exist in the first place because it places the next event in current times! If the article stated the next even would be in 1000 years then it would become a 14000 year cycle. If the next even was in 5000 years then it would become a 18000 year cycle. The article placing the next event in current times is the most important piece to making the cycle 13000 years. Hence why it answers the question &quot;why 13000 years?&quot;. It doesn&#39;t need to mention 13000 years to answer that question it only need to determine when the next event will be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets start off by defining the word <em>simulation</em>.</p>

<p>Simulation - is the imitation of the operation of a <strong>real-world</strong> process or system over time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation">Wiki</a></p>

<p>..meaning, there has to be a <strong>reality</strong> for this word to even have any significance! Without this reality, the term <em>simulation</em> (or anything else for that matter) wouldn&#39;t even exist. Our universe is the blueprint for any and all creation, period. </p>

<p>Reader: How do you know that we aren&#39;t already living in a simulation?</p>

<p>Answer: because <strong>our reality</strong> was formed by natural processes over the course of billions of years! You think artificial reality can trump that?!</p>

<p>As others have pointed out in argument: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but &#39;reality&#39; is only what we perceive as being real. With the right coding, we can easily replicate any impulses we experience in this world, in an artificial world. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: True. But nothing changes the fact that it still a superficial version of the original. The artificial you would be made up of a bunch of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s, where as the <strong>real</strong> you is made up of millions (or billions?) of cells, atoms, molecules, etc (organic matter). </p>

<p>Let me explain the purpose of the &#39;cut of the flesh&#39; experiment. By the way, this example can be rephrased in many ways and still yield the same philosophical/ physical conclusion (example: punch to the face, kick to the balls, etc). </p>

<p>Lets say you are Neo in The Matrix (or some random guy with a VR headset) and you decide you want to have some fun in the (hyper realistic) virtual world. After many hours of playing around in the sim world, you forget that you are even in a simulation (every vr gamers nightmare). The only way <strong>&#39;wake up&#39;</strong> is for someone in the real world to inflict enough pain until you become aware of the lie.</p>

<p>So, the whole &#39;cut of the flesh&#39; experiment is not meant to prove that our reality is real (because the whole concept of our existence is already proof of that), but rather, to add emphasis to it so that you may better understand where i am coming from. It&#39;s just my way of saying to someone &#39;wake the fuck up&#39; and realize. The painful and emotional sensation of blood gushing out is the reality check. The sight of blood increases the realness of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when does adding one grain of sand to another grain, become a pile of sand?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is a stupid question (philosophical in nature but stupid nonetheless). this is one of those questions that can never have a definite answer. it is simply a matter of perspective. does an ant consider 3 grains a pile? we sure wouldn&#39;t, but an ant certainly would! would the definition of a pile of sand be determined by it&#39;s weight, or by how large it appears? Or both?</p>

<p>And to answer your final question regarding synthetic synapses.</p>

<p>Would replacing individual synapses over a long period of time change who <em>you</em> are?</p>

<p>No! Synapses are <strong>physical</strong> in nature. Does replacing an arm or a leg make you a different person? How about a cell? The answer will always be no. Anything that is made up of matter can be replaced and can continue to perform the same function it was performing before. The conscious would be unaffected because it is <em>meta</em> physical. That would be like asking a mechanic &quot;If i change the gears on this car, will it still perform the same as it did before?&quot; It would perform the same (or better) because the part is brand new, or worse because the mechanic who installed it sucked. And at the end of the day, it would still be the same car.</p>

<p>In considering your question, i couldn&#39;t help but wonder about some things of my own. </p>

<p>What exactly defines consciousness? Is it simply the collective understanding of information gathered by our five senses?</p>

<p>Can morale be attributed to consciousness, or is it something that is reserved for the spirit? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a distance between physical sensation and cognitive perception.</p>

<p>The change in energy from medium to medium (vibrations, lightwaves, frequencies, chemical structures) before it reaches the appropriate sensory neuron to be carried to the portion of the brain that can interpret that specific stimulus.</p>

<p>All this processing takes place so that you can perceive your &quot;reality.&quot; I say your because it is different for every single individual; well, we can at least assume every individual perceives some kind of reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I said &quot;what if?&quot;<br/>
I never explicitly said I believed the universe is a simulation, lighten up. Second of all a simulation is plausible, in fact at some point in the future it&#39;s almost inevitable. We&#39;re on a path to being able to create some sort of virtual universe ourselves on a grand scale. On the path; how far away? Fuck if I know, but it&#39;s plausible. And you&#39;d probably never know either way if it was good enough. Does an a character in a video game I play know that they&#39;re just a character being played by me? No. Are they self aware? No, but what if to them they actually feel they are self aware? How would you know how a programmed video game character &quot;feels&quot;? I&#39;m not saying video games are to that advanced a point, obviously they&#39;re not. But once we create a truly sentient AI and singularity happens, what happens if that type of AI is in a video game? Does it know it&#39;s AI? Would it know it&#39;s trapped in a game?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in a very mild sense, yes. but it is still a simulation none the less. although the test subjects are interacting with it, it is only by superficial means. the subjects can&#39;t sense anything without those external sensors. the computer is fooling her into thinking its is real, even though it isn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thought of a false reality is a matter of perspective, which if the individual were aware of falseness of the reality they would also need to have prior knowledge of the true reality to base their assumption. </p>

<p>Further, if this individual had this prior knowledge of the true reality they would not be a product of the simulation, but would of existed and held consciousness prior to the simulation’s creation.  </p>

<p>My statement was not intended to disprove or prove we are living in a simulation, rather it was meant to shed light that in either scenario those would not be able to distinguish with absolute certainty reality from a simulation.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t believe we are living in a simulation, in the traditional sense of Bostrom’s original argument, but I can appreciate the logic and reasonableness of the argument. At the very least, the argument points to an omnipotent creator. </p>

This form of consciousness that we are/or were before we created the simulation, do you consider that to be a sort of collective consciousness of many individuals or do you think of it as just one consciousness that spread itself into many beings in our simulated reality?</p>

<p>You could say that we are god. Tho I do not, and have not ever, subscribed to a religion and do not think of it in the same way say a christian would. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I consider it one energy. The current mainstream view of reality is that the big bang produced matter, and from this matter the chemical reactions have eventually brought about conscious beings. I see it the opposite way, that there was consciousness and only a consciousness from which came the big bang. The way i first heard this idea was to imagine nothingness. Sitting to be in nothingness there isn&#39;t anything to do. One cannot even move, without it being in relation to something else. So this consciousness created the bang which created everything. Everything, every possible thing, every timeline, every thought, every being. In this theory all things are consciousness, even rocks, mud and the earth. I hope I&#39;m explaining this well. I certainly don&#39;t have any answers, this is just my current pov. Ill end with what I think with what I think is possible evidence of this. Current science says that the size of all the matter of everything right before it exploded in the big bang, was condensed to an extremely small point, possibly smaller than a mm. But from memory I think it was almost infinitely small. This was the case because at that time it wasn&#39;t matter, it was an idea. How much space does an idea occupy? So how much space would all thoughts of everything occupy? This idea/thought was the point which exploded into this wonderful universe that we can explore. Us discovering our true self.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Apparently Earth&#39;s 6th Mass Extinction Event Underway</strong></p>

<p><strong>Earth’s five previous mass extinctions</strong></p>

<p>End-Ordovician, 443 million years ago</p>

<p>A severe ice age led to sea level falling by 100m, wiping out 60-70% of all species which were prominently ocean dwellers at the time. Then soon after the ice melted leaving the oceans starved of oxygen.</p>

<p>Late Devonian, c 360 million years ago</p>

<p>A messy prolonged climate change event, again hitting life in shallow seas very hard, killing 70% of species including almost all corals.</p>

<p>Permian-Triassic, c 250 million years ago</p>

<p>The big one – more than 95% of species perished, including trilobites and giant insects – strongly linked to massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia that caused a savage episode of global warming.</p>

<p>Triassic-Jurassic, c 200 million years ago</p>

<p>Three-quarters of species were lost, again most likely due to another huge outburst of volcanism. It left the Earth clear for dinosaurs to flourish.</p>

<p>Cretaceous-Tertiary, 65 million years ago</p>

<p>An giant asteroid impact on Mexico, just after large volcanic eruptions in what is now India, saw the end of the dinosaurs and ammonites. Mammals, and eventually humans, took advantage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you settled on 13k years, because if you settled on that number on your own, you should know that there&#39;s a fair bit of chatter in weird shit conspiracy land involving 12.5k 13k and 25.5k~26k cycles pertaining to major changes on earth.</p>

<p>Some claim some sort of weird spiritual/consciousness related event occurs in a roughly cyclical manner having to do with those time frames. Others claim weird astrological or geological activity. There&#39;s claims that create a weird unified version where weirdness in mass human consciousness basically ends up mass manifesting into huge physical disruptions.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a fun bit of conspiracy literature, most discount as a larp. called the Hidden Hand transcript in which the author claims to be a high level member of the secret society that controls earth(they say illuminati is a made up word they don&#39;t actually use, but that it conveys the idea well enough). Anyway, the author claims to be essentially human, but technically from Venus and usually located off-world and gets into some weird cosmological/spiritual stuff where they talk about something they refer to as a cycle of harvests that run on a roughly 26k year cycle. They claimed(before 2012) that the whole 2012 thing wasn&#39;t actually supposed to be a bam poof end of the world type thing, but the official initialization date for a series of increasingly dramatic escalating events that would eventually lead to a &#39;Great Harvest&quot;.</p>

<p>Of course, they claimed that, barring some sort of potential timeline disruption where a less likely timeline ended up &#39;being activated&#39;, 2008/2009 was supposed to feature the rolling out of a new global currency and massive weather and climate catastrophe scenarios. So, either they where a total larp, or they were legit and something weird happened in timeline land and &#39;their&#39; game-plan got stalled out rather dramatically. Interestingly, 2008 is when satoshi published his paper that lead to the creation of bitcoin and there&#39;s been a lot of chatter about a potential crypto based world currency, so one wonders whether maybe there was some, since abandoned/altered, plan to create a crypto based world currency that would go live back around 2009 rather than now.</p>

<p>If you want to go even deeper down that rabbit hole a lot of alleged psychics/mediums/channelers on the internet are rather adamant that something happened in the collective mind-space around that time that disrupted things in a rather big way. A repeated claim that goes around is that something was originally supposed to happen that would basically drop the curtains on life as we presently know it and that the game plan encountered some rather large last minute re-writes and edits that have taken it into uncharted territory that&#39;s been upending a lot of the established rules governing how these cycles are supposed to actually work. Of course, all of this seems like it&#39;s just one giant and bizarre ARG, so I&#39;d use some serious discernment when looking at anything in these spheres, but as far as I&#39;m concerned there is definitely some sort of weirdness going on although I wouldn&#39;t trust anyone who claimed to know one way or another what exactly that weirdness is or what it means.</p>

And why would they be watching us?&quot; Answers: they don&#39;t, they&#39;re already here, and they&#39;re watching us because they <em>are</em> us. </p>

<p>A past civilization became so technologically advanced, that part of them could break away, to either live underground or offworld during the next cataclysm, and then return with the next iteration of humanity, to blend in and rule from the shadows. This could explain many of the past architectural mysteries, and why many accounts of aliens say they look human.</p>

<p>Just a fun idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This theory makes alot of sense to me too, if i put myself in the shoes of someone who has extreme wealth and knew about a reset or apocalypse I&#39;d do that but we only live to sometimes 100, 13,000 years we wouldn&#39;t bother. UFO&#39;s being us from the future is a cool theory too by doing anything to us they&#39;d alter themselves could be why they don&#39;t come hang out if they really are aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always thought something similar to this. Basically that human history goes back a lot further than we think, and throughout this massive history, civilizations have risen that were able to eventually leave the planet. Whether or not they come back and re-seed or visit is up for debate though.</p>

<p>I have another theory that UFO&#39;s and their pilots are simply time travelers from the far future. Sure we get a few UFO&#39;s popping up in modern times, but as of 2018 we&#39;re a pretty well-documented society that time travelers wouldn&#39;t need to be too interested in. I would assume most of them go back to thousands of years ago, to watch the Pyramids be built, figure out what happened during the Bible days, check out undocumented early civilizations, etc. Hence why there&#39;s so many depictions of flying objects in ancient heiroglyphics - the time travelers from the future visiting ancient civilizations out of curiosity have essentially altered the texts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw several people asking about it and the 13,000 number stuck out to me too. The article linked elsewhere in the thread doesn&#39;t mention that specific number. I wonder if perhaps you stumbled onto my recent comment here:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7qsq9f/there_has_been_two_false_missile_alerts_within_a/dst3yvn/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7qsq9f/there_has_been_two_false_missile_alerts_within_a/dst3yvn/</a>  </p>

<p>The 13,000 number was intended to be an estimate of the orbital period of the new planet that has been inferred in the deep solar system out beyond Pluto. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine">Wikipedia</a> lists an estimate of 10,000-20,000 years, but I see other numbers like 15,000. The model that stuck out in my mind which I read about last year was around 13,000 years. In some ways, the exact number doesn&#39;t matter to this conversation, but the question is what would be the mechanism for a periodic doomsday scenario? Why would a problem present itself to us at regular intervals? Well the orbit of a planet is very regular, and if this planet disturbs the Oort cloud every 1X,XXX years, then that would cause us trouble on a well-defined cycle.  </p>

<p>I just want to point out that even if this is true, there is no guarantee that we would be hit with a comet every 1X,XXX years. Space is still really big compared to the Earth. We would primarily get hit with smaller debris that burns up in the atmosphere or causes minimal damage on the ground. But we would expect a couple hundred years with increased chances of impact events and perhaps some pretty brilliant displays in the sky with all of the new comets and more frequent shooting stars.  </p>

<p>I will admit that I have spent some time speculating about how such a thing could relate to megalithic architecture and astrotheological myths as a way of warning future generations about this long cycle. </p>

<p>My point is that if i were to accept such paltry evidence i&#39;d be forced to believe in things ranging from the moon landings being faked to the flat earth and creationism and the Bernstein bears being evidence of parallel worlds. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  That&#39;s not how it works.  Earth humans have <em>been</em> space bound for quite some time.  It&#39;s just that the 99% isn&#39;t given that information and isn&#39;t allowed to know about the facet of humanity that is in fact space bound already at this point.</p>

<p>This iteration of humanity has been in space since at least as far back as Dwight D. Eisenhower&#39;s time, and there is a <em>lot</em> of information showing that humans have been space faring for a lot further back still.</p>

<p>And as far as 13K year cycles, read up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga">Yugas</a>.  There are in fact cycles that the planet goes through, but they&#39;re a LOT longer and more vast than 13K years.</p>

It makes a lot of sense when you look at everything over the course of history. Maybe some DID make it but not all of them at the time made it off Earth - or maybe they&#39;re inside(think hollow earth theory) - which would make a lot of sense. </p>

<p>You were a civ that found information about this trend and decided it would be best to survive inside the planet with the technology you had rather than leave it. Seems a LOT easier IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe. i have thought about this often too. but i don&#39;t think we are meant to ever leave earth. let me explain. from a biblical stand point, if God created man and creatures (through the natural process of evolution) and the earth (through terraforming) for mans pleasure, then he did so with the intent of having us remain on earth to tend his garden (when it was know as Eden). Thus leaving us captured in this natural cycle of life. If we were to try to leave Earth, then we would be doing so with the idea that all there is to life is surviving against the odds. That would mean our very existence is pointless (not divine) and we only exist to try and make it as far as we can in this physical universe. But why bother? We all have to die at some point. So why try to escape the inevitable? Even if we were to leave this planet in search of a new one, then we would simply end up destroying that planet too the same way we are destroying earth. With out the idea of God, we are like cancerous parasites, consuming any resource we can get a hold of for the simple purposing of surviving. </p>

<p>Is god is an single metaphysical being in another dimension, or a collective body of advanced aliens that found man in a Neanderthal-like state and gifted him a <strong>spirit</strong>, setting us apart from other creatures?</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas_impact_hypothesis">Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis</a></p>

<p>&quot;The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis or Clovis comet hypothesis originally proposed that a large air burst or earth impact of one or more comets initiated the Younger Dryas cold period about 12,900 BP calibrated (10,900 14C uncalibrated) years ago.[1][2][3] The hypothesis has been contested by research showing that most of the conclusions cannot be repeated by other scientists, and criticized because of misinterpretation of data and the lack of confirmatory evidence.[4][5][6][7]</p>

<p>The current impact hypothesis states that the air burst(s) or impact(s) of a swarm of carbonaceous chondrites or comet fragments set areas of the North American continent on fire, causing the extinction of most of the megafauna in North America and the demise of the North American Clovis culture after the last glacial period.[8] The Younger Dryas ice age lasted for about 1,200 years before the climate warmed again. This swarm is hypothesized to have exploded above or possibly on the Laurentide Ice Sheet in the region of the Great Lakes, though no impact crater has yet been identified and no physical model by which such a swarm could form or explode in the air has been proposed. Nevertheless, the proponents suggest that it would be physically possible for such an air burst to have been similar to, but orders of magnitude larger than, the Tunguska event of 1908. The hypothesis proposed that animal and human life in North America not directly killed by the blast or the resulting coast-to-coast wildfires would have likely starved on the burned surface of the continent.&quot; -wikipedia</p>

<p>your theory could hold true on a much larger timeline, like millions of years.</p>

<p>dinsosaur extinction was 65 million yrs ago.</p>

<p>that could have been a prior iteration, albeit one that would have had a different evolutionary outcome.</p>

<p>the age of plants was def an iteration. Plants used to be massive, they created the oxygen and atmosphere of the planet. Then came dinosaurs , eating the plants, making them grow defenses for the first time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the book <em>three-body problem</em> has a similar (underlying/origin?) plot. there is a habitable planet that spawns life but gets &quot;reset&quot; every X number of years (it varies due to the variance in a system such as this, so one iteration might be 50 years and the next 50,000) and in a nutshell the race is for each iteration of intelligent life to try and predict when the next reset will happen and figure out a way to preserve themselves before it happens. this plot isn&#39;t central to the story in the book so don&#39;t go pick it up if you want to read about that (it would be like watching a generic batman movie because you were interested in bruce wayne&#39;s parents being murdered), but it is the trigger or cause behind the main story.</p>

<p>We have not truly gained our consciousness because we cannot remember. We are still at the mercy of our programming. If you don&#39;t think you are, just look at the feelings you get when you stare at an image, or smell the scent of food. That is programming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>covering a lot in a few paragraphs, but....</p>

<p>This ties into the whole Venus theory that an ancient advanced civilization of ten thousand or so humans left Earth about 13k to 15k years ago to escape a solar system wide catastrophe and went to Venus in a ship [possibly] called Atlantis to survive because of the atmosphere. </p>

<p>It goes that Venus actually has a nice climate with a protective atmosphere as legend tells us and as we believed all the way until the 60&#39;s, and therefor we&#39;re being lied to and is why we&#39;ve only ever sent two probes with only a handful of fake pictures. </p>

<p>Theory says they have visited us for thousands of years since [the UFO&#39;s] but they see us as a problematic sub-species creature much like the neanderthal was to us because the humans that survived went back to do or die survival caveman days and warring for power over resources and we have followed that path until now. So as we&#39;ve became far more aggressive than them they have spent the same time developing a continually more passive and peaceful civilization that has grown their knowledge even more. </p>

<p>Says they&#39;ve been slowly guiding a select group of ruling elites [possibly a handful of them that came back] since Babylon so that one day they could gather up large groups to join them when the event gets close to happening again [soon], but the elites have done nothing but use the advanced knowledge for war and destruction and power to rule the Earth from being the scenes instead. Now they&#39;ve basically given up on us and are just trying to clone some of us on Venus to save our sub-species much like we try to save animals going extinct. </p>

<p>While this sounds sci-fi and ridiculous, dismissing something bc it just &quot;sounds far-fetched&quot; is illogical. </p>

<p>In my research on this tech, I came across this: </p>

<p><strong>The Mind Has No Firewall</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Anisimov, psychotronic weapons are those that act to &quot;take away a part of the information which is stored in a man&#39;s brain. It is sent to a computer, which reworks it to the level needed for those who need to control the man, and the modified information is then reinserted into the brain.&quot; These weapons are used against the mind to induce hallucinations, sickness, mutations in human cells, &quot;zombification,&quot; or even death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a firm believer that military tech is decades ahead of civilians, so while &quot;futurists&quot; like Google Engineer Kurzweil see the uploading of the soul as an inevitability in the very near future, I consider it likely that the Black Budget crowd already have access to the tech. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So basically, we are God?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could say that we are god. Tho I do not, and have not ever, subscribed to a religion and do not think of it in the same way say a christian would. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you consider that to be a sort of collective consciousness of many individuals or do you think of it as just one consciousness that spread itself into many beings in our simulated reality?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I consider it one energy. The current mainstream view of reality is that the big bang produced matter, and from this matter the chemical reactions have eventually brought about conscious beings. I see it the opposite way, that there was consciousness and only a consciousness from which came the big bang. The way i first heard this idea was to imagine nothingness. Sitting to be in nothingness there isn&#39;t anything to do. One cannot even move, without it being in relation to something else. So this consciousness created the bang which created everything. Everything, every possible thing, every timeline, every thought, every being. In this theory all things are consciousness, even rocks, mud and the earth. I hope I&#39;m explaining this well. I certainly don&#39;t have any answers, this is just my current pov. Ill end with what I think with what I think is possible evidence of this. Current science says that the size of all the matter of everything right before it exploded in the big bang, was condensed to an extremely small point, possibly smaller than a mm. But from memory I think it was almost infinitely small. This was the case because at that time it wasn&#39;t matter, it was an idea. How much space does an idea occupy? So how much space would all thoughts of everything occupy? This idea/thought was the point which exploded into this wonderful universe that we can explore. Us discovering our true self.</p>
