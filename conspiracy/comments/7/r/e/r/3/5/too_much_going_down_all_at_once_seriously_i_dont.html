        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just stop...and think...just for a minute.</p>

<p>Large false flags occur when several interests or more are served.</p>

<p>Right now is the time to be listing all of the &quot;interests&quot; that would be served. Listing all of the scenarios that could come about.</p>

<p>For an example...we know the military industrial complex is always striving for the next major conflict...war is money...plain and simple..</p>

<p>Crypto-currencies are becoming a serious threat to the established paradigm...imo</p>

<p>We have a huge brawl going on within our government where it&#39;s looking like its possible that many people in both major political parties and federal agencies such as the FBI/CIA/DOJ could be taken down if the truth comes out.</p>

<p>This is not good...Many of us have come to the conclusion that when the &quot;system&quot; feels seriously threatened they have no compunction whatsoever in creating an event that results in a outcome that is in &quot;their&quot; best interests. </p>

<p>How convenient would it be to frame a hostile country for attacking the US in &quot;some manner&quot;...and say that it was done at a time when our government was critically weak due to infighting? Due to the mistrust of its citizens in their government?</p>

<p>Seriously...wouldn&#39;t it be just like &quot;them&quot; to blame &quot;us&quot; for our mistrust in them as the reason for what &quot;they&quot; want to actually happen...happen?</p>

<p>Nuclear missile? Large scale EMP attack? Large scale cyber attack?</p>

<p>Heads on a swivel...is what I&#39;m sayin...I know it&#39;s been beat to death on this sub...but holy crap...too much is happening all at once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the World Socialist Web Site (no, I&#39;m not a socialist, but I read what they say), there are two camps in the government: those that want to go to war with North Korea and by extension, China. And those that want to take out Russian first. The anti-China camp includes the Republicans while the anti-Russia camp includes the Democrats. Basically, from what the conclusion that I&#39;ve so far reached over time, the deep state is in conflict with itself. Or as the WSWS would put it, the state is simply at war with itself. Whether you want to call it the &quot;deep state&quot; or just the state is up to you, but it seems that for now, there is confusion in the ranks of our enemy. At least, that&#39;s what I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been this way since November of &#39;16. We have multiple groups of Elites now openly fighting for control while the Republic continues to rot away beneath them. Also, WSWS is a great anti-establishment site even if people don&#39;t agree with their politics. Their articles are far better than the Corporate Propaganda trash so many consume. And, they were targeted by Googles new algorithm that pushed their search results farther back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Yes, I agree that the WSWS is a great site to go to. I would also recommend Wikispooks, though I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s already pretty well-known around these parts. Hopefully I can make a thread that can gain some traction where we can list all the alternative news websites that we know about.</p>

<p>Anyway, yeah, basically it&#39;s a fight for the empire&#39;s next move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly...but boil this down all the way to an outcome..either outcome...war.</p>

<p>What interests get served by this outcome? Money? Population reduction? Global control? Resources? </p>

<p>Are we there? Are we at the point where robots/automation make it possible to justify population reduction to sick minds?</p>

<p>Are we at the point where it&#39;s a battle for the remaining resources..all or nothing?</p>

<p>Do they just not care...whatever makes more money?</p>

<p>Are all interests served by a global war?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this isn&#39;t just about the fear that govt and media inject into our lives. This is about studying and understanding history so we can anticipate the future.

<p>on the one hand if they emp us back into the stone age or start a major war(s) then unleash the aliens i would understand that. some people would be isolated and scared and willing to accept whatever a &quot;authority&quot; would tell them.</p>

<p>but on the other hand if they wanted to keep Trump and the mainstream media machine going to announce the arrival of aliens i would understand that too.</p>

<p>Oh man, the utter chaos that would ensue. Many would accept the new authority, but places like the US would be a shit show. You think a nation with more guns than citizens is going to calmly accept alien authority after being EMP&#39;d back to the stone age? There would be violence and killing not only among ourselves but against any alien force that attempted to take control.</p>

<p>They could probably dominate the coasts and the big cities, but the countryside, Midwest, Great Plains and the South would be a living hell for man and alien alike. GLHF with that one, honestly. </p>

<p>The main thing will be about who is to blame.    Iran,  NK,  Russia,  China,   but not the scum that takes the money and runs.    No,   those guys will have had nothing to do with setting this mess up and distracting us with shitholes and fake investigations.    Those guys are going to look the most surprised of all,   and the MSM will be rolling in advertising money while they spout an official lie that is being cooked up by &quot;reliable sources&quot;  inside of &quot;trustworthy intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>You can almost smell it cooking.   What you are smelling is just the prelude.    Don&#39;t let these MOFOs set the agenda.    They aren&#39;t the ones being slow cooked,   it the people who are.    We are a long way off as a nation,   from being willing to hear the truth.    The country still wants a lie.</p>

In June and August. And then after the attack claimed responsibility four times… Something’s not adding up… I’m just telling you I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus...</p>

<p>Basically both sides are hoping the reigns of power are taken by their guy so as to deter nuclear annihilation. But many see a nuclear holocaust as all but assured because of the potential evil behind the scenes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I dont get is, Germany back in the day printed their own money just like USA does today, yet they were punished for that and their currency devalued. USA is at 20fucking trillion now? How long can they keep it up, russia paid off all their debt to the west and now look, russia phobia is back on the menu. </p>

<p>Now lets be realistic here, the way US is going is wasteful, unsustainable and as an empire is clearly shifting into collapse(the empire of today, the collapse is going to be akin to russia of the 90s) Now, the way they are planning to pay back this debt is either winning over the globe (800 billion more ontop of already the most costly military than the rest of the wealthiest 12 countries combined in next 7-8 years...) and ww3 is in now way going to be possible against nuclear states, and destabilizing powerful nations like russia, china, even india with terrorism and social manipulation just isnt working. and/or they are planning to automate, and from there its literally easy money for corporate elite and their stakeholders (one of which is the US government). </p>

<p>But US still faces a major hurdle, their lack of governance, letting free market mantra and individualism guide the country is creating tension. Atm its still working, as devide and conquer between all the different sociocultural classes still exists. But the middle class has shrunk and is disappearing entirely, that kind of social instability can be negated for so long. Atm there are social justice movements, racial, political, economical dramas going on. And with the morally ill capitalists at the helm of the gov, adding more shit to worry about already overworked, overstressed nation is easy. They already went after Net neutrality, and completely ignore the healthcare issues, and just watch if NN gets put back, and then there will another issue pop up to avoid discussions on serious issues (If i had to guess it would probably be weed again, just look they already started making strides towards it).</p>

<p>Now when automation does arrive there is a large chance that the lives of most americans will get a lot better. But also the road to that better life, will be paved in painstaking economic upheaval as millions of americans go back to learning in order to repurpose themselves into the new order. What does it mean for the rest of the world, well. Socialism of some sort is on the horizon, so much talk about universal income.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because socialism works, look at USSR in the early 1900s it was considered backwards, after ww2 it was rival to US, and it was affected by ww2, where as USA was not. China in 40 is also rising and becoming better to live in, and look because of a communist gov they set a target of solar, they achieved it, they setting a target to get all electric cars by 2025 or something, they will reach it. </p>

<p>You see the great theft of the american people happened many times, firts slavery, then the federal reserve is private, their tax money isnt going to their own county, its going to the war efforts. Their system just isnt working. To be fair socialism that stalin brought in was not working nad lenin knew it wouldnt. Hence the whole perestroika, which i guess took off, but then by the 90s didnt, long story short. Russia after putin took over in 2000s clawed its way back. </p>

<p>So yes, americans have been indoctrinated, blindfolded and lied to so often that its hard to see the truth from the the bullshit, and their lives are enslaved to a system where wokring all their lives and no legally mandated minimum wage or holidays, people go bankrupt if a medical emergency arises. And the, my all time saddest known thing, the military was supposed to be that helped of social support russia and other nations have. Medicare, education, retirement. But that too has been stolen and veterans are left to die on the streets. </p>

<p>Russia phobia is in such a swing, just go around reddit, anything regarding russia and top comments are always the same. Putin evil dictator, russia evil militarising and ruthless killings. Whilst USA stomps around the world committing war crimes, the people in USA are more worried about ukraine which USA orchestrated, than they are about their own nation, their own people, their neighbours homeless, starving, and bankrupt due to medical bills. They are saying right now that another gov shutdown is looming, right, and 3 months into the new medicaid health insurance for children isnt even set up or funded so children in USA are also in the same boat with medical. </p>

<p>So yes, the 1 percent movement was shutdown in USA and in its place so many social justice black lives matter, weed, net neutrality, just distractions, for the divided nation. Its really is scary what has become of USA. Now realise that if this continues and china and russia succeed int he silk road, US dollar might loose its reserve currency status and yen is close atm, US will collapse and go into a recession (and many economists are warning thta a recession is almost here). </p>

<p>TLDR usa knows how to lie and manipulate the people, to a point that injustice happens under their noses but they are caught in a system that they cant escape from if they want to continue on living (eating, housing, stuff). </p>

<p>on the one hand if they emp us back into the stone age then unleash the aliens i would understand that. some people would be isolated and scared and willing to accept whatever a &quot;authority&quot; would tell them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh man, the utter chaos that would ensue. Many would accept the new authority, but places like the US would be a shit show. You think a nation with more guns than citizens is going to calmly accept alien authority after being EMP&#39;d back to the stone age? There would be violence and killing not only among ourselves but against any alien force that attempted to take control.</p>

<p>They could probably dominate the coasts and the big cities, but the countryside, Midwest, Great Plains and the South would be a living hell for man and alien alike. GLHF with that one, honestly. </p>
