       it reminds me of what i read about snapchat filters, but this it just seems like who cares. theyre not even really accurate and theyre just uploading your face and analyzing it.

       That's exactly what it is. Private companies are able to do things US citizens would never allow their government to do...because "they're just businesses, bro!". Businesses with a known history of cooperating with the government and handing over data carte blanche...fools.

       I think we could position argument to apply pressure on the Federal Trade Commission. It is their job to ensure consumer protection. I'd argue by extension, that we are consumers of social media and we require protection from the over zealous tech companies that take our data with impunity.

       Arguably. We choose to use the service/tech, but we don't agree to having our data mined and then compiled, aggregated, then sold to bad people. We don't even know, most of us don't, that the data is being mined at all. So, yes, we like apps, and we like convenience and novelty, but no, we don't agree with any awareness to the surveillance.

       There's a reason you can't use it in states like Illinois. They have strict biometrics laws. This should be a HUGE red flag!

      <p>
       TL;DR
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act mandates that companies collecting such information obtain prior consent from consumers, detailing how they’ll use it and how long it will be kept. It also allows private citizens to sue, while other states have laws that let only the attorney general bring a lawsuit.

       My brother was in the military and did a tour overseas and worked with facial recognition software, when he came back he deleted all his social media accounts. Cause it freaked him out with how it worked.

       Amazon got it's start selling books. Not because they thought books would be lucrative, but because they believed that people who read books are the types of customers they wanted to chase after. The bookstore was basically a data mining operation where books were sold at a loss to create a database of smart wealthy customers.

       Make it sound fun enough and many people in the population will feed the surveillance data crunchers all the data they’d like. Beyond surveillance, this could be used against people in the most wicked ways through photo manipulation or framing

       I was gonna say nothing to see here, because any smart phone user they probably have data on, but then I went to Google photos to confirm that they do already know it's me, and it asked me this question:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Which one is you? Facial recognition helps us to, blah, blah, blah"...
      </p>
      <p>
       Along with things like the Apple and facebook facial recognition that already creeped me out, yeah, this seems like an innocent looking shortcut.

       It could be Google's way of testing their next Pixel phones face recognition without the special infra red hardware(that iPhone x has). Google needs more random and organic faces to test their prototype. Maybe!
