<p>I think we could position argument to apply pressure on the Federal Trade Commission. It is their job to ensure consumer protection.

<p>Arguably. We choose to use the service/tech, but we don&#39;t agree to having our data mined and then compiled, aggregated, then sold to bad people. We don&#39;t even know, most of us don&#39;t, that the data is being mined at all. So, yes, we like apps, and we like convenience and novelty, but no, we don&#39;t agree with any awareness to the surveillance. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-google-art-selfies-20180116-story.html">Would You Like To Know More?</a></p>

<p>TL;DR </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act mandates that companies collecting such information obtain prior consent from consumers, detailing how they’ll use it and how long it will be kept. It also allows private citizens to sue, while other states have laws that let only the attorney general bring a lawsuit.</p>
