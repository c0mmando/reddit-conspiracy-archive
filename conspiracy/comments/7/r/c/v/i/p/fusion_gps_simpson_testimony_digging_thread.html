        MR. SIMPSON: I didn't say that. What I said was it was credible at the
time it came in. We were able to corroborate various things that supported its
credibility.

        MR. ROONEY: Well, do you know now if anything's false?

        MR. GOWDY: Mr. Simpson, were you aware that Perkins Coie was
retained by the DNC?
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SIMPSON: I'm aware. I was aware of that and have been for years
that they have -- they were one of the main lawyers for the Democratic party, yes.
I don't have any specific awareness -
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. GOWDY: That wasn't my precise question. With respect to this fact
pattern, with respect to your firm being retained, were you aware that Perkins Coie
was working on behalf of the DNC?
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SIMPSON: Yes. I mean, I know that they are - the DNC is a client
of Perkins Coie. I don't - I didn't see it -- nobody gave me a document or
informed me specifically of that.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. GOWDY: I'm looking at a release from Perkins Coie that is giving me
more information than you are. Have you seen the release where they released
you from some of your confidentiality obligations?
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SIMPSON: I would like to see a copy of that, if you don't mind.
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. GOWDY: Do your lawyers not have it?
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SIMPSON: It's been a busy time. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry if I'm not
giving you a clear answer. I knew it was the DNC that we were working for.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        MR. GOWDY: Were you able to vet or corroborate or contradict any of the
sources or subsources?
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SIMPSON: We did get into assessing the credibility of the sources
and whether they were in a position to know the things that they were saying. I
didn't ask for the specific identities of specific people. Some people, I think I know
who they are for other reasons. But that's about as much as I can say.
We did a lot of -- when the first reports came In, we did a lot of discussing of
whether this was credible information. And obviously, evaluating human
Intelligence is not the same thing as looking at documents. And so it's a much
trickier process and the thresholds are different. And so what you're really trying
to do, which is kind of like interviewing in journalism, is figure out whether there's
reason to think that what's being said is credible. And so we did a lot of that.

       <p>
        MR. GOWDY: Yes, I'm sure we will get into that. My other question is,
was there anything not included in your report that you concluded was wrong? In
other words, I think my primary question was, is there anything that Steele, his
sources or subsources told you that you didn't include because you immediately
found it to be incredible? And I think your answer was no.
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SIMPSON: That is correct. My answer to that is no...
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. GOWDY: And how did you assess the reliability of that information,
given the fact that you did not talk to the sources or subsources?
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SIMPSON: So it's obviously a challenging thing to assess human
intelligence, field interviews, and it is different from looking at a lawsuit. But there
are similarities to the interview process in journalism, where there are elements of
people, what people say that you can check... And in a way, it is like journalism, because they are somewhat rigid in
reporting what sources in the field are saying, and, you know, they - they don't do
a lot of the -- this is what this guy said, but we don't think it's true or we believe this
or we believe that he might have gotten the data wrong. They just - it's a kind of
a here's what they said type report.

were doing work for Free Beacon?
       </p>

        MR. SIMPSON: It was one of the first things we found. And I should
emphasize, it was, you know -- originally I saw it in the New York Times article, so
it. wasn't a great investigative discovery. But then when I read into it and I found
depositions in which he was, you know, more than evasive about the relationship,
that's when I got really interested.
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SCHIFF: So during the period of time you were working for Free

business ties in Russia, including those with Felix Sater.
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SIMPSON: Yep, that's correct. And lots of other issues came up
during the primaries that raised concerns in my mind about whether there might be
connections -- Donald Trump might have unexplained connections to Russia or
people involved in that part of the world.

He is an interesting person who crosses over from Brexit, UKIP, Trump, and the Turkey-Russia issue. And then the last thing I would add is, you know, we haven't talked about Deutsche Bank at all. You know, I think they obviously know a fair bit. But they are obviously within your subpoena power, and I am assuming you probably already asked them to provide information.

       Relevant to today’s news about the FBI looking into the NRA and Torshin, see my earlier post today about Trump answering Butina’s question about Russian policy at a 2015 rally in Vegas by indicating that he’d drop sanctions if given the chance
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        MS. SPEIER: Okay. What is the interest of Russia with the National Rifle Association?
       </p>
       <p>
        MR. SIMPSON: I think that most of what we have found is pretty much out there now. You know, it's been said by others, but, you know, what eventually - it appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA And there is more than one explanation for why. But I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.
       </p>
       <p>
        And so there is a Russian banker-slash-Duma member-slash-Mafia leader named Alexander Torshin who is a life member of the NRA. And we spent a lot of time investigating Mr. Torshin.And he is well known to Spanish law enforcement for money laundering activity, and you have probably seen the press articles. And I think the Spanish files on him should be available to you.And he, as you know, was supposed to have a meeting with President Trump after the inauguration. And somebody noticed that there had been some stories about him that weren't pretty good .
       </p>
       <p>
        So he is one of the more important figures, but, you know, another woman with whom he was working, Maria Butina, also was a big Trump fan in Russia, and then suddenly showed up here and started hanging around the Trump transition after the election and rented an apartment and enrolled herself at AU,which I assume gets you a visa.

       "Laundering"?  The RNC, and then the DNC paid Fusion GPS directly for that opposition research.

       You got that wrong.  DNC paid for what was created in US by RNC.  DNC paid legal firm to fusion to Kremlin.  DNC paid RUSSIA.  If you don't agree - you will soon when its being mentioned all over the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Read this testimony.  Where did this information come from Hawaii? How much was paid and who paid that bill?  Who is the legal firm.  Simpson says DNC is still a client.

       So they paid a legal firm and Fusion, both of which are US companies?  What evidence is there that this went to the Kremlin?

       Evidence it went to Kremlin?  Did you read on the roles of the sources involved?  People of the Kremlin were involved.  Don't you find it odd that Don Jr's meeting with Kremlin staff had conversations with Fusion before meeting Don Jr?

       People from the Kremlin were involved with what?  Give specific sources, I don't know what you are talking about.  If someone is doing research on Trump's shady business dealings in Russia, it kinda has to involve some Russians at some point.  Nothing you are describing even comes remotely close to money laundering.  What evidence do you even have that the money was from illegal activities?
      </p>

       I have no problem with immigrants.  A lot of people troll threads like these pretending to be Russians - just making sure you weren't.

       You mean if someone is doing SHADY research on false information they would need to collaborate with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who the fuck said paid for by illegal activities?  Do you not know the definition of LAUNDERING payment means? I pay you to pay someone who pays someone else.  That is LAUNDERING payments.  It is a process used to hid your involvement.  Why hide involvement?

       That is not what money laundering is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point of money laundering is that the money is from criminal activity - i.e. "dirty money".  That's why you "launder" (clean) it.  That is the actual definition, you can't make a new one because it fits your narrative.  Here is the wiki link again since you obviously didn't read it the first time:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Paying a company to do work for you, and then the use that money to hire people is not money laundering.  Not even a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how is the research "shady"?  And if it is false information, why would you even research it?  They could have just made it up without paying anyone.  You make no sense.

       No no.   By claiming "conservative groups and NRA" are infiltrated by Russians without any name or motive gives them a reason to do surveillance.  These guys are slimeballs.  They are out for the good of the people.  Everything is politically motivated.

       The Maginitsky act is important because when Trump Jr said they just talked about adoptions in that Trump Tower meeting. That's what they talked about. Because Russia banned Americans from adopting Russians in response to that act.

       which sanctions in particular are you referring to? I’ve provided sources, are you able to do the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       either way, Trump doesn’t say anything about particular sanctions or specific policy, he just says we don’t need them, which fits in his policy aims to unilaterally drop sanctions against Russia that

       so to be clear - you think the sanctions he’s discussing in a 2015 speech at the beginning of his campaign are the sanctions placed upon Russia for interfering in the 2016 election?

       Actually I misread the thread and thought he was talking about the election sanctions -- retracted that comment. Interesting to read the Torshin/FBI articles with this part of the testimony, will need to look into it further.

       he stalks and harasses any user who thinks there is evidence that Trump colluded with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can tell it's him because he uses similar usernames, goes through people's post histories trying to expose them, and uses lots of emojis.
      </p>
      <p>
       he has also admitted to ban evasion multiple times.

       I think you are confused, he didn't leak the dossier during the election so there is no question of influencing. He could have leaked it but instead went to the FBI, that's kind of professional.

       It rubs me the wrong way.  It is similar to my feeling on the idea of "conspiracy theorist".  Words that have an emotional basis instead of a logical basis are very lowbrow.

       Well, people like Alex Jones with their nonsense do give conspiracy theorists a bad name and people who see conspiracies in everything are a problem too. My standard is that a conspiracy is good if it's hard to refute it, so argue against it till you yourself can't doubt it. Very rarely do I see a good conspiracy.

       By definition, a law enforcement officer investigating a crime that was perpetrated by more than one person would be a "conspiracy theorist".  Language is a powerful tool of manipulation is my main gripe. Most people on this forum are searching for corruption at the highest reaches of power.  We are not trying to perpetuate baseless arguments like "flat earth".  We are seriously trying to help mankind by making everyone accountable.

       I am talking things like Pizzagate and Sandy Hook, there are good conspiracies like JFK and there are these kind where people just amuse themselves by making shit up and the funny thing is that people who claim to be against pedoes would then go to any lengths to defend someone like Moore or even Trump who has his own creepy behavior towards young girls.

       You are clearly judging the veracity of conspiracies with a partisan motive. I don't believe in either, but I also would never isolate the two poster childs (of the left) to discredit conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is a lot of creepy stuff that happened with regards to politicians of all colors.  I think it would be naive to assume that anyone is immune in this current climate, and I think the people who argue about  "pizzagate" have some fair points.  There is a lot of dark/twisted stuff that needs to be explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think things have to be explained in the Moore and Trump camp as well. With regards to a lot of these issues you just have to look at like detectives would... Who has the motive in the situation?  What is the evidence? Are there reasons to question the veracity of the claims due to the people making them? The list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Critical thinking does not have a political motive.  It searches for the facts and the evidence.  That's what I try to do.

       Can say that because most of conspiracy is right wing, they pretend to be non partisan but most of it is to simply attack left and the Democrats, it's just the demographic. I am a realist, I don't pretend something that isn't.

       I never viewed pizzagate as isolated in the rights camp.  The idea is that it involves people in the highest reaches of power, kind of like the [Franklin Coverup](np.reddit.com
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/6b4kus/for_all_the_pizzagate_doubters_you_must_first/">
        /r/conspiracy/comments/6b4kus/for_all_the_pizzagate_doubters_you_must_first/

       ), the

        Dutroux Affair
       </a>
       , the recent sexual assault claims made in Hollywood, etc.  There are a lot of examples that add weight to the claim that this is occurring.  Whether it involves pizza is another rabbit hole that I don't believe is true.

       That is completely inaccurate.  Before the last election, [most conspiracies](np.reddit.com

        /r/conspiracy/comments/4g7jay/updated_compilation_of_confirmed_conspiracy/

       ) did not belong to a political party.  Most still don't today, but some of the ones getting the most attention are political in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the word conspiracy theory instantly causes suspicion about something (which it should not).  Trump-Russia connection is a conspiracy.  Julian Assange being holed up in an embassy is a conspiracy, etc.

       Here is the best part:
SIMPSON: ...So what I think the misconception is, is that, you know, Chris has got people -- or Chris calls people up and says, "I'll give you $5,000 if you tell me what's going on with the Trump operation." And that didn't happen.

      <p>
       MR. ROONEY: Are you sure?

       MR. SIMPSON: Well, I've asked Chris about it, and he said it doesn't -- didn't happen.

       This, I believe, will become way more significant in coming days. This tells me they were spying in the primaries. What do you want to bet that they didn’t put all of their eggs in the “Trump wins the primaries” basket. They were doing 702 “about inquiries” way before the FISA warrant
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Page 34+ on Fusion beginning research into Trump's Russia ties during their time working for the Free Beacon
MR. SCHIFF: During the time that you·were doing work for Free Beacon, you had mentioned some work in the first phase. You had discovered business relationships with Felix Sater and Bayrock. By first phase, do you mean while you were doing work for Free Beacon?
MR. SIMPSON: It was one of the first things we found. And I should emphasize, it was, you know -- originally I saw it in the New York Times article, so it. wasn't a great investigative discovery. But then when I read into it and I found depositions in which he was, you know, more than evasive about the relationship, that's when I got really interested.
MR. SCHIFF: So during the period of time you were working for Free Beacon, you came across some of the first information about candidate Trump's business ties in Russia, including those with Felix Sater.
        <strong>
         MR. SIMPSON: Yep, that's correct. And lots of other issues came up during the primaries that raised concerns in my mind about whether there might be connections -- Donald Trump might have unexplained connections to Russia or people involved in that part of the world.

       This doesn't seem to be saying that he wants to protect his sources by not naming names....it sounds like he did not even confirm the actual identities of the people who provided the information to begin with.

       So, assuming for a moment that Mr. Simpson is genuinely on the Up and Up, how can he even be sure he's not the victim of some wild intelligence operation that was feeding him this information through sources he didn't even confirm the identities of?
