       yeah, that's what these geniuses can't seem to get - even if one accepts everything about the blatantly absurd "election hacking" narrative at face value, the hypocrisy is f-ing incredible. They seem to really believe that a facebook ad is equivalent to a coup.

       yup. but what explains it - just natural stupidity on a mass scale? i dont think thats the only cause. they've been trying to make people stupid by denying them education and feeding them junk food - there is a CULT of stupidity in the US, at least.

       to continue the cult analogy, people have haven't just "drank the koolaid" they've dunked their entire beings in a toxic soup of different koolaids - but I don't think it's unique to the US

       You don't think Cunt Face Hillary laundered billions through the Clinton Foundation? What about all the Spirit Cooking? Either way. 24/7 of media propaganda and the only thing
That has really happened is that one guy who managed Trump's campaign for like a month got indicted for money laundering he did years before the election.

       I didn't say she should be thrown in jail. But it should be investigated. I knew that you would zero in on the Spirit Cooking comment. What is up with you people being such huge pedophile apologist? Nothing brings the paid shills out and the brain washed drones like mentioning Cheese Pizza.

       Well let's see, Trumps criminal campaign manager was charged for money laundering. Why did Trump hire a ciminal with deep ties to Russian money laundering? Papadopulous was charged with lying to the FBI about connections to Russia. Flynn took a plea deal for lying to the FBI about Russia. He got a potential 60 year jail sentence reduced to 6 months, so that doesn't come cheap. Were you under the impression that Russia had nothing to do with any of these indictments?

       What ties to Russian money?  He had connections to a Ukraine Group (as did Hillary's campaign manager who also flirts with not registering as FARA) that is favorable towards Russia.  All the transactional detail is long before Trump ran for President for Manafort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Flynn, there is literally no evidence of Russian collusion.

       That's not true at all though.  Manafort's ties are to the Ukraine (as did Gates/Podesta Group).  The charges are stated to have nothign to do with the Trump campaign (same for Gates).

       Papadopolous, jury is still out on that dope.  As far as I can tell, he got player in a major way.  Who was the ISraeli diplomat that set up the meeting with the Aussie guy?  Anyone know?  From the evidence available though, it looks like he was eager to get the team in on this email info he had and no one responded to him.  Further, it proves the Trump team had nothing to do with the emails if Russia was apparently delivering breadcrumbs to someone to grab their attention RE emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       RE Flynn, I'm pretty ok about that because I'm curious to find out what the basis of his being surveilled was that the FBI would know about his conversations with Kislyak.  It's completely normal and standard for an incoming team to have conversations with foreign nations and especially nations the incoming team intends to approach differently.  Wondering if this was oneo f the over 200 instances of Samantha Power requesting unmasking in the lead up to the election.

       Well two of the people charged are cooperating with the FBI now and they just got Bannon spooked too. It's funny that people write off these criminal indictments as nothing but I'm pretty sure if anybody connected to Hillary or Obama got criminally indicted, people would be singing every single day about how the walls are closing in.

       So you're assuming a large group of people all unified in feeling the same way which then leads you to believe they are suspicious. This is exactly way the investigation is retarded even if there is wrong doing. You're making assumptions and telling people what they think and feel. Why is someone not allowed to ridicule something they feel deserves it? Because it upsets you or goes against your regurgitated narrative? Why is someone automatically a Trump supporter because they don't support an investigation over a year later with nothing but weak at best signs of
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       collusion (which is not a crime).

       the "fruit" is obviously the multiple members of Trump's administration who have been charged with crimes based on discoveries made during Mueller's investigation:

       They are "fruit leading to other fruit" because these charges are likely being used to force these people to give evidence that would lead to charges against more of those involved.

       The investigation is ongoing, and only Trump-associated people are making any claims that it is pointless. Actual Americans who care about their country want the investigation to proceed as it should so we can uncover any other possible misdeeds.

       All of your comments are full of ignorant hugely generalizing assumptions about almost half the country.

      <p>
       But fair enough - I don't consider that "fruit" at all but you won't be replying to me cause you're so knowledgeable so good day. Keep reading mainstream media and eating it up, definitely not a contradiction while on this sub.

       What the Hell does "Interfere" even mean? Like with paid trolls? Big deal. Any country or organization can do that. Hillary had the entire Legacy Media shilling for her. Or is when they leaked Hillary's emails showing the American people what was actually going on? As long as they didn't change any votes on voting machines it's irrelevant.

       It's modern two-party foreign policy. If you're a democrat, you try to find friends abroad. If you're republican, you try to find friends abroad. And republicans' friends abroad compete vs democrats' friends abroad.
