       I think it’s a ‘trend’ now. and people feel edgy and cool to be into rough sex. from what I hear, mostly the people who say they’re into really just mean into watching rough porn and don’t actually want it themselves. and usually reject it when they try to practice it. I think for some of it is because it’s more acceptable to be more open about things like that these days, which is why it also may see more like ‘everybody’s doing it’, but nah. also with porn, and porn addiction, it happens by people starting out with normal shit and needing to increase to more taboo things over time in order to get off. so that’s how people (generally) get into some really sick stuff as well as bdsm and rough things. and with porn being watched by more people and easily accessible, it makes sense that more people are ending up being into watching or practicing rough sex and more. so yeah idk that was super like all rambling lol but that’s my opinion on it

       I'm finding the comments about women watching porn now to be laughable. We've always watched porn! :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree though that as porn is seen as more "acceptable" and accessible now, that it may be affecting people's sexual appetite, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       People being into BDSM is nothing new either, but again, it's easier to find people into it now.

       Yup.  It's just much more out in the open and accepted now.  Us old perverts used to have to be hush-hush about such things.  Society today is much more liberal.  People have been kinky whipping each other for thousands of years.

       Naw. Girls watch porn now. Opens new sexual appetites, or makes them think all guys like the things they're seeing in those vids. Wouldn't be surprised if it's more prevalent now

       2017 was the year porn became high use among females.  A lot of men are addicted to porn and don't know how to get a real girl so sooner or later there aren't going to be enough older guys for the unsatisfied young females and they will resort to other means.  Other means being female oriented porn.  This has unleashed all the taboo's as they are pushed by the (((porn cabal))).

       Because sex isn't taboo anymore. You have a tranny kid with xer own tv show talking about sex changes. You have multiple Teenage pregnancy tv shows. Commercials about lube, condoms, sex toys. Erectile dysfunction banners on the sides of Buses. Take Androgel so you can plow your wife again with a massive erection. Go to ashleymadison so you can cheat on your wife.

       Im not sure how to analyze this concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do know is in my younger days, I was what you would consider a punk rocker.
      </p>
      <p>
       15, 20 years ago people with piercings, tats, and strange hair was not common. BDSM was a fashion theme in the punk and goth scene, as well as a sexual activity that a decent bit of us consumed. Punks had attitude. We were not pussies, we hated all forms of politics and propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we used to call "punk" is now just a SJW. Its really strange.

       1977 Punk Rocker here, back when CBGB's was my 2nd home. BDSM was definitely the fashion theme back then and I agree with everything you said, what we wore then does seem to be the SJW look these days but oddly enough, all my punk friends who are still alive are conservative now.
Also agree that stupid 50 shades spawned a million romance books, a lot of people don't understand what real BDSM is at all, there is probably more trust and honesty in a true BDSM relationship than most these days. I'm not in a relationship like that but I know a few people who are into DD (domestic discipline) relationships and they seem happier than a lot of married couples I know. I'm a writer, I do a lot of research lol

       You’re right. Most of us older punks, east coast punks anyways tend to be libertarian or republican because of the small government factor. It’s really weird how it shifted.

       It really is weird how it shifted! Looking back, even my friends who died (cue Jim Carroll song) in retrospect were on the same page as I imagine you and I are on. I went from not thinking about much more than who was playing than I was about politics and now politics are a passion of mine. Yet, even though I'm an old school punk passionate about politics, I still manage to front a band singing my own songs, only not as often because one set and I'm ready for sleep lol
I sometimes see the SJWs with every shade of hair I had forever ago and think why? What shifted? Should we accuse SJWs of punk-look appropriation?

       We could, but It doesn’t help when people like Fat Mike selectively choose what issues they take a stand on.

       Fat Mike is so obsessed with the GOP but remained silent when Obama was allowing bombings to increase to levels that made Bush look like a wimp.

       Isn't it always the way though? Hypocrisy is the order of the day. Cheetah Chrome is the exact same as Fat Mike, he got so bad I had to unfriend him on FB and I've known him since 1977, he was like an attack dog against all GOP and worshipped at the altar of Obama, but then again his first wife was a Kennedy. Ross The Boss from the Dictators is the complete opposite, maybe because he owns a business and understands more about the way things work in the real world.

       the slope of normalization.  sex is a willful give and take of energy.  it's one of the few acts where the power of this principle of willful energy exchange shows itself clearly in this domain/reality.  and people are going to want to experiment with both sides.  that's totally ok.  it's just that if consent isn't part of the exchange shits gets fucky - no pun intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       it seems like there's a lot of things in this reality where we are led down a slope that's seemingly ok, but there are some groups who play the edge conditions and try to weasel an advantage.

       18-35 year old women most likely read or watched the 50 shades movies where they soften up what BDSM is like.  From then most girls were like oh yasss handcuff and spank me!
      </p>
      <p>
       They probably don’t even realize what real BDSM is like or how there is after care from the dom. Real BDSM goes beyond the bedroom too, the relationship is built on trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go to a BDSM club where people get chained up and whipped in front of people sipping on their cocktails. It’s totally different than what most people think it is.

       People have been into the sort of stuff forever.  Its more publicly acceptable now generally.  There's also been much more emphasis on consent recently, both within the BDSM community and in the public generally, so people feel can feel safer making themselves vulnerable.

       Think of it along the same lines as sexuality- in 1930, do you think anyone could live as openly gay?  Not a chance! People had to keep their non-vanilla appetites behind closed doors.  It was a sin to live together before marriage, have sex before marriage, etc.   [North American] society is simply more open about it now. The bedroom doors have been opened, if you will

       Cutting and pain threshold play is about taking control over one's self; finding self agency in a world where your parents gave you none and the environment you were in was toxic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is super common these days due generally to societal dislocation and isolation:  suburbs, loss of extended family, both parents working - latch key kid, alcoholic family, etc.   So many kids are missing out on developmental milestones because there is no one around but peers.  It all leads to a very specific set of behaviors we see all over the place now: cutting, social anxiety, high depression, suicide, inability to socialize, inability to date, have relationships, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, heavy drug use...
      </p>
      <p>
       We really fucked this society up since the 70s.  Lots of tearing down institutions (mental healthcare and hospitals) and skyrocketing income inequality and debt to our eyeballs all while driving it all to the isolated suburbs and then make both parents work so no one is home.  And then they grow up.

       You’re right. Most of us older punks, east coast punks anyways tend to be libertarian or republican because of the small government factor. It’s really weird how it shifted.
