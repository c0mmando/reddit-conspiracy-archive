    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s a ‘trend’ now. and people feel edgy and cool to be into rough sex. from what I hear, mostly the people who say they’re into really just mean into watching rough porn and don’t actually want it themselves. and usually reject it when they try to practice it. I think for some of it is because it’s more acceptable to be more open about things like that these days, which is why it also may see more like ‘everybody’s doing it’, but nah. also with porn, and porn addiction, it happens by people starting out with normal shit and needing to increase to more taboo things over time in order to get off. so that’s how people (generally) get into some really sick stuff as well as bdsm and rough things. and with porn being watched by more people and easily accessible, it makes sense that more people are ending up being into watching or practicing rough sex and more. so yeah idk that was super like all rambling lol but that’s my opinion on it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m finding the comments about women watching porn now to be laughable. We&#39;ve always watched porn! :)</p>

<p>I do agree though that as porn is seen as more &quot;acceptable&quot; and accessible now, that it may be affecting people&#39;s sexual appetite, so to speak. </p>

<p>People being into BDSM is nothing new either, but again, it&#39;s easier to find people into it now. </p>

A lot of men are addicted to porn and don&#39;t know how to get a real girl so sooner or later there aren&#39;t going to be enough older guys for the unsatisfied young females and they will resort to other means.  Other means being female oriented porn.  This has unleashed all the taboo&#39;s as they are pushed by the (((porn cabal))).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not sure how to analyze this concept. </p>

<p>What I do know is in my younger days, I was what you would consider a punk rocker. </p>

<p>15, 20 years ago people with piercings, tats, and strange hair was not common. BDSM was a fashion theme in the punk and goth scene, as well as a sexual activity that a decent bit of us consumed. Punks had attitude. We were not pussies, we hated all forms of politics and propaganda. </p>

<p>Fast forward.</p>

<p>What we used to call &quot;punk&quot; is now just a SJW. Its really strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1977 Punk Rocker here, back when CBGB&#39;s was my 2nd home. BDSM was definitely the fashion theme back then and I agree with everything you said, what we wore then does seem to be the SJW look these days but oddly enough, all my punk friends who are still alive are conservative now.
Also agree that stupid 50 shades spawned a million romance books, a lot of people don&#39;t understand what real BDSM is at all, there is probably more trust and honesty in a true BDSM relationship than most these days. I&#39;m not in a relationship like that but I know a few people who are into DD (domestic discipline) relationships and they seem happier than a lot of married couples I know. I&#39;m a writer, I do a lot of research lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really is weird how it shifted! Looking back, even my friends who died (cue Jim Carroll song) in retrospect were on the same page as I imagine you and I are on. I went from not thinking about much more than who was playing than I was about politics and now politics are a passion of mine. Yet, even though I&#39;m an old school punk passionate about politics, I still manage to front a band singing my own songs, only not as often because one set and I&#39;m ready for sleep lol
I sometimes see the SJWs with every shade of hair I had forever ago and think why? What shifted? Should we accuse SJWs of punk-look appropriation? </p>

<p>They probably don’t even realize what real BDSM is like or how there is after care from the dom. Real BDSM goes beyond the bedroom too, the relationship is built on trust. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cutting and pain threshold play is about taking control over one&#39;s self; finding self agency in a world where your parents gave you none and the environment you were in was toxic.  </p>

<p>This is super common these days due generally to societal dislocation and isolation:  suburbs, loss of extended family, both parents working - latch key kid, alcoholic family, etc.   So many kids are missing out on developmental milestones because there is no one around but peers.  It all leads to a very specific set of behaviors we see all over the place now: cutting, social anxiety, high depression, suicide, inability to socialize, inability to date, have relationships, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, heavy drug use...</p>

<p>We really fucked this society up since the 70s.  Lots of tearing down institutions (mental healthcare and hospitals) and skyrocketing income inequality and debt to our eyeballs all while driving it all to the isolated suburbs and then make both parents work so no one is home.  And then they grow up.</p>
