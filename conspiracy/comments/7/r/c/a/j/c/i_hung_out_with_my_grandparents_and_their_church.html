       I spent the afternoon at lunch with my grandparents and their church friends today and it’s so odd how different they are from my generation. I know every generation is different but people my age almost seem alien when compared to their parents and grandparents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, It was nice to have an actual conversation that wasn’t about something in pop culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was strange how not one time did anyone get sarcastic or talk about some “quirky” weird shit solely for the sake of talking about some quirky weird shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one took any selfies, no one was glued to their smartphone while ignoring the people around them. No one was talking about memes or the latest pop artist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was just normal everyday talk about our lives, our day and our surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is gonna suck when all the old people die. They’re not all perfect or anything, far from it actually, but at least they’re like genuine human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they’re gone all we’ll be left with is a bunch of selfie taking, narcissistic clones whose personalities were crafted for them by TEEVEE and social media.

Think but really Most conversations were like this not too long ago. It has only been
Since around the early 2000s that people became drones and exposed to propaganda from the media 24/7

       This isn't true, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every generation has had its own stupid shit that young people focus on. If you're lucky enough to live a while, you'll see it happen again and again ad nauseam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the contexts change between generations, the content is more or less the same. Young people focus on stupid shit, and as they get older, they get bored of that and move on to "real" subjects.

       It's kind of self-evident, isn't it? His point is that the "this generation is off course!" nonsense is as old as time, generation after generation say it, and he's attempting to prompt some self-reflection in OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a futile effort, of course. OP sounds as narrow-minded and blinded as the people he complains about.

       Getting children acquainted with technology is important.  In the future, employers will require at least a basic understanding on how to utilize technology.  Ever try to teach your father or mother how to use an iPad or iPhone?  It's a nightmare, it's better for people to learn early on in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you like it or not.  Technology will almost always surpass whatever "traditional" methods you have in efficiency and speed.  Employer's know this and schools know this.  I know we all like to circlejerk about how technology has made society worse overall, etc, etc.  But, technology is a net improvement overall.

       It actually quite literally his video... I think he made it or shills fir the guy who did.
      </p>
      <p>
       He runs a site that charges $20+/mo, he exclusively shills his own videos. He tried to submit directly but that failed so he now tries to get subscribers this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       His videos are nonsensical, often are based in a misapplication or lack of understanding of basic science concepts and his videos mainly promise to blow your mind if you subscribe to his site. He makes fun of “normies” (non woke people) and “conspiritards” (people on this Reddit).
      </p>
      <p>
       He argues by moving goal posts, condescending towards those he debates, and ignoring your points and try to exploit areas where he demands impossible evidence (although his own theories seem to be based in nothing).

       It's still disturbing to sit with a class of six year olds, with each their own tablet and set of headphones, teaching them that it's absolutely not allowed to talk with others when working on the ipad - it gets kids to be unnaturaly quiet, which in turn makes adults use the technology to keep kids quiet as the primary reason for use and teaching kids technology is secondary and said teaching is just the kids just getting told/conditioned not to talk while using the tablet, while playing games.

       I used to believe that quote, too. And then I went to look for the
       <strong>
        primary sources
       </strong>
       , and couldn't find any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously Socrates did not write in English, so this quote must be from a
       <em>
        translation
       </em>
       . And that translation must be from the
       <em>
        original
       </em>
       document/papyrus, right? Wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try this for yourself. See if you can find the
       <strong>
        original
       </strong>
       works of Socrates. Then try to find the oldest 'translation' of his works and see what they supposedly based their 'translation' upon.

       Every single generation ever has said "I don't understand this younger generation. They aint no good for nothin". Ya, the newest generation is a new breed of human it seems like.  But couldn't we say that for every other generation before us? Time moves really fucking fast and society changes at the same rate. These young kids will be saying the same old shit when they grow old too

       Damn, I hope you're trolling right now.  The evidence is in talking to old people....the ones that bitched about anything before this time. Then talk to old people currently in this time. Then grow old.  Every generation says the same shit... "what is the evidence?" what evidence could there possibly be?? Other than life experiences... Talk to all kinds of people, then grow up and you will have your evidence

       I highly doubt that was a common notion until the past few hundred years or so. Life just didn't change fast enough for their to be any real differences between generations. Sure there would be fads and such, but the way people lived their lives changed at a much slower pace.

       I’ve always stuck to the oldest generations at a party or gathering myself. Even as a very young child i would do this. I find the conversation to be very pleasant and interesting, and thoroughly enjoy hearing about the past. You can get some good advice from older generations for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it funny they always seem to think they are taking up my time from something else. That almost always comes up and I have to explain that no, I’m exactly where I want to be and am talking to exactly who I want to talk to. That I am not doing it to be nice.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do better as a society when we step outside of groups just like ourselves, no matter the type of difference (race, age, culture, economic background, even interests).
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m glad you had some good conversations today. :)

       What tranlsation is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The ESV, which is the big one these days, translates it:
"For God so loved the world,[a] that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."
      </p>
      <p>
       And I could go into the Greek of the word translated "perish" if you would like.

       But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”

       Matthew 25:41

       How can you teach about Christianity and not say there is a hell?  You using the bible to try to disprove parts of the bible is honestly hilarious.  If its all gods words (2 Timothy 3:15-17) then that isnt possible.

       Right. Conditionalism allows for the idea of being gone, like would happen with something in a burning lake of sulfur. The fiery imagery doesn't seem to be workable with an idea of eternal torment. Instead, it is just the idea that you no longer exist.

       As much of half of it is autopilot that they've been practicing for decades. Their generation was more homologous and having a common convention to communicate by makes it easier for the older generation to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The younger generation no longer has a completely universal social construct to operate under. I don't think that our social systems have completely caught up with the amount of social utility we've gained recently. As a result we're experiencing a schism between local convention and universal convention.

       I learned plenty. I was fortunate to spend a lot of time with my grandparents, both of which passed away in the last 5 years, both in their 90’s. Conservation of resources, living within your means, and understanding what really matters in life (family, health, happiness) and learning what’s not important.

       Even ten years ago, the idea of teaching children in school that 'gender is a social construct' was viewed by the majority of western adults as misguided at best and downright irresponsible -- bordering on child abuse -- at worst.

       Far as I can tell, the only negative to result from a more accepting nature, across the board, is that there's a few idiots who insist on both making their sons wear dresses and being loud and obnoxious about it.

       Lots of people used to think homosexually was an unnatural and gross thing. Further back, mixing race was bad. Further back, fuck them people over in the next village, they're not like us!

       Overall, isn't it kind of a good thing? I mean, folks seem to have a kneejerk reaction when it comes to trans people, like they're all hairy pervert dudes that wanna watch little girls pee, but near I can tell the only ones wanting to do that are priests, Jeffrey Epstein and Roy Moore.

       Please show me where Charles Marx talked about gender being a social construct. I"m pretty sure that came from the social constructionist movement in psychology in relation to the criticism of the objectivism assumed by positivist/empiricist concepts of knowledge (Gergen, 1985). Among the most popular variations of the social constructionist theories is the gender role theory, considered by Alsop, Fitzsimons and Lennon (2002) as an early form of social constructionism.

       Cultural Marxism" is a snarl word used to paint anyone with progressive tendencies as a secret Communist. The term alludes to a conspiracy theory in which sinister left-wingers have infiltrated media, academia, and science and are engaged in a decades-long plot to undermine Western culture. Some variants of the conspiracy alleges that basically all of modern social liberalism is, in fact, a Communist front group.

       Marxist ideology in regards to social constructs had more to do with which jobs the genders traditionally took and why it wasn't the only pattern to follow.  And evidence has since proved him right on that count in many ways. With proper training and enough gumption, most anyone can do almost anything.

       I guess I'm wondering: you speak as if the idea that gender (not biological sex) being a social construct is dangerous. Am I accurate in that statement? And if I am, what is the danger and why is it dangerous?

       <p>
        In your opinion, what is the purpose of the transgender indoctrination? Who does it benefit
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not OP but I'll go out on a limb and give you my wild speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A purpose is to limit the liability of corporations that have poisoned people over generations with xenoestrogens. If I was a consultant to a corporation that was worried about being bankrupted by civil suits I'd have them get some marketing guys on astroturfing genetic and biological damage as an alternative culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       It benefits the employees, stockholders, tax collectors, currency creators, and anyone who wants to just be able to go to the store and pick up an ice cold Coke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, it's just speculation. I don't really care how people dress or what they call themselves.

       Wouldn't a thesis like that depend on the supposition that transgenders are a recent phenomenon?
      </p>
      <p>
       There have always been people who have felt as if they were born the wrong sex and decided to live as the other. This isn't a new thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spread of it can be explained by 2 things.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Advances in medical science can now let people surgically modify themselves to resemble/become their desired/preferred sex.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The internet. Much easier to find like minded people and acceptance. Can create echo Chambers, ect. Also easier to reveal their existence.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That's a bold claim...that there's some corporation dumping chemicals into the water and making people so sick in the head they identify as trans. Do you have any evidence to back that up?
      </p>
      <p>
       The closest I've been able to find is not close at all. Alex Jones screaming about gay frogs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it just possible those people are different than some and choose to live their lives how they want? Much like how people panicked over kids being notified that homosexuals do exist and aren't bad for being homosexuals. There were plenty of outlandish and  unhinged theories that tried to "explain the gays" as well as a whole fuckton of lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's baffling to me, in this sub there's is so much outrage that no one else is worried about the real problems. "Everyone is fighting each other at the behest of TPTB like puppets." Isn't this exactly the kind of shit the evil overlords would devise? Hate the other, for they are different. They choose to think and live different. Non standard. Bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe trans people are all mentally ill, maybe one day they'll all wake up and realize they were wrong and then regret all the medical procedures and drugs. I mean, that's far-fetched as it gets, but maybe, right? I just don't see what the harm is. They're only hurting themselves it that's the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not rage against tabacoo users with the same relentlessness? Those are honest to goodness idiots poisoning themselves for someone else's profit. The profiteers buy and sell politicians and lie about the effects of their products all the time, in plain sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead...hateful people co-opt the fearful and we step closer and closer to lynchings and pogroms. Because where does it end?

       First, let me make it clear if it wasn't in my previous comment: I don't care how anyone chooses to define their gender or express themselves. People are people, whatever role they choose to play or masks they choose to wear I want them to be fulfilled, compassionate, and content. All the world's a stage and people merely players.
      </p>
      <p>
       You asked for a scenario and I gave you what I believe is a plausible one based on my experiences with how corporations tend to work.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't think so, the speculation I presented just requires that xenoestrogens effect reproductive and hormonal health negatively possibly with cumulative generational effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I suspect that most psychological divergence from norms and physical illness in western society are simply unintended consequences of our technology. But, you asked for a speculation that included intentional bad faith on the part of leadership.

       There are a lot of assumptions here about our ability to understand other societies and the conception of the self in different (dead) cultures and languages. That being said I tentatively agree Feminine Men and Masculine Women do seem to have always been around and this seems to have expressed itself in different cultural ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to everything else you posted:
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want people to live with compassion for other people and to step up when they see people acting malevolently. I want people to act with awareness and not chase shiny things without considering and monitoring unintended consequences. I want people to experience nature and wonder in the beauty of it all. I want people to not fear death and live life courageously and well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't get this abstract concept of gender at all or why people make a huge deal out of it.

       FYI, pretty sure the video he made is by him, he runs a site that charges $20+/mo, he exclusively shills his own videos. He tried to submit directly but that failed so he now tries to get subscribers this way. His videos are nonsensical, often are based in a misapplication or lack of understanding of basic science concepts and his videos mainly promise to blow your mind if you subscribe to his site. He makes fun of “normies” (non woke people) and “conspiritards” (people on this Reddit). He argues by moving goal posts, condescending towards those he debates, and ignoring your points and try to exploit areas where he demands impossible evidence (although his own theories seem to be based in nothing)

       Wrong. I'm asking what's actually wrong with trans people. First he comments on how old folks are getting brain washed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he complains about children being indoctrinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, when I ask "dude what the hell are you talking about?" He give me garbage from Holocaust deniers and a vid from a guy with a full voice who wants money.

       Ain't no feels beyond a sense that everyone should be allowed to live life without being persecuted.

       Holy shit, I need to re-evaluate my opinion of my grandparents and every elderly person whom I've ever had a decent experience with and share a relationship with, I didn't realize your blanket statement completely invalidated their individualistic characteristics that makes each of them a unique human being capable of independent thought. Guess I'll also need to tell my agnostic/athiest elderly relatives that they are actually deluding themselves of their underlying beliefs, as dictated by yourself.

       What is this, the third post today complaining about someone's generation? Where is all of this coming from?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like from the 3 posts I've seen, you guys need to get out and make some new friends. Not everyone is glued to their phones or taking selfies, not everyone is poor and without savings, not everyone can only talk about pop culture and memes. If that's what you experience, it's probably because that's what you put yourself into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get out and expand and find new people. There's plenty of people in their 20's who act like oldsters, and there's plenty of oldsters that act like they're still 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       This blanket "whoah is me my generation is ruined" horse shit is annoying. Every generation thinks the previous one sucks, and every generation does stupid shit when they're figuring themselves out. Those old people you were talking to probably loved to talk about pop culture and tv when they were 20, but now it's so far beyond them that of course they wouldn't want to talk about it.

       Clutch those pearls a little harder. I'm amazed by how many people on this sub are seemingly stuck in the 50's. Should women not be concerned about orgasming either and sex is only for procreation?

       You realize that just throwing out logical fallacy names isn't really a form of debate right? Not to mention it's not ad hominem to address obvious bias in a source. I'm done, go troll someone else now.

       I don't do exclusive relationships, I'm non-monogamous along with my partners, and it seems to me we're all much happier and we'll adjusted than you lot are. Like I said, I'm not debating with someone who's here to troll and just toss out words they don't understand. If you want to cling to some puritanical way of living that's fine, do what you will, and I will too.

       Karl Rove strategy for next presidential election is to sow discord between boomers and millenials. This is an early attempt to strengthen image of baby boomers. You’ll see the opposite too. Towards the end of 2018 you’ll start to see increasing chatter and internet spats centered on boomer vs millennial.

       Hey thanks, I wanted to say the same thing. I’m in my 30’s and when I get together with friends we don’t take selfies, talk about memes, or brush up on celebrity gossip. We drink beer, talk about work and family, then complain about the garbage news media.

       I’ve seen a lot of disheartening posts about “friends” on reddit in general. I’m beginning to think I’m blessed to know real people.

       Anyone who has ever been to the clubhouse at an over-55-community can attest to old people talking about shit just to hear themselves talk.  It may not be "quirky" but it us their knitting patterns, their new diet, their alternative medicine, what they heard about the new neighbors from the gardeners, etc.

       Yep. Although I was wondering about OP's experience with young people just saying dumb shit and memeing all the time. I do that with my friends but usually I can have interesting conversations with random young people I meet. I guess my perspective of the younger generation seems not as bad as his, hence my question.

       I'd really caution you falling into that old horrible cliche of "my generation sucks, I wish things were more like they were in [enter some arbitrary year from the past]."
      </p>
      <p>
       Every generation does this, every generation seems horrible to both the elders and the
       <em>
        outsiders
       </em>
       within that generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen texts from Ancient Rome where people in their 40s and 50s were complaining about the youth, their immature dalliances, the attention paid to stupid things, and how horrible they seem compared to better, greater generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a normal function of the passage of time as a human being. I assume you're young, because I used to feel the same way when I was young. And then something changed where I had matured and I had different friends, and I was able to talk about
       <em>
        real stuff
       </em>
       - my feelings, my fears, my goals and aspirations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'll happen in time, just give it time.

       I am having a really hard time raising a child.  I have a middle schooler.  She is an alien.  She does not do social media.  She does not take selfies.  She watches tv.  She does not gossip.  She does not fit in at all.  Adults love her.  Kids pretty much shun her.  It breaks my heart.  She has spent too much time in sports and with family and not with peers.  She is an alien.  Ugh.

       In Orwell's
       <em>
        1984
       </em>
       he speaks about this: children are turned against their parents by the state and by the telescreen. This is in the book, not so much the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parenting is only going to get more difficult and, let's be honest, most people are giving up, and letting the state and TV raise their kids for them.

       The more one projects the concept of solitude onto an individual, the easier it is for them to accept it. Don't believe that your child isn't welcomed by their peers, instead recognize that they just dont easilly fall into the trap that is cliques. You might be surprised to find out how many different people your child interacts with at school that maybe aren't being completelly registered as the friends that they are. Especially if they are involved with any extracurricular like theatre, sports, band, etc..

       Speaking as one of the old people, I think you're on to something here.  Millenials have been subjected to relentless brainwashing from the moment they were born and have no perspective whatsoever on how thoroughly their attitudes and beliefs have been handed to them by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, on the other hand, have only been subjected to relentless brainwashing for the last third of my life, and already had first-hand knowledge of many things that inoculated me from being seriously brainwashed.  Why?  Because I've seen it for myself, so the lies have no power.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest lies:  women in the 1960s were miserable being at home taking care of their husbands and families and just dying to spend their days in sterile cubicles working for a living.  Not!  Women were happier in the "old days," families were happier, neighborhoods were happier.  We had tons of parties.  We spent lots of time face to face, not much time alone.  There were barbecues and badminton parties and croquet parties and pot lucks and progressive dinner parties.  Kids played outside all day, every day, in the summer time.  They came home tired and dirty and happy, slept like rocks and didn't need meds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on. We have been lied to about so many things.  Talk to your old people before they die, get it on tape, so future generations will know what we once had, and what we lost.

       Bingo. Thanks for taking the time to post this. I too was brainwashed to believe the 1950s were horrible. It took me a long time to see what a colossal lie this was.

       If you were a working woman, person of color, gay, atheist, non-Christian the 50s could be a very shitty time period.
Domestic abuse / child abuse was more common and investigated far less. Spousal rape and rape in general was not taken as seriously. Mental health care was insanely bad with wide spread abuse of the mentality ill. General safety and health standards we're lacking and let's not forget how horrible mobility and access was for the disabled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 50s had a few things that were better than they are now. Livable wages, the tax rate of the wealthy, and affordable college.

       Right, cuz the old people who make up the majority demographic of those watching CNN and Fox News all day, who grew up with only 3 TV channels, and one newspaper, and got their news only from Cronkite, really learned  how to critically think about their media consumption or belief system?

       Bullshit; people who grew up with more options have developed more critical thinking skills.

       Not all truth comes from thinking.  Some of it comes from the heart. Like knowing that love matters, family matters, and a partner who will stick by you when you're old and grey is worth far more than a caravan of one night stands on Tinder or a sex doll.
      </p>
      <p>
       But our fascist overlords want us cold, suffering and alone.  They tell you to waste your 20s and 30s screwing around.  Why commit when there could be another hot babe in the next swipe?  They encourage you to go for short-term gratification, chuckling to themselves as they know what's in store for you when you're old and alone.

       Good post. And you are right. It is chalk and cheese, the current youth vs the older generations.

       Made worse by the fact that children are taught in school how 'racist'/'homophobic/'intolerant' old people supposedly are, alienating the youth from their own parents and grandparents.

       This literally "le wrong generation" taken to an unironic extreme. It reeks of self imposed social misery. And it seems like you think you're better than everyone. Get some likable friends and you won't have hate everything about your peers. This attitude is detrimental to your health.

       It's funny because from my grandparents I learned the terms "Boob Tube" and "Dummy box" in reference to television. And Ironic that one of my grandfathers, who often used those terms had distibution businesses for RCA and Zenith.

       One thing I think about is when young people today eventually get old..are they gonna be like 90 and taking selfies and being so tied to stupid shit? We think of old people today as your old neighbor who always tries to tell you WW2 stories. In the future they will be veryyyy different.

       I disagree. I think that in Huxley fashion, we are being molded by the media into something other than the natural state of humanity. Indeed we are changing what it means to be human. This is partly just a natural progress of resource, supply, and technology, but it is also in large part an concerted effort to reshape social order. Nature vs Societal construct is the core of progressive thought. Humans are social, physically active animals by nature. Both traits are disappearing, especially the social aspect.

       . It's a cool story of how one person started printing things out for their grandma because they realized she felt left out when everyone else at the table was talking about god knows what but their grandma couldn't really participate. It made their relationship a lot stronger.

       You have a point, there are some really obvious differences between this young generation and the oldest. A lot of that is due to technology. However, as you age you'll start to see things differently and so will your peers. I'm just shy of 30 and I'd say Myspace blew up when I was like 16 and from there came... Everything else. My late 20 something and early 30 something year old friends have largely dropped off online. Like yeah a lot of people still have Facebook's but they're completely inactive. There are definitely a lot of us on social media but only a fraction compared to what it was before. We're too busy or uninterested. Your generation will be even more impacted by the internet than mine, but I suspect most of you will use social media less/get bored with it with age also.

       Not everyone is taught how to hold a conversation. Parents let their kids envelope their lives in technology and don’t care to be social with others. I’m 24 and I can’t stand being around airheads and shallow dumb fucks because there isn’t anything under it. They have no depth. It’s unfortunate that they’re are seemingly taking over, so you have to keep those intellectuals close to you.

       I'm 37 and tried having a conversation with a 23 year old today. I was exhausted after 15 minutes. And for some reason, she needed to be having a text conversation, while she was eating w my friend and I, and then tell us what the person who neither of us knew was saying. Nothing she said was of value or importance.

       I would be exhausted as well. I hate when people are on their phone during meals. My fiancé used to be that way but he doesn’t do it anymore. It’s about the only time we can actually sit down and talk about our day or something.

       I love my best friend, but he's totally addicted to his phone. Sometimes, we're mid-conversation and he'll just call someone. Or when we're in someone else's car, he'll call someone, like the rest of us in the car have to be quiet  (to be polite) and listen. Some people literally were not taught manners though. My mom beat them into us.

       I YouTubed 'The Dick Cavitt' show and watched celebrity interviews from the 60/70s. It was stricking how different people are from those days, totally natural and relaxed, no pretense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Celebrity interviews today are totally staged, mostly to sell a movie. People back then didn't give a shit other than to do what they loved.

       Watch these interviews, you'd be shocked at the difference in people today.

       Really? You’re that dense and self absorbed that you think you’re somehow better than an entire generation of younger people? Maybe the reason people don’t talk to you about anything other than pop culture and memes is because you’re an iamverysmart douche who thinks they’re above everyone else.

       You know I agree and disagree. I find the latest trending memes funny and they can take up half of my vocabulary at times and I’ll take quite a few selfies but my friends and I also can delve into some really deep questioning of society and mock what we ourselves are partaking in. I think that there is a balance somewhere, but most of the population is at an unhealthy point now. My father in his late 40s texts and drives, and struggles to finish work because of Facebook. My stepmom will end up sitting in her car outside of the house for half an hour while I’ve cooked dinner and it’s getting cold because of a good game of “Candy Crush”.  It sucks when you want to actually talk about current events and they whip out their phones at the dinner table....

       I recently suggested to my volunteer group that they should hang out with this senior social group and they all looked at me like I was crazy. They couldn't fathom why they would make the effort to meet new people of that age.

       There are still younger people, like myself and my circle, who's lives revolve around better things than phones and what's trending. We can be around each other for hours and not look at our phones...we've even talked about this and neither of us care about our phones except to answer/make a call or text that is important or has substance. I'd rather leave my phone behind with the rest of the sorry saps that will, and have, neck problems and complain about being bored when there's "nothing to do."
      </p>
      <p>
       When we're old and gray there will still be other old folk who haven't given themselves up to the technocracy or surrounded every facet of their lives with a "helpful" electronic device. In fact, I think there are many more younger people 25-35, or so, that share the same thought than one might think.

       Right, cuz the old people who make up the majority demographic of those watching CNN and Fox News all day, who grew up with only 3 TV channels, and one newspaper, and got their news only from Cronkite, really learned  how to critically think about their media consumption or belief system?

       Bullshit; people who grew up with more options have developed more critical thinking skills.

       that is not a counter argument. It is an ad hominem strawman red herring logical fallacy.

        I know a few people in their 50s and 60s who used to hold very different opinions on topics like 'transexuals' than they do today. What happened? Hours of exposure to TV and social media per day has fried their brains.

       They are teaching that 'gender is a social construct' at school now. Ergo not a strawman.

       I highly doubt that was a common notion until the past few hundred years or so. Life just didn't change fast enough for their to be any real differences between generations. Sure there would be fads and such, but the way people lived their lives changed at a much slower pace.

       It actually quite literally his video... I think he made it or shills fir the guy who did.
      </p>
      <p>
       He runs a site that charges $20+/mo, he exclusively shills his own videos. He tried to submit directly but that failed so he now tries to get subscribers this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       His videos are nonsensical, often are based in a misapplication or lack of understanding of basic science concepts and his videos mainly promise to blow your mind if you subscribe to his site. He makes fun of “normies” (non woke people) and “conspiritards” (people on this Reddit).
      </p>
      <p>
       He argues by moving goal posts, condescending towards those he debates, and ignoring your points and try to exploit areas where he demands impossible evidence (although his own theories seem to be based in nothing).
