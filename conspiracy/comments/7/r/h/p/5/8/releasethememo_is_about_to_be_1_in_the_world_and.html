    <div class="md"><p>Oh gosh, there are so many. Recently, I&#39;ve liked Zerohedge, Disobedient Media, The Epoch Times, Medium, Steemit, Voat, etc.</p>

<p>Basically, any place that has an uncensored message board. 4Chan, 8Chan if you can sift through all the nonsense and know what you&#39;re looking for. Takes a lot of effort though. Above Top Secret still has a few nuggets of good info as well. </p>

<p>Read everything from the fringe to mainstream, both left and right, and you can often start to see the picture emerging.</p>

<p>This is very, very important to do with this story. We are talking about a scandal with the potential to shake this nation to its very core - abuse of power at the highest levels of government and open politicization of the FBI/DOJ. Drudge is doing the right thing, as frustrating as it is for all of us to have to wait.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this story is going to go nuclear, and soon. But I&#39;ve had that feeling for a while now. If Drudge had less discipline like me he would have blown his wad early and lost credibility.</p>

<p>Still though it&#39;s already a huge story. I wonder when he&#39;s going to cave and get it on the front page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was on T_D watching Stonetear delete his entire Reddit history in real time.  He asked, on Reddit, how to take either Obama&#39;s and/or Hillary&#39;s names OFF of emails.  Subpoenaed emails.  Nothing happened.  Nothing.  He was given immunity.  Watching that through the night and seeing him caught like a rat in a trap and then seeing it all magically disappear made me give up hope.  Like Lynch and Bill on the plane.  They were caught, red handed.  NOTHING STICKS!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The subject matter of the memo has been in the public sphere for some time for people who have been paying attention. Nunes gave a press conference where he was asked &quot;was the President a part of that incidental collection?&quot; to which he replied &quot;Yes.&quot; Meaning in other words that the Donald Trump&#39;s private communications with his campaign staff were collected by the FBI. That is suspicious in and of itself.</p>

<p>In addition to that, Susan Rice (the National Security Adviser at the time) who reported <em>directly to President Obama</em> &quot;unmasked&quot; names of US persons whose communications were collected in the FISA warrant. Which Nunes already confirmed included President Trump&#39;s private communications. So, you have the National Security Adviser who again reports to the President unmasking names in this FBI investigation and ostensibly feeding that information to President Obama, her boss. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the article, good info. Some of the policy positions argued by these people I am also opposed to - war with Iran is a terrible idea. However, I do think Russia&#39;s active measures campaign has been effective and largely ignored by &quot;the establishment&quot;. If a temporary marriage of convenience is necessary to address that, I can  live with it. Are you of the opinion Russia should be ignored, online influence is irrelevant? Just curious. </p>

<p>I though this paragraph was interesting </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The neocons may be migrating back to the Democratic Party and into the open embrace of its establishment, but their homecoming will not be a seamless affair: Duss, for instance, is now the top foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders. After spending little energy on foreign affairs as a candidate, Sanders’s hiring of Duss is a sign that he sees a rejection of interventionism as ascendant with the populist element of the party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I tend to agree, I don&#39;t think progressive democrats are likely to be suckered into yet another conflict. If anything, the Trump regime has been <em>more</em> hawkish - Flynn putting Iran &quot;on notice&quot; within 2 weeks of the inauguration, Trump&#39;s bellicose tweets about North Korea, intervention in Syria, escalation in Afghanistan and Syria (initially).</p>

<p>The war machine isn&#39;t slowing down but I don&#39;t think the security democracy dashboard is <em>particularly</em> relevant to that wider discussion. </p>

<p>Lately, as in the last 3 months or so? Yeah, I&#39;d say it hasn&#39;t been a major item in mainstream or alt media. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-elections/democrats-target-russia-trump-on-election-meddling-idUSKBN1EZ13P">Senator Cardin&#39;s report</a> just got a bit of media attention, though. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a temporary marriage of convenience is necessary to address that, I can live with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Greenwald&#39;s point is that it is not a temporary marriage of convenience, but a trend that has been growing. I guess we can agree to disagree on that point if you like.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>re you of the opinion Russia should be ignored, online influence is irrelevant?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ignored? No. The Russians, just like every major state and institutional actor, are absolutely using the internet to push their propaganda. I think the key difference between Western and Eastern (mainly Russia, China to a lesser extent) propaganda since WWII has been that the Russians are a bit more direct about it. Currently, you have Putin and his clique of Russian oligarchs who control the Kremlin, who directly finance and control their foreign and domestic propaganda efforts through outlets like RT and Sputnik, all the way down to online troll factories and hackers. </p>

<p>Western oligarchs historically and currently operate with more layers of obfuscation. The oligarchs control governments largely through campaign donations and lobbying efforts, and control the media organs through direct and indirect ownership, and also shape public perception through large foundations and think tanks  (Rockefeller, Ford, Open Society, etc.). It&#39;s not the oligarchs controlling the government controlling the propaganda; it&#39;s the oligarchs controlling the government <em>and</em> controlling the propaganda but through separate channels. </p>

<p>So yes, we <em>as individuals</em> and <em>as a society</em> should be concerned with Russian (oligarchical) influence, but I don&#39;t trust the Western oligarchs (either through governments or think tanks like ASD) to actually protect or serve the <em>people&#39;s</em> interests. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think progressive democrats are likely to be suckered into yet another conflict...Trump regime has been more hawkish</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree, but the Republicans plus the centrist/corporatist/hawkish Dems have more than enough votes to push America towards war and/or increased conflict. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The war machine isn&#39;t slowing down but I don&#39;t think the security democracy dashboard is particularly relevant to that wider discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely disagree. ASD is run by the very same people who orchestrated the illegal Iraq Invasion and the unconstitutional PATRIOT ACT. Chertoff himself <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/23/fear_pays_chertoff_n_787711.html">benefitted enormously</a> from his role in the deployment of the surveillance state apparatus created in the wake of 9/11. Russian online influence is real (whether under- or over-estimated at present), yet far more troubling to me is that ASD and others are using it to build a case for increased surveillance, a more powerful security apparatus, a less free internet, and a more hostile stance toward Russia and Iran (and likely China in the future.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m finding a lot of outrage over this memo either being released or not being released, but struggling to find non-hyperbolic explanation of what it&#39;s actually supposed to <em>be</em>. </p>

<p>I&#39;m finding lots of predictions of what it will <em>do</em> but again, not what the memo is actually supposed to <em>be</em>. </p>

<p>The whole thing smacks of political theater, and judging by the GOP guys going out talking big about this memo they won&#39;t release, I&#39;d question their motives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s because the government is about to shutdown.... and the current administration/party in power want to blame this potential shut down on the minority party but that’s a horribly weak argument and it’s an election year, so they have to make some type of attempt at damage control, and surprise surprise they are falling back to their favorite misdirect topic ...... #crookedliberals ...... </p>

<p>To me this whole #releasethememo thing just feels like a distraction for the MAGA voters, to keep them from paying attention to shit that actually matters and voting red</p>

<p>(Disclaimer: if there is a memo, I’ll read it with an open mind if it ever gets released but that hasn’t happened yet so I’m good on having the smoke blown up my ass and I’ll just continue paying attention to shit that is actually happening)</p>

<p>You most definitely should. You should read all the Corporate Propaganda media (preferably via archive so as to avoid ad money), and you should read the boards here, and the chans (or at least Reddit summaries of them) to get all perspectives. Drudge is a great resource to see what the Right/Libertarian perspective on things is. I check Drudge every day, just as I do r/conspiracy- and I&#39;m a Bernie bro. </p>

<p>I have a feeling this story is going to go nuclear, and soon. But I&#39;ve had that feeling for a while now. If Drudge had less discipline like me he would have blown his wad early and lost credibility.</p>

<p>Still though it&#39;s already a huge story. I wonder when he&#39;s going to cave and get it on the front page.</p>
