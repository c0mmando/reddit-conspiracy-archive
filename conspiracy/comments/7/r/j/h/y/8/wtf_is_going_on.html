       Very simple. Straight to the point. What do people think is really going on? I haven't seen anything quite like this before.

       Support for the government. Support for private mercenaries. Support for all the things conspiracy theorists have stood against for a long time.

       And FoxNews, firmly on one side, did a thorough debunking of the Uranium One story.

       While I certainly agree with what they are reporting. It really doesn't strike me as the news networks I've come to watch. Something is different. It's off. I don't get it.

       Didn't make any claims. I agree that U1 could be a hoax. I'm more so asking the commenters here. WTF is going on? Nothing seems right. News stations are off. Propaganda like I've never seen. I've never seen this much disinformation before. So. Just wondering what other people think.

       You seem to be pushing this narrative hard today. Just because David Brock says so doesn't make it the truth. Uranium One isn't just a storm, it's a catagory 5 hurricane getting ready to make landfall.

       Can I be completely unabashedly honest? 
The final answer is: Jews.  I'm not even joking.  Trump/Russia is a maybe, but not even as big or bad as what Hillary was doing.  Obama possibly/probably CIA, Michelle 90% sure to be a man. Hillary/U1 is more of a technical gotcha, but still wrong. Pedogate true, pizzagate still unverifiable but totally viable, Qanon=good questions/great material some real some larp.  Major politics at play.  Throughout history one usually had to be close to the people to know what's happening.  Here we are,
       <em>
        occasionally
       </em>
       rubbing shoulders with them/the info.  If Trump doesn't attempt to prosecute/curtail the activity, he gets favors done for him.  This is how politics works.  He will have to choose,
       <em>
        or to pick and choose
       </em>
       .  But do look up the JQ.

       That's the old world order. The Court Jews. I believe they did have a vast amount of wealth - still do. Still very much in control.
      </p>
      <p>
       But. There's a Jesuit pope. Trump went to Fordham University. A Jesuit School. I think we're seeing a transition of power after reading all of these comments. A global wake up, transfer of power (secret societies fighting), and a sad attempt to start world war three.

       Ahh...When I first read this last reply of yours, I was slightly enchanted with the idea.  But
       <a href="http://www.fordhamobserver.com/inside-trumps-days-at-fordham/">
        a bit of research
       </a>
       shows that Trump was at Fordham only two years.  Even he had been there 4 or 6 years, I really don't see Trump as the sort who is beholden to religious ideology.  I do see him as a business man, a worldly man, and a patriotic man.  I went to a college for 5 years, and graduated with honors.  Class size averaged 23 people (so fairly small/close-knit).  I don't feel beholden to that college or its ideals whatsoever.  So I really can't see Trump feeling Jesuit.  Do you have more evidence for your theory that you'd be willing to share?

       support for a republican government is not support for a 'government'. look up the differences between republicans and democrats ideologies, republicans are for LESS GOVERNMENT while extreme leftists are for ABSOLUTE GOVERNMENT CONTROL. educate yourself on why exactly so many people support this particular republic

       Cause I just legit Deja Vu that you did, perhaps under another username. I remember in that thread, a user was agreeing that we should be using mercenaries to take out soros/r0thsch1lds and they got banned for the comment

       Yes, you are describing the ideology of republican

       , not the Republican Party. The Democrat and Republican parties are controlled by the same people. The two party paradigm is a scam.

       Saturation of information is also a tactic to have oversight of where specific and crucial intel is going and who is sharing it while the rest are uninformed and chasing bullshit like Q's questioning. I know i will be crucified for mentioning Q this way, but it's a legit tactic used in HUMINT circles. Just consider it and i would love to see people have a real discussion regarding it.. Same goes for a lot of these other insider anons out there and not just Q

       The laws are ambiguous and arbitrarily applied to the weak. Enough people are fooled that there are "sides" - that there is right and wrong, that it keeps most people so busy arguing, so they never figure it  out and spend decades of their lives debating straw dogs, watching sports, buying shit, and getting numb with booze, so they can tell themselves "it's not that bad." There are a few rogue free agents but they are allowed to exist to perpetuate the illusion of freedom and free will.

       I believe nations are controlled by different people playing the long game for a common cause. The world has always been at war by covert operations and collusion via the secret services, intelligence communities and nation states while some of the said services are operating without any governmental oversight at all.

       Human intelligence as a craft is older than biblical times and i do know that things are far worse than we think or perceive it to be.

       A library. They're (almost?) always free, usually have internet, and the people there can literally help you research any topic. Most people don't take advantage of the library, and it sounds lame, but seriously it's a great place to study. Yes, you may have these resources at home (quiet place, computer, internet) but there is a lot to be said about a dedicated environment for no-nonsense research. You are always primed to do work when entering; the same cannot be said when I sit down at my desktop and have the icons of a dozen video games staring back at me.
      </p>
      <p>
       open-mindedness and willingness to learn is undoubtedly important, but you must embrace critical thinking, too!

       The Republicans claim to have another "bombshell worse than watergate." We don't know if it's real or not, but given last time (fast and furious) it was bullshit... I'm personally not holding my breath.

       In fairness, the people who are apparently at the heart of this memo were the ones responsible for fast &amp; furious as well and as thus weren't too keen on prosecuting themselves.  We all know that F&amp;F was BS and should have resulted in multiple firings/convictions/lawsuits, but since the DOJ, DHS, IRS, FBI, and almost all other major departments had been politically infiltrated, hoping they would somehow grow a conscience was just foolhardy.

       The Jesuits created the Illuminati in the late 18th Century (Adam Weishaupt was a Jesuit) right after the Jesuit Suppression in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV kicked all the Jesuits out of Europe. So the Jesuits OWNED the Illuminati as a front company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the Jesuits have been around since the 11th Century, they have far more infiltrated agents and more knowledge than the Illuminati, that's why they are beating them at such a high level right now. Think of the Illuminati as a breakaway LLC, and the parent company (Jesuits) destroying the LLC and creating a new LLC to replace it.
      </p>

       It's their last ditch effort. So don't feel bad when the media ruins Trump's reputation with all these slimy stories. Let them eat each other and ruin each other.

       This is the natural progression of Western society and capitalism playing themselves out. These problems were less apparent before we had advanced tech, back when natural resources and careers were easier to find. Now we're all free-falling with very little shared culture to cling to. It's natural for a society like this to splinter when we have as many opinions as problems. You see it less in places like China, where they have a very strong cultural 'glue.'
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course lots of conspiracies go on in the background to divert resources and control the populace, holding it all together. Some are also working to tear it all down for their own benefit. Figuring out who's on which side and how much you should worry about it is the tricky part.

        liberalism
       </em>
       /demoralization playing itself out.  "strength through diversity"? What then is the meaning of solidarity or unity?  The embracing of homosexuality and the pedophilia that comes with it?  All this stuff... is de-moralizing.  Demoralization causes a dwindling of the lifeforce within us.  God=life. Good/God=life-promoting.  Sin=life demoting.  We have become a sinful society.  Ironically, a society of infidels.  We bombed the shit out of the middle east because.... (enter
       <em>
        the JQ
       </em>
       ).  Our media tells lies. Lie after lie.  It's insanity.  And it's orchestrated.  It's also foretold.  Is this not like Babylon?

       Around 40% of pedophiles identify as bi-sexual or homosexual.  So no, ≠, but there is a very high correlation.  Makes sense, doesn't it?  One sexual deviancy is a gateway to others.  I've lived it, and it's obvious to most people.

       Money is going on, it's a fight to the death to steal the wealth of the people and the planet.

      <p>
       There are a number of factions fighting for this wealth, they come from the left and the right; from manufacturing and oil and transportation and banking and politics. They are all fighting amongst themselves like two wolves and a sheep discussing what's for dinner.

       The Government establishment is very, very corrupt. This includes both Republicans and Dems. Things have been corrupt for a long time, and they have only gotten worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB want to keep their puppet government, and they want to keep it strong. So what do they do? Everything they can possibly get away with, if it means keeping anti-Establishment candidates from winning. This includes spying on them in order to get leverage over them, which is facilitated by abusing the FISA warrant process.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time, their plan failed and Trump was elected. In order to handicap him, they created the Russia-Trump collusion narrative, and even got a couple people in his campaign indicted (on unrelated charges) to give the appearance of legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       At present, there is a war going on in our government. Its a war between TPTB and their puppet government, and between Trump and whoever he represents (hopefully We the People, but you never can be sure).

who owns the media? (yes, even reddit)
who is the media for, who is it against?
who owns a huge chunk of the BIG BIG money in the world?
what does money give you?
what do people/organizations do when they don't get their way?

       And how do we know Trump isn't their puppet? Instead of going after Hillary like he promised, he's going after marihuana. And cutting taxes for the elites. His populist message is a facade to keep the common man happy. TPTB saw the populist wave on both sides and decided to infiltrate it. We're on our own, and the sooner you realize that the better.

       False, Trump realizes the reason people like JFK, MLK were taken out.
      </p>
      <p>
       They unified people. Trump knows if he's polarizing enough, maintains the dissonance, that the establishment will not remove him.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no war because the deep state doesn't need Trump removed. If he were out trying to bring people together en masse against the swamp; he'd be gone yesterday. He know's what he's doing.

       Hey man I've got tons of relatives who are just like you. Think they've pulled a fast one on the government and the President is their inside guy. I've never voted Dem and never will. I had been working in politics when Obama was elected (didn't vote for him either) and the shit I saw made my milk curdle. If you catch my drift.

       Trump IS an improvement in the long run. Similarly to how a good forest fire will clear out the underbrush...Trump and the tide that brought him is going to run America so hard into the ground that the humbling will do us good. Spoil the rod spare the child as it says in the Bible and boy is America due for a good woopin'.

       My wife and I make over 125k combined. We file jointly and itemize because we're small business owners. And we live in California. This tax bill fucks the middle class and small business owners to give permanent tax breaks to large corporations, capital managers, real estate developers and the highest income bracket.

       America is not crumbling economically.
       <strong>
        Everyone
       </strong>
       got a tax break, so fuck off with that.  Reason why is that Republicans won't get elected if they don't put the country into debt further, just as the democrats do.  Each party gives handouts, they just give them out differently.  One is social programs, other is cash/less taxes.  One equals more government, the other less.  Best thing you can do is stand up for truth and stay sane.  Also be kind to each other.

       Almost half of the tax cut goes to the richest 1% and by 2027 80% of the tax cut goes to the richest 1%.  The rich own most stocks and the recent boom is built on a deregulation bubble that will burst - and will burst big.  Adding $1.4 trillion to the national debt isn't worth it if most Americans will get crumbs compared to the rich and the powerful.

       This four page memo is supposed to lead to Obama's, Hillary's, Comey's and Mueller's arrest, detail how the DNC conspired with the Russians to try to prevent Trump from winning the 2016 election and prove that there was no Trump collusion with the Russians and that the whole dossier was a fake.

       If you have had a child in school recently, you know it goes far beyond not teaching critical thinking.  They create harsh unpredictable unenforceable rules that seem designed to create a high level of cognitive compliance.

       To my mind, you aren't doing your kids any favors by keeping them away from the battleground they will eventually need to master.  That said, not all schools are created equal.  I have shopped heavily and pulled mine out of more than one.

       The person that replied to you, step2thejep is John le bon and he jsut linked to a video he himself produced. He is trying to promote his paid website ($20+/mo) and his youtube channel so he tries to insert links to conspiracy threads. He exclusively links to his own content.
      </p>
      <p>
       His views are nonsensical, his style of debate starts by asking some question about one of your points and the he will condescend, move goal posts, demand impossible proof for your points while demanding none for his own,  misapply/ misunderstand science, and link to his own videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is shilling for his own channel/ site.

       Glance through his comment hx, in addition to being the worst kind of noxious debater, he just exclusively and often randomly links to his videos... but pretends to be someone else who happened on this video.

       Big Picture:
      </p>
      <p>
       An awakening is taking place. Some sort of global consciousness shift. The people who have had access to "hidden knowledge" and "the mysteries" know that this ascension shift is coming, and have been putting as many people and narratives in place to derail it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ruling paradigm, of the West at least, is a cabal of satanic pedophiles. It looks to me like, at the top of the food chain, is worship of Moloch. I think this because of all the child abuse and sacrifice (and yes, I count abortion as child sacrifice). Moloch is blesses these people for a while, but ultimately they become fodder as well when their usefulness is done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationally, one of two things is happening:
      </p>
      <p>
       One: A counter-force to the Moloch types has finally gotten its shit together in the past decade or so and is finally pushing back. They are good and decent, and even though they have to make some compromises, their overall motivations are benevolent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two: The counterforce is just as evil, if not more so, than the current controlling paradigm. Considering how evil the current paradigm is, this seems difficult to believe. I tend to think they are slightly less evil, that they're not on board with all the child raping/killing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is no hero, he's a figurehead for the counterforce group, who needed a "name," a "persona" everybody knows. He's mostly there to distract from the real heavy shit that's going down, and the media plays along.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible all this is merely theater, entertainment before the asteroid hits or the solar wave fries all the electronics.

       Hardcore shilling on this sub. The worst is coming from the hordes of r/politics and r/worldnews assets. If you take a look at subs like these you will see that they are entirely taken over by corporate media and they are turning redditors into their personal army to subvert non conforming subreddits like this one. Just read the comment sections on these subs, the people are totally radicalized and irrational from the constant consumption of corporate propaganda.

       QAnon is probably a LARP for the conspiracy minded.  The illusion, however, is being shattered.

       Why would Democrats vote for the Re-Auth if they think the president may be a Russian plant?  Why would a President that is at war with the deep state sing the Re-Auth continuing the deep state's power?!?  The narrative is shattered.  Those on the Trump train are not going to be able to mend the shattering illusion.

       Sometimes it feels like there's a delicate balance between TPTB's control and plans vs outright revolt by the population. Sometimes things seem to tip a little too far either way, thngs look like they're going to stray into unharmonious territory, and resources are put into play to bring things back into balance so the sheep can keep on being sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, when there's something that pisses off the population and makes them sit up and take notice (profiteering, war crimes, overreach, erosion of rights, whatever) TPTB say, "We can't have that! Distract them so they go back to watching the Kardashians! Make Donald say something controversial again! Fuck that mayor over in that little podunk town with some big scandal! Hint at something so people look elsewhere!"

who owns a huge chunk of the BIG BIG money in the world?
what does money give you?
what do people/organizations do when they don't get their way?

       And how do we know Trump isn't their puppet? Instead of going after Hillary like he promised, he's going after marihuana. And cutting taxes for the elites. His populist message is a facade to keep the common man happy. TPTB saw the populist wave on both sides and decided to infiltrate it. We're on our own, and the sooner you realize that the better.
