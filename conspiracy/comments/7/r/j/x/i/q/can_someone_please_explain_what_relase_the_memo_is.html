       The FISA Court is used to evade the normal procedures for acquiring a warrant to intrude on the communications of US citizens. Its existence is justified by the need for "National Security." If the members of congress who have read the contents of the memo are telling the truth about what it contains, then The FISA Court was used to get a warrant that allowed the USA's national security apparatus first to influence a US election, then to overturn the outcome of that election.

       Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, created in 1978 establishing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The court is held in secret, with only the government present.  The members of the bench are appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, their rulings have real world implications in the intelligence community. There is a court of review but only three cases have ever gone before it, the Supreme Court is the ultimate last step but no case has ever reached that far. Between 1979 and 2012 the court has heard 33,900 and only denied wiretapping in eleven cases.

       Because Mueller can't impeach the President, and he can't actually arrest him either. The real outcome of the investigation will depend on Congress, and their response will depend in large part on how their constituents see the Mueller investigation. If the Republicans successfully move on from it in the public mind, there will be far less push to impeach or punish even if Mueller confirms every possible charge.

       Friend, politicians don’t listen to their constituents unless is to prepare speeches near election times. What the public wants means jack shit in the political world.

       Public opinion absolutely influences decisions. If the public demands the head of Trump, Republican lawmakers will be more likely to act. It's not out of altruism or devotion to the land, it's because they want to keep their jobs.

       Thing is, the public had been demanding his head since his poll numbers started picking up steam during the campaign. There was even a literal dummy head severed on Twitter. Hasn’t worked so far.

       Members of the House on Thursday said they viewed a “shocking” classified memo allegedly detailing abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by senior Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigations officials in relation to the investigation of the Trump campaign and called for it to be declassified and available to the public immediately.
“It’s troubling. It is shocking,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) told Fox News. “Part of me wishes that I didn’t read it because I don’t want to believe that those kinds of things could be happening in this country that I call home and love so much.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “The facts contained in this memo are jaw-dropping and demand full transparency. There is no higher priority than the release of this information to preserve our democracy,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), a member of the Judiciary Committee, which oversees the DOJ and the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another Judiciary Committee member, Rep. Steve King (R-IA), called what he saw in the memo “sickening” and said it was “worse than Watergate.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read the memo. The sickening reality has set in. I no longer hold out hope there is an innocent explanation for the information the public has seen. I have long said it is worse than Watergate. It was #neverTrump &amp; #alwaysHillary. #releasethememo

      <p>
       Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), another Judiciary Committee member,  called the memo “deeply troubling” and said it raises questions about the “Obama DOJ and Comey FBI.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “The classified report compiled by House Intelligence is deeply troubling and raises serious questions about the upper echelon of the Obama DOJ and Comey FBI as it relates to the so-called collusion investigation,” he tweeted.

       “You think about, ‘is this happening in America or is this the KGB?’ That’s how alarming it is,” Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) told Fox News.
      </p>
      <p>
       “It is so alarming the American people have to see this,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, also said to network.
      </p>
      <p>
       The viewing of the memo came after all Republican members of the House intelligence committee, whose investigators compiled the classified memo, voted Thursday to make it available to all House members. Every Democrat on the committee voted against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Gaetz, the memo’s contents could lead to the firing — and perhaps even jailing — of senior DOJ and FBI officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I think that this will not end just with firings. I believe there are people who will go to jail,” he said on Fox News’ Hannity.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said what he saw in the memo also explains why Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Judiciary Subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) recently referred the Fusion GPS dossier author Christopher Steele for a criminal investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I think there will be criminal implications here,” Gaetz added.
      </p>
      <p>
       The memo also reportedly contains information about the dossier put together by Fusion GPS that alleged Trump and members of his team colluded with Russians in the 2016 election, according to a report by investigative journalist Sara Carter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was revealed in October that the dossier was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Despite being a political document, the dossier was reportedly part of the evidence FBI officials used to apply for and obtain a warrant through a secret FISA court to spy on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Page told Breitbart News in a statement: “After over a year of inciting discord and threats of violence across America, it’s encouraging that the individuals in Washington responsible for these efforts to undermine our great democracy may be held accountable soon.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Breitbart News reported on March 3, 2017, that the Obama administration took steps to undermine Trump’s presidential campaign using “police state” tactics, including spying on the Trump campaign. That report is widely believed to have led to President Trump’s tweet that later accused the Obama administration of wiretapping Trump Tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of the public and Congress are now calling for the document to be declassified and released to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately #ReleaseTheMemo #FISAMemo &amp; ALL relevant material sourced in it. Every American needs to know the truth! We wouldn't be revealing any sources &amp; methods that we shouldn't; only feds' reliance on bad sources &amp; methods.

       DeSantis said the House intelligence committee, pursuant to House rules, should vote to make the report publicly available as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       “While the report is classified as Top Secret, I believe the select committee should, pursuant to House rules, vote to make the report publicly available as soon as possible. This is a matter of national significance and the American people deserve the truth,” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Rule X of the House Rules allows the select committee to publicly disclose any information in its possession after a determination by the select committee that the public interest would be served by such disclosure.”
      </p>
      <p>
       According to House Rules, if the House intelligence committee votes to make the report public, President Trump would have five days to issue an objection. If he objected, it would take a vote on the House floor.

       There is a classified Memo that the GoP is wanting released so that the public knows just how deep the corruption went. From the sounds of it, it would seem they have a private conversation record of Obama's DoJ and FBI conspiring to use the FISA system illegally to spy on a political opponent and sitting President. Treason in every sense of the word.
