    <div class="md"><p>Make sure that each day you focus on real people and real life every day.  Begin with yourself and what  you want in life, then family or romantic relationships, include your co-workers and neighbors and the people you bump to as you are out and about.  </p>

<p>Notice how life is actually happening, don&#39;t pay so much attention to   all those efforts constantly</p>

<p>We are all still the same people we were last year, 10  years ago, 50  years ago. </p>

<p>We are not naturally violent against each other, we are a species who are genetically designed to succeed by cooperating with each other.</p>

<p>Pay attention to life as it is actually happening, not to the constant stream of manipulative misinformation, and keep moving forward and when possible provide any boost you can to others, and sometimes all we can offer is a kind word, thanks, and encouragement, to another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since scientists first started electrically shocking Planaria worms, you&#39;ve been subject to series of shocks. If you fear it excites the flight/fight response, if they keep it up, you are left with flight/hide due to exhaustion, you become decerebrate no longer capable of critical thinking, cognitive dissonance leads you to say, &quot;Help me Daddy, make the bad thing go away.&quot; You <em>surrender to authority</em>.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been fine tuning the shocks: frequency, duration, reinforcement, and inventing new ones. Example: the 17 year War <strong><em>OF</em></strong> Terror. How about &quot;Carbon&quot;? Overpopulation? Now, &quot;The Russians are coming!&quot; It&#39;s all a shit show to make sure you can never raise your head up and question or challenge the rich man&#39;s stranglehold which becomes stronger and stronger as he buys or blackmails our representatives. We are no longer represented at all, and you know it. Oh how about those mass shootings? Rumors of war? On and on. TV is the number one hypnotic source of your misery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I do: I am trying to make as much money as I can, and build up as many assets as possible. I have mainly invested in real estate, and I now have enough passive income that I don&#39;t have to work if I don&#39;t want to, but I am anyway. I also own a property in Montana, which seems like it would be a pretty decent place to be if shit goes down. For now, its a great vacation spot that I can rent out.</p>

<p>Point being, live normally and prepare as best you can in case you are right. I&#39;ll bet nothing significant happens in our lifetimes, but I&#39;d be a fool if I didn&#39;t hedge my bets.</p>
