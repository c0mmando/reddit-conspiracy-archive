        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many people in the conspiracy community have laughed at the idea of a flat earth model, and wonder how such a theory came about.  Well, I can tell you that this theory came about because nearly all of the photographs from &quot;outer space&quot; have been artistically rendered.  Additionally, nearly all satellite photographs and photographs of the earth have also been artistically rendered.  Furthermore, we see tools like Google maps that are seemingly able to take a sphere and make it appear flat.  It makes you wonder:  what are they hiding about &quot;outer space&quot;?  Also, if math is able to take a sphere and make it flat, is the opposite effect also possible?  I believe that many of these questions would be answered if we could determine how to travel in a straight line using earth&#39;s magnetic fields, but this information is hidden.  Due to a lack of information, we can only conjecture regarding the nature of this place, but one thing is certain:  we are actively being deceived.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know many of you like to think that flat earth has been a thing for a long time but it hasn&#39;t. It is a disinformation psyop that was started shortly after Obama mentioned the flat earth society in a couple speeches on climate change.</p>

<p>I would really start to look hard at the main youtube users pushing this stuff. I agree that NASA paints the earth and the moon landing footage is most likely studio footage(ok it is) and we can&#39;t get past the van allen belts. But don&#39;t fall for it. Look all the way back to 2004 and you will see it came out of almost nowhere in 2014. It is a psyop that is sucking in folks who are waking up trying to make sense of the world around them. I know shit is messed up and it is ok to entertain the thought but don&#39;t swallow it hook line and sinker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I don&#39;t see that as a good business plan. There are much cheaper ways to do this. If the Earth is flat you can still have nihilism and atheism. If the Earth is round you can still have Christianity and hope. </p>

<p>There is just such a large leap from lying about the flatness of the earth to atheism and nihilism. Social media works just fine for that and it is hella cheaper. Do we have photos of the ice walls? How much would it cost to guard the ice walls? How many people would it take to guard the ice walls? What are the chances of these people keeping such a juicy secret?  It all seems too messy for a government that cannot figure out how to make the DMV work, the Post office to work, the finances for military to work, the Medicare system to work, the SS system to work, the TSA to work. </p>

<p>Either the Government is an amazing system that can keep many secrets or it is a terrible bureaucracy that isn&#39;t allowed to look at their shoes unless the proper paperwork has been filled out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can respect that aspect, but please consider your plan for greed/narcissism/separation. Spend BILLIONS of dollars on a lie that doesn&#39;t really have a good business model. Also, who is starting this amount of spending?  When did this idea start? Who started this idea? Remember that this idea began before 1400s. That means that a group of people would have to convince ALL mathematicians, astronomers, physicists, and pilots to lie to the public for over 600 years! That has to be a red flag for you. </p>

<p>Please just ask any pilot about the spherical nature of the earth. Flight times are reduced by using the principals of the spherical nature of the earth. It an extremely common math equation that is used thousands of times a day. I don&#39;t want to dismiss your argument that greed and narcissism play a role in the world, but convincing the population that the world is spherical just doesn&#39;t do that. However, reshaping science to fit a biblical view sounds more like a conspiracy to me.  </p>
