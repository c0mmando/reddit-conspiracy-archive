       Many people in the conspiracy community have laughed at the idea of a flat earth model, and wonder how such a theory came about.  Well, I can tell you that this theory came about because nearly all of the photographs from "outer space" have been artistically rendered.  Additionally, nearly all satellite photographs and photographs of the earth have also been artistically rendered.  Furthermore, we see tools like Google maps that are seemingly able to take a sphere and make it appear flat.  It makes you wonder:  what are they hiding about "outer space"?  Also, if math is able to take a sphere and make it flat, is the opposite effect also possible?  I believe that many of these questions would be answered if we could determine how to travel in a straight line using earth's magnetic fields, but this information is hidden.  Due to a lack of information, we can only conjecture regarding the nature of this place, but one thing is certain:  we are actively being deceived.

       I know many of you like to think that flat earth has been a thing for a long time but it hasn't. It is a disinformation psyop that was started shortly after Obama mentioned the flat earth society in a couple speeches on climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would really start to look hard at the main youtube users pushing this stuff. I agree that NASA paints the earth and the moon landing footage is most likely studio footage(ok it is) and we can't get past the van allen belts. But don't fall for it. Look all the way back to 2004 and you will see it came out of almost nowhere in 2014. It is a psyop that is sucking in folks who are waking up trying to make sense of the world around them. I know shit is messed up and it is ok to entertain the thought but don't swallow it hook line and sinker.

       Flat Earth has been believed far longer than the spherical model. A round Earth is the new version, people are just beginning to once again wake to the deception. In all honesty, we have no idea what the Earth looks like as we have never seen a real image of it. Everything presented are just theories, but Flat Earth has been believed by civilizations far more advanced than us and makes far more sense and than a ball spinning and travelling at millions of miles per hour around a sun through space.

       They're hiding Hollow Earth aka Agartha.

       Every piece of disinfo they release has truth to it, so what's the truth behind Flat Earth? The best theory I heard is that the Earth starts to flatten out somewhat near the polar openings. That explains the NASA renderings (which also hide the Secret Space Program).

       Flat earth theories didn’t start because of the images from space. It has been a belief for centuries, maybe longer. Unfortunate that it’s ill advised belief, but anyone can believe whatever they want.

       four questions: 
1). Why would the government hide a flat earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       2). Realistically try to calculate how much it would cost to keep us
from knowing about a flat earth. Would the secret be worth the money?
      </p>
      <p>
       3). Who would benefit from a round earth conspiracy?
      </p>

       4). How would they benefit from a round earth conspiracy?

       they benefit from the round earth conspiracy to promote atheism and nihilism. it helps keep people participating in the governments today and keeps them distracted. if you believe that your life is worthless and youre drifting in space you'll spend a lot of your money on distractions from that "truth."  You'll watch television and sports, you'll believe that politics are real, you'll participate in this gross modern system just to fit in with all the other people who don't want to be alone with their thoughts. imo

       I guess I don't see that as a good business plan. There are much cheaper ways to do this. If the Earth is flat you can still have nihilism and atheism. If the Earth is round you can still have Christianity and hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is just such a large leap from lying about the flatness of the earth to atheism and nihilism. Social media works just fine for that and it is hella cheaper. Do we have photos of the ice walls? How much would it cost to guard the ice walls? How many people would it take to guard the ice walls? What are the chances of these people keeping such a juicy secret?  It all seems too messy for a government that cannot figure out how to make the DMV work, the Post office to work, the finances for military to work, the Medicare system to work, the SS system to work, the TSA to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either the Government is an amazing system that can keep many secrets or it is a terrible bureaucracy that isn't allowed to look at their shoes unless the proper paperwork has been filled out.

       they keep saying there's possibilites of other life in the endless vastness of space and that we are specks of dust in the 'galaxy.' This makes people afraid and makes them think that they are nothing. it makes life seem meaningless. They dont want us to know that this earth is all there is and that we are all connected as ONE. They want to increase the greed/narcissism/seperation of the populace. They hide and lie so much from us about ancient history and theyve done it so well too

       I can respect that aspect, but please consider your plan for greed/narcissism/separation. Spend BILLIONS of dollars on a lie that doesn't really have a good business model. Also, who is starting this amount of spending?  When did this idea start? Who started this idea? Remember that this idea began before 1400s. That means that a group of people would have to convince ALL mathematicians, astronomers, physicists, and pilots to lie to the public for over 600 years! That has to be a red flag for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please just ask any pilot about the spherical nature of the earth. Flight times are reduced by using the principals of the spherical nature of the earth. It an extremely common math equation that is used thousands of times a day. I don't want to dismiss your argument that greed and narcissism play a role in the world, but convincing the population that the world is spherical just doesn't do that. However, reshaping science to fit a biblical view sounds more like a conspiracy to me.

       Flat Earth has been believed far longer than the spherical model. A round Earth is the new version, people are just beginning to once again wake to the deception. In all honesty, we have no idea what the Earth looks like as we have never seen a real image of it. Everything presented are just theories, but Flat Earth has been believed by civilizations far more advanced than us and makes far more sense and than a ball spinning and travelling at millions of miles per hour around a sun through space.
