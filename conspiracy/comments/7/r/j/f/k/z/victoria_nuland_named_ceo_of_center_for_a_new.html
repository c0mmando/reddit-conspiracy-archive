        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">51</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/CelineHagbard.html">CelineHagbard</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Longtime users of this sub are likely familiar with Victoria <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=MSxaa-67yGM">&quot;Fuck the EU&quot;</a> Nuland. The context of that quote was a leaked phone call between Nuland (then Assistant US Sec of State) and Geoffrey Pyatt (Ambassador to Ukraine) in early 2014 and released Feb. 4, 2014, in the midst of the crisis in the Ukraine and the eventual ouster of then President of Ukraine Victor Yanukovych. Even before Yanukovych was ousted, Nuland had decided that Arseniy Yatseniuk (“Yats”) was the man the US wanted in the new government:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think Yats is the guy who’s got the economic experience, the governing experience.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arseniy Yatsenyuk would be <a href="http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/193035.html">made prime minister</a> on Feb. 27, 2014. Much more could be said on the US&#39; involvement in the the 2014 Ukraine putsch, and much has, but suffice it to say that Victoria Nuland was heavily involved in representing the US interests both before, during, and after the events of the Maidan. </p>

<p>Those of you with a longer memory of geopolitics might remember the name Victoria Nuland from another regime change orchestrated by the US government. In 1997, Victoria Nuland&#39;s husband Robert Kagan, along with William Kristol, co-founded and signed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050205041635/http://www.newamericancentury.org/statementofprinciples.htm">Statement of Priniciples</a> for neoconservative foreign policy think tank, the Project for a New American Century. If you&#39;re familiar with this organization, it&#39;s likely because of a report they issued in September 2000, <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf">Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses</a> <em>[PDF]</em>, in which they argued for America to take a more aggressive approach to funding the military in the wake of the end of the Cold War. Specifically, they bemoaned:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a <strong><em>new Pearl Harbor</em></strong> [emphasis mine].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we know, they ended up getting that &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot; they wished for, and fellow signatories Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and Paul Wolfowitz ended up being the driving forces in the 2003 invasion and regime change in Iraq. </p>

<p>I bring all this up because if you were reading what these neocon &quot;thought leaders&quot; were saying in the late 90s and early 00s, you could have foreseen the direction US foreign policy ended up going for the last twenty years. It should be noted that Victoria Nuland&#39;s role in the Ukraine crisis took place under <em>Democratic</em> president Barack Obama. This is what we mean when we say for certain issues such as foreign policy, it doesn&#39;t matter a whole lot which team&#39;s puppet sits in the Oval Office. </p>

<p>Now we have Victoria Nuland, the same massively influential neocon, <a href="https://www.cnas.org/press/press-release/cnas-names-victoria-nuland-former-u-s-ambassador-to-nato-as-ceo-robert-o-work-former-deputy-secretary-of-defense-rejoins-cnas-as-senior-defense-counselor">being made CEO</a> of the <a href="https://www.cnas.org/">Center for a New American Security</a> (name sound vaguely familiar to anyone?).  CNAS&#39;s mission statement is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Center for a New American Security (CNAS) is an independent, bipartisan, nonprofit organization that develops strong, pragmatic, and principled national security and defense policies. CNAS engages policymakers, experts, and the public with innovative, fact-based research, ideas, and analysis to shape and elevate the national security debate. A key part of our mission is to inform and prepare the national security leaders of today and tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a level higher than this, some shadowy cabal with names like Rockefeller and Rothschild, and even several that few of us even on this sub have ever heard of? I wouldn&#39;t doubt it for a second. But when it comes to the level where the medium-term plans are implemented (~10–30 year time scales), they don&#39;t really hide what they&#39;re doing; they broadcast it for everyone to see. Their &quot;agenda is designed to shape the choices of leaders in the U.S. government, the private sector, and society to advance U.S. interests and strategy.&quot; They openly brag that their &quot;work has informed key U.S. strategic choices and has been acted on by Republican and Democratic leaders in the executive branch and on Capitol Hill.&quot;</p>

<p>And this is also not to say that CNAS and the neocons more broadly are the only game in town. There are literally dozens if not hundreds of policy think tanks in DC and across the globe, some competing, some cooperating to an extent, that are not only shaping the policies of the US and other major powers, but are doing so publicly. Glenn Greenwald <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/07/17/with-new-d-c-policy-group-dems-continue-to-rehabilitate-and-unify-with-bush-era-neocons/">wrote about one here</a>, the <a href="http://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/">Alliance for Securing Democracy</a>, in which  top neocons (including Bill Kristol and Mike Chertoff) are teaming up with prominent establishment Democratic war hawks (Laura Rosenberger, Jake Sullivan, and former acting CIA Director Mike Morrell). </p>

<p>This is what I mean (and I think I can speak for quite a few here) when I say that <strong>Red vs Blue is a sham and a distraction</strong>. The MSM, and to a large extent a lot of the alt media as well, act as the rodeo clowns to pull our attention away from what these groups are openly saying and advocating for. I&#39;m not saying we could have prevented or even predicted 9/11 and the Iraq war by studying these groups in the late 90s, but that whole mess would have made a lot more sense had we be combing through these documents instead of analyzing &quot;lock boxes&quot; and &quot;hanging chads&quot; with a microscope. &quot;Shithole&quot; and &quot;governement shutdown&quot; are those buzzwords of this week, but I&#39;d bet good money that what&#39;s coming out of these think tanks today will have a hell of a lot more relevance in 10 years than 99% of anything coming out of the MSM <em>or</em> the alt media this week. </p>

<p>Our news cycles, even and maybe especially on this sub, are measured in days or weeks if we&#39;re lucky; these players operate on years and decades. And that doesn&#39;t even get to those who think in generations and centuries. </p>

<p>ever since I found out Mattis was a member.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good find. Seems he <a href="https://www.cnas.org/press/press-release/gen-ret-james-mattis-adm-ret-gary-roughead-tim-westergren-join-cnas-board-of-directors">came on in 2014</a>, but has since left at some point. The link to his page on their site 404s now. Wouldn&#39;t look too good for the Sec Def to be so openly part of a neocon think tank. </p>

<p>A project I&#39;ve been mulling around in my head for the last year or two is to build an extensive knowledge graph of all these influential players, the organizations they been a part of, the positions they&#39;ve held, and their connections with each other. Sort of like those graphs I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen of interlocking corporate directorates, but fully searchable and indexed. </p>

<p>I have about half the tech skills needed to do this, but it&#39;s a pretty ambitious goal to do it how I want it. If anyone&#39;s interested in such a project, let me know here or shoot me a PM. If done right, I think it could be a pretty useful resource. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great post. These think tanks are the tail that wags the dog of American foreign policy. If you look at their <a href="https://www.cnas.org/support-cnas/cnas-supporters">self disclosed financiers</a> you&#39;ll pretty quickly realize what the end goal of these organizations is. The vast majority are either directly MIC contractors (Boeing, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop) or entities with vested interests in the business of war. It&#39;s pretty simplistic, but a company that makes bombs...needs someone to drop them, so they can make more.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s such an easy sell to the rest of the government too. Personal example, at least in my tiny rural state, literally the only relatively high paying jobs are <em>from</em> the MIC. My senators have a vested interest in there being a need for planes and surface ships.</p>

<p>The drums of war are pretty obviously beating in NK and Iran&#39;s (at the behest of Israel) direction. I have half a hope that Bush fucked up Afghanistan/Iraq so much that the public wouldn&#39;t be down for round two...but the group was the New American <strong>Century</strong> so maybe they can just wait it out. Or maybe they&#39;ll create another new Pearl Harbor, its worked a few times in the past.</p>

<p>I think Eisenhower warned us about this...</p>

<p>Yep. Same with the security contractors, and to a lesser extent, a lot of the other major industries such as pharma. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think a hot war with NK is unlikely for the foreseeable future, and Iran only slightly more likely, but the mere buildup of arms does, to paraphrase Eisenhower, represent a theft from the American people, and from the people of the war more generally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree hot wars with those countries are unlikely, if only because the wars of the Bush/Obama (and now Trump) administrations were such a boondoggle - and memories aren&#39;t that short. I think the patriotic fervor following 9/11 has waned. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with the idea it robs the people to fund the military, but it also employs millions of people - so it also feeds a huge amount of the country as well. Calling it welfare for the country is apparently insulting, so it&#39;s just job creation.</p>

<p>Maybe we could use that money to rebuild critical infrastructure. Fuck I&#39;d love the boarder wall if it created good, union jobs for Americans. It&#39;s kind of funny, political opinions of a wall aside, it&#39;s a very New Deal kind of program to directly inject tax-payer money back into the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is kind of funny that the American military is literally the largest socialist program in the world. It employees people, but not to any good end. The best-case use for a bomber is that it never needs to be used. The ability to project force has certainly helped the US GDP over the last 70 years, but dollar for dollar it&#39;s becoming a bad investment, even for the wealthy.</p>

<p>If the government is going to spend taxpayer money on anything that large, I&#39;d much prefer a massive infrastructure program. Our bridges and roads are crumbling, and our rail system is laughably outdated. The wall would be interesting for doing that, but doesn&#39;t do anything to directly help the American people. Not really. TVA massively improved the lives of real people who were struggling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I completely agree, the massive defense budget is just a socialist jobs program with better PR. Call military spending welfare and youre a pariah, but based on the conventional definition it fits.</p>

<p>The wall is a feel good measure much like a new Aircraft Carrier, I agree, unnecessary entirely, but fuck if it doesn&#39;t give normal Americans money. </p>

<p>New hydroelectric programs, solar energy training and instillation - all things that would drastically improve life in the country. Alternate energy sources would further put us out of the influence of the fossil fuel rich countries, lessening their influence on us.</p>

<p>We&#39;re getting away from the point of these alphabet think tanks that shift foreign policy towards bomb dropping, rather than road building, but I&#39;m kinda blind to how to get back to that kind of system. </p>

<p>Fuck, of all the evil fucks to poke their head up this election season, the only people talking about domestic infrastructure development were Bernie and goddamn Steve Bannon. Building in our own country isn&#39;t as sexy as destroy another country I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if Hillary Clinton went down it would be a bishop sacrifice at best. She&#39;s a major player, but ultimately still a few layers removed. If they did &quot;take her down,&quot; which would be more for show than anything, it would be to protect the numerous connections of the Clinton Foundation, CHAI, and CGI. These foundations have operated as a nexus of a lot of this influence peddling, and are connect to a lot of the huge players in the NGO worlds like Open Society and the Gates Foundation. Charles Ortel has done some good work uncovering some of these connections. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a hydra, only worse to some extent, probably closer to a mycelium network. It operates right beneath the surface, but there&#39;s no single point of failure. It&#39;s tendrils reach into every aspect of modern society, from governments to corporations to foundations and other NGOs. You can burn it back on the edges, but even if you somehow took out a major node, the rest of the network would quickly fill in the whole. Most if not all of the players are expendable, and few if any have control or even knowledge of the whole board. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All these plans hinge on money, but the US empire is precarious at the moment due to possible bankruptcy.  A handful of oil producing nations (Venezuela, Russia, and Iran, as well as China in the SE sea) are not selling for dollars.  This means that countries that need oil are going to return a portion of those dollars causing inflation in the US.  Inflation in the US means that the government cannot print more dollars to fund the military objectives.  In the past, the USG was able to print dollars but the effects of printing (inflation) were exported to those countries needing to purchase oil.</p>

<p>This is probably why Trump is pushing to stop low producing/high welfare immigrants from coming to the US.  It is also why he&#39;s looking to bring back production to the US.  He wants to strengthen the economy in preparation for the dump of dollars.  The MAGA envisioned by these think tanks means a mega economy, not freedom or liberty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, I think think tanks are one of the clearest ways to see how our government is being manipulated and controlled. It&#39;s hard to tell how powerful indvidual think tanks are as they don&#39;t get much attention but they have to be very influential with how many powerful people they have on their boards running them. </p>

<p>For example I know there was a lot of Israeli influence pushing for the iraq war and involving aipac pnac and some more think tanks. But its hard to see how influential they are when there are hundreds of others </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck the EU coming straight from the ruling class
A power hungry bitch got it good &#39;cause I&#39;m an ass
And not the other underlings so the we all think
we have the authority to kill a minority
Love that shit, &#39;cause I&#39;m the one
who runs punk motherfuckers with dog-tags and guns
to be beating on, and throw them in jails
We can make the the whole world a living hell 
Fucking with me causes artificial anger 
I&#39;ll call your just leader a fuckin&#39; dictator
Shooting for the Stars, Nukes are the product
And the US government is selling narcotics
You&#39;d rather see, me than Le Pen
than me and Obama no different from Osama
Beat a culture out of shape
and when I&#39;m finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
At a black site you get bread and water
I don&#39;t know if they fags or what
Looking out for their people, they must be nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can&#39;t get none
But don&#39;t let it be a black and a white one
&#39;Cause we&#39;ll slam ya down to the street top
World police showing force the Black Ops
Nuland will swarm
on any motherfucker without a US uniform
Just &#39;cause I runs, with the USD
All countries are afraid of me!
HUH, an old hag on the warpath
And when I&#39;m finished, it&#39;s gonna be a bloodbath
of civilians, dying in everyday
Anyone else got something to say?</p>

They use east vs west and christianity vs islam as an excuse to run their middle east proxy wars and bleed the american taxpayers, while they work to set up their new world order with Israel at the top of the Pyramid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Foreign Affairs, as in the CFR publication? I actually think it&#39;s still worthwhile to read, particularly so we can understand the globalist thinking on a lot of issues. CFR is a more broad NGO politics-wise (compared to CNAS being more neocon, and something like Center for American Progress being more neoliberal/establishment Democrat), so I think <em>FA</em> articles tend to establish roughly the two ends of the Overton window. </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually rethinking some of my media consumption habits, but I generally like James Corbett for doing some great analysis on how current events fit into the broader historical perspectives. For more current news, I do like the No Agenda podcast, but lately I think they&#39;ve been a bit distracted by the spectacle rather than unveiling it. </p>

<p>In general, I think it&#39;s good to consider perspectives from those pretty far outside the Overton window, in both directions. Even if I don&#39;t agree with their ideologies or policy prescriptions, they bring focus to details and events that get ignored by the mainstream and the alt-reaction media. Chris Hedges from TruthDig and Robert Parry from Consortium News are generally pretty good from the &quot;left,&quot; and ZeroHedge and GlobalResearch.ca have some good material from the &quot;right&quot;. NakedCapitalism often has some great insight on financial matters from a variety of authors, and MoonOfAlabama can be quite good as well. </p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t have too many authors from the right whom I consistently trust to deliver accurate and unsensationalized reporting. Not because I lean left (I do in some areas, absolutely not in others), but I think because their audience tends more to crave the sensational, which then drives the content. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree hot wars with those countries are unlikely, if only because the wars of the Bush/Obama (and now Trump) administrations were such a boondoggle - and memories aren&#39;t that short. I think the patriotic fervor following 9/11 has waned. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with the idea it robs the people to fund the military, but it also employs millions of people - so it also feeds a huge amount of the country as well. Calling it welfare for the country is apparently insulting, so it&#39;s just job creation.</p>

<p>Maybe we could use that money to rebuild critical infrastructure. Fuck I&#39;d love the boarder wall if it created good, union jobs for Americans. It&#39;s kind of funny, political opinions of a wall aside, it&#39;s a very New Deal kind of program to directly inject tax-payer money back into the country.</p>
