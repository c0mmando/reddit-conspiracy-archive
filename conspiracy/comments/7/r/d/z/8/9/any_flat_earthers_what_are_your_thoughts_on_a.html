       Hi, everybody. I've been sitting on an idea for a while and I wanted to reach out and see what your thoughts on this are. Feel free to answer if you're not a Flat Earther.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a student journalist, and I want to make a short video profile of people who associate with the Flat Earth movement. Conspiracy theorists face a lot of ridicule by the media but I find the community to be a great example of people exercising their free speech and questioning mainstream beliefs. I think it may also be symbolic of a greater struggle against current politics. I would want to focus more on the person, than the conspiracy aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have some questions, if you have the time to answer:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) theoretically, how open would you be to having your political/scientific opinions recorded (not necessarily in a video) and published?
      </p>
      <p>
       b) are there certain aspects of this that you think it is imperative to cover?
      </p>
      <p>
       c) I live in Canada. Don't tell me your city (unless you want to) but is there a sizeable population of the community in Canada (esp. British Columbia?)
      </p>
      <p>
       d) lastly, is this something you'd be interested in watching? If not, what would make it pique your interest?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks so much to anyone who can help me out. I really appreciate it!

       If you want a theory most agree on here try MKUltra. If you want something like Flat Earth try Electric Universe Theory. While I don't subscribe to EUT at least it's not the dumb of Flat Earth.

       Flat earth is not free speech. Free speech is something that comes from your mind. There's a major differential between being paid to speak your mind or actually using your mind.

       You should probably do it on the idea of alternative views on the planet/our existence in general- if you want to keep the flat earth type topic. The flat earth theory is what brought me to this sub, b/c I wanted to see it debated.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the first conspiracy in a while to really make me question what I've already believed in for years. I think people hate it mostly b/c we are so invested in aliens, and space travel, and that puts those in question. Cue somebody to hit me with, "No, we hate it b/c it's retarded!" and run away.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been attacked more than any conspiracy that I've ever seen. You can rant about shape shifting lizard people all day long, and never get a peep in opposition. Mention that flat earth has some merit to it, and people come out of ye old woodworks to get this visceral hostility to you. This fascinates me, as well as the topic of what is reality in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially the flat earth conundrum is more complex than most people give it credit for. There are problems with a globe earth/heliocentric model, and this is what pulls most people in to consider it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, people have points against flat earth, but seem to overlook or assume that those things makes all the things like Eric Dubay's 200 proofs the earth is flat not exist or still be valid points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I recognize that both (all?) models, flat, sphere, pear- I mean "oblate spheroid," hollow, etc. all have their quirks and anomalies, which just send me running back to Camp Simulation Theory, like Elon Musk believes.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Flat earth is fascinating to open minded people, but gets gut wrench reactions from many. They think, "I can prove x is a problem on flat earth, so everything else is false, ergo earth is a ball." Nevermind that there are still problems with sphere earth. Then there's hollow earth guys. You should cover the whole fight, if you choose this subject.

       It gets attacked because it's a classic example of human stupidity and old, dated knowledge being replaced. Also, pretty much everyone hears the story of Columbus (I'm pretty sure he didn't actually think the earth was flat, but the point still stands) and the story of Galileo in school. It has also gained popularity as a meme/joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying the earth is flat gets a similar reaction to saying 2+2=5, and both ideas are similarly ridiculous.

       I actually watched that video. It's one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. It's just blatant falsehoods and lies over and over again going on and on.

      <p>
       The earth isn't flat. I'm all about being open minded, but if you think the earth is flat, you are about as far from being open minded as you can get.

       Hello you! I agree with a lot of what you say, except for your faith in NASA Freemasons, and I guess this having zero merit.

       No, I don't consider myself a flat earther, but they do have some points I'd like you to address for me. The biggest one off the top of my head is curved water. Other than a drop, or water curving as it pours, can you show water curving in a mass?
      </p>
      <p>
       They have a point with the, "water level" always being level, and some pictures that appear to defy curvature, (i.e. the world record photograph). There's the

      <p>
       It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       funny also, that people have seemingly conflicting arguments such as, "You can't go high enough to see the curvature, it's like an ant on a beach ball..." But then say you can see the curvature from the beach, watching ships, and from airplane windows. Even though no matter how high up you go, (so long as it's not a fisheye GoPro) it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       appear to be flat.

      <p>
       The curving in small amounts of water is due to surface tension. The reason why water "curves" in the ocean is because it's sitting on the earth, which is round. Before you say "then why doesn't it flow downhill", it's not downhill. Gravity is all even on that surface.

       You explained that one yourself. It's a mirage. It's not visible like that 99% of the time. If the earth was flat, you would always be able to see it.

        There's places that are known for their flatness such as this, which seem to defy curvature.

      <p>
       How does it defy curvature? Are you saying that because you cannot see the curve from ground level easy it is therefor flat? Really?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You can't go high enough to see the curvature, it's like an ant on a beach ball...

      <p>
       What? Who says you can't go high up enough to see the curve?
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmkbAql5_jU&amp;amp;t=0s">
        The curve starts to become very apparent at 40,000ft.

       Again, see what I just linked. Flights at 40,000ft are not that common, but there are some routs that take them. I was on a flight a while ago that briefly went up that high. Curve is definitely visible.

Many planes do still take the around rout because there are simply not very many people taking that rout, so they would rather funnel the people taking those flights onto more common routs.

       That is the same argument people use for everything. Ever drive in fog? Someone can be driving directly at you, with high beams on, and you won't see them until surprisingly close. Fog is essentially a ground level cloud, so the same phenomenon still applies everywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for flights, there's video after video of people showing different sides of the flight path problem. Some people can show some that don't make sense on ball earth, or how planes disappear off of GPS in the southern hemisphere, and some show some like you sent me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there's locations on the popular flat earth AE map model that don't make sense, there's also things on spinning sphere earth that don't make sense. Traveling with or against rotation comes to mind (other than the countless videos that are just guys showing opposite/counter scenarios like you sent me) but there's a
       <em>
        ton

       What about that? As I have already said, the atmosphere spins along with the earth. That doesn't really have an effect until you leave the atmosphere. Rockets launched into space do actually have to account for this, and launching eastward gives them a speed boost.

       Yeah, as picked up by a seismometer. We are talking vibrations so tiny you need extremely sensitive equipment to detect it. I really don't know what you think that is supposed to mean. There is even an explanation in your own link. You do realize by somehow using that as evidence you concede that the moon landings happen, right? Those seismometers were set up by astronauts, and the impact that caused them was the lunar descent module slamming into the moon.

      <p>
       It is large, but there is at least one far more extreme example that I can think of off the top of my head. The moon is about 80x smaller than the earth in terms of mass. Pluto's moon Charon is about 8x smaller than Pluto in terms of mass. That's a 10 fold increase. The size of the orbiting objects really doesn't matter. They can be the exact same size and mass and be in orbit around each other.

       About to go to bed, but I am interested by experiments that show things weighing more at different altitudes or locations. There's a guy on YouTube that does this, that I just remembered I wanted to check back up on.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why I brought up the Cavendish Experiment, most of the ones in use at universities such as Harvard, are the ones that use steel balls.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interesting thing about that is when you heat and machine steel, (such as in the manufacturing of said balls) it makes it slightly magnetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there is the phenomenon of static electricity, so basically the attraction for virtually all Cavendish setups could easily be explained with magnetism or static.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you scroll near the bottom of [this] page, you'll see Harvard has one for demonstration that admittedly has magnets in the center of the balls.

       It's hard to do it perfectly because the variation is relatively small over what you can realistically do. If you are interested, the equation for the change in acceleration do to gravity is g(h) = g * [r/(h + r)]
       <sup>
        2,
       </sup>
       where g(h) is your new gravitational acceleration, g is the acceleration due to gravity at sea level (about 9.81m/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       ), r is the radius of the earth (in m), and h is your altitude. If you get a decent scale you can probably test it yourself on an airplane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The centrifugal force of the earth's rotation also has an effect, so you would have to make sure you are at the same latitude as well.

      <p>
       If you heat up a metal, it loses its magnetic properties. Also, they used lead, which is not magnetic.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also there is the phenomenon of static electricity, so basically the attraction for virtually all Cavendish setups could easily be explained with magnetism or static.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, they most definitely cannot. If it was all explained by that, the experiment would not be repeatable with the same results over and over again across different tests and yield the same constant. It would be constantly changing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        If you scroll near the bottom of [this] page, you'll see Harvard has one for demonstration that admittedly has magnets in the center of the balls.

       Every online (particularly Reddit) has its go to words that everything seems to come back to eventually... and eventually get so played out it annoys me. When I was playing in the "manospere," and the other red pill subs, it was Alpha and Beta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, it's "shill." I'm
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       tired of hearing that word I'm about ready to pull out a thesaurus and throw it at somebody. It also doesn't help that I have the attention span of a squirrel.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, some of you seem to actually fit the proverbial bill, and it looks like you all are reading the same memo. I started to link you pictures of NASA Freemason coins and rings, and point out that public shuttles aren't lodges, and so what if they don't want to get hit with bad PR from discrimination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I saw you sent me
       <em>
        the exact same pictures that every other person has sent me
       </em>
       since I've started taking part in this debate. I reiterate,
       <em>
        the exact same still photograph of a sail boat
       </em>
       that I got
       <em>
        again
       </em>
       last night.
      </p>
      <p>
       It leads me to believe there are only five to ten pictures to represent what you claim, you all are literally getting the exact same memo, or you're all just that lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to play smack a flat mole in a discussion- at least try to be somewhat original, and creative. I'm quickly losing my give a humorous shit if the earth is a pizza, a pear, or a doughnut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is going to see you "roast" me except maybe 5 people, ( including mods) if you're lucky- and they're probably more bored with seeing the exact same copy pasta as I am. We'd probably all rather watch laundry spin, and at least see a different color every once and a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to read and get in on that new new baby, with everybody else. Start a new thread so maybe
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       body might add something we all haven't seen before... Or at least try to be as entertaining as the fizz fuck that hit me with the same shit last night.

       Yes, the Cavendish Experiment has been debunked years ago. It's still the experiment that is used to validate the gravitational constant though.

       , but all I've yet to be sent are balloons and such falling in a vacuum. We go in circles about density and buoyancy, and they say they can't work without gravity, but you can't explain away one set of physics with one you can't prove exist without the one you're trying to disprove.

       Water retains it's level. Polaris never moves, and can see the same star constellations in the ancient past, even though we are , as science states, orbiting the sun that is 93 million miles away, while rotating a thousand miles an hour, and spiraling through the universe at 66,ooo miles an hour. Yet you will still get circle star trails, same constellations from ancient past, and Polaris always remain center. The scientific equation for the curvature of the earth can't be proven. 8 inches per square mile can't be measured at ground level,, let alone almost 0 visible, or measurable curvature over a still body of water. Why does the dramatic changes in weather on earth from winter to summer seem more plausible that the earth tilts to a 93 million miles away sun, than merely the sun gets closer during the summer, further during the winter. The tilt just happens to be 66.6 degrees. LOL.

        Other than a drop, or water curving as it pours, can you show water curving in a mass

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The curving in small amounts of water is due to surface tension. The reason why water "curves" in the ocean is because it's sitting on the earth, which is round. Before you say "then why doesn't it flow downhill", it's not downhill. Gravity is all even on that surface.

       Again, see what I just linked. Flights at 40,000ft are not that common, but there are some routs that take them. I was on a flight a while ago that briefly went up that high. Curve is definitely visible.

      <p>
       It's hard to do it perfectly because the variation is relatively small over what you can realistically do. If you are interested, the equation for the change in acceleration do to gravity is g(h) = g * [r/(h + r)]
       <sup>
        2,
       </sup>
       where g(h) is your new gravitational acceleration, g is the acceleration due to gravity at sea level (about 9.81m/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       ), r is the radius of the earth (in m), and h is your altitude. If you get a decent scale you can probably test it yourself on an airplane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The centrifugal force of the earth's rotation also has an effect, so you would have to make sure you are at the same latitude as well.

        The interesting thing about that is when you heat and machine steel, (such as in the manufacturing of said balls) it makes it slightly magnetic.

      <p>
       If you heat up a metal, it loses its magnetic properties. Also, they used lead, which is not magnetic.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also there is the phenomenon of static electricity, so basically the attraction for virtually all Cavendish setups could easily be explained with magnetism or static.

      <p>
       No, they most definitely cannot. If it was all explained by that, the experiment would not be repeatable with the same results over and over again across different tests and yield the same constant. It would be constantly changing.

        If you scroll near the bottom of [this] page, you'll see Harvard has one for demonstration that admittedly has magnets in the center of the balls.

        They have a point with the, "water level" always being level, and some pictures that appear to defy curvature, (i.e. the world record photograph). There's the Chicago mirage picture that several guys have appeared to recreate, and drive to from one shore to the other on camera.
