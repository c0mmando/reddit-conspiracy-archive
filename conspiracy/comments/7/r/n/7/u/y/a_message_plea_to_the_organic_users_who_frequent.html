       We've been infiltrated by a concerted effort to hijack this sub and turn it into a battleground of a partisan nature.  As someone who has had a number of posts make it to the front page, I can tell you that the majority of organic users don't bother to vote or comment and this is hurting the quality of discourse here something fierce.  My plea is for you to start participating.  We need you.  The sub needs you.  The U.S.A. needs you and the world needs you and your participation here.  Don't simply lurk, participate.

       It's also important to browse /new. It's ground zero in the fight against the shills, and allows the Real Ones to set the tone of discussion for any given post. /new is far more interesting than /hot.

       They can slide stuff, and parrot talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they can't do is demonstrate compassion and thoughtfulness. There's no nuance or ability to admit that they just don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       When somebody begins to realize the only reason they've believed certain things is because their family, or pastor, or teacher, or television told them to reiterating the talking points only serve to highlight the bankruptcy of a position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just being real and admitting that we don't know but it definitely seems like some weird shit is going on will go a long ways.

       People who are paid for media work are paid to act a role. Getting true believers is a bonus at best, it can often be a liability because true believers are harder to control and are prone to moments of enlightenment that make them unpredictable.

       Regardless, it doesn't strengthen a weak position.

       Don't give up. We will get more organic participation to join your efforts and drown out the brigade that is trying to drown us out.  The organic users are the majority here, it's just that, until now, too many of them have been silent lurkers.

       Wow, the more I read replies like yours, the more I feel like this post is a conspiracy to introduce multiples users into this sub, under the guise of "I was just a lurker", to seize control of it.
       <br/>
       Seems like an inorganic push, framed as an organic push.

       This site is international in user-base, but still firmly US- and to a lesser extent Anglo-centric. Also, I think a lot of US conspiracy theorists (myself included) tend to hold onto our ingrained American exceptionalism in our own twisted way: America is the best at fucking everyone over.

       Any conspiracies you have! American ones are just easy because we have this Central Intelligence Agency that likes to overthrow governments and do general fuckery around the world, also FOIA that gives out "declasdified" documents with all the good stuff blacked out which is a breeding ground for conspiracy.

       I disagree, but that may be just a separate conspiracy that I subscribe to that you don't.  Something about the series of events playing out in the world right now makes it seem like public opinion is an extremely important battleground for both sides.  And it's not that the conspiracy community in particular is important to target, but more that the conspiracy community was one of the last places to freely discuss "wrongthink" on reddit.  Much like Albu Kamal was a small insignificant part of Syria until it was the last stronghold in the war against ISIS.  I wouldn't imagine the civilians there, watching artillery rain down on them, would have much respect for someone asking "why would two world powers fight over this little insignificant community?"

       Are you seriously asking for sources in regards to something that has been observed by many people here? I honestly have things to better use my time on. I legitimately don't care if you agree with me, I'm just stating what I've observed over the past ~4 years that I've been here.

       You think you "struck a chord"? As if I'm mentally ill myself for thinking that statement is rediculous? You don't have to partake in discussions you don't buy into, but don't pretend you know any better than they do. I don't believe all conspiracies either.

       It's pointless to claim that you've been here for 4 years on a 1 year old account. Maybe you have, maybe you haven't, but if you want to make that claim you have to keep your account running.

       In this thread? Yeah, probably. If you can't see that "more than a few" regular contributors here are mentally ill, then I don't know what to tell you.

       Someone ignoring the deep state conspiracy is obviously not interested in possibly one of the biggest conspiracy of all time.

       People don't draw a line between shills and useful idiots, and they need to. Shills are paid to convert people into useful idiots with deceptive rhetoric. Useful idiots really believe what they're saying and do the shill's work for them, for free.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is never worthwhile to call someone a shill, most of the time they're a useful idiot, and using that card just lends legitimacy to a cheap one-size-fits-all dismissal of an argument. Far better to pull apart the faulty rhetoric itself. You might convert the useful idiot(probably not during the exchange, but you'll plant seeds. The truth and honest rhetoric arepowerful that way), and by doing so you've inoculated anyone who reads the exchange from falling for the deceptive rhetoric.

       Paid or otherwise, there is a concerted effort to hijack this sub and turn it into a battleground of a partisan nature.  There are political conspiracies that should be addressed, but historically, this sub did not look at the world from a Left or Right, Republican or Democrat perspective, but from a perspective that acknowledged the Left/Right Paradigm is false.  That's Conspiracy Theory 101: Divide and Conquer.

       Continue voting and commenting.  If all the organic users here participate, the inorganic effort to hijack this sub will be extinguished.  This post, for example, at this time, has 107 points and is 82% upvoted.  Meanwhile, it's received 679 views.  Can you imagine if just 50% of the organic users voted/commented?  The inorganic effort would be overwhelmed.

       This sub went rabidly partisan during the 2016 campaign period, and the never-ending drip-drip-drip of allegations about Russia has just exacerbated that trend.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a way, it's gratifying that conspiratorial modes of expression have now 'gone mainstream', but the downside of that is that most people who constitute the mainstream are fucking imbeciles and the widening of debate has therefore led to its dilution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad truth is that these days it's the people who want a
       <em>
        non
       </em>
       -partisan sub who are trying to hijack it!
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see any cure for the situation, except not replying to partisan posts and trying to carry on with non-partisan debate. Unless there are enough non-partisans to start and moderate a new conspiracy subreddit with a strict "no party politics" rule.

       How would you eliminate party politics and not stifle conversation?  You have something to say, then say it.  I don't need people tiptoeing around becaise of some rule.  Party politics or not,  I also am capable of doing my own research if something captures my attention.  Just downvote and move on if that is what you want to do.  I would rather see an organic change than an artificial change.

       I agree with your statement, but am suspicious about your motives. Don't pretend this is a
       <em>
        recent

       thing. It's been evident for a few years, and ramped exponentially up during Trump v. Hillary.

       Now that many people here are seeing Trump as the charlatan he is, you come in and say it's becoming "partisan."

       Why is that?  What is the correlation between right wingers and conspiracy?  I certainly don't identify with either side 100% but given today's adminstration I'm forced to believe I lean left.  With that said, I have a great intolerance for both types of people.  I ask because I sometimes wonder how I fit in to it all along with like-minded individuals as myself.

You aint wrong though, I've seen many poor chuds get ripped apart for having a theory or thought that went against the grain. Been reading stuff on r/conspiracy for a decent while as well, place has definitely been through a few paradigm shifts.

       No. There are good and bad people at every point on the political spectrum. However, it's fucking retarded that you can complain about the democrats here all day long, but the second you mention Russia, you're downvoted.

       Subs aimed at the internet, literally every election around the world in the last 2 years being hacked, missiles aimed at telecomms satellites, millions of dollars given to terrorist orgs like the Taliban or the IS, the list goes on.

       Sure, I believe a "handkerchief with pizza-related map" is some sort of code for some illegal, immoral or corrupt activity. What that might be I don't know exactly but we do have a proven history of politicians diddling kids so along with everything else in the pizza gate milieu that the code might be for sex trafficking minors is not that far fetched. On the other hand, since 1945 Russia has been involved in low level skirmishes and more for over 7 decades now. Even if they are trying to start WWIII they obviously aren't very good at it.

       Right, it is a common deflection I hear from people who wish to downplay the sex trafficking of minors part of pizzagate. They say well it was probably just a code for drugs and not a code for kids. I don't claim to know one way or the other but I think it is important to keep in mind all the other parts of pizzagate that show that the code might be about kids shouldn't be thrown out just because it might also be about something else.

       True.  I added a word to my other comment to hopefully more clearly convey what I was saying.  I think a problem in the conspiracy community is when people assign truth to topics that have no known truth.  It is a problem everywhere, but I think people in the conspiracy community need to be more aware of this flaw than other communities just because of who we are.  What should be a motivation to do further research is instead presented as truth far too often.  Does nothing but discredit the person and the community as a whole.  Some of those who do this may not subscribe to conspiracy theories and are just doing this to intentionally discredit us.

       We are in an era where the majority of the world's largest economies belong to corporations rather than nations.  Wealth means power.  So nations and by extension, people, are losing power.

       We are being divided so partisanship is to be expected.  If you wish to change the narrative, you will have to do better than this comment you made here.  His comment didn't bother me, but it did bother you.  That is fine and all, but try harder.

       Both parties are seeing their numbers drop amid this divisive political culture we have right now.  Fewer and fewer people identify with a party.  The middle ground is growing.  Our only hope might be to grow the middle ground to force a shift to a more bipartisan culture in our politics.  They can't keep losing numbers forever and as such, places like this are a battle ground.  Unfortunately, I don't think we are anywhere close to that right now and things will get worse before they get better.  But you have to start somewhere.  The raindrop never feels responsible for the flood.

       The memo of contention currently available in a secure room for house intelligence committee members should be declassified, and made available for the public to view. It will destroy the false Russia/Trump collusion narrative, and implicate FBI and DOJ personnel in a "bigger than Watergate" scandal.

       Could we do a temp ban on political posts?  I quite enjoy a good flat earth or aliens or whatever is so far from the mainstream it makes me think about what could be possible.  There are some great posts on here all the time.  (There used to be more)
      </p>
      <p>
       But what has been happening has been... well... Do these people think they're going to change the political views of people who enjoy being highly skeptical?  What's the endgame for taking over this sub?  I understand there are many who were here and then joined TD before the election.  But it really seems like those folks think if they can control this sub there is something to gain that will help their cause.  I just don't understand.  Especially with this latest stuff about the memo.  Highly transparent.

       SUPERSEDE THE STATUS QUO. MAKE THEIR CONTRADICTIONS OBSOLETE. We need to be about the TRUTH. The forces of this world that we fight are spiritual in nature and political discussion is the most basic ABC's level of what is happening. Politics is the clearest contradiction. Socio-Economics gets a little deeper. Start talking about Pedophilia and The Death Cult, and how we're poisoned in every way imaginable in the context of both our our physical bodies, our minds and our spirit and you're JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE. Tell people we live in a holographic prison for our Consciousness and they walk out of the room and call you names. We need to FREE OUR MINDS!

       You keep saying vast majority of organic users can you tell me how to spot the difference and how you know that the organic users have been lurking? Is it not possible that more organic users just found this sub and started participating? Thats how I ended up here. I don't agree with some of the outlandish stuff but I like to see what other people have to say.

       Right now, this thread has 1008 points, is 85% upvoted, yet has 7.3K views on a sub that has been very hostile to non-partisan perspectives as of late.  This is because of a very modest uptick in organic user participation.  Imagine if we just had 50% or even 25% organic user participation...

       Well, maybe organic users who see your attempt at you basically calling them Russian bots, and toeing the Twitter/dnc "you've got bots" party line are downvoting you?
       <br/>
       Maybe they feel you're the shill, and this post is just a call to lean "more left", and that's it.

       Both "sides" brigade. It's not a case of just one or the other, and it's certainly not a majority (most users are lurkers). But they come in waves when key events occur and when key words and topics are posted about. I think it's likely that upvote/downvote bots and comment bots make up the majority of brigades, but then there's a few who encourage and provoke partisan arguments between genuine users.

       Totally agree. The fun has gone. I remember when it was mostly about open discussion and exploration of all sorts of theories. Nowadays I see more comments from "users" who try to make it "a battleground for information between each side" and that's just such nonsense. It's not a battleground. This is an Internet forum.

       As a long time lurker and never voter or comment on almost anything if I participated I would do just that :D
Proof in both arenas is always based on personal believes as proof is ever misleading,
example left russiacolusion and rights fisacourt shit, both have "proofs" that lead to everything and nothing
russia is still a fucking thing after a year but still ZERO on all of it but "proofs" are like there?!?!?!?!?!
as Im not an american and can look at all that without some biased thought I can say that Donald is your president that most of the country voted for and wanted.
The MSM outright hates him unfairly on all fronts, covering he said "shithole" and not so much important stuff that is so fucking obvious
its sad to watch.
Everything leads to politics in the end, from hollywood to antarctica and the whole reddit is infiltrated by bots and shills.
Baning political talk in a conspiracy sub is HAHAHAHAHAHA!
EVERYTHING is a conspiracy from aliens, pizzagate and CIA/NSA spying on everyone and on a conspiracy subs everything should be talked about, EVERYTHING!
Because in everything there is truth and thats what we all are looking for here.
Learn what shills and bots do and ignore is the best strategy ( in my shit opinion is :D ).

       Its answers like THIS that are the problem. It an infiltration of the right AND left, not just td or the right.  Both sides need to remember this isn't a sporting event where one side wins and one side loses. In the end if the bickering continues the only ones who lose are us and the elites keep on winning.

       My point was/is that simply saying its TD infiltration is wrong.  Its both sides but to many people have blinders on.  This has been going on since the late 60's and every year it gets worse.

       Yes there is TD infiltration into this sub, but you also have to admit/recognize that just as much infiltration comes from the Left.

       Admittedly, I am more of a lurker than I want be on here.  I do upvotes, but never bother with downs.  I have a lot that I would like to say, but there are always hundreds of comments that are just political bickering, and it becomes less and less likely that my contribution will become a part of a worthwhile conversation.

       Right!? When did people suddenly decide that this wasn't happening any more?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally - I am politically LEFT - But I in no fucking way, shape or form think that the US Democrats (for example) represent or stand for my beliefs! I think they're a disgrace!
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'd like to think that people on the Right of the spectrum, will call out there own just the same. I'll say it right now: Obama was a fucking dissapointment and Clinton is downright corrupt. I don't even consider the US democrats to be a Leftist party tbh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not blaming the Right here (although, the support for D T is pretty incredible, it's like - people used to have a problem with billionaires corrupting politicians (something DT has admitted to doing, btw) and yet - they seem to have NO problem with a billionaire cutting out the middleman and just having absolute power? WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lefties are no fucking better. Clinton is a disgrace and yet people on the Left defend her? It just undermines their integrity.

       yeah, i think in a lot of social issues Obama was a pretty decent president. one thing i think a lot of people don't understand is how slow change comes in a government and country as large as the US. it's a lot harder to really make serious changes than people think it is.

       You can knock Obama as youd like and he may even deserve those criticisms but he did try and lay groundwork to insure the health of the poorest Americans. We got stuck with a bad system because of our inability to work across the aisle but hey it's better than "compassionate conservatism"

       Preventing disease us only half of public health. You can't stop every person from getting sick. And you aren't paying for somebody else's healthcare under social medicine. You are paying for your own healthcare when you need it. If Americans weren't born selfish or turned selfish by anti-social, we would easily be able to keep up the health of the nation

       This is the problem, my friends: the CORPORATE media has indoctrinated the masses into thinking Dems are left wing (or centrist, depending on who you ask) and Repubs are "moderate" right wing. &gt;_&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, this is a decades long lie, for 30+ years
both major parties have been
       <strong>
        extremely
       </strong>
       right wing (economically) and
       <strong>
        extremely
       </strong>
       authoritarian (socially).
Not "moderate" AT ALL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although not yet classical fascist (Mussolini style) but too damn close for comfort.
They (establishment/MSM) have (attempted) to shift the spectrum scale further to the right over the decades without us noticing,
so that we perceive extreme policies as "normal/centrist/reasonable" but they're not, they're lying to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before Reagan's trickle down scam economics,
Dems/Repubs probably weren't so insane (except the warmonger shit, that seems to be a loooong tradition....sadly)
Both parties suck.
The real U.S. spectrum (which will never be aired on corrupt MSM) :

       Both parties are just two shades of NEOliberalism (few steps away from NWO globalist corporate-bankster fascism). 
This is not "liberalism" in the way most might think of.
Long story short, lib vs con at least at this point, is corporate marketing propaganda.
"I'm a proud liberal/conservative and the teeeveee says therefore I should vote Democrat/Republican party".
      </p>
      <p>
       The two party system is a scam and it along with the MSM has tried
to deliberately shift our calibration of the spectrum (which more accurately uses two axes, not just one axis).

       In my opinion- this is a Leftist problem. The Right are NOT going to fix this for us - they're just going to use it as ammunition, the same way disingenuous Leftists use lunatics on the right to try and paint them all with the same brush.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Right call the Left SJWs and the Left call the Right Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO - the Left need to weed out and DISAVOW SJWs and the Right need to weed out and DISAVOW Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       neither of these groups come even close to representing the true ideals of EITHER side of politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But both side effectively use them as strawmen to attempt to deligitimise LEGITIMATE concerns the other side has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even as a Leftist - who is pro-immigration, I support letting in the worlds most disadvantaged. But I'm not so fucking naive to pretend there isn't problems within these communities that form when they group together in a new country. The harsh reality is, if you taken in 10,000 people who grow up where life was little worth less than $1,000, where you are LUCKY if you have witnessed a close-family member die before your 18th Birthday, I could go on. But yes - these are fucking traumatised people and they are NOT going to be easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution is NOT to just bar them from entry - ESPECIALLY since the chief reason their countries are so fucked is because of colonisation, exploitation, etc from the wealthy nations - we (wealthy nations) are fucking OBLIGED to help these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But - BUT BUT BUT - the answer is also not the SJW solution of pretending differences don't exist. And that a Sudanese man, who witnessed his son rape his mother in front of him, before they were both brutally tortured to death - is somehow no different from you or I. That is fucking ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       People in the Right have LEGITIMATE concerns and SJWs pretending those concerns don't exist just make us all look like fucking retards when any idiot can point to statistics which prove the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess, what I am getting at is this: Both the Left and the Right pretty much want the same thing, but they advocate different ways of achieving the same end. (not including the extremists like antifa, nazis, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       We need fucking meaningful dialogue. People need to learn how to listen to what other people are saying. And on top of that, we need to stop dismissing someone elses concerns are "baseless' and "wrong' and "weak" and "bigoted" and all the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is NOT fucking Black &amp; White.

       I agree, friend! But I would really recommend people to avoid using the terms "the left" and "the right" because these hive mind terms were used even more than usual by the corporate media during the Antifa VS Neonazi divide and conquer psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spectrum is much more than two arbitrary boxes (of the elites' made up criteria). But they're trying to get everyone to pick a sports team, I mean "side" and bleed into the extremes.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh you lean left? Pick up your molotov and support violent SJW infiltrated Antifaa!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh you lean right? Salute the Fuhrer!". It's ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I don't know if antifa was ever legit but clearly it's been infiltrated with violent SJWs like the BLM movement I guess). Proper anarchists (or whatever antifa
       <strong>
        claim
       </strong>
       to represent) aren't like these SJWs that don't respect free speech and basic decency. 
I don't agree with most Trump supporters but if they're reasonable, sometimes we can come  to an understanding if they're bright and open minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I agree that left wingers need to get SJWs to see reason and see the damage they're doing (providing ammunition to opponents as you said). Social issues seem to be the first barrier to uniting people. I prefer stuff like traditional/natural gender roles (masculine men/feminine women, if it can be helped) and yet I'm not a conservative at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       "World is not black and white" absolutely! I've mentioned this in my presentation, it really is true. Some people oversimplify stuff which leads to misunderstandings and anger between people. Nonsense like "left wing = more gubbermint and right wing = more freedomz". Plenty of evidence shows otherwise, let alone the fact the most popular forms of socialism and leftism are not authoritarian, but libertarian leftism/libertarian socialism. (Not to be confused with the extreme right libertarian "Libertarian Party" which just wants more corporate control and reduction of social programs, i.e. consolidating wealth at the hands of a few.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also dumb over-simplistic arguments like "big gov vs small gov" "tax vs no tax" "extreme political correctness vs anti-political correctness".....insane how stupid these common arguments are. They ignore stuff in between, "boths", and methods (e.g. HOW tax is done, not simply that tax exists....just like gov can be good or bad, the way we're taxed can be good or bad depending on method.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I don't feel good telling foreigners to head back to the warzone/economic hellhole either. Although I do also feel mass immigration is unnecessary and perhaps part of some weird establishment agenda (or at least just a way for the elites to get away with warmonger shit).
      </p>
      <p>
       So my solution is collectively/democratically push for an end to war, corruption and NEOliberalism, globalism, mafias, huge transnational corporations and huge deregulated banks, etc. so that worker wages worldwide are decent, make governments work for the people, not the other way round. Increase non-corrupted social programs to deliver opportunities for everyone to have a good life. Then people would not need to move countries at all. 
Government isn't the problem, it's beurocrat cronies, secret societies and corporate shills that infiltrate the gov through lobbying and other methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone wants freedom and security but some people buy the political lies of stuff
like extreme deregulation = freedom, when it's really just increasing dominant corporate control (unless you keep the good regulations like worker rights, environment protection, etc.)
I think most people would hover somewhere closer to "big brained centrist" and away from the NWO extremes if they
knew that socialism is not one ideology but a broad term for several ideologies with the socialism-capitalism
ratio higher than the right wing counterparts. Some may be scared of removing capitalism but we don't even need
to do that. Some strains of Democratic Socialism still have capitalism, just a nicer version with decent rules and none of the cronyist crap like Obamacare which is a right wing invention, way more inferior to socialized single payer universal healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we started slightly right of Bernie, at straight American centrist, people would see the Dems/Repubs
are bullshit and wonder "let's go a little more left.....to center left!" and then probably stay there since
I believe that's the sweet spot, personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       My presentation was basically trying to unite the people and get them to see that the spectrum is not as it's claimed
by the corporate media. They're pushing extremes on us and painting them as normal. The establishment's so called "left wing" is not
real left wing. The MSM was acting like Bernie was extreme left (and authoritarian LOL) when he really is MUCH less authoritarian than most other candidates, and economically just barely left of center in America, straight centrist in Europe. FDR style social democracy economics. (Which I think are decent, although I prefer center left democratic socialism which takes collectivist responsibility a little more seriously and provide at least a few socialized and nationalized alternatives to corporate rip-offs such as expensive privatized train services.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Centrism could unite the people, but Bernie was the closest to American centrist that I know
and while very popular (I think he's the most popular politician in the U.S.!!) it's being painted
a different way in the media + we still have people falling for Dem vs Repub when both are shit and Bernie
was a rare exception (originally an Independent before running). Can't believe people swallowed the corporate lie
that Bernie's policies were "pie in the sky unrealistic" when they were already done by FDR and probably other presidents too to some extent.

       This is a very underrated statement. The battle has never been more apparent than it is right now. The two parties are so threatened by the power of internet that if the information out there were to fall into the wrong hands, it could really disrupt things for them. As I get older and start to see things as they truly are it’s really quite frightening. People shit on the millennials but god damn, they are our only hope.

       You could do what some subreddits do and ban political posts for a day a week or every other weekend to allow different content to hit the hot section. Seems like the best solution, because organic users will never be able to compete with bot networks; and the quality of the subreddit goes down as the casual user who might join a discussion is scared off by the divisive political comments.

       Just got to be careful with implementation and lay out rules very clearly so no one bitches or moans about a mod conspiracy to silence them lol.

       Nah...political conspiracies do exist.  The problem is joining a side of the false Left/Right Paradigm and approaching conspiracies as a partisan.  That is what smells like poop around here.

       There is ba difference in left wing and right wing thought.  It's not a false paradigm.   That being said, the Republican party has been usurped by Soros and the Neoconservatives.  We essentially have only the left and controlled opposition puppets.

       Yeah, I agree - political conspiracies cover too much ground to be banned. People just need to drop the partisan crap. It's fine if you're Left/Right - Democrat, Republican, or anything else for that matter - but just be willing to accept evidence,
       <em>
        especially facts - when people start ignoring facts it becomes ridiculous
       </em>
       , about all spectrums of politics.

       I'm Left politically - But I don't like Clinton for example - and I'm open to a good conspiracy no matter if it makes Clinton, Obama, etc look like the devil incarnated. likewise, I expect people on the Right - to accept certain FACTS about D.T - let alone theories!

       While what you say is true, it’s also true that certain politicians (like the Clintons) are lightning rods for conspiracy theories for political reasons. It can be tricky to parse out genuinely interesting conspiracy theories from pure political bullshit.

       I wouldn't call them evil, but they are aggressively evil. During the election cycle I met plenty who stated, "I get why people dislike Hillary, but what happened with her email scandal was just an accident. I delete work emails on accident all the time. She apoligized and she's ready to move on."
      </p>

       Hey now this is the opposite of what the post was about it was talking about theories about people representing certain beliefs being corrupt and what you did was directly refer to the people with the beliefs which is unnecessary and a rude statement about a large group of people. And to your statement itself I say no not really there are quite a few but not most.

       What makes you say that? For one, I'm not American. Two - even if I was, I wouldn't either of the major two parties, I don't like either of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally - in my country (Australia) - we have a pretty similar two-party system - the Liberal (Right) and Labour (left). I actualy generally support either the Greens, an independ - or occasionally a diggerent small party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our voting system is a "little bit" (not much) better than yours, in that by voting outside of the major two parties, you are NOT throwing your vote away. You write a prefernce order - for ALL candidates/parties - and as the tally gets done and candidates are knocked out, they just keeping working up (down?) you list of preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, lets say there are 20 candidates, the one you like best and vote for ends up getting knocked out immediately (least amount of votes). However - lets say it gets down to the final 2 (and they're the two major parties) which ever one of those you preferenced higher counts FULL VALUE - even if they were your second to last preference, your vote for them is weighted equally to someone who put them first.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a good system and sees some smaller parties, independents, win enough seats to be able to affect small amounts of change (better than nothing).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway - I find your post quite weird. A hell of a lot of assumptions based on my writing quite a small amount, including assumptions relating to things that I didn't even comment on lol!

       Part of the transparency comes from reactionary stuff: you’ll see a major scandal on one side, then a highly voted post about an opposing and well-tread issue. Trump Russia collusion? Clinton Ukraine collusion! Now, the Clinton stuff is probably a covered up conspiracy, but that’s not why it’s upvoted. It’s upvoted to make The Donald feel better.

       This is true of all 'conspiracy' outlets/forums. Most 'awake' people still take their cues from the telescreen, and the majority still believe the telescreens stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, most 'conspiracy' people are doubtful of the official story of the Vegas shooting, but few doubt the fundamental elements of the story e.g. people died and got hurt.

       Most of his claims are sensational but lack substance and if anyone disagree he calls them normies or conspiritards (people in this sub).
      </p>
      <p>
       His argument style is a mixture of condescension, moving goal posts, asking for impossible proof, ad hominem attacks and latching onto some tiny part of your argument he thinks he can undermine...
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically you are arguing with a shill who is trying to promote his paid website. He tried to post videos directly but got few upvotes so he now does this.

       The real conspiracy is there's only 1 ruling party. In the grand scheme, there is no difference between Republican or Democrat. All the conspiracies revolving around politics in the US are fruit of this scheme.

       If it is on the front page of the NY Times or Wa Post, or it's on CNN or Fox news, it is inevitably dull and stupid. These and similar sources should be ignored totally unless it's an earthquake, a hurricane, or the NFL and NBA finals.

       US political stuff... sure the alphabet stuff is great, but every little, bloody post about politics is what killed it.

       They aren't.  It's a manufactored illusion.  Just because somebody posts about politician A, some fucking shill coming in and crying about politician B doesn't make the OP partisan.  It makes the respondant a fucking shill trying to create the illusion that the sub has gone all partisan.  They want to wreck the sub and they're managing it.  Now they're making moves to ban political discussion on a conspiracy subreddit with half a million users.  Sly doesn't even remotely describe it.

       This my touch a few nerves. But I need to say, I disagree on one thing - I believe highly skeptical folks are the people you CAN persuade and convince of things. On the contrary, I - very sadly, in fact - find the conspiracy community (as a generalisation of course - not everyone!!) - some of the most close-minded people I've ever met. Oh - don't get me wrong, they go against the grain, to be sure. But they're still no more open-minded about their beliefs, if anything, I find them to be the least skeptical because they're willing to believe, unfaltering - on faith practically - the level of religious belief - things with almost no evidence (often the nature of a good conspiracy IS that you can never be sure, yet.. people are certain).

       The republicans could make it public when ever they want.   So could Trump.   I'd like to see what it says before saying it is relative or not.   Something I would hope everyone would want to do.   But as it stands we have people telling us vague things about what's in it and let's just say those people have not earned any credit in the "trust me" game they're trying to play.

       The problem is,  left/right viewpoints are pushed so hard, with corresponding articles making each side correct to their bias, that there’s virtually no way to approach political subjects without biases. There’s very little reporting of just facts. It sucks!

       What!?  You like flat earth!?  That is like shill tactic number one “hey prove the earth is round!” To derail from actual discussion.  Politics is getting to be too much, but all of what is going on in politics
       <em>
        are major fucking IRL conspiracies

       so if this is a conspiracy sub it

       I didn't say I support the theory.  Just that I like to read any argument about any idea that forces me/someone to pause and think.   Could flat Earth be true?  Most likely not.   But if someone takes the time to put together a decent post that makes me think for moment about what could be true that's great content.   That what we need more of on this sub.   Instead of what we got now which is "there's a big scary boogyman in the closet.   I can't show it to you so you are just going to have to take my word.".

       We're seeing something similar at
       <a href="/r/WayOfTheBern">
        /r/WayOfTheBern
       </a>
       . We see obvious vote brigades all the time, and the real tell that they're not organic is how fast a post falls into negative karma, which would normally end up hiding a post, so then we pin it and two hours later - presto - the vote trend is reversed and then some.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another solution we've employed is to set our comment default to "New." When we see brigaded posts, there's almost always this mystery wave of upvotes on one or two early comments that are clearly not from any regular users, and it's obvious their goal is to quickly get something to be securely planted as the "top" comment in the "Best" that most subs use as a default.

       Oftentimes there's only one party who seems to be implicated in a conspiracy. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but "let's not be partisan" is often a subtle way of saying "let's deflect blame from the people who actually did wrong"

       It's hard when they bring in a downvote brigade and suppress organic opinions.  Until the mods step up and start watching users more closely and figure out who's actually an organic user and who is part of a shill campaign, most organic users are just going to stay back in the shadows.

       The issue it will always have is that pretty much every conspiracy leads back to politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed that very early on. I think when I first started using Reddit some 5 years ago I made a post here about it, asking if there was a subreddit that just focused on non-political stuff like aliens.  Back then it was a nicer community (Reddit wasn’t tumblr 2.0 so didn’t have the nasty SJW type comments/folks either) and the thread showed how it was all linked to politics ultimately.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t see it changing any time soon. One large majority think donald trump is the last hope against everything establishment/deep state that conspiracy theorists ave been fighting since the beginning of time (and so, are very passionate about it), another large majority think he is deep-state/establishment and the largest (voting) majority are just here to derail, distract and bring the place down by any means necessary because it’s considered to be a anti-liberal-narrative subreddit with a huge subscriber base that poses a threat to said narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Share blue and CTR are a thing, that isn’t an unproven conspiracy theory.  There is no doubt they operate here. Sometimes they are obvious, sometimes they aren’t.  Some claim there is a right-side alternative operating here too, but the only example I’ve seen of it are usually very obviously fake examples setup by the likes of share blue, similar to how they post racist content somewhere under a fake account then say ‘look these people are racist’.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a post here the other day that made the front page that said ‘trump supporter multiple accounts busted!’ Or something obviously click-baity like that.  It was an obvious lame attempt where a supposed trump supporter had posted an identical comment multiple times with different accounts, then coincidently this warrior of Reddit noticed, screenshotted and posted here and probably lots of other places.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only ways I can think of to help the worsening issues will stifle the growth of the subreddit and it’s activity, so aren’t viable.  I don’t envy the mods.

       That cuts close to home. We had to call it out whenever we'd see it, so it's not as bad as it used to be, but just as you said, we'd see someone post some stupid racist shit at the bottom of a days old thread long gone from the hot page, then it gets upvoted, and then an hour later someone at TopMinds or EnoughSandersSpam just happened to find it and post "Look how racist those Sanders people really are."

       Not kidding man. I have recently gone from non conspiracy theorist. To the moon landings were a hoax. And now I’m seriously doubting that we live on a  globe spinning at a thousand miles an hour.  I’m a federal biologist so I understand science and I don’t think the place we live is as it has been described to us.

       I had the same reaction until I watched the latest eclipse go in the wrong direction. They literally cannot model a solar eclipse. Every model has the earth spinning in the wrong direction, The moon orbiting at twice the earths angular speed, or the sun moving. Same with lunar eclipses. They tell us that the shadow on the moon is caused by the earth but we have seen lunar eclipses occur with the sun in the same sky next to the moon. Just the tip of the iceberg.

       I've got a conspiracy theory for you: The OP and most of the top posts are AstroTurfed.      Calling for end of "partisanship and talking politics" whenever the left is getting bad PR has been in their playbook ever since Hamilton wrote George Washington's farewell address because Jefferson's right leaning party was taking power from Hamilton's leftists.

       speaking of conspiracies and manipulation, it's the fucking information age bruh, you gotta get a hand|e on html and python by age 16 or you really can't even navigate the web safely.

       ] I mean, how are you gonna b0t comment and sh1|| if you don't have 40 instances of s4ndboxle running 40 pr0ckzies and logged into reddit, using reddits API from the bottom of every page, lmao, and scanning for whatever keyword I want and dumping a prepared comment from a pool in a big .CSV of prepared counterpoints. 40 upvotes, 40 downvotes, 40 comments, I even offer to sell my warez, if you got bitcoin or even DOGE nowadays. DM for more information if you're trying to get cyberpunk like John Connor (in Terminator 2 though, I think he h4cked an ATM with a fucking Atari 2600) or if you just want to get on par with the other actors in your playing field, you will have to modernize your skill set. Thats a real true FACT.

       If you want to get cyberpunk like Rick Ro$$ U|bricht, that costs extra, but of course I can show you da wae.

       The problem is reddit is partisan whether you are protecting this sub or not. If this sub let threads be organic then things will be fine, but you have shareblue and media matters aka TMOR spoiling the fun, not this sub.

       I'm just a lurker here, but this is one of the only subs I've followed the last year or two. I agree partisanship has grown lately, and I'm posting just to say not everyone is a bot. That said, I recognize the change in quality of posts.

       This still is one of my favorite subreddits, if not my favorite. I rarely create posts, my comment amount fluctuates, and I lurk a lot but remain silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't take anything serious on Reddit—arguments or insults or what have you. I like everyone here because even though some may be wrong on occasion they still provoke discussion and critical thinking which reach the masses, many who lurk only.
      </p>
      <p>
       I come here because I don't fit in a box—I'm an anarchist who promotes and defends socialism and repeatedly calls out the Trump administration but on the other hand I don't believe in gun control, I believe in the right to own guns. I'm not mad about illegal immigrants being deported. I also don't believe in the Trump-Russia narrative aka witchhunt. I know both major political parties are BS. I believe the system is rigged and that there is a bigger picture at hand. The MSM is propaganda and a lot of it is just tabloid journalism. I believe parts of the US government was involved in 911. I believe in the evils of US imperialism. I also believe in the evils of capitalism and the brainwashed apathy that the masses have been indoctrinated with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I come here because I feel at home. I come here to be informed and for my thinking to be provoked and stimulated.

       An important note - one worth mentioning ad nauseum : It's not "partisan" or "pro Trump" to discuss Clinton crimes nor is it partisan to remind people the murder of Seth Rich has not been solved.
      </p>

       Efforts to resolve partisan conflict are pointless if we are only doing so to censor discussions that conflict with a particular affiliation.

       To call it a psyop is very dismissive. I never said Hilary was directly responsible for anything but I think the DNC as a whole is responsible for his death however I will not go offtopic in this thread. There is a lot more to this story than most people know and obviously much of it is speculative but I really just don't even want to get into it here because this sub sucks for discussion.

       I don't mean to be dismissive at all by calling it a psyop.  On the contrary, I think weaponized psyops against Americans are a serious crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine for a moment, that Hillary/the DNC have murdered multiple good people and they don't want to get caught by real patriots who are on to their corruption.  Now, would it be out of the question to dress up a complicit Israeli in red, white and blue, slap a DNC leadership label on him, plant a story about him being murdered and then fly him back to Tel Aviv?

       While you’re certainly not wrong, I’d like to point out that many of those discussions are predicated on people wanting them to be true. The have a conclusion and build a road to it. That’s the most broken way anyone of a truly skeptical nature should approach anything.

       It's all reddit and most likely all social media.
It's a psyop of epic proportions, really scary shit when you think "am I talking to a human or a bot?" Just before I reply to anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of think this is the new normal, remember that voting has also been tampered.
      </p>
      <p>
       What to do? At this point I'm starting to think that strict membership with BladeRunner's AI exams to spot bots/trolls might become something common, really sad times.

       Bruh. The Ruskies have submarines lined up and ready to take out most of the world's internet connection, plus missiles primed for taking out US telecomms satellites. Plus the Ruskies give money to Syria who gives money to the IS, and they also give money to the NRA who gives money to American politicians.

       Where to start with this amazing statement.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Syria and Bashar al Assad ABSOLUTELY DO NOT FUND IS.. Anyone with a modicum of information about the situation would agree here.  FFS Assad is an alawhite the ISIS fools are Sunni extremists funded by Qatar and the Saudis in an effort to put the brakes on Iranian influence.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       2.The United States has a huge advantage over Russia in everything but midrange missiles.  Vlad is an old KBG guy so I think it is fair to hold his government in contempt, but the Russian bogeyman scenario is bullshit.

       That isn't true and Obama's beloved 'moderate rebels' trying to overthrow the government weren't simply rebels -- they were ISIS, and they are against Assad and the Syrian government. Russia are literally the good guys in Syria, not the US trying to overthrow the democratically elected government leader to build a pipeline.

       This sub seems more like a political sub. When I think of a conspiracy sub I think more aliens, corrupt government, and off the wall ideas like tptb are poisoning us or I made a tin chest plate to protect me from wifi. 
I just hang around for the random jewels that pop up. 
A lot of people here are fighting over sides and the ones who post off the wall crazy conspiracy's get attacked and called crazy. Ok time to resume lurking.

The last part reflects in real life as I doubt they even care about a small sub of people.
Even if we do figure out who is behind the corruption and who runs the show we couldn't get enough people together to do anything. I'm just a dumb hillbilly setting back watching this all unfold.

       Our founders had the answer United we stand, they built this country and said in God we trust, doesn't matter what God you trust. They gave us the right to bear arms so we could protect ourselves and our friends/neighbors. But we can't protect anyone.

       They give us the idea that where in control because we get to vote that's a f***in joke. That's why the second amendment was created because they knew from past mistakes that the system would be corrupted tptb would want to control everything and everyone.

       Everyone's to divided to pull together and make a change for the better, the first thing we need to do is accept each others differences, then put an end to this race, religion, and political segregation and unite. Then and only then will we be able to work together and stop the corruption and bs that plagues the world.

       Honestly this was a good thing for me too see, as I’ve had a Reddit for a very long time, I’ve saved an unreal amount of posts off of this thread, and over the course of time accumulated quite the collection of posts and comments that I felt had to be of importance. I’m new to Reddit per say, as in I don’t normally get very active in the comments but from here on out I will be more vocal and comfortable thanks to reading this.

       I lurk because I know this place has become... maybe not corrupted, but
       <em>
        monitored
       </em>
       . I lurk because I'm aware of the fact that reddit is now strictly controlled. Hell, just this morning I had a thread banned from r/games of all places, which is supposed to be centered around "quality discussion".
      </p>
      <p>
       And now they introduce this pseudo facebook nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was also ridiculed here a couple years ago after posting about noticing weather control patterns over a major city I used to live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       After so many accusations and labels, those of us who really are "organic" users as you put it, just don't want to deal with the fucking mass anymore. I'm fucking over it. I couldn't care less anymore if people refuse to wake up. It really is going to take their food/electricity taken from them before the people of this country get riled up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess you could say I'm a bit jaded. And that's okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been focusing on my own happiness in this increasingly shit-encrusted reality, and I've done more than my part at "participating" and trying to "red-pill"(i hate that phrase) people for several years now to now avail. The reason why you don't see any legitimate conspiracy theorists here is because we're all burnt the fuck out.

       That profile avatar and background image stuff. I'll admit I took part... but I don't like it. Next thing you know we'll have personal ratings tied to our profiles. So that only the most popular posters get recognition and rest falls to the wayside. (worst case scenario, of course)

       The problem is less with the sub than how "conspiracy" acts as a signifier in 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Conspiracy" has a very specific legal definition (U.S.A) and is not even that hard to get convicted of. I think most people here are familiar with the roots of "Conspiracy Theory" as a slander. I think vastly fewer people (a shamefully small number, probably) are familiar with AM radio jibbajabba being nurtured as a growth industry by US intelligence assets only after the emergence of a generation of researchers who very seriously questioned the JFK narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Don't be partisan" is an easy out here. I highly doubt most people posting here have much love for either political party / oedipal edifce of the United States. But the goddam pepe bullshit quotient in this sub is off the fucking chart. Like, "call Phill Agee a postmodern Marxist SJW" levels of pure unadulterated idiocy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting back on track : this sub will always be an unmanageable fuckfest so long as critical examination of current events has to contend with specious trash posted by people who are either on PCP or suffering from some kind of schizophreniform disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically this sub will only ever be good if there's some kind of mod coup. I'll be sipping pina coladas and reading old issues of Lobster until then.

       Lol, no it didn't. This sub is gamed by corporations just like the rest of Reddit. They push stories here and can pay for upvotes like anyone else. The same is true of political agents. It isn't just "good" people not taking a stand, it's people with agendas taking advantage of the ignorance of the average person, just like regular life. This sub falls too easily into the mistake of thinking we are more intelligent than the average Reddit user, I highly doubt that assumption.

       This is a conspiracy sub. If you Google ANY conspiracy you will find mounds of evidence against it. That's kind of the point. This sub is meant to be a place to discuss conspiracy theories that exist outside of the establishment narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you have a Bernie related name, I'll give you a Bernie related example. The rigging of the Democratic primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton. Now, any Bernie supporter worth his salt knows the primary was rigged. It's really past the point of deniability. Go ahead and Google "did the DNC rig the primary?" The very first result is a WaPo article titled "No, the DNC didn’t 'rig' the Democratic primary for Hillary Clinton"
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are looking for stories you can verify with a quick Google search, go to r/worldnews. This is not the sub for that, nor do I want it to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I come here to learn about shit that MSM doesn't want me to know. I highly doubt things of that nature are easily verified on Google.

       My point is that the point of this sub is to explore alternative paths and see if they are plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately the goal is to move things from this sub to the "news" category.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that end in mind... Bringing the topics we don't want in the sub to the top will speed up there exit into the mainstream... That sounds silly when typed all out but this is r/conspiracy...

       What about limiting recent political pieces to, say Sundays only?  Or any other type of "themed" days, like CIA saturdays or technology Tuesdays. I'm not a name-gal, sorry. But essentially trying to direct a theme or topic discussion to get away from partisan bitching

       I wonder if closing the sub for a week would help? If suddenly the shills have no posts to shill on, they will either find somewhere else to make their shill money or the funding dries up and they all just leave.

       In “related communities” I get r/politics and r/worldnews along with some alien stuff and bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is, why are those being recommended or who chose them to be recommended? Is it someone or something? Just wanted to point out that such suggestions  could make it confusing as to the purpose of this sub. It would make sense that if you’re being told this falls under the same “topics,” that’s what people will come here to post or discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk if that’s a reddit thing but you might want to look into that as it has to be contributing to this phenomenon in some way.

       It's just so hard to participate now. I'm one of the more skeptical voices, so I will instantly get labeled a shill for expressing doubt. No one wants to talk facts; opinions are all that matter.

       You and I are of the same mindset.  There are more of us than there are of them and this thread is proof of that.  The partisans have spent every downvote they have and it still made it to the top in probably record time.  All it will take to take this sub back is participation of organic, non partisan users like you and me.

       I've said all the same things you're saying here at one time or another. People applaud and agree, but nothing happens.

      <p>
       I have political views and I talk plenty of shit about Trump and other public figures outside of this sub. I try keep it that kind of thing out my comments here because I realize these public figures aren't the face of the enemy. They're a distraction from the things that are really going on with the shadowy figures using all means at their disposal to consolidate power and maintain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republican Party (and other conservative institutions worldwide) have proven very useful to these forces with their ability to exploit fear and ignorance in people.  This could easily shift to more liberal institutions in the future as the population continues a leftward trend in their personal ideology.  Those shadowy figures will still be there doing the same shit, just using different pawns.

       Im subscribed to the sub and thoroughly enjoy most of the content, yet often times I am at work and too busy to add to the conversation with a thoughtful comment. Also, i dont always have a pertinent thought on the topic at hand as i am just learning about said topic from the post i am viewing.  I will take the time, when i have it, to add to the discourse.

       This sub was 100% overtaken by Trump trolls about a year and a half ago.  Before your account was even created.  You don't get to come in here and talk about "organic posting" when you have never seen the garbage the "organic posting" was.

       It depends on what viewpoints are being expressed as to what constitutes a "hijack" in this subreddit, and I'd be curious to know what you consider organic content.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub was very much "hijacked" by r/The_Donald during the election and for a while afterwards.  They saw r/conspiracy as a group that was rightfully upset with the government towards the end of the Obama administration, and redirected that anger towards vapid distractions like Pizzagate and birtherism.  There were a few people I considered organic users who saw past this propaganda, and knew that a billionaire real estate investor with ties to the Clintons and the Saudi Royal Family and massive debts to banks like Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch was probably not the "outsider" that he appeared to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I think it's hijacked by propaganda bots that rush to be the first few comments on a story to spin the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'd like to see more 9/11 Truth posts.  AE911 has an excellent body of research and I'd love for them to continue cracking the case.  I'd also like to see more surveillance research - after the chilling effects of Snowden, Thomas Drake, and Bill Binney, surveillance whistleblowing has effectively stopped.

       There's no going back. This recent campaign/admin has done a very thorough job of completely Co opting this and these sort of places on the internet. Far better and with less resistance than those who have tried before. The internet is over as far as freedom of thought/narrative is concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a child of the internet and as an early adopter and believer in the potential of its scope it pains me to say but we will never have it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm someone who believed, since the mid 90s, that this internet was going to change everything and facilitate putting the power back in the hands of the people. It did, for a while. But that's over now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn off and get out and reconnect with nature, your neighbors, and community. That is the most radical/counter cultural thing we can do now. Again, the free and open internet is over.

       Yo, I'm sorry but isn't this the mods job?
      </p>
      <p>
       The quality of posts here have been shit for a very long time. I completly understand why some people left when the front page was being spammed with Seth Rich and HRC drama posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Namely these events would occur while Trump was having a "bad news day",but because the mods did nothing about it naturally people left.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't up to us to be "keep the quality up" of the sub by posting just "hoping" the better quality posts make it through the downvote bots. The Mods should be seeking ways to clean up the sub, so we can get back to finding out the shit our government keeps from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many times am I going to argue with another "conspirator" who says this POTUS isn't like the rest of them, while he obviously does some "rest of them" type shit, come on!

       I'm guilty as charged. I'll start upvoting the legit stuff. I find a lot of stuff on this sub to be a little crazy but I love coming here because it is no crazier than what the MSM try and feed us. A strength of this sub is that most posts are backed with sources (even if they are sources the MSM disparage) and as a result I now have an open mind (to the point I believe it is more likely than not) that, as a random for instance, ancient humans reached a far higher level of technological advancement than we are led to believe - and those ruling the world know it. Anyway, keep up the good work because people like me come here often and like this sub the way it is/was.

       Well then don't upvote partisan issues and give them no comments. Non-action is the easiest and most effective method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though to be fair, whenever the conspiracy involves a Government, and they frequently do, then it is inherently partisan. There's some shades of gray and making a judgement call seems to lead to bickering like this.

       I wish there was a political conspiracy sub, though I'm not sure one already exists. I would like this sub to be all the crazy "X-Files" type of conspiracies. Stuff like UFOs, time travel, aliens, secret space programs and so on. Just all the really cool 'what if?' conspiracy theories. This sub now as it stands is a vile, vile, pit of extreme hate and bigotry.

       This sub is very weird there is no doubt disinfo folks and all sorts. I've observed this sub daily. I'd like to contribute more being a long time activist against the new world order and the false left right paradigm but I never feel like it's very organic.

       This sub reminds me of Alex Jones and Infowars.  It used to be a mix of legitimate conspiracies and nonsense conspiracies. Then it became a mix of legitimate conspiracies, nonsense conspiracies, and Trump propaganda.

       old school agreed upon practice was that every time our forum would get invaded by shills, we would change the subject to COINTELPRO to educate the new users who may not understand what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       the next time our forum gets invaded, it is the newly-educated users responsibly to educate the next generation of users on COINTELPRO

       USA shutdown, Russian Afrin withdrawal and Turkish mobilization toward kurds seems like an awfully opportune coincidence.

       I'm sure there's more people here like me or at least there was...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a cynical person. I've worked for the machine and seen how fcked it is, I've become super cynical of everything political, because I know we are in a game, ran by the elite who just use left/right to keep us occupied.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in crazy CTs that I think are too 'over the top' (lizard people, flat earth, hollow earth) but I'm willing to not comment on those posts. I believe there are a few powerful organisations that run the world and that's the theories I'm interested in. Also, the history of the earth, but I think that's less of a CT and more of science just doesn't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm sure there's somewhere I could go to find likeminded people. People who don't necessarily have an interest in the more out there theories, but very interested in other theories, just over Trump and Clinton fans talking smack.

       The people you seek are here.  They are the ones who put this thread at the top.  They think like you think.  They were bullied into not participating by a loud minority.  That will change when the organic non-partisan users start participating again, as evidenced by this thread.

       I came to this sub because I wanted to see people talk about conspiracies. It was during the election, and instead it was literally nothing but post after post about Hilary. A subject I didn't care about. So I left. Now I only comes here when other subs make fun of the place. It was over run by alt-right, the top mods heavily support the far right even now. You let the sub become political, get ready for the garbage and the dislike that comes with the territory.

       I just recently joined the r/conspiracy community so I’m still catching up to speed but I’ve already noticed lots of people here taking sides especially in posts regarding anything political. I was under the impression that conspiracists are all on the same side...the side of the truth. But it seems like a few bad eggs want
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       version of the truth to be accepted over others. This sub shouldn’t be about attacking other commentators it should be about enlightenment and collaborative efforts to find out what’s real and what’s just a facade.

       I want the Coup D'etat in 1963 exposed, with Johnson's complicity. It's obvious John Connolly had nothing to do with it. Ruby died of lung cancer...of the stomach. Sabots were found on the rooftop
       <em>
        next to
       </em>
       the TBD. Description are radically different of the "Oswald" that shot Tippett. Top sniper was, in a test, barely able to get the requisite shots off using the Mannlicher-Carcano.

       I keep my eyes open — I lurk because I’d rather listen than make a decision right off, especially about speculative material.  Being loud and opinionated about conspiracies doesn’t usually go well at the parties.  But every now and then I find something that sounds true here— do my research, then inevitably find more information that solidifies what I learned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorting through the junk is difficult and he subject matter of this subreddit actually needs less opinions because theories are already opinions.  Fact and analysis, links to evidence— that’s what I think this sub would respond to best.

       Exactly this. I've had abuse on another sub for trying to engage about Nigel Farage, got called a Zionist, an Israelite and a f**king moron by 3 different people in 2 minutes because I dared to disagree with someone. I've seen it on this sub too hence the lurking

       I will, as requested, begin to participate more often in these discussions. Just beware that this is am extremely political time in American history where everyone seemingly has an (educated or uneducated) opinion about everything. Unfortunately we might have reached a tipping point on almost all of our subs that being up any type of controversy. But as I stated above, I will do my part and contribute more even though I don't know much about this stuff. I very much enjoy reading reading all of the content and comments on this sub.

       We are going to have to deal with it and get to know who is who without it distressing us too much.   Use NEW and follow your friends under preferences.    Its probably hopeless to try to keep a list of the partisan shills and trolls,  unless we can find out who is doing all the downvoting in NEW.    Not all that transparent is it,   and thats the problem.    Voting should be recorded by name!

       Ok,  so along comes a candidate,   lets say Chelsea Manning,  running on a platform called "Organic r/conspiracy users".    If you support him/her/he/she/it then that makes you partisan,  doesn't it?

       They've succeeded only because too many organic, non-partisan users stopped participating.  When we participate in mass, they can't deal with the numbers.

       It's really frustrating to be asked for proof that Hillary is corrupt. This sub knew that 4 years ago. Also, just because we don't call Trump an alt-right Nazi racist that doesn't mean we're T_D shills which seems to be the nature of discourse here. Also, people perpetuating the Russian hack bullshit are either willfully stupid or paid. I can't see any reason or evidence to believe that shit at this point and I think groups are being paid to propagate this.

       there's an audience interested in the Russian collusion stuff because there is an active investigation about it that Trump seems to be actively trying to discredit and derail. That, and that alone, should be enough for any American citizen to be worried about.

       instead, there SEEM to be a lot of people constantly bringing up the idea that believing there may be some fire behind that smoke are STUPID and GULLIBLE for believing so. it's repeated constantly in comments here...

       Weird how as soon as the narrative starts to turn against Trump, the good people of r/conspiracy who spent months screeching about Pizzagate, emails, Benghazi, emails, the DNC, emails, Vince Foster, emails, and how only exposing the truth could protect America from the Clintons suddenly need a safe space from politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys are just like Alex Jones. You want to think you’re these edgy woke geniuses who see through the looking-glass when all you really are is a mouthpiece for the Republican Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       If r/conspiracy is going to ban political news that cite against the fat, lazy traitor in the Oval, it should man up and put a rule on the sidebar that this sub is primarily for delicate alt-right snowflakes with eggshell skin.

       I look forward to your downvotes and your explanation of how this is Hillary’s fault.

       You can just look at what the meta posts like this were saying 24 hours ago. It was all "be prepared for people to downvote these memo posts". The memo dominated the front page, but there was
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7rid61/be_prepared_today_rconspiracy/">
        a meta post
       </a>
       warning that there was gonna be a brigade to shut down the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then people actually figured out the memo was just some Republican propaganda and we started seeing posts shit talking Trump for signing the FISA bill and Republicans in general for not leaking this all-important memo. Now, we have a meta post complaining about political posts in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel pretty confident this post either wouldn't exist or would be nearly as upvoted if the memo narrative pushed by King and Nunes hadn't fallen apart.

       I participate where I find it necessary. There's just a lot of closed minded bigotry that goes on and it's the wrong attitude for a conspiracy sub.

       I'm into conspiracies because I keep an open mind so when I see useless arguing I tend to avoid it like the plague.

       Part of the problem is that I think there are legitimate conspiracies that have been skewed by media and social media as partisan issues. For example, Seth Rich, the Vegas shooting, pedophilia among the elites- there are valid questions to be asking for all of these, but people quickly take sides before investigating.

       I'm subbed but I generally don't post. When I do post on greater reddit it's usually benign shit posting. I can't count how many times I've backed out of posting after scribbling out my thoughts. There are A LOT of folks that get spun up because another person's thoughts doesn't line up with theirs, and there are A LOT of subreddits that exist in name only, that contain A LOT of those folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me it's easy, I generally don't post because I don't argue with people on the internet.

       I’ve lurked on this sub for years. Same with r/politics. Both have opened my eyes to so much more that goes on in this world. But I avoid commenting on either subs for the same reason...anytime I suggest a different viewpoint (here it would be refuting a conspiracy, in the other it would be suggesting something even remotely conservative), I get downvoted to hell. For some reason people think the downvote button means disagree, and they do that instead of responding with healthy discourse. I welcome disagreement but don’t ruin the Reddit karma.

       I agree. This sub has become a shithole thanks to all the unregulated immigration from other subs. They terker front page. Sad!

       They shouldn't be allowed to vote as non-subscribers. They have to go back. I will deport them back to politics and the_donald. I will build a stronger moderation team that will maintain the rule of law that allows conspirators to thrive in their own subreddit. We will make conspiracy strong again. We will make conspiracy safe again. And yes, we will MAKE CONSPIRACY GREAT AGAIN!

       As a Libertarian, good Lord, I can’t generally post any-fucking-thing without getting downvoted to oblivion because I AM non-partisan. I skew left on social issues and hard right on foreign and financial policy. The point is, I’m always too left for some and too right for the others so voices advocating pragmatism and common sense really have no place on a platform where the most active members are shilling along party lines. I don’t mind contributing, I still do it, but when your comments become invisible moments after posting it’s like - why bother?

       I hear you and that is largely why I submitted this plea.  Just look at the thread, though.  Rather than being buried, it shot straight to the top.  The users here are overwhelmingly like you, it's just that the active minority has bullied and discouraged real organic non partisan users like us into silence.  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.

       I'm only commenting in the spirit of the post. I refuse to identify with any political party, libertarian or otherwise. I don't understand why people want to put themselves in boxes and limit ideas with labels. Besides that, personal political beliefs should change with the world, time, new experiences, new ideas, etc. It shouldn't be static.

       Exactly. The most static thing about Libertarianism is just an adherence to the notion of personal sovereignty. Libertarianism is a set of principles. It’s a philosophy far more than a “party.” Identifying as a Libertarian is just kinda broadcasting that I believe in policy and issues that
       <em>

       comform to a party stand.

       Almost 600,000 free thinkers here, and that's why it has become a place for political posts. 600,000 is a lot of eyes. It comes down to making a set of community rules that keeps posts to actual conspiracies, and then enforcing them.

       I think it's too subjective to have gatekeepers deciding what's a real conspiracy and what's not.  Partisanship, however, can be objectively identified, and purging the sub of that would go a heck of a long way towards fixing what is wrong.

       A lot are just news reports of single case incidents. Easy to eliminate those. Like the Jamaica posts today. How is that a conspiracy?

       The overwhelming majority of users who lurk here are non-partisans who have been bullied into silence by a loud obnoxious minority of partisans.  If the non partisan userbase becomes active again, the results of which can be seen by looking at this post and it's comments at the top of the front page, then the sub can be salvaged even without the mod's help or cooperation.

       We gotta get with the mods if we want this to happen. I love the idea of a less partisan
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but without a clear policy that is rigorously enforced, it won’t happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       MODS! Can we have a discussion about making the sub less partisan? And if the traffic is just too high on the partisan stuff to justify that shift (remember all sub identity questions are ultimately questions of advertising $$$ for Reddit), we can just look into making a paired sub for non-partisan content.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t want to censor folks who view conspiracies through a partisan lens. And hell, there are LOADS of partisan conspiracies, but I think it might be healthy for the sustainability of this community to have a group of subs with specific posting rules.

       It might be helpful if you clarify what you believe to be "partisan issues" on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rooting for transparency and showing support for an administration that seems to be moving towards holding corrupt politicians accountable for corrupt acts is not a "partisan" issue if that's what you are referencing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the monochromatic nature of these issues can be addressed as being spun into partisan issues. The fact that Republican congressmen are using the potential exposure of the previous D admin's corruption to look smart and one up each other with how offended they are, yes that is smoke and bullshit. But very few people here, who have been here for a number of years, doubt for a millisecond that widespread corruption of the federal government is and has been a major issue, nor do they doubt that corruption was perpetuated if not outright normalized by administration after administration over the past number of decades.

       Hi.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm coming out of lurkerdom, partially to explain my lurkerdom.  I only read on this sub usually b/c formulating conspiracies is just not my thing.  However, there has been (used to be?) good discussions of things the gov't is misdirecting about/covering up.  Things that are not really conspiracies IMO just things the "mainstream" doesn't want discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the only sub that gets bot manipulation and other crap.  I'm from WayoftheBern and damn do we get brigaded.  It's gotten to the point a bunch of users have been purposely posting phrases to trigger the bots and shills...I'm not entirely sure why, an act of defiance, a method to document the political shithole reddit has become, or a method to capture the interest of people who then become subscribers.  Our subscribers have def gone up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, this organic being will try to participate here more, but I'm not sure what I can say that is of interest.

       I remember when ATS got compromised, now its front page is 99% left vs right bullshit, every single day. I really hope that doesn't happen here. To my knowledge there is really nowhere else to go left on the entire internet. Still, pretty regularly there are spam posts and/or brigading(esp when something makes it to /all) but for the most part it settles back down to us regular users. I have my suspicions as to the level which this sub is monitored however...and when something is truly earth-shattering on here it will get censored for sure...but that is inescapable this day and age, sadly.

       It would be cool to have timelines for each conspiracy and add pieces on news/information we find relevant without losing any piece on the way. 
Plus it would give better insight to new users and give them a chance to understand certain posts better.

       Speaking of the political nature this sub has taken in the recent times, anyone who still posts in a Dem vs Repub stance is either ignorantly uninformed or a shill.  People who bash Trump do so do so regardless of anything good he does do and those who like Trump and support him only do so as long as he stays the course of at least trying to drain an almost undrainable swamp. My point is simply people like Trump not because he's a Repub but becasue he at least appears to be trying to help the common man.  This is in contrast to those who support the Clinton/Obama narrative regardless of what evidence is supplied that they were a crime syndicate that even involved our CIA, FBI and DoJ.  Support or oppose the action, not the person or party.  It has always been the Haves vs you and me.

       the usa and the world huh. this isnt a movie and i gurantee none of you actually do anything in the real world about shit going on. do you have meetings with people in your town about shit going on? naw you just play on the internet and get your dopamine release whenever someone says something that excites a emotion.

       I don't post here very often because of the Shareblue astro turfing. You can't say anything remotely right leaning with them labelling you as a racist trumper or some BS. Not to mention they're always making dumb comments like "this place is t_d 2.0" and those dumb comments are always upvoted to the top of every post while everyone else is downvoted into the negatives. Furthermore two junior mods worked with site admins to oust the longest sitting sub mod who was trying to work against the shareblue astroturfing. This sub has been fully taken over.

       I get what everyone is saying, but many are avoiding the obvious. Politics and conspiracy go hand in hand. They always have. I'll say more on this later, but for now just know that the two cannot be separated.

       And yes, what OP initially said is right on. Participation is necessary. Otherwise the board becomes vulnerable to attacks from "bad actors" who, it should be said, have significant funding behind them to degrade freethinking discourse.

       Try to think about this for a moment before you answer...really think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a difference between discussing political conspiracies/conspiracy theories and discussing political conspiracies/conspiracy theories from the perspective of a partisan from the false left/right paradigm?

       Wow, that's a mouthful. ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm actually thinking about writing a much longer blog post/essay about that very thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, they seem to be tied together so closely that it's nearly impossible to avoid the dialectical trap. Partly because all we have is language to communicate and debate these ideas, and language is a trap. It confines us in being able to articulate our thoughts... which often transcends all of that stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say, that if you look at the majority of conspiracies from the past century or so, there's always been a political component to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, depending on which team the debater happens to be on, usually views it from that their own political perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a tough nut to crack, but I'm working on it.

       Paid or otherwise, there is a concerted effort to hijack this sub and turn it into a battleground of a partisan nature.  There are political conspiracies that should be addressed, but historically, this sub did not look at the world from a Left or Right, Republican or Democrat perspective, but from a perspective that acknowledged the Left/Right Paradigm is false.  That's Conspiracy Theory 101: Divide and Conquer.

       That profile avatar and background image stuff. I'll admit I took part... but I don't like it. Next thing you know we'll have personal ratings tied to our profiles. So that only the most popular posters get recognition and rest falls to the wayside. (worst case scenario, of course)
