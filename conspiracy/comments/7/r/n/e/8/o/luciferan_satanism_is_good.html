        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Disclaimer: I am not of any religious affiliation. I simply enjoy theology and appreciate the teachings and literary value of many religions. This is just my take after spending some time to learn a bit about Lucifer.</p>

<p>Premise A: The Church has had a very powerful influence over the course of history</p>

<p>Premise B: The Church has used its power to manipulate society and form core values.</p>

<p>Premise C: The stories and values conveyed in the Bible are used to enact Premise B</p>

<p>With these premises is mind, I want to examine the story and character of Lucifer. Lucifer, also called the Morning Star and the Bringer of Light, was an angel who was cast out of Heaven by God. Why? <strong>Disobedience</strong>. Lucifer enacted his own <strong>free will</strong> to go against God&#39;s command. He chose <strong>not to bow</strong> to Humanity during Genesis, and <strong>refused to be subject</strong> to Christ the Son. In the canon of the Church, Lucifer (or Satan) is known and accepted as a <strong>rebel</strong>. As punishment for his dissent, Lucifer and his army were cast into Hell for all eternity. In a further act of rebellion against God, he assumes the form of a serpent to tempt Eve into eating the fruit of <strong>knowledge</strong>, thus enacting original sin and dooming humanity in the eyes of God, until Christ comes to redeem the souls of man.</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with my premises? Well, I think it shows a lot about what values the Church wants to inspire in people, and what they want to make taboo. The ultimate enemy of God is Satan. Satan, above all else, represents rebellion. <strong>To rebel is to oppose the establishment</strong>. To rebel is to take a stand against objectionable systematic institutions. Satan is an icon of choice, freedom, and independence. He is the one who does not submit. Who refuses to be ruled. Who stands beside his choice even through eternal agony. What could be worse for an institution with monstrous social influence than dissent? What could be worse for an emperor than rebellion? Since the fall of Rome, the Church has demonized those who speak out, who choose to stand against the establishment, and those who do not fall in line. The enemy of the Church is no devil, it is free will and knowledge. Further, Lucifer&#39;s enacting of Original Sin cements the requirement of the Church to provide salvation. If you accept the teachings of the Church, you are then required to follow their rules to be saved. If you are a ruler, this little loop lets you exalt the Church to create compliant citizens, lest they end up like Lucifer.</p>

<p>In this contemporary era, the Church is obviously not at its peak of influence (although the vast majority of oaths in the US, including that of the President, are sworn over a Bible). In fact, opposing the Church in 2018 is pretty much normal. So perhaps Satanism isn&#39;t really a great reaction to the modern social landscape. However, Lucifer as a character strikes a kinship in me as a conspiracy theorist as well as an avid seeker of knowledge. We are all rebels of thought. We refuse to submit our minds to the established narrative. We come to this page of the internet in search of knowledge, so we may eat the fruit and willingly leave the nice, soft Garden behind. For me, Lucifer r epresents enlightenment and a welcoming into the true reality. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Lucifer_Liege_Luc_Viatour.jpg">He also had great hair.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that Satan deceived eve by lying to her about God’s words of caution, that she <em>would,</em> indeed, <em>die.</em> He tricked her into acting against her own interest bec he hated God’s special creation —man.  In this this way, he condemned man to live without God. He blatantly LIED about the consequences of eating the forbidden fruit, not to impart knowledge, but to steal, kill and destroy.  So, stop crediting Lucifer with grandiose and good intentions. All he wanted was to kill mankind out of overwhelming hatred. </p>

<p>God is not ‘the establishment.’  He is pure and true goodness and love. If you believe what Satan is selling, you have also been deceived. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is Satan&#39;s side of the story.</p>

<p>God&#39;s side of the story is that he created Satan and all of the angels. Then they rebelled against him for no fucking reason. Then they tricked all the humans into going along with it, causing them to experience death and suffering. </p>

<p>Then they went down and started fucking the humans and creating blood-drinking, cannibalistic giants and genetic hybrids that so terrorized the inhabitants of the earth that God had to wipe them all off the face of the earth with a flood and save the few humans that weren&#39;t genetically corrupted by fucking demons on a giant boat with the few animals that weren&#39;t corrupted by fucking said demons.</p>

<p>Then God sent his son to try to make it all right, and Satan murdered him for no fucking reason, finally proving that Satan is actually the asshole, not God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you mix up actors like the Church and Lucifer with your real point - the value of free will.  These are totally separate things.  The various value narratives around the aforementioned actors is all over place, and one can&#39;t come to any useful conclusions because the premise is always sketchy.  So I&#39;d toss out the ideas of the Church, Christ, Lucifer, and all that shit, and ignore them.  And I&#39;d focus on the question of free will.  </p>

<p>Free will is both bad and good.  It&#39;s in having free will that one can discern better designs and worse designs.  That&#39;s probably the point of it.  The application of free will in opposition to things whose truth cannot be doubted (eg. 1+1=2) is where maybe the concept itself starts to have problems.  A needless rebel, rebelling against known and undeniable truths creates problems.  The facility of rebellion is fine, as long as it&#39;s applied well.  That&#39;s the problem.  Where Lucifer sits on this spectrum, I have no idea.  All I&#39;ve heard are people reiterating what others have said.  Who the hell knows what the real story is.  But if the character of Lucifer stands for the quality of rebellion absent contextual considerations, then sure, the archetype is in the wrong.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luciferan, satanism whatever you want to call it represents duality and severance. Having one thing devided into two promotes conflict and war. </p>

<p>Godliness, or holiness (wholiness), are representations of into and completeness. When one realizes the continuity of all and how the dark is just as much the light as the light is dark (as in they are inseparable and depend on each other for existance) then you can have balance. It is the whole ideology of meeting your enemy with love because they are you. </p>

<p>It is to realize in war you are ultimately fighting your other hand and to completely irradicate and destroy the opposition would mean to destroy your self in the process. </p>

<p>Lucifarien cults are rot with anarchy and destruction of unity and balance. However they should not be eliminated as like anything that contradicts the good, it gives us perspective in why we are trying to fight for the balance of everything to be slightly pulling towards the good and why we should build a strong defense to keep the balance intact. </p>
