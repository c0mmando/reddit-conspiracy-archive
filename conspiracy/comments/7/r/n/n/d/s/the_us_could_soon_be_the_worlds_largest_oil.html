    <div class="md"><p>Not for many years. The technology isn’t there yet. The Tesla semi-trucks range would require constant charging for long haul trucking. Tesla is also much more expensive and untested. I have no doubt the future will see these trucks but not right away.

    <div class="md"><p>You are underestimating russia. They have no debt to the west, they have a military good enough to take on US, whilst having miniscule spending. Its small economy is growing and is strong enough to survive in the face of sanctions. Russia and china are indeed a threat to US, but not in the way the media portrays it, no economically. If the silk road works, that right there will be the end of the US gravy train, and that is why terrorists exist, why military spending is up by 800billion over the next decade and such strong russia phobia. </p>

<p>Russia is a boogie man to excuse the huge MIC, but in reality the elite and rich of US are afraid of russia and rightfully so. That country is ex soviet union and that motherfucker was/is/remained a superpower. (sure their economy on paper isnt as huge as US, but they are moving forward and making strides and the lives of the people have been getting better. Where as US is moving backwards). So no there isnt ONE superpower, china is huge and owns most of US debt, there are as always multiple powers, and the reason why nobody refers to these nations in terms of superpowers anymore. </p>
