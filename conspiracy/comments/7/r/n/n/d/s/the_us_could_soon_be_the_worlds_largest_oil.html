       The Russians have historically made inroads into left-wing interests used to sow discord. Republican (and Trumps) agendas are diametrically opposed to that of Russia. A strong US military, aggressive/strong foreign policy, tax cuts aimed at benefiting American business, and more American energy production helps them how exactly?

       People don’t talk like this in polite company. Americans try to avoid politics and controversial talk like this in public. Most Americans in my experience as fairly non-confrontational and want to be left alone by these sorts of people.

       That's literally the exact opposite of what I said but okay. I'm saying if your proof that Trump does not have Russia's support is that the US might threaten its exports then surely that must apply to Saudi Arabia backing the dems too?

       Renewable energy doesn’t power the cars and trucks though. Americans need oil and gas. Renewable energy can’t threaten these nations for many years. How many Americans right now even own hybrid or electric cars? It will be a long way off before our semi trucks that literally drive our economy are all-electric, powered by an all-renewable, affordable electric grid.

       First of all, you're in for a rude awakening if you think commercial trucking won't be almost entirely electric very soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all, are you saying that a democratic president would outlaw the production of US oil? The dems are not anti US oil, they are pro clean energy, which would largely be produced in the US.

       Not for many years. The technology isn’t there yet. The Tesla semi-trucks range would require constant charging for long haul trucking. Tesla is also much more expensive and untested. I have no doubt the future will see these trucks but not right away. The average American driver isn’t shelling out the extra money for electrics or hybrid cars yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I don’t think Democrats are friendly to oil. Clean energy is being produced already alongside.

       TBH Saudi Arabia has committed to diversifying its economy over the past couple of years. They see the writing on the wall and can't solely rely on oil moving forward. Further, they need America to counter Iranian influence, otherwise they would lose badly without US support.

       Doesn’t this then lend credence to the conspiracy that Trump is leveraging the Saudis and that is why we saw the drastic shakeup last year? That there are white and black hats, rather white and black headdresses, in Saudi Arabia at war with each other?

       Because Putin both has a personal vendetta against Clinton, one that goes both ways and dates to her time as SoS, and because Clinton would not be willing to weaken economic sanctions against Russia; something Putin desperately needs. Trump, however, might have been willing to do so.

       Oil is kind of ancillary to the whole issue. Amercia may not need Russian oil at some point, we don’t even really need it now, but the rest of the world still needs it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The economic sanctions are for more than oil, and since America is still the global hegemony, for now, much of the rest of the world is following America’s lead on those sanctions.

       It's win-win for both countries, economically. This whole "Russia and US are competing enemies", is complete and utter bullshit propaganda. Russia doesn't want to take over the world, but, US and company sure as shit do, and have, for the most part. It's utter madness. We were originally supposed to more like Switzerland.

       Competition is the most effective way to get innovation and progression. Otherwise there is a complacency. And why i believe that the world is in flux because the focus was on US dominating the global stage for the last 30 years, and now we have rising powers again ready to compete on a level playing field, US faces a problem that is has grown to bloated and complacent with being the 'leader', and giving that status to someone else, well, the elite just wont give it up without a fight.

       Russia is a boogieman.  It has 15% the size of our economy.  There is only one superpower in the world and its the US, but rather admit that and decrease MIC spending they keep making up terrorist groups, boogieman, and Krazy dictators.  There is one bully left in the schoolyard and its us.

       You are underestimating russia. They have no debt to the west, they have a military good enough to take on US, whilst having miniscule spending. Its small economy is growing and is strong enough to survive in the face of sanctions. Russia and china are indeed a threat to US, but not in the way the media portrays it, no economically. If the silk road works, that right there will be the end of the US gravy train, and that is why terrorists exist, why military spending is up by 800billion over the next decade and such strong russia phobia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is a boogie man to excuse the huge MIC, but in reality the elite and rich of US are afraid of russia and rightfully so. That country is ex soviet union and that motherfucker was/is/remained a superpower. (sure their economy on paper isnt as huge as US, but they are moving forward and making strides and the lives of the people have been getting better. Where as US is moving backwards). So no there isnt ONE superpower, china is huge and owns most of US debt, there are as always multiple powers, and the reason why nobody refers to these nations in terms of superpowers anymore.

         Russian economy is going to boom when silk road with china happens. It doesnt take an expert to realise this, all those ex soviet nations, the entire asia, middle east through to eurpe will be connect via a dedicated trade route, essentially building up economies and countries that are "developing".  That right there, is a threat to US, and the reason for the russia phobia (amongst many others)
