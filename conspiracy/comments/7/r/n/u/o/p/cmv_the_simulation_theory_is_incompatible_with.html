<p>It&#39;s absurd.  But specifically between the big bang and the simulation theories.  Neither falsifiable Bor can they be proved.  This stupid background radiation evidence is just people doing their best to make the data fit their preexisting theory.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Simulation theory doesn’t make sense. Who’s simulating the simulators and why? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>not knowing the answers to those questions doesn&#39;t mean the concept of a simulated reality doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are they technically our god? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>depends on how you interpret the definition of God and how the simulation works.  For example, the people in the Matrix are living in simulation but the machines are not their gods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we are being simulated must we not be simulated based of some real universe, somewhere? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simulation could be a natural simulation and not intelligently manufactured.  Its easy to assume a simulated universe was built by a higher intelligence but its not necessary either.</p>

<p>Many believe that physical reality is a manifestation of the universe&#39;s collective consciousness - the universe experiencing itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is that universe about and what explains that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unknown, but again not knowing doesn&#39;t mean the concept doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does an intimately large simulator for a universe run? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on the type of simulation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think this is a case of being a hammer and seeing all problems as a nail. Today, tech and IT are trendy. Everything looks like a tech problem now. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simulation hypothesis can be naturally occurring as I mentioned earlier, but I do agree that the idea of it being built is trendy at the moment (and probably why its going main stream) but there is a lot of evidence that supports the concept.  The plank length for one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LARP?</p>

<p>People wondering about things and fielding ideas probably wouldn&#39;t be called a psyop if we understand psyop to mean a concerted effort by a group of people to lead some portion of the population to a preprogrammed position.</p>

<p>I&#39;m okay with calling something a psyop if it generally seems to cause people to adopt a position of fear or arrogance.</p>

<p>In this instance I think people just like to get high and let their minds wander on different ideas.</p>

<p>Could be the reptilians though, sure.</p>

<p>According to the Chinese philosophical classic Zhuangzi, the great Daoist thinker of that name fell asleep one day and dreamed that he was a butterfly. When he woke up, he did not know whether he really was a man who had dreamed he was a butterfly or whether he was a butterfly now dreaming he was a man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you should explain why the Simulation and Big Bang theories are &quot;incompatible&quot;. </p>

<p>You can certainly argue that the Big Bang is not necessary in a simulation theory, but that doesn&#39;t mean the two are incompatible.</p>

<p>If we are in a simulation, the creators are surely able to create and bake-in in a coherent backstory for the origins of our universe. Whether Big Bang theory fits that description, I&#39;m not sure, but never mind.</p>

<p>Would a steady-state universe be more compatible with a simulated universe, do you think?</p>
