        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed MSM,INDEPENDENT MEDIA,normal people and political people turning the name of this event into &quot;October first shooting&quot; so vegas doesn&#39;t lose revenue and look like an unsafe tourist site. I don&#39;t think the LVMPD,FBI or MGM  has been honest enough to earn the right for that. Show some footage..cctv&#39;s are everywhere. The truth is that it was THE LAS VEGAS MASSACRE. THE FACT THEY ARE CHANGING THE NAME OVER MONEY IS APPALLING. Just know if your loved one dies in vegas casinos will NOT  release tapes or help because of possible lawsuits. We haven&#39;t even seen a video showing if the guy was right or left handed playing poker..he shot himself with his right hand yet,The letter on the table the pen is set to the LEFT,tape set to upper LEFT and the pic of him with his eyes closed about to drink a shot with his girlfriend he&#39;s using his LEFT hand. He shot himself with his RIGHT though so Maybe it&#39;s just me but I think las vegas massacre should be the term used so everyone remembers how it went down,the stonewalling,lies and lack of transparency from MGM,FBI and LVMPD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS: MSM and others are trying to change the name from the Las Vegas massacre  to &quot;Oct first shooting&quot; the proof doesn&#39;t need linked check any MSM outlet. The fact it&#39;s about tourist and money they don&#39;t want the name LAS VEGAS involved so tourists feel safe is appalling. It&#39;s all about money. How safe is your family in vegas if they can&#39;t even show a camera of someome playing poker? If your love one died I&#39;m very sorry but the way the public was treated imo they deserve this to be called the Las Vegas massacre. Not October first shooting. Ever see the movie casino? Doesn&#39;t seem much changed except the fbi is now part of the mob.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple things what&#39;s wrong with calling it 1 October as a Vegas native I have to constantly talk about it and being able to refer to this specific scenario under a specific name is actually beneficial calling it something as vague as Las Vegas Massacre stupid. Second thing is I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily bad to Shield Las Vegas tourist interest considering the entire city depends on it if people stopped coming to Vegas, Vegas would shut down millions of people would have to leave our economy depends on tourist too much. I think your giving to much power to a name imo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was hard to read... It should be called LVM precisely because it&#39;s a tourist mecca. That was a huge part of the massacre. It&#39;s not like The Omaha Flu or something random. This event was Vegas in its DNA--a native son, professional gambler, famous casino, crowded event, weapons, the larger than life scale and body count, the cameras, the secrecy,etc. Whitewashing it is wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree maybe LVM is better but it&#39;s the same thing just shortened. Las Vegas is trying to get thier name out of the what the event officially became to be named. Why not keep it what the public came up with? There&#39;s always a motive in MSM and changes like that. They don&#39;t want the name LAS Vegas massacre messing with the yearly revenue they make from tourists. After seeing how botched,fake,lied too,non transparent and the list of other things would you trust vegas police or fbi if it was one of your family members dead? Lombardo said 10x no evidence of another shooter or accomplice..now that&#39;s changed along with the forever changing story of campos and shuck and the timeline..money is apparently more important than the lives lost to higher ups at MGM..note too employees at MB never recall campos being security or even seeing him. How did he have s master key to clear rooms? That means he had access to paddocks room too..hard drive gone? Extra set of gloves? Wasn&#39;t campos reported dead the first 24hrs? That&#39;s what I remember. Then he was shot in the leg,then he was hit with &quot;shrapnel&quot; in the leg..fled to mexico for some reason?? Mary lou is now saying her prints are on bullets bc she helped paddock load them on and off. The story still doesn&#39;t add up..campso says he went down a floor and came back up to floor 32..shuck says the opposite? No body cams on the 2 LVMP that was with the breach team? They seemed to have them outside..Paddock recorded himself apparently as he did the attack? There are many things they can do to show they are trying to be transparent without giving out to much. We don&#39;t know that was Mary coming off a Phillipines airline..all we see is a well disguised female in a wheelchair and a Phillipines airline plane. 100k wired to her on what date? She probably has more than 1 bank and could be receiving more money..campos,Mary and shuck plus the ppl who leaked the pics. All suspect imo. I also think the releasing of all these pics is to distract from looking for shooters in the venue..why else did they wipe the phones that faced very important places in the venue??🤔 without premission too? There&#39;s gotta be a right violated there I would think? Not many people know there&#39;s tunnels under that whole area of vegas tgat the shooting occurred and word is higher up pay homeless to do dirty work. Not many homeless are willing to talk about what happened in the tunnels that night..there is a lot unanswered still. X2 more women killed than men and majority or womem shot twice..less men killed and majority shot once. From 32 floors up with wind and a bump stock this guy managed this accuracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear your side although I may feel differently. We are just now getting info of more suspects I mean is it safe? The little info we do have the name makes no difference to me..I&#39;m cool on vegas rn. I don&#39;t think it should be considered 1st October for revenue sake when the fbi and police don know if it&#39;s even safe right now. Lombardo look like he was fearing his life the first press conference he did,but that&#39;s probably just his fbi handler intimidating him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just feel obligated to make it clear that false flags don&#39;t equate hoaxes or mean that it never happened. 9/11 was a false flag; thousands died and it gave cover for the deep state/shadow government to ramp up perpetual war and, ultimately, hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost and countless millions destroyed, over it.</p>

<p>Operation Gladio was a false flag and hundreds of people died.</p>

<p>Hell, the sinking of the USS main was probably a false flag, too.</p>

<p>Idk; maybe this is already understood and didn&#39;t need saying, but I think we gotta be careful about how we phrase this stuff, because people reading/listening might walk away with a flawed understanding of the terms/events, which is ultimately detrimental to the &quot;movement&quot;, itself (that movement being one advocating transparency and some semblance of &quot;justice&quot; following exposure of these grand manipulations/massacres/abuses of power).</p>

<p>Just tryin&#39; to contribute healthily to this sub rather than lurk like I have been, for years :p</p>

<p>Frankly, this seems like a silly train of thought. We don’t call it the “New York City suicide flight”; it’s 9/11. If anything, ascribing a date to the shooting elevates it past a location and allows for acknowledgement that people all across the country lost someone that day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s more the idea that the name is suddenly changing speaks to a kind of inauthentic marketing decision than whatever it actually changes to. 9/11 never “spontaneously” rebranded. That is the problem. </p>

<p>This rebranding of the Las Vegas shooting to “One October” just feels a little gross and inauthentic. There was probably a meeting at some level where they had to tell all the grunts in the media that we are calling it “One October” now. There was probably also a meeting even before that at the executive level to make the decision to change it because they conducted a focus group and some midwesterners felt that the original name reminded them that their safety is an illusion. So then they made the decision to have a second meeting and get some creatives to brainstorm a few different names, which they did some more focus tests on, ultimately leading to “One October”. </p>
