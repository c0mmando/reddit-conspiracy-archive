        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I had a crazy thought, and felt the need to share for opinion. I’ve never posted here, so please go easy on me. What if the content of the Bible was given to Humankind as a political promise, rather than a full proof prophecy? You would have to assume in this case that the odds between God and Satan were much more balanced than we have presumed. Maybe the Bible describes the world that God controls, after he wins the battle with Satan. Obviously if Satan was victorious with this battle, then the world would never change, people would be living in complete sin, and chaos could reign supreme as far as our free will could handle. So if this battle already ensued, then humanity would never have known, then the Bible would be rendered void. This would compared to finding an old campaign agenda from a politician who lost the race for presidency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But this assumes that Satan is the bad guy. What if he is not? </p>

<p>Let me explain some of what I understand of the bible. From the stance of an outsider looking in. Doesn&#39;t Jesus tell you to love thy enemy, Is Satan not the enemy of mankind. The only way to bring about heaven on earth is to accept Satan. But people pretend he doesn&#39;t exist. Well we all have a bit of god in us and a bit of satan in us. Yet we pretend the other half doesn&#39;t exist. Since we pretend it doesn&#39;t exist we don&#39;t address it. Or we punish it. But this hasn&#39;t changed Satan. </p>

<p>With love and acceptance do we bring about heaven on earth. That means you must accept that the man that murdered, can be redeemed. That means that you have to accept that those that do evil deeds can in fact change and embrace the light.</p>

<p>That evil is to live. they are one in the same. But that doesn&#39;t mean it wins. It only wins when we pretend we can control it. That we can hide it. That it doesn&#39;t exist. Lucifer the light bringer. His crime to give humanity knowledge. His penance was to be cast down, looked upon as a vile creature. Misunderstood by those he wished to give knowledge. </p>

<p>But Satan isn&#39;t Lucifer. Satan is one who defies. And we all have defied god according to the bible. We are all Satan. We live in his world and it is controlled by Satan this is true because Satan is in me and you. Satan is all who have defied god.</p>

<p>AT least this is what I understand with brief encounters with the book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not accept, repent.</p>

<p>God hates evil, and he literally said in the Bible satan came to kill steal and destroy and that Satan goes over the earth looking whom he can devour. Also look at all the people who have been caught killing people in the same of the devil, their king. </p>

<p>Once you accept Christ Satan has no rule over you, unless you chose sin and don&#39;t repent. That is literally the point of the new testiment. </p>

<p>Jesus said to love you enemy because he understood separation. That man is tempted by Satan and evil spirits into sin, and that he loves sinners because he can separate the sin and man. He was dry clear about how damaging any contact with satans kingdom in.</p>

<p>You literally just described the opposite of what God stands for, over and over he said reject Satan and renounce every and to not even let your eyes see evil and to keep your heart pure. </p>

<p>Satan is not light, he is called the great deciever, pretending to be light and full of darkness. He is literally at fault for every evil thing on earth, every hurt and pain comes from evil which is what he is.</p>

<p>It amazes me that people actually try to justify or destort that.</p>

<p>You guys need to reread you Bible, and study known satanisnt who literally say that evil some over them and gave them a thirst for those things so they can please the master.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I explained my perspective on it, emphasized that it was the perspective of an outsider looking in. </p>

<p>Seem really odd then that you see evil, if god asked you not too. Keeping your heart pure whatever could this mean. Would that mean to forgive others. Would that mean that systems we have in place that punish sin are against god. Since we are to see no evil. If we are to see no evil what does that mean. Does that mean to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist or to quill evil by not acknowledging it. That with time, those that do evil deeds will come to repent all on their own?</p>

<p>Okay again let me emphasis that, I am not a  Christian, I am woefully ignorant on much of what the bible has to say. New and Old, though I have read a great deal of the Old testament, and parsed through some of the new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can any option you want.</p>

<p>My point is the Bible says that evil that is not repented of should and will be punished and in no way to have anything to do with the devil. It literally says it again and again.</p>

<p>So it say that it says to accept the devil and evil is contrary. That&#39;s my point.</p>

<p>And no, the Bible shows again and again that some people never repent (look at serial killers).</p>

<p>The Bible didn&#39;t say ignore evil it said expose and fight it through Christ. So, what your saying is false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can my point of view be false. I guess you just want to be right and that is fine. But this is still the view I hold. IT is my belief. How can a belief be false, when it isn&#39;t based on anything factual. I represented my understandings. </p>

<p>That is like me telling you that your religion is nothing, it is a tool for control. The book is false. It was written by supposed prophets. But really it is a just false. </p>

<p>but I don&#39;t take that position when speaking about belief. Or faith. I can&#39;t tell you what is true. That is why it is faith. You are placing your trust that it is truth. You believe. </p>

<p>This is what is wrong with discussing religion. People want to be right. Now if I had said this is what the bible is saying then I could under stand your accusation as to what I&#39;m saying is false. But I have never made this claim. </p>

<p>It seems you lack some sort of reading comprehension. So why should I take your words as truth. If you can&#39;t read that I am merely expressing my opinion. And An opinion by name can not be true or false.</p>

<p>I make no claims to know the truth. I only make the claim that this is my understanding, my opinion. It should not take away from your opinion. It should either strengthen your own faith in your religion or make you question it. </p>

<p>Is your faith lacking so that you have to exclaim that it is truth. To render other opinion null because anything questioning your faith puts it at risk. </p>

<p>It is a weak position you put yourself in. </p>

Some theologians believe the even minor dualistic traits found in the Abrahamic tradition originate from expose during the Babylonian captivity.  In the book of Job &quot;he-satan&quot; is not the devil but the accuser. Imagine an overzealous prosecuting attorney. If there&#39;s a God, any written revelation will be filtered through contemporary humanity&#39;s understanding.  Beware mormons and muslims or anyone who claims the unadulterated truth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God says many times everything he says will come to pass. That&#39;s is the basis of the Bible and faith.</p>

<p>That end battle hasn&#39;t happened because most of the things in revelations have not happened. God says after he wins the battle it will basically be like heaven, and we defiantly are not living in that time. And he tells us that Satan is ruling over the earth now, thus the bad things that occur.</p>

<p>Literally almost none of the things that are said to come have come, so we now the has been no final battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But this assumes that Satan is the bad guy. What if he is not? </p>

<p>Let me explain some of what I understand of the bible. From the stance of an outsider looking in. Doesn&#39;t Jesus tell you to love thy enemy, Is Satan not the enemy of mankind. The only way to bring about heaven on earth is to accept Satan. But people pretend he doesn&#39;t exist. Well we all have a bit of god in us and a bit of satan in us. Yet we pretend the other half doesn&#39;t exist. Since we pretend it doesn&#39;t exist we don&#39;t address it. Or we punish it. But this hasn&#39;t changed Satan. </p>

<p>With love and acceptance do we bring about heaven on earth. That means you must accept that the man that murdered, can be redeemed. That means that you have to accept that those that do evil deeds can in fact change and embrace the light.</p>

<p>That evil is to live. they are one in the same. But that doesn&#39;t mean it wins. It only wins when we pretend we can control it. That we can hide it. That it doesn&#39;t exist. Lucifer the light bringer. His crime to give humanity knowledge. His penance was to be cast down, looked upon as a vile creature. Misunderstood by those he wished to give knowledge. </p>

<p>But Satan isn&#39;t Lucifer. Satan is one who defies. And we all have defied god according to the bible. We are all Satan. We live in his world and it is controlled by Satan this is true because Satan is in me and you. Satan is all who have defied god.</p>

<p>AT least this is what I understand with brief encounters with the book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not accept, repent.</p>

<p>God hates evil, and he literally said in the Bible satan came to kill steal and destroy and that Satan goes over the earth looking whom he can devour. Also look at all the people who have been caught killing people in the same of the devil, their king. </p>

<p>Once you accept Christ Satan has no rule over you, unless you chose sin and don&#39;t repent. That is literally the point of the new testiment. </p>

<p>Jesus said to love you enemy because he understood separation. That man is tempted by Satan and evil spirits into sin, and that he loves sinners because he can separate the sin and man. He was dry clear about how damaging any contact with satans kingdom in.</p>

<p>You literally just described the opposite of what God stands for, over and over he said reject Satan and renounce every and to not even let your eyes see evil and to keep your heart pure. </p>

<p>Satan is not light, he is called the great deciever, pretending to be light and full of darkness. He is literally at fault for every evil thing on earth, every hurt and pain comes from evil which is what he is.</p>

<p>It amazes me that people actually try to justify or destort that.</p>

<p>You guys need to reread you Bible, and study known satanisnt who literally say that evil some over them and gave them a thirst for those things so they can please the master.</p>
