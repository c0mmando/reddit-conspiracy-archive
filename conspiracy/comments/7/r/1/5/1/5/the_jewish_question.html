       I want to draw your attention to the JQ. Don't you dare mention the "Joos" word or you will be punished by the IDF thought police...
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish question is not a recent phenomenon, it existed throughout centuries and not because people are stupid anti-Semites but because there is a consistent behavior of Jewish people which aims to subvert all that elevates humans, all that is sacred and makes us human in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       My awakening to the Jewish question was gradual. I could not care less about the Jews; I was not even able to recognize them. I always treated others as I wanted to be treated regardless of race and economic status. But the word Jew always had a negative connotation, on a subconscious level. 
One friend of mine pointed out that the other guy was a Jew. I remember answering - so what? I know his personality. Then I decided to delve into this question . Some books about the Jews were perceived as a joke. I did not see any reasons for hate. Let them worship their religion and dress to their liking. As time went on, I changed my mind. We are led to believe that Jews are akin to innocent kids or handicapped people who need our support and were persecuted for no apparent reason. But if we take a closer look we will realize that it was the Jews who persecuted others on the basis of the supremacist religion, it was the Jews who slaughtered millions of people for resisting their tyranny.
During the peak of the Ottoman Empire, it conquered Greece, Serbia, and other nations. Turks killed Christians, took women captives. It tells us that instead of the Jews, there could be any group. But since Jews use covert means and are tribalists - they succeeded.
Jews want everyone to believe that race does not exist, culture is a myth, god, not Christian, not Muslim variant of God but the concept of absolute itself is a myth, gender does not exist, nationalism leads to the holocaust, and family is obsolete. On the other hand, they remain loyal to the traditions and religion throughout centuries. When people voice sympathy for nationalism, love towards their blood and ancestors, Jews are viewed as a distinct group, helping one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       People say you hate Jews. No, I hate deceit. The very fact that you are hated for simply discussing this topic, that you can be shut down and silenced speaks for itself. You can find all kinds of degeneracy online: suicide instructions, pornography, violence but as soon as you mention Jews you are the most evil person on earth.
Google it yourself. Ashkenazi Jews came from 150 women. That’s it. 150 sick individuals (there is some kind of disease in them women and it is inherited) that’s why Jews are predisposed to genetic diseases that are only found in Jews. No one else has them. 
The important moment to keep in mind that Jews who hold high positions of power - they are not some caricature movie antagonists. That is not the case. In fact, those people are well-educated, well-dressed, they have families and home addresses, they drive nice cars, they love their wives, but there is something missing. The ability to empathize with others.
The thing is, if you become docile and loving of Jews, they don’t automatically stop hating you. So beware. You can’t simply say:  hey guys, we are Europeans and we are OK with the state of Israel, we don’t want to kill or harm Jewish people. You can practice whatever you want in your own country. We are all humans, let’s live in peace.  But we have one little desire. We want to run our own countries without your help. Please leave us alone, don’t spread your LGBT, gay agenda among us. Don’t bring more migrants. On top of that, it was all funny if it hadn’t direct consequences on our lives.
 We can’t do that. Jews won’t even consider this option. It is evident throughout history. 
People are always asking me. Do you know good Jews? I know but they are an insignificant minority. 
Can we fix the Jewish problem? Nope. At least not in a way that people tried to fix it many times in the past. What we can fix is our own problems and the rest will follow. I will hope.

       That's what they want...
       <em>
        Anything
       </em>
       that's distracts you from what is really happening and who is actually pulling the strings.. 
The situation with "Jerusalem" is most certainly reminiscent of 1930s Germany..

       Please be sure not to mention anything like that going forward, because you will be branded an anti semite and a child fucker...

       Not really. The Palestinians are nothing more than a horde of Orcs, but with crude rockets. Israel would be better off deporting them to their homeland of Jordan or Syria where they belong.

       I know you are being facetious. But in actuality several of those "suicide bombers" were tied to a Israeli delivery company that hired Palestinians. I know you won't believe me, unfortunately truth is unpalatable.

       The Jewish Question? Do you also ask yourself the white European male question? It's like the best you can do is spit up false facts from the various nazi sites you visit. What is even worse is how you try and say you only judge people on the content of their character and don't see religion and didn't care because his personality was good, but then go on to say you know a few good jews, but a majority are bad. How would you know who is Jewish or not in the people you encounter if you are not actively trying figure out others' religions. The Ottoman empire was Jewish? What? Practice your religion in your own country? The country one is born is their country. But, but, Israel offers citizenship to Jews around the world. That's their country. It's their perogative to do so. No one is required to move. Vatican City could offer the option to Catholics or th4 US could offer it to Mormons if either so choosed. Are their jews, especially devoutly religious ones, who want to keep to themselves? Yep, but their are also many devout Christian groups who do the same. Why is one more offensive than the other? Do some Jewish groups have genetic predisposition to some disease? Yes, one I believe is the one that causes sids in babies. Newsflash, though, other groups also have genetic predispositions, too. Nordic people have the predisposition to type 1 diabetes. Are they just as geneticly inferior? Ashkenazi jews came from only 150 women? No idea where you pulled that from, but if that sick, how do you feel that all people have, I believe, one of 3 mitochondrial dna ancestors. All people descended from one of three women. Ewww gross right? You say you hate decit, but you clearly love the confirmation bias the decit peddled to you regarding falsehoods about Jewish people provides you. You end by stating what we can do is fix our own problems and this is one of those few correct statements you make. Fix your belief that all people arenthe same simply based on religion, national origin, political affiliatipn, etc., and your "Jewish Question" will be solved.

       That the ijdf is monitoring low karma posts on Reddit? That they give a shit about any of this.

       Capitalism works out fine on paper but it always descends into kleptocracy as it puts profit as the number one goal and that is antithetical to the nature of the human being which is a social animal.  Unable to reconcile the contradictions of capitalism humanity is hopelessly lost under this artificial and evil structure.

       Corporations are above the law, police murder in the streets with impunity, minority rule, Democratic structures deliberately undermine by ruling party and executive.  Seems like capitalism has failed again, just like every time it's been tried.

       But is it fascist? No, it isn't. Your initial statement that capitalism turns to fascism is just wrong, and that's what I debunked. At least the majority of people in capitalist countries don't end up starving.

       All the countries that have starving people are Capitalist countries and North Korea who are at war.  Venesuela is Capitalist and only starving due to US embargos and other tricks.  Nobody's starving in Cuba.

       ... North Korea isn't at war with jack shit, moron. They technically haven't signed a peace treaty with South Korea, but they're not actually fighting anyone. Venezuela is socialist, you moron. And Cuba is a shit country for other reasons besides starving. Otherwise, people wouldn't want to leave so bad. Just because the United States has two bad places in it, one because of low intelligence and the other because of a FUCKING NATURAL DISASTER, doesn't make it a bad place to live, especially when compared to countries like North Korea.

       Great write-up OP. The fact that your thread has 0 points speaks volumes about the level of truth you're speaking. You're not even allowed to speak this, so they downvote you.

       It's the introduction to

        Culture of Critique

       . You can also

        read the intro online

       ... North Korea isn't at war with jack shit, moron. They technically haven't signed a peace treaty with South Korea, but they're not actually fighting anyone. Venezuela is socialist, you moron. And Cuba is a shit country for other reasons besides starving. Otherwise, people wouldn't want to leave so bad. Just because the United States has two bad places in it, one because of low intelligence and the other because of a FUCKING NATURAL DISASTER, doesn't make it a bad place to live, especially when compared to countries like North Korea.
