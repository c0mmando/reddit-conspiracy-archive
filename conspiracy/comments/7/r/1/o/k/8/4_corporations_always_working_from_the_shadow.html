        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A small experiment : </p>

<p>Think of Company. A major MNC which has business all across the globe. It should be a public company i.e listed on stock exchange. </p>

<p>I challenge you, your company has investment from following 4 corporations.   </p>

<p>a. Vanguard<br/>
b. FMR (Fidelity)<br/>
c. Blackrock<br/>
d. State Street Corp.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say your company is <strong>Apple</strong>. How do you check now?  Type in Google : <strong>&quot;Apple Institutional ownership&quot;</strong> - It will give you nasdaq link. Click on that and you will see who are top shareholders in Apple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/googl/institutional-holdings">This is Apple&#39;s Institutional Ownership page on Nasdaq.</a> </p>

<p>For example, <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutional-portfolio/vanguard-group-inc-61322">If you go to Vanguard&#39;s page, it mostly has major shareholding on most major corporations around the world including some major banks.</a>  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutional-portfolio/fmr-llc-12407">Same with FMR LLC, this is their portfolio.</a>   </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutional-portfolio/state-street-corp-6697">Again, same with State Street Corp.</a>  </p>

<p>Now, let us expand our base a little :   </p>

<p>The world’s largest companies are now: Bank of America, JP Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.Let us now review who their shareholders are.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>JP Morgan Chase</strong> with 2.39 trillion dollars of assets. Largest shareholders are State Street Corp., Vanguard Group, FMR, BlackRock, T. Rowe, AXA, Capital World Investor, Capital Research Global Investor, Northern Trust Corp. and Bank of Mellon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bank of America</strong> with assets 2.17 trillion. Its large institutional investor is Vanguard Group, Inc.  FMR, State Street Corp.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Citigroup</strong> with assets 1,88 trillion. The biggest investor —Vanguard Group, FMR, BlackRock.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wells Fargo</strong> Assets: 1.44 trillion : Yes, again Vanguard Group, FMR, BlackRock.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> : FMR, Vanguard again.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> : BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street Corp.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>: State Street Corp, BlackRock, Vanguard.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>To go even further, we can now try to find out the shareholders of these companies and shareholders of major banks worldwide.  </p>

<p><strong>Bank of NY Mellon:</strong></p>

<p>Davis Selected, Massachusetts Financial Services, Capital Research Global Investor, Dodge, Cox, Southeatern Asset Mgmt. and … “The big four.”</p>

<p><strong>State Street Corporation (one of the “big four”):</strong></p>

<p>Massachusetts Financial Services, Capital Research Global Investor, Barrow Hanley, GE, Putnam Investment and … The “big four” (shareholders themselves!).</p>

<p><strong>BlackRock (another of the “big four”):</strong></p>

<p>PNC, Barclays e CIC.</p>

<p>Who is behind the PNC? FMR (Fidelity), BlackRock, State Street, etc.</p>

<p>And behind Barclays? BlackRock.  </p>

<p>In short: the eight largest U.S. financial companies (JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, U.S. Bancorp, Bank of New York Mellon and Morgan Stanley) are 100% controlled by 10 shareholders and we have 4 companies always present in all decisions: BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard and Fidelity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These, and other companies&#39; stocks are owned by the mutual funds that are managed by the big 4 asset managers.  Vanguard is at the top because right now passive funds, aka index funds, is seeing all flows since fees investors pay are really low.  There are few other asset managers that are down the list.  Virtually all of the shareholders in the funds are 401ks, IRAs and Roths.  There isn&#39;t a conspiracy here.  The companies themselves don&#39;t own any of the shares.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have expanded their corporate governance teams significantly in response to growing pressure from policymakers and clients to demonstrate they are policing the companies they invest in.&quot;   </p>

<p>&quot;Theresa May, the British prime minister, launched a far-reaching consultation on reforming corporate governance in the UK last November in a bid to improve business behaviour. The government wants to strengthen shareholders’ power, but is also considering whether to force large investors to disclose their voting records at companies’ annual general meetings.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, shareholder proxies take place every year and the underlying shareholder gets a vote.  If your 401k is with Vanguard, you will get an correspondences from ComputerShare that manages majority of the asset managers&#39; proxies.  </p>

<p>As for institutional votes for underlying company proxies, vanguard owns about 6.7% of Apple as of 9/30 according to Mornigstar,  so that&#39;s how many votes they get.  A manager like vanguard will never own 51% of a large cap like Apple because their own investment policies won&#39;t allow it.  And no fund is allowed to own more 5% of a company&#39;s shares.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, when you think, there is no free market mechanisms here. Neither you can find original and unbiased competition between two large companies involved in same sector.   </p>

<p>For example : Google has Android and Apple&#39;s ioS. The consumers around the world live in an imagination that there is fierce battle between android vs ioS or between Windows vs Mac whereas in reality, all the major decisions are taken at the top levels by almost same people and the same board members. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are giant investment companies, so they have stock holdings in all these companies, not necessarily operational control.  </p>

<p>Another thing to remember is that the money they use to own the other companies is money from their customers.  My money is included in that, and most retirement plans include shares in these companies due to funds which own other funds.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t conflate stock ownership with control.  Shareholders have a varying degree of functional control.  I admit it&#39;s fucked up that these companies are this big and states are often barred from opening their own banks which could compete with these companies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know finance pretty well. Let&#39;s break it up. </p>

<p>Yes, this is a private investment giant and it has our money in it. We are all well aware of that. But these giant companies mostly invest in public comanies and this is exactly how they control/influence major corporations.</p>

<p>Stock ownership has everything to do with control. 51% stock ownership makes you a majority partner, 49% makes you a minority partner. 35% will make you majority partner as well if other shareholders are bifurcated as 5%, 7%, 15% or anything less than 35%. </p>

<p>This is the fun with public companies. Their stock is basically public money and shareholders are owners. But basically the most heavy weighted shareholders are generally the most influential in management. </p>

<p>Representative from these companies are present in most top-level board meetings of the companies. I can give you more pointers in the micro level but that would require a lot of more painstaking work. If you are interested enough you can find out even about the Executives and who is sitting in which meetings. Having said that,of course, they won&#39;t be anywhere in operational level of these companies directly. But they are present nevertheless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, good research and well thought out. My question is how much (or if)individual investments contribute and make it appear as if vanguard or fidelity hold higher stakes in these companies than they actually do. For example, if I have a vanguard account and invest in apple, does that affect how many shares vanguard owns in apple? If so, I imagine a majority of these holdings are actually from individual investors vs corporate owned. Does anyone have insight into this?</p>

<p>shareholders have as much control as the board of directors. the same board who legally, the company is obligated to maximize returns for. i think it’s disingenuous to not mention that the top shareholders are those on the board of directors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is patently false.  The board makes decisions to maximize shareholders returns and are beholden to the shareholders.  Apple has stock ownership guidelines that limit how much board of directors can own and this is same for many, if not all, companies.  In other words, shareholders have more control.  When an activist hedge fund manager acquires enough shares, they can impact the governance structure.  </p>
