    <div class="md"><p>The stars are spiritual entities. When Satan&#39;s angels are cast down the constellations will not remain. Nibiru is a psyop to make us believe when this happens that it&#39;s a massive meteor shower event and to present the fallen angels as aliens.</p>

<p>3 And there was seen another sign in the heaven, and, lo, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems,</p>

<p>4 and his tail doth draw the third of the stars of the heaven, and he did cast them to the earth; and the dragon did stand before the woman who is about to bring forth, that when she may bring forth, her child he may devour;</p>

<p>5 and she brought forth a male child, who is about to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, and caught away was her child unto God and His throne,</p>

<p>6 and the woman did flee to the wilderness, where she hath a place made ready from God, that there they may nourish her -- days a thousand, two hundred, sixty.</p>

<p>7 And there came war in the heaven; Michael and his messengers did war against the dragon, and the dragon did war, and his messengers,</p>

<p>8 and they did not prevail, nor was their place found any more in the heaven;</p>

<p>9 and the great dragon was cast forth -- the old serpent, who is called <code>Devil,&#39; and</code>the Adversary,&#39; who is leading astray the whole world -- he was cast forth to the earth, and his messengers were cast forth with him.</p>

<p>10 And I heard a great voice saying in the heaven, `Now did come the salvation, and the power, and the reign, of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because cast down was the accuser of our brethren, who is accusing them before our God day and night;</p>

<p>11 and they did overcome him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life -- unto death;</p>

<p>12 because of this be glad, ye heavens, and those in them who do tabernacle; wo to those inhabiting the land and the sea, because the Devil did go down unto you, having great wrath, having known that he hath little time.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You broke down Revelation 12 wrong.</p>

<p>The Devil = Rothschild he already controls the world. His forefather is Esau/Edom in the Bible. These families are what created the so called Jew<em>ISH.</em></p>

<p>The Woman = True Israel, these people were hidden within history on purpose by God. Scattered across the four corners of the earth. These people (Rothschild knows who they are) will be persecuted (Jacobs trouble). The 12 stars are the 12 bloodlines of True Israel when compared to the so called Jew<em>ISH</em> we ask where are the other 11 tribes? They have no answer.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to reiterate that Satan is the current ruler of this world because God made it so, not because he wanted to rebel against God but because God wanted to punish his own <strong>Chosen People</strong>.</p>

<p>This chapter is talking about the incoming invasion by God to now punish Satan (it&#39;s a nation of people). The elites know this which is why they hide the fact that UFO&#39;s exists and in the Roman catholic church they have that big ass telescope to watch the stars. </p>

<p>Revelation 12 goes hand in hand with Genesis 3.</p>

<p>You see the Bible is does not contradict itself.</p>

<p><strong>Genesis 3:12-15 KJV</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</p>

<p>13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</p>

<p>14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</p>

<p>15 <strong>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we jump to when the twins were born (literally the only two people in the Bible that matter) for it was their difference that God made the current reality we live in come to pass (think Naruto).</p>

<p><strong>Genesis 25:21-26</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>21 And Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</p>

<p>22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the Lord.</p>

<p>23 And the Lord said unto her, <strong>Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The above was God cursing the seed of the serpent (Esau), Cain&#39;s reincarnated spirit.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</p>

<p>25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; <strong>and they called his name Esau.</strong></p>

<p>26 <strong>And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau&#39;s heel; and his name was called Jacob:</strong> and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, Esau backstabbed Jacob long ago, this is how we came to power. This is told in <strong>Psalms 83</strong> all nations in the world took council against YHWH&#39;s people. But God knew this would happen so he made sure to write it down so that the reality we live in could be remembered.</p>

<p>Old Testament</p>

<p><strong>Malachi 1:4 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, <strong>The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>New Testament</p>

<p><strong>Romans 9:13 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, <strong>but Esau have I hated.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hebrews 12:17</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, <strong>he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, by the way, Michael is the archangel of God when it says he wars with the devil, it is literally talking about Edom coming together to use their military to fight the so called UFO&#39;s (Chariots of God). </p>

<p>Again, Satan is already here:</p>

<p><strong>Job 9:24King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The entire Bible is about True Israel returning to power and the fall of the Satan here on earth.</p>

<p><strong>2 Esdras 6:9</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>For Esau is the end of the world</strong>, and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.” </p>
</blockquote>
