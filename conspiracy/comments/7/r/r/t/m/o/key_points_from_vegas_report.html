        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Key Points</p>

<p>-Paddock booked three rooms at The Ogden (a condominium complex in downtown Las Vegas) for September 17th through September 28th. He booked two rooms at the Mandalay Bay for September 25th through October 2nd. He made several trips between these three locations before the shooting on October 1st.</p>

<p>-On September 25th and 26th, Mandalay Bay hotel staff helped Paddock bring 12 suitcases into his two hotel rooms on the 32nd floor via the service elevator. Also on the 26th, “Paddock completed a wire transfer in Mesquite, Nevada of $50,000 from his Wells Fargo account to an account in the Philippines.”</p>

<p>-On September 28th, “Paddock made a $14,000 deposit at Wells Fargo and transferred $50,000 to a bank in the Philippines.”</p>

<p>-23 assault rifles were recovered in the two Mandalay Bay hotel rooms where the shooting took place. At least 7 did not have any sights mounted. Spent casings from the 1,050 .223 and 8 .308 caliber rounds that were fired from these rooms were also found, along with 5,280 unfired rounds of ammunition.</p>

<p>-Four laptop computers and three cellphones were recovered in the two rooms where Paddock was staying. Child pornography was found on one of the laptops. Paddock’s brother was arrested for possession of child pornography on October 26th.</p>

<p>-Campos (the hotel security officer who responded to the shooting and first notified LVPD) reported being shot with a &quot;pellet or bb gun&quot;. During questioning, he told investigators that, “He used the guest elevator [on the 31st floor] to go to the 32nd floor. Video surveillance showed Security Officer Campos actually went to the 33rd floor, then took a guest elevator down to the 32nd floor.”</p>

<p>-“Security Officer Campos did in fact have a pre-planned vacation to Mexico to go visit his father and Security Officer Campos asked law enforcement for permission to make this trip.”</p>

<p>-Campos and Shuck (the hotel engineer) both told their superiors that the shooter was on the 32nd floor within minutes of the first rounds being fired. Shortly afterward, “Two armed Mandalay Bay security officers exited the guest elevator on the 32nd floor and went to the Center Core.” Police officers went to the 31st floor and the rooftop of the hotel before moving to the 32nd floor. Additionally, “...multiple reports of active shooters along Las Vegas Boulevard at various hotel properties were broadcasted. Several officers from the exterior Las Vegas Village posts joined Strike Teams and left to address those reports.”</p>

<p>-The bodies of “Seven additional victims were located and recovered from the exterior perimeter. Their body positions and locations suggested they had been placed at these locations.”</p>

<p>So the 1,100 shots is really 1,058, which I&#39;d assume includes the 200 fired down the hallway.  So he fired 850 shots on the crowd, without a site, from 475 yards, and hit around 400 people.... With a bumpstock at a high rate of fire.  Amazing, dude got close to 50% accuracy as an out of shape 64 year old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please read the report (seeing as we are discussing it in the thread).  They correct the 200 number (which was from early news reports) and say that 35 shots were fired down the hall.  They explain where the 200 number came from and they explicity say that the actual number of rounds fired down the hall was approximately 35.  If you count the holes in the door, there are approximately 35 of them.  So, perhaps we can start using that number? </p>

<p>Sorry I&#39;ve haven&#39;t had the time to read the report, and sorry for basing my information off of the prior information we&#39;ve heard directly from the Police &amp; FBI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(which was from early news reports) </p>

<p>That was from the police &amp; FBI and something I took issue with initially.  The fact they are changing the number from 200+ bullets to 35 should make everyone say, WTF?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They explain where the 200 number came from and they explicity say that the actual number of rounds fired down the hall was approximately 35. </p>

<p>Since you&#39;re up to speed on the new report, can you show me the explination.  Find it hard to believe they didn&#39;t know the amount of bullet holes in that hallway on day 2.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, perhaps we can start using that number?</p>

<p>Sure, would have loved to use that number months ago, but apparently this is one of the worst investigations ever ran.  Even their ability to figure out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79koz5/jesus_camposs_timeline_and_the_recent/">Campos&#39;s timeline</a> was a complete shit show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again, how many months has it been, and we&#39;re finally hearing it was 35 oppose to 200?  Seems like the officials were trying to paint a fucked up Rambo situation, and the fact they were doing that makes me question it harder.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Located throughout the 100-wing hallway from the double doors of room 32-135 to the alcove
wall of room 32-105 were over 200 bullet strikes. The bullet strikes consisted of actual impacts
and holes. These strikes were caused by approximately 35 rounds fired down the 100-wing from
inside of room 32-135.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a &quot;strike&quot; is every time a bullet hits.  Bullet goes into the door (1 strike).  Bullet comes out of door (1 strike) bullet hit light fixture (1 strike) bullet goes through light fixture and hits wall (1 strike).</p>

<p>If it sounds like bullshit, that is because it is.  They are just &quot;explaining&quot; how the number went from 200 to 35.  But I don&#39;t think it really means too much.  They were trying to push the Jesus was a savior (Campos), and tried to explain why they didn&#39;t push into the room earlier.  They vastly over estimated the number but have corrected it now.  It happens and there were numerous false reports and conflicting information coming in over the radio, so they got a key fact wrong.  They have since fixed it.  Don&#39;t think there is too much more to it than that. </p>

<p>What about EOTechOptics, Red-Dot Scopes, and Scopes says &#39;no sights&quot; to you? He had PLENTY SIGHTS! They&#39;re only gonna end up on the rifle he LAST used them on and they are easily removed/attached to different rifles, and FAST with enough practice. He also had tracer round inserted into the 100 round magazines, presumably 1 round every 10 shots or so, which leaves a streak in the sky visibly so that the shooter can tell where his shots are going with or without a sight. </p>

<p>Also watch the video: How many people, jammed into a small area, just STOOD THERE frozen in fear/confusion instead of running away/thinning out/making a moving target? He went to shooting ranges all the time. He was a hobbyist pro and clearly smarter than a lot of people. We need to give this monster more credit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So considering people with multiples, that&#39;s a pretty high hit rate.  Of course fish in a barrel and all that, but maybe only for the first couple magazines.  After that people were more spread out.</p>

<p>But....not sure on the angle and how many could be hit by fragments off the concrete (?) surface.  Probably quite a few, even multiple per round.  Overall, I&#39;d lean toward conceivable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supposedly he had practice, and I wouldn&#39;t write a 60 year old off that easily these days.</p>

<p>But thinking about the report...he fired almost 400 rounds in the first 1-2 minutes (2206-2207).  At that time, the crowd is completely packed.  It would almost be hard ~not~ to hit someone with each shot, even with a bump stock.  Some of them might even have hit multiple people (through shots, fragments).  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the vast majority of the gsw&#39;s came from those first four bursts into the crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to think there were more than one shooter, still could be wrong, hence being a member of a conspiracy sub.  In fact a co-worker who&#39;s in the military made an interesting comment yesterday when I was <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/babahererra/status/914765380798820353">re-watching this video</a>.  He didn&#39;t see the video, just heard it, but thought I was watching &quot;Talking Guns&quot; videos, which I&#39;ve never heard of.  I guess talking guns is a technique that is used for several reasons, one of which is to make it sound like there is only one shooter, the other is to keep the barrels cooler, and the 3rd is so they can stay on target between the bursts.  It could explain why there were 2 windows, although there are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74qrxy/i_dont_think_stephen_paddocks_window_was_broken/">issues with that as well</a>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That first picture helps to identify the angle a little bit better.  Seems steep.</p>

<p>Obviously we&#39;re here because there is just something really wrong with the entire story/incident.  Maybe the report pushes me a little away from an alternative story, but maybe that&#39;s just the point of the report.</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t considered all the (aerosol) gunpowder in the room.  The snorkel thing is really interesting.  Also makes it harder to think there was a second shooter at least in the room.  But it also really doesn&#39;t add up well either with him shooting himself so early.  He had plenty of rounds left and no immediate breaching pressure that I can infer.</p>

<p>Ahh that makes a lot of sense. I don&#39;t know why I couldn&#39;t rationalize that myself.

    <div class="md"><p>In many ways this report says a lot without really saying anything. </p>

<p>An example of that is OP&#39;s final point about the seven bodies placed at these location.  This is Page 34 of the report and it talks about the seven additional victims that were placed at the perimeter.  If it was a concert goer who placed their friend, whatever there after carrying or stretchering them to the perimeter seeking medical help and they died on the way surely someone would have stayed with them.  If law enforcement put them there at some point that would be reported as well.  Instead, we are left with the statement &quot;seven additional victims&quot;.....</p>

<p>Surely if I am an investigator I want to know how they were placed there.  Maybe they did just that, and have a very good reason, but didn&#39;t write it in the report. Ultimately the goal was to issue this report to answer the many questions people had.  In the end, however, it creates more questions for me than it answers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shots were fired in 32-134 so they were fired after the second breach.</p>

<p>There are other shots through the wall that were apparently fired by Paddock.  It is likely that these were the result of &quot;cook off&quot; conditions.  The could have also been fired by Paddock as test rounds to verify that he could shoot through the walls.  His likely plan was to retreat into room 32-134 when the main room was breached and he could then fire through the walls at police in the other room after he closed the door.  He accidentally closed the door, causing it to &quot;lock,&quot; which is likely why he decided to kill himself without fully retreating to his final hold out point.  This explains the &quot;why did he kill himself when he had some many rounds left?&quot; question. </p>

<p>The &quot;shoes&quot; found in the second room were &quot;sandals.&quot;  They are visible in the picture on page 73.  They look to be &quot;larger&quot; and would be consistent with Paddock&#39;s size, but sandals fit a wide variety of foot sizes.  It is not uncommon to for people to have a pair of shoes as well as a pair of sandals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s do some math for the arms deal gone wrong theory:</p>

<p>It looks like 1000 rounds of .223 ammo is anywhere between $150 and $250 if you buy in bulk. .308 is somewhere in that range, but we&#39;ll pretend the majority is .223. Let&#39;s double the price because it&#39;s an off the books deal so $400/ 1000 rounds. </p>

<p>Less than 6500 rounds at around $400 per 1000 is going to put us at around $2500 for ammo.</p>

<p>Magazines and loaders seem to run around $20 for 25 - 30 rounds of .223 ammo. He seemed to have quite an assortment of magazines from 40 to 100 round capacity. We&#39;ll estimate 50 and say they are $40 each on average with mark up to $60.</p>

<p>$3000</p>

<p>14 bump stocks. We&#39;ll say $200 for those. Mark up to $300</p>

<p>$4200</p>

<p>8 Bipods at a markup price of $50</p>

<p>$400</p>

<p>A mixture of 22 AR-10s and AR-15s. From the few I spot checked, a mid range for these seems to be $1000 to $2000. So at an average of $1500 and a mark up to maybe $2000:</p>

<p>$44,000</p>

<p>5 EOTech Optics sights which range from $500 to $1000. So we&#39;ll say $800 with markup:</p>

<p>$4000</p>

<p>Recovered form his car:</p>

<p>20x 2 pound exploding targets: $500
10 x 1 pound exploding targets: $200
2 x 20pound bag of exploding precursor: $160?
More ammo and magazines: estimate $2500</p>

<p>Total: Roughly $62,000 (I know nothing about guns so emphasis on the roughly)</p>

<p>$100,000 was wired to Phillipines. I could very easily see someone saying ok you want 25 rifles and how much ammo? I can do that for $100k. I don&#39;t know if I believe that theory, but the money is reasonable. </p>

<p>1) on page 39/81 of the report it says that he was laying on the floor with a rifle under his legs where in the leaked picture it was clearly over (could have been moved after the breech but still odd)</p>

<p>2) says on the same page he was wearing black gloves as the picture also indicates but on the autopsy page 49/81 it lists what he was wearing black gloves weren&#39;t included. </p>

<p>There could be explanations for those and I&#39;m trying to go through the report(s) piece by piece.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m still trying to figure out what the hell he was doing with the hose/snorkle/fan</p>

<p>And it said on the run down of the rooms he had set up multiple live feed cameras. Now of course if he was setting up to see when the police were coming he would need real time footage of the situation but did they ever see if he was recording it or streaming it to someone else? I know when this first happened people were saying he was streaming it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) yeah that&#39;s not good</p>

<p>2) I&#39;m not sure they&#39;d automatically state that he was wearing gloves or not. </p>

<p>The snorkel thing is easy to me, he wanted the mask and had to by the kit that included the snorkel, the report says the tube was in the trash. </p>

<p>I see it as most possible that he set up a real time camera set-up just to monitor his surroundings. A live recording set up would&#39;ve been kinda advanced, and why would he want to record it? </p>

<p>And how the hell was he gonna live stream it? Mandalay Bay WIFI is shit and LTE is shit for that too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All excellent points which is why I posted initial thoughts to try to help get context. From the picture that was posted in the report there was a blue hose that spanned the better part of the room with the breathing part of it attached to one side of the hose while the other was attached to the fan. That&#39;s what threw me off about it. It&#39;s an oddity.</p>

<p>People were saying shortly after this broke that he was recording it or streaming it far before we got any reports of what his set up was like which is what posed the question in my head of was it true but of course gossip is prevalent and we&#39;ll probably never know given the lack of transparency here. All Lombardo kept saying in the presser was consult the report or he couldn&#39;t answer because it was tied up on litigation, though, he wouldn&#39;t specify why it was in litigation. And that he only released it because he wanted people to stop saying he was incompetent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s curious.
Maybe the gloves could&#39;ve come off at some point between the found body and the autopsy, for dozens of reasons. Like multiple forensics personal from multiple agencies have different protocol, so removing the gloves to examine the hands and fingerprinting before letting them get to another examiner?</p>

<p>Just playing devils advocate. Considering how many hands are in this pot, I&#39;m not willing to speculate anything without intense scrutiny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just got back to re-reading some comments. Didn&#39;t see this one.</p>

<p>Whats the problem with the stairwell door? Are you referring to how it was &quot;barricaded?&quot; </p>

<p>If that&#39;s it, I assumed he drilled screws in from the outside, and he just relied on the treads to hold the door to slow down entry, obviously not ideal. But because if he wanted to really barricade the door he would&#39;ve had to do it from the stairwell side and he couldn&#39;t undo from the hallway it if he wanted to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no. If you look at the pictures presented the one of just the close up of the stairwell door and the one of the front of the hallway seeing both doors you compare the two pictures. The one close up shows the door barricade you can tell that the door swings inward going from the hallway to the stairwell. Then in the picture of the hallway you don&#39;t see the barricade on that part of the stairwell door as in the previous picture but the door still swings inward so either there is another door to the stairwell that I&#39;m not seeing in the photograph or it&#39;s the same door but the barricade is there in one and not the other. I hope that makes sense. It&#39;s just another inconsistency that I can&#39;t make heads or tails of. If they tried saying it was different sides of the same door that couldn&#39;t be because it swings inwards. I hope that makes sense.</p>

He had 2 inhalers with him which indicates he MAY have had trouble breathing with all that gun-powder in the air from firing ~1100 rounds. He had attached a snorkel mouthpiece to a long length of vacuum-cleaner hose, and then attached the hose to a fan/funnel that would drive fresh air to his system during the barrage and allow his old asthma-y ass to breath during the assault. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The op said, &quot;Report stated they found 529 Paddock sightings on digital media but we have yet to see 1 of them.&quot;</p>

<p>The report actually said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were approximately 1,965 leads investigated. There were approximately 21,560 hours of
video and 251,099 images obtained by investigators of the LVMPD and the FBI. Analysis found
529 sightings of Paddock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, there are 251,099 images and some of them contain images of Paddock.  The report released 2 new ones (these were not previously released, so I am not sure why you are confused about this.  You did not see these prior to the report being released unless you are in law enforcement.  The images are different from the ones you previously saw.  Look at these 2 images.  Then look at the ones you saw previously.  They are clearly different and there are massive differences in the blood patterns.  They were taken at different times and evidence the movement of Paddocks body.  Not sure why people keep saying they are the same ones, perhaps you can explain that.)  </p>

<p>The report is clearly talking about both video and still images -- because it says so.  It says there are 529 total &quot;sightings.&quot;  They released 2 images that have Paddock&#39;s dead body in them.  </p>

<p>I get it. You want pictures of him shopping in WalMart or walking in the casinco.  That will blow the case wide open.  The problem is, they keep releasing more and more information and people keep wanting to see whatever it is that was not released.</p>

<p>If you want to see video of Paddock in  a casino, here you go:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoM8G7aFFV8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoM8G7aFFV8</a></p>

<p>It is from 2013.  Don&#39;t worry, the footage from 2017 will be released at some point.  But what will you do when it doesn&#39;t show him meeting with Saudi Assassins and CIA gun dealers?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The op said, &quot;Report stated they found 529 Paddock sightings on digital media but we have yet to see 1 of them.&quot;</p>

<p>The report actually said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were approximately 1,965 leads investigated. There were approximately 21,560 hours of
video and 251,099 images obtained by investigators of the LVMPD and the FBI. Analysis found
529 sightings of Paddock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, there are 251,099 images and some of them contain images of Paddock.  The report released 2 new ones (these were not previously released, so I am not sure why you are confused about this.  You did not see these prior to the report being released unless you are in law enforcement.  The images are different from the ones you previously saw.  Look at these 2 images.  Then look at the ones you saw previously.  They are clearly different and there are massive differences in the blood patterns.  They were taken at different times and evidence the movement of Paddocks body.  Not sure why people keep saying they are the same ones, perhaps you can explain that.)  </p>

<p>The report is clearly talking about both video and still images -- because it says so.  It says there are 529 total &quot;sightings.&quot;  They released 2 images that have Paddock&#39;s dead body in them.  </p>

<p>I get it. You want pictures of him shopping in WalMart or walking in the casinco.  That will blow the case wide open.  The problem is, they keep releasing more and more information and people keep wanting to see whatever it is that was not released.</p>

<p>If you want to see video of Paddock in  a casino, here you go:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoM8G7aFFV8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoM8G7aFFV8</a></p>

<p>It is from 2013.  Don&#39;t worry, the footage from 2017 will be released at some point.  But what will you do when it doesn&#39;t show him meeting with Saudi Assassins and CIA gun dealers?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no. If you look at the pictures presented the one of just the close up of the stairwell door and the one of the front of the hallway seeing both doors you compare the two pictures. The one close up shows the door barricade you can tell that the door swings inward going from the hallway to the stairwell. Then in the picture of the hallway you don&#39;t see the barricade on that part of the stairwell door as in the previous picture but the door still swings inward so either there is another door to the stairwell that I&#39;m not seeing in the photograph or it&#39;s the same door but the barricade is there in one and not the other. I hope that makes sense. It&#39;s just another inconsistency that I can&#39;t make heads or tails of. If they tried saying it was different sides of the same door that couldn&#39;t be because it swings inwards. I hope that makes sense.</p>
