       I've seen lots of people saying the NBA/NFL are rigged, something something Patriots 2002.   What about soccer?   I remember S Korea getting """very lucky""" when they hosted the world cup and got all the way to the semis in 2002, with Spain and Italy being the victims.   Doping is another thing that supposedly barely ever happens (something like a handful out of 5000 tests) anyone have the scoop on that?

       They use the refs to get more calls swayed towards a team. Doesnâ€™t always work but makes it near impossible to have a fair match.

       Fan is short for fanatic. Generally means you have unreasonable beliefs about your favorite team or sport or player. You can however know for certain that those sports are competing for your attention and money. There will be some "maneuvers"

       if televised sports are not rigged somehow i would be suprised. it needs to keep the fanatics on the egde of their seat, so they even invent more controversy to give them fodder during the downtime. they know what works, how to milk it.

       because advertisers, they rule the fucking media world. imo. they set the standards, and make the rules, or the media suppliers dont get paid. all media is a form of marketing and advertising. sports included.

       Well the NFL just accidently put out an ad for this upcoming superbowl that had the Patriots and vikings playing. Both teams have yet to make the superbowl but we'll see after this weekend.

       Don't even get me started. First time in 15 years I didn't watch the Natty. I'd say it was a game I pretty much could've watched in mid-November, but the SEC doesn't schedule games like that-- hello Mercer.

       There is match fixing in football but mostly it is in markets you would expect such corruption (Asia, eastern Europe, Africa etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       In my 31 years I believe there has only been one incident of match fixing / betting in the top division in England and that was in the 90â€™s and involved Bruce Grobbalar and Hans Seagars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doping and drugs are anyones guess. You would have to expect there to be plenty of it. Man Cityâ€™s manager has always been involved with wrong doing and doping. He was banned as a player and is rumoured to have shady doctors and medical staff around at all his clubs except at Bayern Munich.

       Raptors fan here. It's obvious to me that the refs are influencing outcomes. It's been particularly bad the last few years. It appears that some players are involved as well. Really takes the fun out of the game.

       While I may not be 100% convinced that the NBA is rigged I do find it mystifying as to the subjective nature of calls made from game to game.

       It's gotten so bad that it appears the can review video of any play sequence to find violations to retroactively make calls against us. The first example of this was last year when after a game winning three, they reviewed the play and decided that the timekeeper had missed a few milliseconds in starting the clock, and that we would not have made the bucket if timed correctly. We were given the loss. Of course they failed to note the overun of the clock on the stoppage directly previous to the final play, and several just prior. Soon they'll say a misthrown tip to start the game erroneously caused us to win a game.

       I don't believe he won. If I remember correctly, the NFL won as it was considered entertainment rather than a sporting event which pretty much signaled the NFL is rigged/fixed/scripted like the WWE.

       For English soccer it is pretty clear that refs and the Football Association don't like my team, Chelsea. They even used video review in the midweek game and got it wrong. So wrong the ref association came out and said it was wrong afterwards.

       Yeah? They hardly ever get penalties. Remember the Battle of the Bridge against spurs? Ref straight up said he wasn't going call the game right and Chelsea got fined a shit ton of money for getting their ass kicked by the ref and Spurs.

       NBA is by far the easiest sport to rig and there's no way it was just one guy ever to rig it. You can call two quick fouls and literally take the best player on the team off the floor for several minutes for basically nothing. Football is definitely rigable, the easiest being drive killing holding calls or advantageous "weak" pass interference calls.

       I think every major sport is manipulated to a degree. That being said, some are easier to manipulate/rig than others, usually because of the way the rules work or the number of refs on the field/court at any given time. I would imagine that soccer, with one main referee running around in front of the whole stadium, would be a bit harder to fix than American football, where 5 or 6 referees are everywhere and a lot more action happens.

       You don't think any professional athlete would've come out about the games being rigged? They're human too and they do know what's right and wrong.

       The NFL has a weird business model. The NFL itself doesn't make that much money (a few million). Each of the teams operate as separate entities and they make the billions of dollars and they are not non-profit organizations.
      </p>

       Also the NFL Head Office is no longer a non-profit organization.

       I've seen enough games to know that sports are rigged. Teams that had disasters in their city the previous year winning championships to teams with big markets consistently getting calls against smaller market teams(especially in playoffs, post-season). Yet fanatics of sports and sports teams don't want to believe, I am just crazy to them.

       Start of the NHL season in 1989 (yes I am old) I said if Calgary wins this year this whole thing is rigged.  Sure enough they did.

       Lanny MacDonald announced his retirement and if any player could not go without a cup ring it was him. They let it happen.

       Since then I have paid attention  to things like playoff games. Notice how many go the full 7 games?

       Sports are a show. A distraction and they milk them for all they are worth.

       Nowadays one hardly has to "fix" a game as they did in the old days. Nowadays you can bet on ANYTHING that is related to ANY game. Not that hard to make money of the number of corners or throw-ins in a soccer-game if you can only get one of the players on the field to help you out a little. Just an example of how easy it is to "rig" a modern game without rigging the actual result.
