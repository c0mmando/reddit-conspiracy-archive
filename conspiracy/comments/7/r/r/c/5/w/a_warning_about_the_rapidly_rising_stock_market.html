       It is a bubble and it gets easier to create the bubbles since there are not many individual, ordinary citizens who are stock holders since the boom/busts that began with Black Monday, included the TEch Crash and of course the economic collapse of 2007.

       Stocks, are now mostly owned and controlled by institutions such as mutual funds and really huge investors, like hedge funds and private equity groups.

       Well Trump and Ryan are gonna reign in the budget and controll spending cause that's what the GOP always does. As for debt, I think thats more fear mongering than most other things. We have $20 trillion in debt. $6 of that being owned to foreign interests, the rest being owed back to the US gov or Us people and groups. Our GDP is close to $18 trillion. I haven't heard anyrhing about the Fed printing money like it's paper. Yeah, sure it prints money to replace the money being taken out of circulation, but I haven'tnheard anything about adding additional money to the econimy. I'm not sure why they would do that? That's usually a recession move. You put new money into the economy under the belief that the value created by the influx will be grwater than the cost of the wealth. None of this shit matters to me, though, cause I've made myself impervious to the stock market. All my money is invested in pogs.

       You never heard of qualitative easing (QE &amp; QE2)?  Its basically how they tried to recover from the 2008/2009 collapse. ..but printing money, 0% interest rates, etc.  Its been full throttle for a decade.

       Yeah, bud. I was some what poorly and rudimentaly trying to describe the policy in my comment about wealth being added to the economy in hopes what creates has more value than the original wealth. QE works. There is no question about that. It has been proven at least once and better economists than myself might choose to argue twice now. A question is, though, just how much does it really work and how long should the policy be in place? QE2 was in 2011, that is a bit in the past now. This, though, is where my economic policy knowledge really ends regsrding all if this. I know it's more complicated than wealth in, more wealth out and there are basis points and borrowing and interest rates and the whole shebang. In the world of Keynes vs Friedman, I'd fall in the, "why not Zoidberg" camp. No, I don't things are as black and white to choose only one or the other. Certain policies work best in certain climates.

       Still at basically 0% interest rates which is another soft QE as the bank borrow for free (thus mo money from thin air). You can argue the multiplier effect (which is really a shrinking multiplier effect and has been for decades) mostly because the banks don't lend that money back out into the economy, they just invest it for their own house portfolios.  Anyway, the inflation and debt created by QE and such policies is a short term fix that causes long term problems. ..just ask seniors on a fixed income..savers get clobbered under such policies and risk takers are rewarded...espcially those too big to fail.

       Overvaluation built on hyped up fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       All those companies are valuated on how many users they have. How many bank accounts, real or not, they can present to investors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wealth is so concetrated right now that any wave in the big propped up ball of fraud and debt, makes the dollar as a whole worth less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the truth comes out that 60% of social media accounts are fake. 20% of bank accounts are fake. And they all got breached / hacked. And it was all hosted on Amazon servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would evaporate 100's of billions of dollars of valuation overnight. That loss is then socialized. They get a stern talking to from Sen. Warren. Maybe a fine, but who would trust them?   What investor would trust a bank or a media company that openly lied to them for over a decade?   People start looking more closely - it's all over the place. The jig is up. Golden parachutes get deployed.

       I’d say that the tech companies might be. With all the bots it has increased the revenue from advertisers who are increasingly catching on to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a lot of the market should be poised to do well as the lowered corporate tax rates are obviously beneficial for companies

       It's been accurate since 2014. But, nothing has occurred in terms of a predictable trough/downturn. Completely manipulated. It will only fall when those in power want it to fall.

       The United States may be headed for a transformation event style meltdown.  The main reason our economy remains solvent is the fact the US dollar is the primary reserve currency.  China has been hoarding gold, and now Russia is as well.  We will not be the reserve currency forever.  The only reason we have been able to substain such ludicrous amounts of public and private debt is the stake the rest of the world has in our success.  Take that incentive away, combine it with a rough Brexit that prevents the UK from propping us up, and we could be fucked.  Our economy is like Madoff's pyramid scheme, and when people stop gambling on our success we lose.

       I hit eject on any stock investments I had in my 401k and am in metals.  That is pointless, however, as I suspect Fort Knox is about 90% lead bars with gold paint.  The worst part is I have very limited skills outside of finance, my chosen profession.  I have been camping a dozen times, fished about a dozen times when I was a kid 40 years ago.  When the shit hits the fan and the power grid goes down I may be better off ramming my car into the Walgreens drive thru and loading up on oxy.  That may be the one currency that could hold its value if shit unravels.

       They wouldn't use lead bars, they would use tungsten since it weighs virtually the same as gold and its already quite a heist so no need to be so greedy with it.  I guess if you spent a shit load of time on a single bar in the lab then you could figure out its absolute composition but for practicality purposes they need to cut the bars open.  So they would just sample random bars.  Its kind of a bad thing and you just really want to be sure that your supply is valid and to do that you'd want to have audits.  Hmm, but they don't publicly audit it and so anything goes.  Agreed, its a ridiculous situation.

       has lots of info supporting something like this. It's not necessarily that the collapse of the market is a way to make people poor. It's more like, the way that the Fed has played games with the dollar and with interest rates has created unsustainable bubble markets in everything, including the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were about to have a mild correction when Long Term Capital Management went under, but Wall Street bailed them out. No big deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were about to have a painful correction when the housing market collapsed, but the Fed bailed Wall Street out with QE and low interest rates. So we only had a small correction there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have a bond bubble about to pop, and there's nobody big enough to stop it, because the dollar is the world's trade currency. So it's just going to happen. And all that deferred pain from the corrections we cut short is going to crash in all at once.
       <br/>
       There are a lot of things that could set it off -- China, oil prices, this shutdown, some kind of attack or false flag, who knows. Maybe we teeter along for another year or two first. But a correction
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       coming.

       I told my brother to get his retirement out of the stock market months ago.  I don't have any inside knowledge, but I know the Wall street bandits have not been reined in and no stock market goes only up.  It's due to for another "correction".  I don't know how long the U.S. can keep going with so much of our economy based on blowing up bubbles over and over, anyway.

       The stock market has a boom-bust cycle roughly every twelve years. We're due for the bubble to pop. Right now people see the market going up and think they need to get in as it will keep going up. Those people lose all their money. The smart people see it going up, sell to those people, make a lot of money, and buy back twice as much once the bubble pops. It's been like this for forever.

       I don't normally comment on this subreddit, but this post irked me so much. If you simply think the market is going to crash just because it has "gone up," then it should've crashed sometime in the past 4 years or so. This post has no substance whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the market was going to crash it would have to be something external, not just because the market is "high." If you're gonna post something, please put more effort.
