       The following contains approximately

      </p>
      <p>
       I've tried to present this material in as concise a manner as possible. Those that dismiss this information without careful consideration are doing this entire topic, and themselves, a great disservice.

       This material is

       vaccines are harmful and ineffective.

       Strain Replacement &amp; Pathogen Evolution
      </h2>
      <p>
       Ideally, vaccines would provide perfect protection that lasts forever. However, vaccines are imperfect; they confer incomplete immunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mounting evidence indicates that vaccines designed to
       <em>
        reduce
       </em>
       the growth rate of pathogens within their hosts produce conditions that actually
       <em>
        increase
       </em>
       pathogen virulence, ultimately preventing eradication of the disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disease-causing organisms strive to maximally infect their hosts without killing them. Vaccines induce the targeted pathogen to adapt and evolve in unintended ways, creating undesirable disease outcomes in individuals and entire host populations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Herd immunity may never be achieved as vaccination rates impel the pathogen family to avoid extinction by enhancing its hostile nature as it
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11742400">
        adapts to its new environment

        This evolution can erode any population-wide benefits such that overall mortality rates are unaffected, or even increase, with the level of vaccination coverage.

        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16817536">
         We find
        </a>
        that the use of either anti-growth or anti-transmission vaccines leads to the evolution of pathogens with an increased within-host growth rate; infection of unvaccinated hosts with such evolved pathogens results in high host mortality.

       Vaccines that target some

       Selling Varicella

      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox">
        Chickenpox
       </a>
       is a contagious disease caused by infection with varicella zoster virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_vaccine">
        chickenpox vaccine
       </a>
       was introduced in 1995, it was common for doctors to recommend exposing children to the disease because it is generally benign in childhood and complication rates increase when it is contracted by teenagers or adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people regain their health after contracting chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body. Later, when immunity weakens, the virus can become active again and cause
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles">
        shingles
       </a>
       , also known as herpes zoster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immunity against shingles is strengthened by periodic exposures to the varicella virus. Before the chickenpox vaccine, frequent encounters with the varicella virus boosted antibody protection against shingles. Although chickenpox cases decreased after the introduction of the vaccine, this restricted opportunities to reinforce immunity and increased the rate of shingles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Medical costs, pain, and suffering associated with shingles generally are much greater than with chickenpox. To address this problem, the maker of the chickenpox vaccine,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_%26_Co.">
        Merck &amp; Co.
       </a>
       has developed and released a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoster_vaccine">
        shingles vaccine
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to causing a dramatic rise in shingles,
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22659447/">
        the vaccine becomes less effective as rates increase
       </a>
       . This is due to a reduction in opportunities for natural boosts to immunity which occur from exposure to people who are shedding the wild varicella virus.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the prelicensure era, 95% of adults experienced natural chickenpox (usually as children)--these cases were usually benign and resulted in long-term immunity. Varicella vaccination is less effective than the natural immunity that existed in prevaccine communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Universal varicella vaccination has not proven to be cost-effective as increased herpes zoster morbidity has disproportionately offset cost savings associated with reductions in varicella disease. Universal varicella vaccination has failed to provide long-term protection from varicella zoster virus disease.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sponsored and promoted studies that showed positive outcomes of varicella vaccination but opposed, and attempted to block, publication of findings that were critical of the vaccination program.

       Alright. This is evidence that we need to make a newer vaccine. We now know these things, and input them into the equation and take them into account. Do you think that if this wasnt 3 in 1 deal that this statistic would change?

       This statement the whole potential health benefits thing is idiotic, ignorant, and lack of empathy for children. Just because you will be immune from it the rest of your life that does MAKE IT A GOOD THING! Why should a child needlessly suffer [horrific pain, rashes, and potentially dying](

Sorry to get all worked up about this, but I actually have high functioning autism. Yes I got vaccinate, and what a fucking mircle I dont have polio. And no it didnt make me autistic. This annoys me to no end.

       Despite so much being spent on health care in the first world, we are getting sicker and sicker, and Big Pharma keep refusing to study their vaccines, that's because they know what they're vaccines are really doing, if they believed their vaccines were good they would have no shame in studying them and showing us exactly how much harm they are causing.  Unfortunately vaccines are regularly causing all sorts of highly profitable problems, this is great for the industry, as healthy people don't make them profits.  Vaccines are causing Asthma, Diabetes Type 1, MS, Peanut Allergies, Epilepsy, Childhood Leukemia, Eczema, Muscle Wasting Diseases and so much more.  The childhood viruses were are vaccinating against are very mild and short term, nothing to worry about in healthy well-nourished individuals, the immune system knows what it's doing.  Whereas the problems the vaccines cause, nobody wants those, they are a life sentence.

       No he is wrong. If you look at the graphs in the article you linked the rate of mortality in both infants and children in the U.S has been steadily decreasing decade after decade since the 1950's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that article points out is that the rate of decrease in the U.S hasn't caught up to other rich countries. They say this is because of poverty and welfare spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing you have to realize about the U.S is that it has large population groups that other rich countries don't have. The U.S for example has a large population group whose total tax remittance isn't even enough to cover their welfare expenditure.

       Life expectancy figures from the past are artificially low due to high infant mortality. Not surviving being born. It drives the average down to seem like no one was living past 60.

      <p>
       Modern tech has helped us survive being born, but diet related illnesses that require meds for life, hyper virulent disease caused by resistance , etc.. those are the indicators he's referring to. We created a whole new kind of sickness and time wil tel if we can keep up with it.

If medical science and modern tech are that powerful, whose to say the same people 'manipulating' the vaccines aren't manipulating the procedures and medicine?

       Just found this, will put it here, the MMR vaccine is causing lots of epilepsy, which easily outweighs any theoretical benefit of the vaccine given that Measles is such a mild virus in the first world.

       Physicians for Informed Consent Finds MMR Vaccine Causes Seizures in 5,700 U.S. Children Annually
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/news/physicians-informed-consent-finds-mmr-vaccine-causes-seizures-5700-u-s-children-annually/">
        https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/news/physicians-informed-consent-finds-mmr-vaccine-causes-seizures-5700-u-s-children-annually/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Los Angeles, Calif. — The California-based nonprofit organization, Physicians for Informed Consent (PIC), recently reported in The BMJ that every year about 5,700 U.S. children suffer seizures from the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       This finding is derived from results of the most statistically powered safety study ever to measure the association between MMR vaccination and febrile seizures. More than half a million children were evaluated, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, from a Danish population that is relied upon globally to examine vaccine safety. The results showed that seizures from the MMR vaccine occur in about 1 in 640 children up to two weeks following MMR vaccination. Applying this risk of seizures to the 3.64 million U.S. children vaccinated with a first dose of MMR every year results in about 5,700 annual MMR-vaccine seizures.
      </p>
      <p>
       “To make accurate and ethical public health decisions, the risks of a vaccine must be compared to the risks of the disease one is trying to prevent,” said Dr. Shira Miller, PIC president and founder. “When considering the MMR vaccine to prevent measles, the risks of the MMR vaccine need to be compared to the risks of measles.”
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a five-fold higher risk of seizures from the MMR vaccine than seizures from measles, and a significant portion of MMR-vaccine seizures cause permanent harm. For example, 5% of febrile seizures result in epilepsy, a chronic brain disorder that leads to recurring seizures. Annually, about 300 MMR-vaccine seizures (5% of 5,700) will lead to epilepsy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), designed to be a warning system for identifying vaccine side effects, receives only about 90 annual reports of MMR-vaccine seizures following the first dose—only 1.6% of the 5,700 MMR-vaccine seizures that actually occur. Thus, other serious vaccine adverse events from MMR, including permanent neurological harm and death, may similarly be underreported.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In the United States, measles is generally a benign, short-term viral infection; 99.99% of measles cases fully recover,” said Dr. Miller. “As it has not been proven that the MMR vaccine is safer than measles, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that mandatory measles mass vaccination results in a net public health benefit in the United States.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Physicians for Informed Consent is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational organization dedicated to safeguarding informed consent in vaccination. To learn more about vaccine risks vs. disease risks, read PIC’s Letter to the Editor in The BMJ, and PIC’s Measles Disease Information Statement (DIS) and Vaccine Risk Statement (VRS) at physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles."

       I saw TV show excerpt from "The Doctors". They were very uninformed about CDC failures and independent clinical studies. When the guests tried to explain why the statements about all vaccines being "safe and effective/widely studies/proven" the "doctors went straight to emotion when they could not defend their statements. It was pathetic.

        Human papillomavirus

       In 2006, the FDA approved a new HPV vaccine for 9 to 26-year-old women. The vaccine protects against 4 of the 100 strains of HPV. Another HPV vaccine, produced by a U.K. manufacturer, is also available in many parts of the world.

        HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials. Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions and significant misinterpretation of available data.
       </p>
       <p>
        Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities).
       </p>
       <p>
        We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles.

       Wrong. Simply wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more than 100 types of HPV and only 40 are considered sexually transmitted. Of those 40, 13 are commensal meaning that they cause no harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves 27 types of sexually transmitted HPV that can potentially cause harm. 13 of those canc cause warts.
       <strong>
        14 can cause cancer. Of these 14, HPV 16 and HPV 18 cause more HPV related cancers than all the other HPV types put together including about 70% of all cervical cancers.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although most infections cause no symptoms and resolve spontaneously, that simple statement is misleading without definitions. After all, "most" of 100 cases could be 51.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is now estimated that around 90% of sexually active people in the US have had or will have at least one HPV infection with most of those having more than one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men tend to have more infections and those infections tend to last longer while women suffer more adverse reactions, more specifically, women suffer adverse reactions of HPV infections 8 or 9 times more often than do men. That is almost exclusively due to the uterine cervix susceptibility to precancerous and cancerous lesions.

       That's nitpicking, the types of HPV in the vaccine are sexually transmitted, that's the type we are discussing now.  HPV is mainly transmitted through sexual contact and most people are infected with HPV shortly after the onset of sexual activity.

       It takes 7 to 10 years, average (depending what type of cervical cancer), to develop invasive cervical cancer from an HPV infection. If you're sexually active at 13, you can have cervical cancer at 20 before you've ever had a single Pap.

       I'm neutral. I'm not pro- or anti-. When I went to find cases of vaccine-injury vs. injuries/death from not taking a vaccine, I found mostly that with each vaccine there are serveral hundred more cases per year won in court for permanent vaccine injury than reported injuries from not taking vaccines. In fact, where are those numbers? These numbers are hard as fuck to find and you would think if there are kids dying from not being given vaccines that we would hear about them. I don't deny they exist necessarily, I just want to know more. Statistically, there is a much greater chance of being harmed by the shot than the disease if you aren't in a situation where they are necessary (healthy, first world, etc.) Im still looking for statistics on injuries due to not taking the vaccines but they are difficult to find.

       When one learns that lots of the common allergies and autoimmune diseases are vaccine injuries, then you ask about when the friend/family member first had symptoms, you'll find it's mostly just after a vaccine or not long after.
      </p>
      <p>
       A pensioner I knew was going away through a cruise, he got two travel vaccines before he went, both at the same time.  He told the doctor it wasn't a good idea to give them together, but the doctor said it was fine.  On the cruise he got extremely sick, almost died, he was later diagnosed with an autoimmune disease associated with one of the vaccines he received.  It costs 2K US dollars per month for a treatment to keep him alive, even still he's already been close to death on a few times, such is the severity of his illness.

      <p>
       Most people who get chicken pox are fine, the mortality rate is typically low. In the US, before the vaccine came out there were ~4 million cases, ~9000 hospitalizations, and ~100 deaths per year. About 1/5 of those hospitalized developed neurological complications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vaccine causes serious complication in 2.6/100,000 doses, and death in .1/100,000 doses (usually in children with severe congenital defects or a compromised immune system, who shouldn't have received it in the first place). Usually about 5 million doses are given per year - that adds up to 100 cases of serious side effects and 5 deaths per year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chicken pox was a comparatively benign illness, but it still caused deaths and serious problems. The vaccine has brought down levels of infection by close to 90%, and it's risks are far less than the virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines cause you to shed the virus for 2 weeks. Ok, that sounds pretty bad. How many people have caught chickenpox from an immunized person? 11. So it's obviously not the same as the virus floating around the population in it's normal manner. Yeah, definitely "tears apart" the herd immunity "marketing approach" as you call it.

       Cervical cancer accounts for less than 1% of all new cancer diagnosis, it's mostly a problem for smokers and those who used oral contraception.  Healthy females will clear up the HPV virus naturally.   The HPV vaccine has approx 1 in 33 risk of harming you, that is far higher than the risk of cervical cancer itself, especially in someone so young who is at low risk.  It's also been admitted in official documents that if you had HPV when you received the vaccine your risk of cervical cancer increases, yet they are not screening to see if people have HPV before giving the vaccine.  Another thing to watch out for is that many

        cervical cancer diagnosis are false positive

       , they show up in official data as the real thing and tens of thousands of $ are spent treating a healthy individual, that means the healthy patient being damaged by the chemo along with $100,000+ for Big Pharma.

       Woops! You are absolutely right. I misrepresented the facts. However, I hope you noticed that right there on the same page, is the fourth bullet point:
Between 1999 and 2008, there were 3,063 cases of cervical cancer each year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        On average, there were 14 cases per year among women aged 15 to 19, and 125 cases per year among women aged 20 to 24 years.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So even though I made a mistake, it still proved axiotl wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       14 teenagers in the US per year. That's higher than I expected.

       <p>
        Conclusion
Exposure to HPV vaccines was not associated with an increased risk of ADs within the time period studied. Results were robust to case definitions and time windows of exposure. Continued active surveillance is needed to confirm this finding for individual ADs.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        RESULTS:
A total of 70 265 girls and women had at least one of the 49 predefined autoimmune diseases; 16% of these individuals received at least one dose of qHPV vaccine. In unvaccinated girls and women, 5428 new-onset autoimmune diseases were observed during 245 807 person-years at a rate of 22.1 (95% CI 21.5-22.7) new events per 1000 person-years. In vaccinated girls and women, there were 124 new events during 7848 person-years at a rate of 15.8 (95% CI 13.2-18.8) per 1000 person-years. There was no increase in the incidence of new-onset autoimmune disease associated with qHPV vaccination during the risk period; on the contrary, we found a slightly reduced risk (incidence rate ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.93).

       Unfortunately, that's only an abstract and I can't tell you who funded the research.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here we are with at least two studies that have done exactly what OPs study suggested - followed up on a potential connection. And they found none.

       If you look at the detail they rigged it by only looking for preselected autoimmune diseases, they didn’t look for the obvious ones which are regularly linked with the vaccine.  Vaccine science is mostly smoke and mirrors, so are most of the pro vaccine people who show up in this sub.

       Cervical cancer is caused by a persistent infection by a high risk type of HPV. Cervical cancer begins as dysplasia and progresses through several stages of dysplasia through to cancer. Therefore, evidence that people who have been vaccinated have fewer incidence of dysplasia is also evidence that there will fewer incidence of invasive cancer.

       This guy is trying to say that reducing incidence of dysplasia is not evidence the vaccine works. That's quackery.

       I would imagine since vaccines are actually facing real scientific peril on an increasingly mainstream level the pharma companies are going to begin trying to use the fake news angle on people presenting any antivaxx science by doxxing them and attempting to present their arguments in the worst light possible using the media.

       He's right. Literally (and I'm not using that word facetiously) your entire post history is filled with defending this vaccine. You're incredibly passionate about defending just this vaccine for someone who is admittedly not even a medical professional, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even one of the lead researchers in developing this vaccine is speaking out about it, and the very real problems with this vaccine have become evident enough that even mainstream news sites can't ignore it anymore. So please, stop pushing your agenda here.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Parents and women must know that deaths occurred. Not all deaths that have been reported were represented in Dr. Slade's work, one-third of the death reports were unavailable to the CDC, leaving the parents of the deceased teenagers in despair that the CDC is ignoring the very rare but real occurrences that need not have happened if parents were given information stating that there are real, but small risks of death surrounding the administration of Gardasil."
      </p>
      <p>
       She also worries that Merck's aggressive marketing of the vaccine may have given women a false sense of security. "The future expectations women hold because they have received free doses of Gardasil purchased by philanthropic foundations, by public health agencies or covered by insurance is the true threat to cervical cancer in the future. Should women stop Pap screening after vaccination, the cervical cancer rate will actually increase per year. Should women believe this is preventive for all cancers - something never stated, but often inferred by many in the population-- a reduction in all health care will compound our current health crisis. Should Gardasil not be effective for more than 15 years, the most costly public health experiment in cancer control will have failed miserably."

       No. Neither he nor you are even close to being right about my post history. You are looking for something that isn't there. The vaccine is incidental to my posting passion.

       This is an issue with conspiracy theorists - a tendency to look for things that support their preconceived, mysterious agendas instead of looking at the most logical and reasonable explanation.

       However, even if I were the CEO of Merk, its still up to you to prove your theory.

       Holy shit.  I looked.  I'll admit that I didn't make it more than a half dozen screens of posting history before I said "Jesus" and closed it out.  There is nothing in my day to day life that could possible make me engage that strongly on one topic without getting paid for it... But that might just be me.

       Just commenting because it's odd to see people arguing over something we all have the facts for. It is wrong to say you post 100% about HPV - there are plenty of other posts. But objectively, the huge majority are about HPV, and they are far longer and more detailed than your other comments. You post about HPV in all kinds of subs too.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give a bit of data, I looked through the first six pages of your most recent comments (25 posts a page so 150 in total). I count 9 that aren't HPV related. That's less than 5%.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm really baffled how you can sincerely deny that your posts are overwhelmingly on a single topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I can see why you're so into the subject. Your ex husband sounds like a real piece of shit who really screwed you over. So I'm not saying you're a shill. But come on now, surely you can admit you're super interested in talking about HPV on reddit.

       If you looked through their post history more you will see that they were diagnosed with cancer awhile ago and it was related to HPV. It's not so crazy that a cancer patient/survivor would take an extreme interest in educating folks on a commonly misunderstood topic. Their stance on vaccines is a bit fanatical especially in regards to HPV, but it is understandable.

       Yeah, she pm'ed me (because they banner her here) and started being a huge dick about it, but I figured it out. She wouldn't just tell me out rigjt no matter how nicely I asked. She kept telling me I was stupid, that all of the evidence I needed was in her post history, and that I should do my own research...she might be sick, and I feel bad about that, but fuck her as a person. I was genuinely asking why and she just threw it back in my face. I just stopped replying, stopped caring.

After adjusting for the number of recent sexual partners, the difference in prevalence of high-risk nonvaccine types was reduced, but remained significant.”

Physicians for Informed Consent Finds MMR Vaccine Causes Seizures in 5,700 U.S. Children Annually
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/news/physicians-informed-consent-finds-mmr-vaccine-causes-seizures-5700-u-s-children-annually/">
        https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/news/physicians-informed-consent-finds-mmr-vaccine-causes-seizures-5700-u-s-children-annually/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Los Angeles, Calif. — The California-based nonprofit organization, Physicians for Informed Consent (PIC), recently reported in The BMJ that every year about 5,700 U.S. children suffer seizures from the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       This finding is derived from results of the most statistically powered safety study ever to measure the association between MMR vaccination and febrile seizures. More than half a million children were evaluated, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, from a Danish population that is relied upon globally to examine vaccine safety. The results showed that seizures from the MMR vaccine occur in about 1 in 640 children up to two weeks following MMR vaccination. Applying this risk of seizures to the 3.64 million U.S. children vaccinated with a first dose of MMR every year results in about 5,700 annual MMR-vaccine seizures.
      </p>
      <p>
       “To make accurate and ethical public health decisions, the risks of a vaccine must be compared to the risks of the disease one is trying to prevent,” said Dr. Shira Miller, PIC president and founder. “When considering the MMR vaccine to prevent measles, the risks of the MMR vaccine need to be compared to the risks of measles.”
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a five-fold higher risk of seizures from the MMR vaccine than seizures from measles, and a significant portion of MMR-vaccine seizures cause permanent harm. For example, 5% of febrile seizures result in epilepsy, a chronic brain disorder that leads to recurring seizures. Annually, about 300 MMR-vaccine seizures (5% of 5,700) will lead to epilepsy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), designed to be a warning system for identifying vaccine side effects, receives only about 90 annual reports of MMR-vaccine seizures following the first dose—only 1.6% of the 5,700 MMR-vaccine seizures that actually occur. Thus, other serious vaccine adverse events from MMR, including permanent neurological harm and death, may similarly be underreported.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In the United States, measles is generally a benign, short-term viral infection; 99.99% of measles cases fully recover,” said Dr. Miller. “As it has not been proven that the MMR vaccine is safer than measles, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that mandatory measles mass vaccination results in a net public health benefit in the United States.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Physicians for Informed Consent is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational organization dedicated to safeguarding informed consent in vaccination. To learn more about vaccine risks vs. disease risks, read PIC’s Letter to the Editor in The BMJ, and PIC’s Measles Disease Information Statement (DIS) and Vaccine Risk Statement (VRS) at physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles.

       Nothing on HPV. High risk strains are uniquely susceptible to causing cancer, not necessarily being pathogens that spread. As a general rule HPV is relatively harmless. Hence why only the top cancer causing strains are included.

       Here’s a fun tidbit. At 17 I was diagnosed with HPV. My gyro told me it rarely goes away on its own and the only way to fix it was getting the gardisil vaccine. She used her authority to lie to me, she said it would make my HPV go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked around and read a few articles before deciding to simply live a healthier life and avoid the vaccine. My HPV cleared up by next pap and ten years later I’m still hpv free.

       Moral of the story. Doctors lie to you. They offer a
       <em>
        false sense of security
       </em>
       and that’s the biggest problem with vaccines, being offered a vaccine as a cure all when you likely just need to change your lifestyle

       good lord, you dodged a bullet there. It has been shown that taking the gardasil vaccine when you already have an ongoing HPV infection leads to a greater chance of developing cancer. That doctor should be sued for malpractice. Im glad you are now healthy and hpv free.

      <p>
       The pertussis vaccine has encouraged evolutionary adaptation, permitting virulent vaccine-resistant strains of pertussis to emerge.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who are vaccinated against pertussis may be silent carriers of the disease and capable of infecting others. For example,

      <p>
       The new definition was excessively restrictive, requiring laboratory confirmation and at least 21 days of paroxysmal cough. As a result, legitimate cases of pertussis were eliminated and the efficacy of the vaccine was artificially inflated.

       Originally developed in the 1940s, the

        influenza vaccine
       </a>
       is strongly encouraged for nearly everyone over the age of 6 months. About 170 million doses were expected to be produced for the U.S. market during the 2015/2016 flu season, compared to 32 million in 1990.
      </p>
      <p>
       Annual vaccination against seasonal influenza reduces protective immunity against more virulent strains. People who are naturally exposed to circulating influenza viruses (the unvaccinated) frequently gain cross-protection against other strains of the disease.

        This lack of precision causes physicians and potential vaccine recipients to have unrealistic assumptions about the vaccine's potential benefit, and impedes dissemination of the evidence on nonpharmaceutical interventions against respiratory diseases.

        Additionally, there are significant statistical incompatibilities between official estimates and national vital statistics data. Compounding these problems is a marketing of fear—a CDC communications strategy in which medical experts “predict dire outcomes” during flu seasons.

       The current vaccines are simply shots in the dark as the necessary research has not been performed, we do not have much of a clue how much harm they are causing or how much benefit they actually bring.  However the pharmaceuticals do their own studies we they don't share with us, they will know that vaccines are bringing profits i.e. by inducing profitable sickness, as independent experts have verified and as vaccine inserts mention in small print.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately now we're at a stage where the experts are now able to crowdfund to the necessary research which the pharmaceuticals refuse to do.

       In the case of polio, they reclassified the conditions necessary for the illness to be classified as "polio", essentially making that diagnoses much more restrictive.

       One of the key things about polio is that many people in the early 20th century that were diagnosed with polio did not actually have polio. There are about 8 other diseases that have similar symptoms to polio that were unknown at the time but were stamped with the diagnosis of polio. It padded the stats. Even

        Read the section on polio
       </a>
       from my first "skeptic's guide."
      </p>
      <p>
       The vaccine made polio epidemics
       <em>
        worse
       </em>
       ...and when they realized this they changed the definition of polio to make it seem like cases had been
       <em>
        reduced
       </em>
       by the vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       DDT poisoning and high-sugar diets contributed to the "polio" epidemic, and the vaccine was contaminated with SV-40, a cancer-causing simian virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       An entire generation was therefore given a cancer-causing virus, which may be directly responsible for today's epidemic in soft-tissue cancers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, the polio vaccine was one of the greatest scientific debacles of the 20th century.

       To be clear here, you don't actually know anyone who has recently contracted polio. Say in the last 30 years. Measles? Diptheria? Rubella? No? That's a bit weird. Those used to be pretty common...or maybe that was all a lie too.  Maybe the government told my dad to tell me about how much having german measles sucked, so id get sucked into the vaccine conspiracy.

       I love that you sticky and mod your own thread and then call out other subs as "safe spaces". I also love the shotgun technique of link posting. 100 links, 5 minutes to read each, 15 to fact check with multiple sources, 5 to summarize and respond. Round it up to 50 hours to address each claim made. Not counting the additional links, sprinkled here and there, that would also have to be verified. Only really useful to someone who thinks your claims are credible, because who is going to bother with that? Well played indeed. You literally can't argue against it. Again, well done. And stickied as well? Have a well deserved upvote.

       Disaster seems like a bit of a stretch, seeing as nobody has polio anymore. Again, id draw attention to the lack of people with polio. No, im not going to go through and fact check 50 other false claims. Your main claims seem to be that live polio vaccine gives people polio-it definitly can, thats why they are switching to the inactive vaccine to finally eliminate it. Live vaccine is cheap and easy to administer. Seems to have worked pretty well, considering polio is just about eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your other point seems to be that meningitis is actually polio. It's just not. Transmission is different, symptoms are different, disease process is different, patient outcomes are different. And we can actually see stuff under microscopes, meaning that this conspiracy extends to everyone with a microscope.  But why let that stand in the way. Im sure you have another link avalanche to "prove" your point.
      </p>

       I used to care if people immunized their kids. I care less now. You do you. More personal freedom, i say. You want to ride a motorcycle on the interstate with your kid on the back with no helmet, why is that my business? I mean, i'll make fun of you, because i think your behaviour is reckless and ill considered. But im sure as hell not going to stop you. The problem with most vaccines is they dont last as long as we thought. A blood titer and a booster every once and a while fix the problem of unvaccinated people adequately. Your risk taking behavior is fully none of my concern.

        seeing as nobody has polio anymore

      <p>
       Tell that to the 10s of thousands of cases of "non-acute flaccid paralysis" that the polio vaccine recently caused in India.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1950's, this polio vaccine-caused paralysis would have been classified as, you guessed it, polio!
      </p>
      <p>
       When the vaccine was
       <em>
        clearly
       </em>
       making things worse, they reclassified polio to require a much narrower definition, effectively "eliminating" polio, when in reality paralysis cases were called something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, read the section on polio in my first Skeptic's Guide...it's been scientifically determined that elimination of the polio virus is
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        considering polio is just about eliminated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Polio can never be eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please read my section on polio.

       So dont get vaccines. I really dont care anymore. I mean, if someone is reading this and is on the fence about getting their kid vaccinated, id encourage them to actually check some of your claims, many of which are completely false...but again, do what you want. You claim to care about how there cant be a discussion about vaccine safety, and then you write a screed railing against every vaccine and pushing outright lies about their effects. Its comical. The most obvious evidence being people dont get these diseases any more, in spite of your ridiculous claims that they actually do. If thats not enough for people, nothing i can say will change their mind.

       The fact that you are using only 2 books as the basis for a very wide array of claims regarding a medical issue, on which you are not an expert, is an example in my mind of malfeasance considering this could cost lives. You have not at any stage offered a counter point to your claims and it comes off as intellectually disingenuous. Please restructure your OP to fairly represent both sides of the argument as it is too difficult for somebody to actually debunk each of your claims due to the fact it would take such a long time.

       I usually appreciate this sub for its alternative opinions but as with many conspiracy theories the arguments are suffering from overreach. Had you limited your hypothesis to "are certain vaccines unnecessary and is there an international cabal pushing these in an effort to line their pockets" i would've been right there with you. Instead you are promoting what in my understanding is medical misinformation, which i consider to be something very wrong. I hope people wouldn't look for medical advice on a conspiracy forum, however when people are looking for alternative theories to support their biases... well they might just find themselves here looking at the 'specially designated' thread at the top of the page.

       If you knew anything about polio you'd realize that about 1 in 100,000 people will show any symptoms at all(a cold or flu) and the vast majority of people recover in a few days. I'm pretty sure we've all been infected with polio not that'd you'd notice, or know, for the fact that it can only be detected with a spinal tap.

       I think there is an important distinction between 1 in 100 000 (your claim) and a bit more than 1 in 4 (everybody else). What im saying is, and i think you just demonstrated this really well, your initial claim was a totally made up number and the actual number is really easy to find. My question was where did you come up with that number? Did you just make it up, or did you read it and not check it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Good example of how virtually every claim here will fall apart under any kind of scrutiny, though. Cheers.

       Thats not what you said. You said 1 in 100k show symptoms of the disease. No mention of rate, and if thats what you actually meant its really poorly worded. 
I'll play though. Rate over how much time? Annually? Lifetime? Its not a rate if you dont include a time, its just a bullshit number you made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your number is bullshit anyway. 1949 there were 42000 cases in the us, pop 149 000 000. 1 in 3500 got sick that year. Thing is, its localized, so spreading it out really minimizes the risk. In 1916, 2000 people died from polio in new york city alone.

       It killed everyone that was susceptible. It still kills people. And its a totally different disease than polio, which is human to human transmission via fecal/oral route. Shit water, basically. The claim was that improved sanitation eliminated polio, and the obvious reality is that there are lots of places in the world with shit contaminated water that should be polio infested, but arent. Can you explain that? Try to stay on topic.

       Jobs only died after he was convinced to have some chemo and radiotherapy, before that he lived many years more than what he would have with conventional.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you posted the sound bite shows you have no clue about this topic, you must imagine that chemo and radiotherapy are curing every cancer, the reality is they poison the body, even if you survive you will have permanent damage and the treatments will make secondaries likely.  You must have never observed all the celebrities in the news who get cancer, then chemo and then die.

       All diseases are cell-damage that we give specific names to. But the term "disease" is a strange one. It doesn't make much sense to refer to symptoms of cell-damage as a fragmented term.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically you look at what causes cell-damage. The answer lies in chemistry: acidosis and alkalosis. Your body needs both, but too much acidosis and your lymph system, kidneys, adrenals, pituitary glands and liver start to fail. Your body gets too acidic and can't get rid of the toxins? Cell damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       We give these varying degrees of cell damage names like diabetes and cancer. But we never look at what root cause of the problems are.

       The answer is really, really simple. Just get rid of what causes the acidosis. That way you allow the 100 trillion cells in your body to resume what they do best: pooping and eating. Without flooding the interstitial cells with acids, your body actually functions properly and gets rid of damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can even revert genetic weaknesses with life-style changes. Babies were never supposed to be born with tumors, toddlers were never supposed to wear glasses. Something's up here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept I'm playing with is that we are a tropical species. As such, we were never supposed to eat dead animals, nor drink their milk. Sure, you can survive off it. Depending on how strong your constitution and current health, you can do quite well. But once you're sick, you have to detox. Get rid of the toxins in interstitial cells so your 100 trillions bone-cells, muscle-cells and brain-cells can resume functioning optimally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all acidosis, alkalosis and how this relates to the health of your lymph system. This is essentially the sewage system of your body. That's how you get rid of acids and toxins. Kidneys too. For a lot of people, these systems are quite clogged up. Get too clogged up? Get stuff like depression. Body can't get rid of heavy metals? Get Alzheimer's. Can't get rid of systemic inflammation / acidosis? Get arthrititis. Makes sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything else in the universe is cause and effect. If you wake up to find your car keyed, you don't say: "Oh well, that's probably because the car was getting older. Old cars often have scratches." No, you say: who's the fucker that keyed my car? Except when it comes to illness, you are the fucker who keyed your own body. But people in general are not ready for this level of self-accountability, people love pills that drown out the symptoms.

       A lot of illnesses can be avoided by healthy living, I agree. But you have people that live a clean life and still get cancer, Or kids that get some stupid illness and it kills them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have people in countries that reject vaccines because they think the UN are trying to poison them but when was the last time you knew of someone dying of rubella or measles? Or all those people suffering from polio?

       I've read a lot of stuff on polio. Is it true? I don't know. But... my two cents is that this explanation is plausible: polio is caused by highly unsanitational circumstances and malnutrition.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all post world war 2, so it makes sense. We also saw polio dissappear in other countries where they didn't have the vaccins. Yet all they did was change nutrition and sanitation circumstances. So how do you explain that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, no proof. But organisations like the UN, the WHO, the CDC and the FDA give me the absolute creeps. I've heard them openly say they prefer the world's population to go into the 500 millions, not the 7 billions. So... Yeah, take it with a grain of salt, but I've seen some weird claims come from these organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I live in a country with a for-profit healthcare system and it severly fucked me up thankyouverymuch :-)
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't know which people lead a 100% clean life and get cancer. Can you name these people? I'm not trying to be a dick per se, but almost everyone I know thinks they live healthily. But they don't, not by my current standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also kids getting ilnesses is horrific. But I can definitely see a cause-and-effect relationship being plausible. Children get their lymph system from their mothers. Genetic weaknesses being hereditary sounds plausible to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also vaccins often contain thimerosol and other heavy metals. We already know that amalgam in teeth can cause psychosis, schizofrenia and levels of depression and madness previously thought infathomable. And we've know this stuff since the mad hatters...
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, even as close as 40 years ago, doctors told pregnant women they could smoke up to 10 cigarettes a day. You could say my "trust" in allopathic medicine, when it comes to chronic ilnesses, has essentially become zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, not evidence, but I've put hundreds of hours of personal research into health. Most of what I've come to accept as true is based on evidence and logic. Or at least on results.

       I am not saying leukemia won't kill you, nor that it isn't a nasty thing. I'm saying the label of "cancer" is not accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got my information on illnesses, like cancer, from hundreds of hours of my own research. Some reading papers, mostly hundreds of hours of lectures from Naturopaths who have a track record of keeping their patients alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, look. It worked for you. That's good, great. Glad to have you alive. But there is absolutely zero chance you'll ever see me trust an MD over a highly qualified and reliable ND (though there are only a handful of those in the entire world). Because I have some life experience when it comes to health myself. You may think this knowledge was airdropped to me. You have no idea and I don't want to go deep into that with highly skeptical individuals.

       I got my information from having had cancer and spending the next 3 and a half years reading studies, papers, watching 100’s of hours of lectures and debates and a huge amount of reading up on not just my form of cancer but many others. Social media, someone watching a few videos and reads a few articles and they think they know better than professionals that dedicate their lives to it. I certainly don’t but from your comments you actually know less than me. Not sceptical, but a lucky and educated enough survivor. I rely on professionals and specialists in the field for my information

       Look, what this entire conversation will boil down to is this: allopaths try to control the body, naturopaths try to give the body what it needs to heal itself. So if you're not someone who believes in the "God-force", free markets, free will, and that there are people out there who are, for lack of a better term, "evil", I just don't see the point in continueing this conversation. Because your mind needs to truly understand that "trust" in others will get you fucked and killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Robert Morse, Peter Glidden and Joel Wallach (all on YouTube) can't provide enough proof through clinically verified, physics and chemistry based proofs, my personal argumentation doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The td;dr of all disease and cancer is: you cause cell damage to yourself through acidosis / inflammation. Because you're a tropical species that should only eat fruit. Yet you eat bread, rice, dead animals, heat your meals in radiation chambers (microwave ovens), sit in front of acid forming computer screens, treat your cancer with acid chemotherapy (acids on acids...). So basically your entire life is a lie. All of it. Your entire belief system, everything you believe. It's all bullshit. So yeah, from my experience, maybe 3% of all people have the ability to accept this. Because it means leaving your culture behind. That means never talking to your "friends" again, cutting off ties with family.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the fuck does anyone do that? They can't. You need money to survive. So you also need the ability to get money that isn't dirty. Which is impossible. Except through Bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, you can think I know less than you. But you're only using your thinking mind. That limits you. It's useful only for immediate survival, not for big-picture reasoning and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next time you speak to your oncologist, ask him these ten questions. They're all quite reasonable. I can almost guarantee he will kick you out of his office:

       Look mate I already stated there were external factors that can increase the risk in some cancers and the percentage of cancers that can be reduced/prevented (I provided the links). I have been clear for 3 years so no I am not looking at it from someone in stage 4/5 and taking stuff at face value because my life is dependent on it. I am going by all available evidence available from professionals and researchers in that field (including a sister that was a long term oncology nurse) that I have been studying since getting the all clear. The simple fact is there is still a huge amount we don’t know yet (yet you do?) also some cancers can not be treated through chemo/radio. There’s over 200 cancers all with loads of varying degrees taking into account the stage/persons makeup/cancer with millions of variables.

       Mutations can happen by chance when a cell is dividing. They can also be caused by the processes of life inside the cell. Or by things coming from outside the body, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke. And some people can inherit faults in particular genes that make them more likely to develop a cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some genes get damaged every day and cells are very good at repairing them. But over time, the damage may build up. And once cells start growing too fast, they are more likely to pick up further mutations and less likely to be able to repair the damaged genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the word  “Chance”?

       Face facts mate sometimes it’s just bad luck in some cases. “Not” all.

       Please elaborate on this “only using your thinking mind comment”. You completely lost me there. Throw something nonsensical in there and beat me down with some stupid?.... Am I to believe someone on a conspiracy forum that watches the odd YouTube video and reads a little bit on the tinterweb or someone that save lives or dedicates their life’s work to understanding the disease?.

       This the same Dr Morse that runs Dr Morse’s herbal health club store online?. Ok you win. Those links I provided from all the leading cancer charities were so wrong. I will take my information from a charlatan trying to sell me placebos. You are a wally and doubly so considering you think I should take what he says on a YouTube video to sell you stuff from his online store over all of the links I provided. Again you have provided nothing beyond YouTube videos from some dubious sources. I am outta here

       The best place people can start learning about vaccines is buying the book Dr. Suzanne Humphries and Roman Bystrianak wrote called Dissolving Illusions. It provides a foundation for understanding, and not just a bunch of links (while they are all helpful, it’s hard to convince someone that has a dogmatic approach towards vaccinations to fully understand the other side of this perpetual argument with links that are a lot of times impossible to understand without proper training). The great thing about this book are the references provided. It’s a treasure chest of history and research that’s been buried for over 100 years.

       I get it, only Pharmaceutical patented products can possibly be good for us and only Pharma paid off doctors can ever know the truth about true health.  Healthy diet is useless, not smoking is useless, vitamins useless, exercise a waste of time, only vaccines can save us.  We all need to listen to Big Pharma Vaccine Millionaire Paul 'Profit' Offit on why it is safe to receive 10,000 vaccines on one sitting.

       Following your logic we should all go and ask McDonald's for advice about a healthy diet.

       What rubbish are you talking about. Of course there are benefits to those things in many areas of health nobody denies that. I'm saying evidence based medical science, carried out by people who have spent their life studying and researching it is more trustworthy.
      </p>

       If you want to believe every researcher in all these fields of medical science in the whole world in history is lying and likes to intentionally hurt patients because they have been paid off then go ahead.

       I'm pointing out her credentials and lack of experience in the relevant field which is pretty important when discussing scientific papers and studies. Same story with the other loon you posted Neil Z. Miller. A medical research journalist with a degree in psychology. They publish articles to junk medical journals that will accept anything, misrepresent data, use bad studies that have already been rebutted by scientists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm happy enough believing all physicians, epidemiologists and immunologists in the world of the last few decades who spent their lives studying these fields are not all liars and want to intentionally harm their patents over those two quacks.

       Haha no it has not. It is complete and utter nonsense. There is no possible mechanism for the claims of homeopathy to work. You can't take one molecule of something and dilute it billions and billions of times and have any of the solution be anything other than water. If you read actual scientific literature on it, it's no better than placebo.

       The mod team voted to have this stickied. We're trying to encourage more OC from the community, and hopefully the more OC that gets stickied, the more folks will be encouraged to create OC.

       Which ones? Let's discuss that! I've been working on this post off and on for about a year. Any studies that have been "discredited or retracted" have happened since then...can you link the ones you're referring to so I can update my post?

       I use that for my OC...it helps to have a place to work/edit larger posts with tons of links first before I share it in its completed form on a larger sub like

       In this instance, the wording was poor, and I apologize. I've changed it to reflect the fact that the study determined that the flu vaccine was efficacious, but that more studies are urgently needed before making the vaccination of children a public health policy.

       If a mod stickied a post about how the "man" doesn't want you to drink Bleach because they don't want you to know the secret, would you agree that it's dangerous misinformation that maybe a child could read and do something very bad? People should always consult with their doctor before making any medical decision and this mod should be removed.

       Funny how drinking bleach is putting toxic chemicals in your body and you're against it, and getting vaccines is also putting toxic chemicals in your body and you're for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very interesting analogy.

       Thimerosal has yet to be proven harmful after many studies and was removed from most vaccines years ago. Early studies used methylmercury as a guideline for ethylmercury (found in Thimerosal) toxicity which was later proven not to be comparable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Formaldehyde is a carcinogen with the highest risk being inhalation or high and prolonged levels of exposure. It's also naturally occuring in the body and found in many fruits and vegetables we eat on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       2-Phenoxyethanol is a common preservative found in many cosmetics and baby care products that is not toxic at the low levels used in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aluminum is found in many foods and water in low levels. It's also in breast milk in higher levels than vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all the big scary words commonly used by anti-vax peddlers to make people afraid to put these 'dangerous toxins' in their children.

They recommend further research focused specifically on the biotransformation of thimerosal and its neurotoxic potential.

       So unknown, linked (but not proven causation) with microglia (but not necessarily autism...just an effect some autistic children have), and recommended more research 12 years ago. Oh, and 0% contagious.

       Versus influenza: 5 million cases per year with up to 600k of those resulting in death. Incredibly contagious.

       Stating the purpose of Mercury in the vaccine, i.e. as preservative, does not in anyway prove it is safe.  And just because Big Pharma don't do research to see if Mercury, Aluminum etc are safe, and so hence don't find any bad evidence through not looking, still does not mean that injecting Mercury and Aluminum is safe.

       Actually this was the very first "conspiracy theory" that opened my eyes years ago. This video was my red pill. I was not a supporter of vaccines due to knowing someone with a vaccine injured child, but I had no idea it was connected to a global agenda. I didn't even know there was a global agenda

       First, you can ask for the flu shot without thimerosal, which is available. Second, since thimerosal isn't in vaccines like MMR, hep-b, and all other recommended childhood vaccines, what's the theory then? What's the problem with those vaccines, which do in fact immunize children?

       Yes i recommend watching the video to the end. It's long and slightly dated but this guy goes way down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       At 30 min he begins to talk about the conflict of interest between regulators and industry, and financial ties between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly after that he begins to explore intent. By 45 min deeper.... Rockefeller, Kissinger, Gates, World Health Organization....
      </p>
      <p>
       At the one hour point he really dives down the rabbit hole even more. I'll let you decide. Make some popcorn to go with the red pill. It's a video worth watching imo

       But it still doesn't answer my question about MMR, hep, chickenpox, etc.  They no longer contain thimerosal , so what is the current theory on them?  Why would they be bad, considering that they do vaccinate children against potentially deadly diseases.

       Depending on which state you're in, you might be able to get a Personal Belief Exemption.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in California, you're gonna have a harder time. You'll need a Medical Exemption from a doctor, which is typically only given out if there's a solid medical reason, like if your son's immune system is already compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may find a sympathetic doctor, but I wouldn't bet on it. People have lost medical licenses over issuing out fraudulent medical exemptions.

       you should probably read some medical journals and the conclusions drawn by medical professionals rather than this thread, which the OP said it mostly based off 2 books, one written by a homeopath. Homeopathy is effective as a form of medicine in the same way a placebo is considered a form of medicine.

       You get him vaccinated. Trust me, if he's over age three he's not going to magically get autism -- to the best of my knowledge, there's never been a case of someone beginning to show autistic symptoms past that age. And it could save his life.

       Your script is well out of date, we're already at a stage where a CDC whistleblower has confirmed that the studies showing vaccines caused autism were destroyed as part of one of the biggest cover-ups.  The former head of the NIH said that the necessary studies to see if vaccines cause autism have not yet been performed, she says the studies are required.  Even vaccine millionaire patent holder Paul 'Profit' Offit admitted to other vaccine shills (on video) that it is not know with MMR causes autism, but he recommended they lie about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also we are not discussing the whole Autistic spectrum, just the part of it linked with vaccines, not Asperger etc,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_dgh4UJ9L4">
        just when children regress after their vaccines into something far more serious than Aspergers
       </a>
       after a vaccine, and even worse than Down Syndrome.

       Out of everything in this sub, this is the one topic I strongly disagree with. You are literally born with autism. You don't develop it, you can't catch it; it's all in your brain chemicals and signals. Not everything is a conspiracy.

       Of the pregnant women who took Thalidomide, not everyone one of their babies had birth defects, a % of them do.  There are many factors at play, but since they refuse to do the necessary research we will never know exactly which factors are involved when a child goes Autistic after a vaccine.  Known factors including a number of different vaccines, Tylenol (University of California found it was those who were given Tylenol at the time of MMR who were most likely to go Autistic) and mitochondrial disorders as

       Yes you should always be wary of who is funding and carrying out these kinds of studies. Including studies by anti-vax foundations. What's more helpful is checking the impact of journals they are posted to to see if they are reputable and not predatory or have one of the main scientists on their board. Checking their expertise is important too (like ophthalmologists doing vaccine research).
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing about scientific studies though is that you can go and look at them yourself and they get peer-reviewed. So even if you don't like the source, if their methodology is sound with the results and conclusions based on the evidence shown then it's still good reliable science.
      </p>

       This is rarely the case with anti-vax studies.

       The so-called anti-vax side are people who have given up lucrative careers to get the truth out, the industry destroys people as soon as they dare find out the harm of a vaccine.  The money is in the pro-vaxx side, so that's why it's full of shills and weak characters, whereas the vaccine safety side is full of decent human beings trying to get the truth out, save lives and protect health.

        CONCLUSIONS: There is no increased risk of postvaccination seizure in infants regardless of timing of vaccination. In year 2, delaying MMR vaccine past 15 months of age results in a higher risk of seizures. The strength of the association is doubled with MMRV vaccine. These findings suggest that on-time vaccination is as safe with regard to seizures as delayed vaccination in the first year of life, and that delayed vaccination in the second year of life is associated with more postvaccination seizures than on-time vaccination.

       That has literally nothing to do with the comment you are addressing. Autism itself has absolutely nothing to do with seizures, there needs to be comorbid epilepsy or some other similar independently seizure causing condition in order for them to occur.

shown to impair both prenatal and postnatal brain
development in humans and experimental animals."

      <p>
       "The risks from current childhood vaccination
schedules are thus twofold. First, a single vaccine
may disrupt the delicate balance of immune mediators
required for normal brain development
and thus compromise neurodevelopmental programs.
Second, such multiple vaccinations are
routinely administered simultaneously (Table 2),
thus magnifying the inflammatory response
which, although being essential for linking the
innate and adaptive immune responses, is also
responsible for adjuvant’s immunotoxic effects.4
The repetitive taxing of the immune system by
high doses of Al adjuvants may also cause a
state of immune hyperactivity, a known risk for
autoimmune diseases."

       You think food and drink we consume goes in one hole and out the other without anything getting absorbed into the bloodstream? Taking tablets as medication does nothing then? Injecting means you can get the necessary higher, more controlled amounts into the bloodstream faster. Again it's all about the dose.

       Why is that relevant to this discussion on whether it's safe to inject?  Air is common too, it's safe to breathe, but it's not safe to inject as it can cause embolisms which cause serious harm.

       In theory, you are absolutely right.  How do we explain the many cases I have seen in documentaries, and various clips where parents testify the kids have normal language and cognitive capabilities, and a few hours after innoculation, their child regresses and get diagnosed with autism?

       You're right, it's great that there are many scientists doing real studies showing that there is no link between vaccines and Autism so we can quell the notion that they do.

       Told by who? There is no World Scientist Boss that tells all of them what to do. There are thousands of studies over decades on their effects. Do yourself a favour and do a little research outside of the anti-vax bubble, how scientific studies and peer review journals work.   You and your bullshit peddling is leading to real harm.

       The kinda gloss over that fact like its somehow inconvenient. The claim to have "studies" but are quick to discount the massive number of ones that show no link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also they COMPLETELY GET WRONG WHAT A STUDY DOES:
      </p>
      <p>
       It cannot prove or  disprove anything absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they do is they show linkages between actions and results with an according level of confidence in the hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       That why when you see polls, they have a disclaimer on them "The results are accurate to +/- 3.2% 19 times out of 20. That is the accuracy of the number they are trying to estimate using their methods and sample size.

       Even if this was true, which I personally doubt it is:
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain epigenetics. Explain how you, as a baby, got your lymph system from your mother.

       And explain how the heavy metals in her body, as a result from her having received vaccines, are unable to affect the health of the baby growing inside her. Because it makes a lot of sense to me that if the mother is made less strong, the baby in the womb is made less strong.

       Appeal to authority is how we got into this mess as a species, so semantics be damned. Bottom line is don't inject heavy metals into children, I don't need 4 years of memorisation to realize that and neither do you.

       I was listening to this podcast, The higher side chats (Highly recommend btw), and the topic was about how "evil" the whole birthing process is. Something that I would like to read up on that they mentioned was how ultrasounds and sonograms are terrible for the fetus. The guest basically stated that not long ago, autism and common developmental diseases were not... Common.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason being agenda 21 and all that. 
hours. 
I'm not sure if that's true. But at this point, occam's razor is brittle. It's hard to ignore the truth about how low men's testosterone levels are. I'm sure 95% is based on what men eat. However, I think some stats need to be done comparing western countries with other developed countries.

       That is all. I trust the scientists who went to school for 5-8+ yrs. I trust their research and findings. Did those people have a phd in scienece, or engineering. And the concept of "evil", in subject.

       Wrong.  The no. 2 predictor of autism is early childhood brain injury.  Autism definitely has a genetic component, though, certain children are genetically predisposed to have hyper-immune reactions to certain antigen proteins, similar to how certain children have hyper-immune reactions to peanuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Autism is, essentially, brain damage.  It can begin pre or postnatally.

       I noticed that too. Pro-vaxxers are very hostile, not even allowing for any questioning of vaccines, whether some may be harmful or if the schedule of vaccines for babies is too much in a relatively short time for their immune systems to handle. Why do they feel so threatened by people questioning? We're supposed to believe the pharmaceutical companies have our best interests at heart and don't care about the massive profits from pushing their vaccines onto the public.

        Autism has worse outcomes than Down Syndrome, most pregnant women would choose to abort if their unborn child had Downs Syndrome. Autism is a life sentence for the parents, it most cases they would have preferred their child to die from the vaccine than be left mentally retarded, screaming, banging their head against a wall.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay, autism runs in my family: I have three cousins with the syndrome, ranging from high-funcitoning Asperger's to low-functioning ASD. And I guarantee you
       <em>
        none
       </em>
       of my aunts and uncles would rather their child be dead right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, my cousins have trouble with things that you and I find easy, from emotional regulation to social interactions. But that doesn't mean they aren't wonderful, valid human beings whose lives are just as worth living as yours and mine. One of them currently studying to be a computer programmer. Another lives in a group home, but he's the sweetest man you'll ever meet and lightens up all our family gatherings. I would cry my eyes out if anything happened to any of them. And you just wished death on them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, get out there and actually meet someone with autism (or Asperger's or ASD -- they're all different names for the same disorder). Look past the superficial differences, and you'll soon realize they're just people, who want to live fulfilling lives and be loved, same as anyone else.

       To say that autism "runs in your family" may be missing the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if your genetics simply have weakness within in them. A weakness that only gets triggered when heavy metals are introduced into your genetic make-up. Perhaps certain glands within your lymph system are not as strong as with others. Perhaps your kidneys are genetically weaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps none of these weaknesses would have triggered autism or Asperger's had these people never received vaccines that contain formaldehyde, aluminium and other substances that have no place in the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a cousin who is "on the spectrum." His uncle is a structural engineer, our grand-father is a teacher. I don't have any issues myself. Yet the cousin, I assume, got a lot of vaccines as the uncle is a firm believer in modern medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course we don't want people to go or die. But it is wise to essentially "zoom out" of your situation. Look at others and look at history. I am personally seeing many more people develop systems that simply were not around a few decades ago. So something is going on. And perhaps genetic constitution is a key factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least all of this makes a lot of sense to me. I'm a big fan of the wholistic approach of looking at the body and, when necessary, using wholistic methods of healing.

       Metals that are used in vaccines are already commonly ingested through other sources and our bodies are well equipped to deal with them at the levels present.

       What sort of magic do you think happens with an intramuscular injection? Where do you think it ends up? Same place as when you ingest, into the bloodstream and then ends up mostly in the kidney, then liver and spleen. Injection means a slightly higher amount dependant on the dose. The trash youtube video you linked just says it's excreted fairly rapidly as if it just goes in your mouth then our your arse with zero absorption.

       You use the term "vaccine-induced regressive autism" as if it's some officially-recognized medical diagnosis when it's just something made up by parents who face the adversity of a child with autism and desperately seek an answer as to why they were put in that situation.

       All medical terms were at one point "made up."

      <p>
       Naming an 'illness' is essentially collecting a set of symptoms and giving it a name.
      </p>
      <p>
       To play Devil's advocate: even if it one day turns out that there is no such thing as vaccine-induced regressive autism, which I personally doubt, it will still have been useful to have named the concept. If only just just for purposes of debunking and to accurately hypothesise the potential cause.

       Big Pharma decide what's 'officially recognized', that's all about profits and cover-ups.  They have a history of renaming Polio when it was convenient, calling things Cancer which aren't Cancer and now we see they through a serious vaccine injury in with all of the rest of the Autism, despite it being distinctive from the other types.  This is how they hide it i.e "well Autism was here already so nothing new", but it's regressive Autism and quite different from the other types.  Parents aren't making up stories, as the CDC whistleblower has admitted this is a cover up, he was there and witnessed the destruction of evidence.

       The problem is that these people are totally willing to ignore the benefits of vaccines in favour of the rare, yet sometimes awful drawbacks that can come with them. Certainly, in the case of the influenza vaccine, questions need to be asked.

       It's not just the flu. You need to weigh risk v reward. Why introduce aluminum into your child's immune system and brain at 1 day old for HepB? You shouldn't be able to have custody of a child if they're at risk of contracting HepB. That's just one example

       You see wut I did thur. Both your and my claim above may be correct, but they are barbaric nonetheless. You inject your children with live and dead strains of virusses. Are you fucking insane?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even joking, vaccines are barbaric and they don't do shit. Having a healthy body and living healthily got rid of all of the shit you listed. Same with "mental illness." Depression isn't a Prozac-deficiency and it's about time your criminal mindset realised it.

       Apparently it’s better to die from the plague or a car accident than to potentially develop autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t understand it. I’m disabled, have bad reactions to vaccines because I’m immune compromised. I still encourage people to get vaccines. It’s the safer option than allowing millions to die from horrible, untreatable, often fatal illnesses.
      </p>

       My baby sister is on the spectrum. Yes, helping raise her was pretty difficult at times. But I would
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       do it ten times over if it meant she was alive. The fact that these people would rather risk kids dying than them be autistic is fucking horrific to me.

       It's been shown that herd immunity is a myth.  Many baby boomers didn't return to get boosters that are required to be immune to the disease or virus and no major outbreaks occurred.

       Which shows that you haven't looked at the data. Vaccines weren't introduced until the bulk of the deaths had been solved for already.

       ahhh but you only look at deaths! That is an important statistic without question, but instead lets look at the total impact of the infection. an estimate
       <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html">
        three to four million were infected each year
       </a>
       , along with approx 48,000 hospitalized (thats a bit of an excess strain on our health system) and an approximately 4,000 suffered from encephalitis each year caused by measles, which could lead to a variety of problems including brain damage. Sure, we were better at treating patients with measles, but why not just do our best to eliminate it entirely through vaccines!!

       your initial comment was regarding death as well. You said "...die to easily preventable disease". So now are you agreeing that vaccines aren't the major factor when it comes to saving lives?

       This is the same pill popping mentality that goes along with giving kids Ritalin or depressed people Prozac. All drugs have side effects, so you could be trading 3 days of being sick in bed for a lifelong autoimmune disease.

       This won't add anything, but I just wanted to say how annoyed I was about a student in my statistics class.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were talking about biases and correlation doesn't always mean causation... My professor brought up autism and vaccines as an example. It wasn't like she picked a side, just mentioned it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This student asks "did it show if it was, like, uneducated people that believed this? Like autism?... Really, come on!" and she did an annoying laugh like you have to be the dumbest to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like she couldn't see why someone would believe it once but. She couldn't understand from someone else's point of view. I hate that people are getting like this.

       OP's post is full of incredibly intellectually dishonest misinformation. There are certainly many valid complaints to be made about the American health care system and pharmaceutical industry. But the basic functioning of vaccines is very well understood by modern science. The cherry-picked facts from these articles pale in comparison to the literally thousands of peer-reviewed studies demonstrating the overall safety of vaccines. Mild reactions to various vaccines are fairly common, but serious reactions are EXTREMELY rare, typically on the order of 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000. Meanwhile the effects of many of these diseases can be extremely serious if not fatal, especially in children who don't have developed immune systems like adults. It is incredibly irresponsible to not get your kids their basic vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I absolutely believe in small groups of of wealthy elites and government insiders carrying out criminal conspiracies. But tens of thousands of scientists and doctors from all around the world are not in on a conspiracy to trick you into thinking you should get vaccinated.

       CDC is a very poor source to use, whistleblowers have exposed them for destroying studies showing the danger of vaccines.  They are an industry captured regulator.  I would strongly recommend you to look what the independent researchers are saying rather than relying on studies with conflict of interest involved.

       The CDC receives industry funding.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Despite the agency’s disclaimer, the CDC does receive millions of dollars in industry gifts and funding, both directly and indirectly, and several recent CDC actions and recommendations have raised questions about the science it cites, the clinical guidelines it promotes, and the money it is taking."
      </p>
      <p>
       Marcia Angell, former editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, told The BMJ, “The CDC has enormous credibility among physicians, in no small part because the agency is generally thought to be free of industry bias. Financial dealings with biopharmaceutical companies threaten that reputation.”2

       Excellent post!

      <p>
       Amazing how they simply drop sick people from a safety trial to whitewash the results:-

      <p>
       <strong>
        Vaccine Trial Side Effect 1
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       One, a web developer in his 20s, felt ill after receiving just one dose.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I experienced tiredness and ringing in my ears,” said the web developer, who reported the feelings along with “disequilibrium and slurred speech” continue to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Vaccine Trial Side Effect 2
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another participant, a Colorado woman in her 40s, said she told Halford she experienced flu-like aches and pains and tingling and numbness soon after the second shot. The symptoms were followed by an “excruciating” 30-day outbreak of herpes.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I have new symptoms every day,” that woman later wrote Halford in an email exchange provided to KHN. “This is terrifying.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So what do the researchers do?  Remove them from the study to whitewash the whole thing, making the vaccine appear perfectly safe
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Halford had told participants he would follow up on their reactions to the vaccine for a year, according to the consent form. But he
       <strong>
        stopped sending questionnaires
       </strong>
       to the two participants who said they had been
       <strong>
        dropped from the trial.

       I enjoy conspiracy theories as much as the next guy, but what are you suggesting? That we not vaccinate and roll back a 100 years to where we basically had to have 5 to 10 kids and roll the dice hoping that 1 or 2 would live to get married and have their own children, probably at 15 or 16 so they can start having enough kids to start the process again?

       Vaccines have to be evidence-based, not assumption-based, they need to be about actual science, and until that science begins then in many cases it's likely vaccines are causing far more harm than good.

       The viruses we are vaccinating against and mild and not life threatening to healthy people in the first world.  They are nothing to be afraid off, instead of afraid of malnutrition and poor sanitation, that was the reason for the many deaths in the past.

       Far more harm than good? But if a stretch, I have a daughter, with another on the way. Me and my partner did talk about vaccinations and we both don’t just blindly trust the pharmaceutical community, but risking my child’s life in the off chance she may develop a syndrome as well as a possible harbinger of death for other kids seems extreme. Unvaccinated kids our all other kids at risk, and if something happened to my kids because of it, id probably gut the bastards. There is reason that even the most forward thinking pediatricians and child care services, and schools won’t take unvaccinated kids. While there may be side effects and chances of developmental issues, the consequences of forgoing these things are too risky. Have someone come up with a better solution, but until then don’t try to scare new parents into making poor decisions.

       You are over estimating the danger of mild short term childhood viruses and under estimating the risk of vaccines causing long term severe disability.  You also have fallen for the herd immunity propaganda,  not realizing that vaccines cause you to shed the virus for two weeks, so unless you quarantined yourself after a vaccine you will be putting immunocompromised at risk.
      </p>

       As you can see, the logic of your argument does not hold up, you have taken pharma marketing and fearmongering at facevalue without looking up the facts.

       Most people with Polio wouldn’t even get symptoms, no biggie, some would get flu like symptoms no biggie.  It is a disease of poor sanitation, not something to vaccinate against.  In fact post of what we though was polio was actually people getting poisoned by pesticides such as DDT.  The vaccine was found to be cancer causing, so to be avoided.
      </p>

       As for Diphtheria it is not a first world problem, more something that would crop up in a war zone.

       Also, the risk of dying from polio is very high, and without vaccines being so prevalent in modern society, we would still have kids dying left and right. Which is my point, so the very very very small chance your kid may develop Down syndrome, or whatever unscientifically backed theory you guys are thumping around now, against a giant chance of almost ensured death. I’ll take the vaccine.

       You have been misinformed, the risk of dying from Polio is very low.  Polio wouldn’t exist in the first world anyway without vaccines, good sanitation protects from it

      <p>
       There is no benefit at all in receiving a Polio vaccine, but that vaccine might give you cancer or induce an autoimmune disease, educated people will avoid it as they do all vaccines

       The "conspiracy" involves conditioning parents to allow the administration of too many vaccines for their infants/toddlers.

       As usual with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , it's asking good questions, but I'm skeptical of the answers. Here's a quote from one of your linked posts:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After the introduction of Hib immunization in children, invasive Hib infections in unimmunized adults also declined, but the overall rate of invasive Hi disease in adults increased.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I checked the paper.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Before introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines, rates of Hib disease in Alaska's indigenous people were among the highest in the world. Vaccination reduced rates dramatically; however, invasive H. influenzae type a (Hia) disease has emerged.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They're stating that the introduction of the vaccine was unarguably beneficial for indigenous Alaskans, not the reverse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Representation of infected, indigenous Hib patients from 1980-1982
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3484505">
        was representative of 51% of the total infected
       </a>
       . Alaskan natives are 16% of the population. Reduction of Hib was dramatic and effective. A study
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16882783">
        cited by the paper you linked
       </a>
       says that "After universal infant vaccination in 1991, H influenzae type b disease among Alaska Native and non-Native children &lt; 5 years of age decreased by 94% and 96%, respectively."  That's a major success.
      </p>
      <p>
       The paper you link spans from 1983 to 2011. The Hib vaccines were introduced in 2002. Type-a emerged a decade later. It is of note that the Hib vaccine reduced the Hib infection rate, so the Hib vaccine was effective, regardless of a new strain showing up on the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my issue here, and maybe you can help. Where in the study does it suggest that the Hib vaccine is a direct cause of the Hia upswing among Alaskans? And if the Hia upswing is a resultant of the Hib vaccine, did the vaccine's benefits outweigh the future challenges presented by type-a flu?

       I have heard this before... But if "Depopulation is a huge issue for them.", why has the worldwide populate only gone up since the advent of vaccinations? Why have childhood mortality rates declined worldwide since the advent of vaccination? If vaccination is a part of the a plan to depopulate the Earth, it doesn't seem to be working.

       I'm not saying the idea of vaccines is bad, I'm saying they have taken this "medical procedure" and are turning it into a soft kill weapon. They work slowly at this global agenda. It's a multi generational plan. Their goal is to reduce the population drastically. You are all being programmed that it is normal to get huge numbers of vaccines. You are not to question it. Just get your jabs. No questions. Line up and vaccinate regularly. They are making it normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will weaken immune systems by overloading them. This also diminishes natural immunity to the wild viruses. It's all preparation for a big viral pandemic that is coming. I also believe that they are going to use them as covert birth control. Sterility will be common someday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead and vaccinate if you want to. Keep an eye on it though and remember what I told you. There will be more and more and more vaccines being forced at you. Maybe you don't need them all? Chicken pox is a good example. Do you really need that vaccine?

       That's the problem, though. Infant mortality rates are way down in 3rd world populaces and populations are up where vaccination programs have been introduced. I'm pretty sure there are some exceptions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, which was hit hard by the AIDs epidemic.

         As to why infant mortality is higher in the USA versus other 1st world countries that vaccinate less, there could be a lot of factors. (And this is could be a fascinating study.) Population density. Homogeneity of population. Percentage of population below the poverty line. General level of health care available across income levels. General awareness of health issues. Diet and exercise levels. Immigration levels. And so on.
Heck, are we sure that all these countries use the same definition of infant mortality? For example: does a still born baby count towards the mortality rate? It may be that some countries manage to prevent more still born children, only to have them die shortly afterwards.

        It's not just the US, if you draw a graph showing which countries give the most vaccines, it's clear that the more a country gives the worse it's infant mortality.  This will be to do with vaccines causing SIDS and many autoimmune diseases and allergies.  Japan found that when they stopped vaccinating under 2's their infant mortality rate jumped up to best in the world, SIDS vanished in the country.  The unfortunate reality is that it is not safe to vaccinating children under the age of 2 as essential detoxifying enzymes are not yet present in the liver, so it any child under the age of 2 is being poisoned in one way or another with vaccines.

       Just to be clear, Japan didn't stop vaccinating under 2's. They made more vaccines voluntary. In fact the Japan Pediatric Society still recommends a complete suite of infant vaccinations.

       I'm talking historically, back in 1975 this was, after too many vaccine deaths they stopped vaccinating under 2's, then infant mortality jumped up for 17th best in the world to the best in the world, first place.  In 1988 it changed, Japan has moved down the list.

       Vaccines in the third world actually do reduce the population, but it's because women don't have so many babies anymore because they know there's a higher chance that they will survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines do definitely help in the third world.. the problem is that independent organizations who tested these vaccines found that the manufacturers were meaningfully putting sterilizing agents into them.

       You have been misled on that, pharma refuse the necessary studies, they play games with statistics and allow people with conflicts of interest to make key decisions.  The CDC has been captured by industry, so they are all part of the same beast.

       Here we see
       <a href="https://patientdanmark.dk/private-forces-to-raise-funds-research-into-aluminium-in-vaccines/">
        experts having to crowdfund for their own vaccine safety research
       </a>
       because Big Pharma continue to refuse to perform the most basic studies of all.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mild reactions to various vaccines are fairly common, but serious reactions are EXTREMELY rare, typically on the order of 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nobody knows that as the studies are never performed, vaccine-induced autoimmune diseases can take months to show symptoms after a vaccine.  No tracking system is in place to find out exactly how much carnage vaccines are causing.

       Not many of them are involved, they just get fed marketing information from the top and have to place trust in it.  The necessary safety studies are never performed so the bad data never reaches them.  It would be like asking a soldier in US Afghan if 9/11 was a false flag, they've been told from their boss that it was and that hence Afghan needs to be attacked, they weren't there when the false flag too place, the same as most doctors are involved in testing vaccines and funding biased studies.

       No they are not but the lisencing boards are and they keep these scientists on a short leash unable to go against the regulations that the board decides not on. In addition the only organizations hiring them are the ones who also agree to these regulations. This includes health insurance that will not reimburse for treatments that contradict the medical board.

       Depending on your HMO doctors often are incentivized to have fully vaccinated patients...cold hard cash in pocket.  They are also not taught about the ingredients, just that they should be given.  "Lately, people opposed to vaccines have been very upset about a recent finding that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan has a Performance Recognition program for provider incentives, including paying $400 to providers for every fully vaccinated two year old in their practice."

       Firsty we would have to be careful about assuming insurance companies know the true purpose of vaccines i.e. to induce profitable disease.  Secondly, if they did know the true reason, we have to keep in mind that their profits are capped as a % of the total healthcare spend, so it would be in their interests to encourage more vaccine induced disease, as it increases the profits they can take

       You have fallen hook line and sinker for the propaganda antiquegeek.  The recently vaccinated shed viruses for 2 weeks post-vaccination, yet we let them walk around shopping malls and in schools.  The unvaccinated don't spontaneously generate viruses out of nowhere to spread around.  Actually studies show that the unvaccinated are far healthier on average than the vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd strongly recommend you do some research before spreading your beliefs on social media, as they could endanger a child if anyone follows your advice.

       The CDC have been asked to perform the study themselves but they refuse, they say it's 'unethical', which is an absurd excuse, they know the study will find out the truth, so instead they use studies where they play games with the data.

       Fortunately good scientists have already been analyzing the data available, this one found that vaccinated children to be over six times more likely to have neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Pilot comparative study on the health of vaccinated and unvaccinated 6- to 12-year-old U.S. children
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "However,  in  a  final  adjusted  model  with  interaction,  vaccination  but  not  preterm  birth  remained  associated  with  NDD,  while  the  interaction  of  preterm  birth and vaccination was associated with a 6.6-fold increased odds of NDD (95% CI: 2.8, 15.5). In conclusion, vaccinated homeschool children were found to have a higher rate of allergies and NDD than unvaccinated homeschool children. While vaccination remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors, preterm birth coupled with vaccination was associated with an apparent synergistic increase in the odds of NDD."

       Vaccines can kill, they also cause Autism.  Measles is a mild virus in the first world, parents used to hold Measles parties to spread the virus, nobody was scared, only Big Pharma want us to live in fear and buy their products.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, vaccine-induced regressive Autism has worse outcomes than Down Syndrome, most pregnant women would choose to abort if their unborn child had Downs Syndrome.  Autism is a life sentence for the parents, it most cases they would have preferred their child to die from the vaccine than be left mentally retarding, screaming, banging their head against a wall.

       many people in the comments have pointed out how the research is actually pretty weak and that no counterpoints are offered in the OP. It comes off as intellectually dishonest to only present 1 side of an argument, specifically one where the body of research suggests the OP is wrong. He even said the majority of his research was only from 2 books.

       The flu kills approximately 260 people per year, the rest die of pneumonia which is usually treatable and shows how ineffective modern medicine can be.

       The flu is not even diagnosed using a test. The doc just makes a guess and reports the death to the cdc. So the 260 number is probably over inflated. I suspect their purpose in selling the ineffective vaccines is to create a population of ailments that will lead to lucrative treatments for them. Just a guess though.

       Thats the SOP because this test produces so many false negatives. They don't want to miss flu cases so they will diagnose flu then follow up  with a more accurate test. Because flu is dangerous. Skipped that part to cherry pick something out of context that "supports" your point, huh? How totally like the rest of this thread. 
Also, because you are pretending not to understand this, let me explain the basic pathology of flu. You get sick from flu, then you get pneumonia. It's like getting a cut, then you get an infection. Most of the time, the infection is what kills you. Sometimes it's just flu, like with spanish flu, but luckily that's not the case most of the time. 
What i'd like to see is a citation for the original claim that flu virus by itself hardly kills anybody. I've noticed you guys seem to like posting fake numbers, and I want to see a credible source for your original claim.

       I do this for a living, this is my field so you are not explaining anything to me but regurgitating your opinion which does not matter. Reported flu deaths are not reported because of a test they are reported because the doc makes a judgement call. This leads to errors in the reported numbers. There is no way to measure how many people die from the flu until they make regulations that require testing of suspected flu deaths that confirm it. Gold standard is biopsy or western blot to confirm the actual bacteria not the antibodies.

       Got an expert over here guys! He does this for a living, we can all go home now!
Joking. Let's pretend for a second that somebody who dies from a flu like illness also tested positive for flu. Which is likely right? They would get a rapid test, or the RT-PCR, or a viral culture positive result for influenza. That person's condition worsens and they die. And you are saying the only way to know anything about how they died is a post mortem test? I mean, yeah, it would be nice to have that information, but at the same time I think we can be confident that they didn't die from a car crash. Are you suggesting a mystery agent? Or just that 99% certain isn't worth anything? I get that, but it's a really thin limb to suggest that these deaths aren't caused by flu.
You guys are the one making the claim, with absolute certainty. I want to see some evidence.

       The thing is they don’t bother testing post Mortem. The diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation. Elderly patients can die fro many things because they have so many different diseases. You are just hell bent on being right. Maybe read your own link and learn a thing a two. There is no reason to jump to a mystery agent, when most elderly take about 7 different medications for about 5-7 different conditions. Blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiac, diabetes, gastric, and pain meds. Respiratory distress can occur for many other conditions besides the flu. Since testing is not needed for the flu and it is unreliable the doctor is making a guess. 
I would love evidence as well, but the lack of evidence is not evidence of proof. Without proper collection techniques the numbers are unreliable. That should concern everyone because we have no way to verify if the numbers reported are accurate and trust is an emotion that has no place in science more so in medical settings. 
FYI: mystery agent? You sound silly, and seem to resort to demeaning labels when your facts don’t support your argument. Tha shows a lack of curiosity and intelligence on your end. You seem more concerned with being right even when you are wrong, not very smart. No one is ever right all the time. In this case try some humility and if you are truly concerned about resolving the problem of the flu then you are going to need to follow facts and not some hidden agenda to push false narratives. Good luck.

       Where does it say that most diagnoses are clinical? There you go again, making yet another false claim that has to be refuted instead of admitting you are posting outright lies. The document says you can diagnose flu clinically during an outbreak inspite of a negative rapid test result. It also says to then follow up with a more accurate test. This is because it is safer be cautious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im looking at my state's numbers right now. They are reporting not just the number of positive tests, but the strain of flu. Did they get that from a clinical diagnosis? The strain of flu? You are so completely full of shit its amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are claiming that people that die after getting a positive flu test didnt die from flu. We arent talking about clinically dignosed cases here. We are talking about people who get a positive test result for flu, and then die. You are saying they what, coincidentally died right after, because diseases are common and old people take a lot of medication? Lol, buddy. People get flu and they die, you cant explain that. That's the extent of your reasoning here. How embarrassing.

       So they only test outpatients for flu? So if somebody gets admitted to hospital with flu like symptoms, they won't test them for flu? In spite of having 3 different ways to confirm a flu infection? Im finding it hard to follow this "logic". Im all out of troll food, so im just going to see myself out.

       Hi, parent of an autistic six year old here. My son is the most honest, caring, and sweet boy I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing, let alone raise. Sure, it’s difficult to raise one child who is neurotypical and one who is not because each has their own unique challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my experience with my son going to therapy and meeting many children with autism, it is often the fear (from a combination of ignorance about autism and the anti-vax movement) that holds parents back from getting their child therapy when their brain is still developing out of denial that their child has it in the first place, causing children to be much lower functioning than they otherwise may have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every child can miss their window of opportunity to learn to socialize and communicate. Children with autism simply learn their own unique ways and need to be given the right tools to succeed while they still can utilize them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not downplaying how difficult it can be to care for someone who refuses to communicate. Before he was diagnosed and he wasn’t yet in therapy, my husband and I were going through hell. However, since he was diagnosed when he had just turned three and we got him into ABA therapy right away, he went from having moderate autism to high functioning and may even test out of the spectrum entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want to help children with autism, stop scaring parents into thinking it’s some horrible disease worse than polio, smallpox, etc. All you’re doing is scaring good willed parents out of doing what is right for their kids.

       Flu doesn't kill many people at all as official statistics of past years show, but then to make people scared of the flu they started labeling all respiratory deaths as Flu, including pneumonia. Back in the 90's it was normal to see 600 to 700 per year die from Flu, a very low number, whereas then they tell us it's tens of thousands, the trick is that they include not just influenza death cases, but also other respiratory, circulatory, cardiac and pulmonary deaths that potentially might have been associated with influenza.

       Below is how the CDC justify artificially inflating their flu deaths, most of which are really pneumonia which is a very common cause of death in very sick people who were already on their way out.  They inflate the deaths to help sell the vaccine.
      </p>

       <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm">
        https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "CDC does not know exactly how many people die from seasonal flu each year."
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Why does CDC estimate deaths associated with seasonal flu?"
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       "CDC feels it is important to convey the full burden of seasonal flu to the public. Seasonal flu is a serious disease that causes illness, hospitalizations, and deaths every year in the United States. CDC estimates of annual influenza-associated deaths in the United States"
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       "What categories does CDC use to estimate flu-associated deaths?
      </p>
      <p>
       CDC uses two categories of underlying cause of death information listed on death certificates: pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) causes and respiratory and circulatory (R&amp;C) causes. CDC uses statistical models with records from these two categories to make estimates of influenza-associated mortality."

       we get to see exactly how many of the deaths were really caused by Influenza
      </p>

       e.g. In 1999 the pneumonia deaths were 62,065 and influenza just 1,665

       Thanks. That seems stupid, in my country this would never happen and is a good example of regulatory capture regarding the cdc. The flu shot has always been a choice though where i am from so i understand why they would choose to push it this way.

       ITT: 1. Think about the children, get your vaccines.
      </p>
      <pre><code>   2. You should consult a honest physician (not that receiving money/free trips, would ever influence them to give you anything a Pharma company tells them to do).
    3. There are hundreds of studies that show that vaccines actually turned the world from hell to paradise (yes you can pat the lions and sleep in their lap thanks to them, also we won't look on evidence that show the horrific consequences of using them).

       Thanks for posting this, sadly it is almost impossible to reach people, let alone change their minds about something that has been ingrained since elementary school. Time and time again we see the deplorable practices of this companies, but since they bribe public officials they have carte blanche mostly everywhere in the world.

       Aaaand let the mocking begin. Seriously though, it looks like top commenters stopped reading on 3rd sentence. You can't really find any decent criticism with clear expression of thoughts regarding what you WROTE. It's all the same fed up arguments. As if someone gave the command to bombard this post when the key word is detected.
P. S. thanks OP for the valuable information.

       Crap!  I went to get a tetanus vaccine last week after stepping on a mystery object.  They no longer offered plain tetanus, so I had to get a "TDAP" vaccine which bundles tetanus and pertussis.  What a scam.

       The Tetanus vaccine is based on bad science and is one of the most dangerous on the market.  In Africa they found that it actually reduced the lifespan of children who were injected with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tetanus is a disease of poor wound hygiene, normally one would only expect someone with serious burns or an immune system issue to go down with Tetanus, but even if they did there is are tetanus antitoxins, such as tetanus immune globulin and also antibiotics, so there is no benefit in risking the vaccine.

       It's absolutely disgusting how much someone has to preface their statements before delivering some inconvenient truth about "vaccines".
       <br/>
       Shows how successful the pharmaceutical industry and their PTB buddies have been at shaping public opinion via their influence over universities, control of media and internet shills &amp; bots.
       <br/>
       They've damn near created a new religion with "vaccines" and drug-pushing doctors as infallible, unquestionable deities.

        The family headstone, marking the deaths of almost an entire family because of diphtheria.
       </a>

      <p>
       Eight children dead in a span of 2 and a half weeks from diphtheria, in 1897-98.

       <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/dip.html#trends">
        fell dramatically
       </a>
       . From 18,000—20,000 in 1940 to 2,000 in 1960. Cases reported nowadays are a tiny, tiny percentage of what they were 100 years ago.

        Diphtheria is extremely rare in the United States today; between 2004 and 2011, no cases of diphtheria were reported to public health officials. One case was provisionally reported in 2012.

       Vaccines, in concert with improved health and hygiene, are the reasons why a family in 1987, or 1997, or 2017 don't have to suffer the tragedy of losing

       This is a conspiracy theory because the pharmaceutical companies are pushing a product that they've managed to absolve themselves of the consequences.  Herd immunity is a moving goal post.  Do you want to be treated as a herd or take our health back?

        Why the autism connection needs to be further researched...
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “immune activation”
describes the activation of the cellular
components of the immune system. The
developing brain can be injured by immune
activation, with life-long consequences
(Meyer 2009, Deverman 2009, Estes 2016,
Kneusel 2014, Careaga 2017, Meyer 2014).
Immune activation injury is linked to autism,
schizophrenia, depression and other mental
illnesses or neurodevelopmental disorders.
Immune activation effects on the brain are
mediated by immune system signaling
molecules, especially cytokines (Estes 2016,
Meyer 2014, Smith 2007, Choi 2016, Pineda
2013).
It is generally accepted that immune
activation (e.g., from infection) during
pregnancy is a risk factor for autism and
schizophrenia in the offspring (Ciaranello
1995, Atladottir 2010, Brown 2012). The
intensity and duration of immune activation
and cytokine expression appear to be
important factors influencing autism risk
(Meyer 2014). Intense immune activation is
associated with greater risk of autism
(Careaga 2017, Atladottir 2010). Chronic
inflammation is associated with greater risk
of autism (Jones 2016, Zerbo 2014). However,
there is no evidence that short-duration, low intensity
immune activation resulting from
common childhood illnesses increase autism
risk. Timing of immune activation in relation
to stages of brain development is also an
important factor (Meyer 2006, Meyer 2009).
Animal experiments have tested the
effects of immune activation during
pregnancy and postnatally on the
development of offspring (Meyer 2009,
Deverman 2009, Estes 2016, Kneusel 2014,
Careaga 2017, Meyer 2014). In these
experiments, pregnant animals (mice, rats
and monkeys) or neonates are injected with a
non-infectious immune activating substance
such as “poly-IC” (which mimics a viral
infection) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, which
mimics a bacterial infection). These
substances cause immune system activation without infection. They induce fever and
cytokine production and can have substantial
effects on brain development if activation is
sufficiently intense or prolonged and if
exposure occurs during vulnerable
developmental stages.
Immune activation has been
demonstrated in mice to cause the three core
behavioral symptoms of autism: decreased
socialization and communication, and
increased repetitive behaviors (Malkova
2012). Immune activation has also been
shown to cause neuropathology (Weir 2015)
and behavioral abnormalities in monkeys
that resemble behaviors in human
schizophrenia and autism.

       I was listening to this podcast, The higher side chats (Highly recommend btw), and the topic was about how "evil" the whole birthing process is. Something that I would like to read up on that they mentioned was how ultrasounds and sonograms are terrible for the fetus. The guest basically stated that not long ago, autism and common developmental diseases were not... Common.

I'm not sure if that's true. But at this point, occam's razor is brittle. It's hard to ignore the truth about how low men's testosterone levels are. I'm sure 95% is based on what men eat. However, I think some stats need to be done comparing western countries with other developed countries.

       I have M.E or as it is also known as CFS [Chronic fatigue syndrome], so many people of my age group have it vaccinated in 1968. I keep reading up on it and there are some studies [sorry I have no link] that seem to suggest that M.E is like a small 'cousin' of Polio.
It would make a lot of sense as this illness in its form didn't really exist before and started mostly in the 1980s [as yuppie flu].

       im sorry to hear about your illness friend. Ive come to some information in regards to CFS. There is a special diet that comes from a book called "The plant paradox" by Dr. Gundry. It has been used with people with CFS with excellent results. I have something similar and this diet has given me almost miraculous results. Also look into detoxing, I recommend you look into Josh Macin and the detox dudes.  Anyway just wanted to mention it , it may help out. It is basically a low lectin diet. Thanks for that link and I wish you nothing but a full recovery.

       Thank you for responding. Tried most things, cant be cured as so many think [I was even told to go to meditation and the girl was adamant that I will be cured] This can be frustrating sometimes as I have meditated since my youth and she just wasn't taking my explanations into account at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       M.E It is something at the mitochondrial level that is just not working as it should, like a defective battery, it just won't hold charge. also as it is late onset CFS [I prefer M.E as it is truer in meaning] it isn't likely to get better. 
I always explain it as being given £5 spending money whilst other people get £50 a day and things just cost a certain amount [hair washing = £2 for example, hoovering = £3 etc].
      </p>
      <p>
       However I appreciate your ideas and will look into it. I have basically learned to just live with the little bit of energy that I am given daily and it works quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still quite convinced that it is due to vaccines.

       oh i absolutely think vaccines are a main culprit for many diseases including M.E.. I was injured by a tdap vaccine but have made a lot of progress thanks to food, specially what i put and not put in my body. I was always told that disease begins in the gut, like Hippocrates said, and i couldn't agree more. Food is the very first thing to look at when it comes to any disease. Fasting is another incredible tool to help heal the body as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though M.E. is a problem that seems to be coming from a deficient mitochondrial function, im willing to bet that its because the body is full of heavy metals and toxins that interfere with the bodies natural processes. Heavy metals are really hard to detox from specially if you have your detox pathways damaged. ex leaky gut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you havent already, look into kratom. Ive heard good things from people with M.E. /CFS. God bless friend.

       Please add controversy surrounding the feds use of the anthrax shot and BT Vaccines on their own soldiers, which were pointed to as the likely cause or causes of the 11 symptoms which became known as Gulf War Syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DOD made it illegal to not take a shot in 2009 (UCMJ), and in 2011 began their own department for the creation of counter-bio-weapons (vaccines). Perhaps they did this because Merk pharma has been embroiled in lawsuits by ex employees that all have data evidencing their allegations that Merk fudged saftey and efficacy data for over 20 years to retain patents. The DOD requires the same shots for DOD Civilians as it does for it's soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DOD is and has been allowed to use New Investigational Drugs on soldiers, but after John D. Rockafeller stood before Congress and told the people that their government had likely caused a debacle by testing things on troops that may have consequences, Congress told the DOD to use documents to inform people before they give them the shot. It's a grey area for if people have a choice (they do but are told they don't).
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1991 Australia changed their formula after 90 percent of the first troops came back from the person gulf with what later became known as Gulf War Syndrome. The US did not change their formula, which included an adjuvant called squaline that science later found reason not to trust. Squaline was included in an innoculation in Spain a while back, so I know its still in use in places, in spite of the controversy surrounding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my story from when I proved the anthrax shot is still a danger to humans as of July 2011. The anthrax shot almost took my life and they swept it under the rug.

       With all due respect, framing your post as objective and purely informative whilst presenting an obscenely biased collection of obscure scientific literature sourced from books written by anti-vaccination advocates (neither of which possess any credentials whatsoever to support their capacity to critically evaluate scientific literature) is reprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're doing here is feeding confirmation bias and using a small minority of cherry-picked information to discredit the vast majority of information on the subject; the polar opposite of how the scientific method actually works.

       Well my whole family got a flu vaccine this season and didn't get the flu. I came down with it and developed pneumonia and was down 14 days. I officially unfollow this train of thought. It's fucking retarted. I'm not getting the flu again because I've seen the light. This shit thinking is autism.

       If you take the time to do your own research you may find that you are not likely to come in contact with most of the diseases we are told to vaccinate against (Giving Hep B to an infant, a vaccine which still carries a toxic dose of mercury is unnecessary and dangerous, the use of this vaccine and rising rates of autism follow the same upward curve if you graft them)...and if you do come in contact you are highly unlikely to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines contain toxic doses of heavy metals and chemicals...bring on the pathogens, its the chemicals that will mess your brain up.  And annual flu shots, and the HUGE vaccine schedule they have for kids now?  Its ruining the kids brains.  Anyone in education will tell you kids are different now...so what has changed?  Food, GMOs and the Vaccine schedule to start...even waiting until a child is over the age of 3 is better...and Hep B, Hep A, the rotovirus vaccine, NOT needed...we live in a country with sanitation.

       And imagine this...any industry that has 1) legal immunity from liability for damages from its product, yet 2) you are in most states forced to imbibe, YET if you question the safety and efficacy of the vaccines suddenly you are an anti science heretic lunatic. WHAT???  There is plenty to question with science and vaccine development anyway...there are billions in damages paid out (and many unable to collect based on not being able to prove the rigorous standards)...and many who have been vaccinated, yet still catch the diseases...yet if I question the safety, I'm vilified... thats more than enough red flags...

       The best argument against vaccination is the somewhat questionable efficacy, and the almost complete lack of safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.6 billion dollars in awards from the vaccine Court were given out for mostly CHILDREN who were harmed. Many seriously harmed. By that I mean lifelong debilitation and/or DEATH.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been virtually no effort to properly monitor adverse events to the point where less than 5%, with some estimates closer to 1 or 2%, reporting rates for adverse events. This means that there is no real data to back any assertion of safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can provide evidence of both efficacy and safety, now's your chance. And not just for the individual vaccines, but for the entirety of the combined administration of all vaccines and its effects on small children or adults.

      <p>
       Tell that to the 10s of thousands of cases of "non-acute flaccid paralysis" that the polio vaccine recently caused in India.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1950's, this polio vaccine-caused paralysis would have been classified as, you guessed it, polio!
      </p>
      <p>
       When the vaccine was
       <em>
        clearly
       </em>
       making things worse, they reclassified polio to require a much narrower definition, effectively "eliminating" polio, when in reality paralysis cases were called something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, read the section on polio in my first Skeptic's Guide...it's been scientifically determined that elimination of the polio virus is
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        considering polio is just about eliminated.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Polio can never be eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please read my section on polio.

       Sanitation has been shown to be the leading cause of diseases vanishing. That and a proper diet to build a strong immune system.  The diseases of the past existed mainly because of people shitting in the streets and having empty food.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been shown that herd immunity is a myth.  Many baby boomers didn't return to get boosters that are required to be immune to the disease or virus and no major outbreaks occurred.  It was estimated that only a small minority were up to date on their boosters and the large majority was not.

       Vaccines are used to commit genocide, they are tool to sterilize and bring down fertility.  WHO and UNICEF are going around the Third World committing genocide with their vaccines, they've been caught red-handed a number of times.

       Wouldn't Big Phamra make a shit-ton more money treating disease out breaks and symptoms than what they make from vaccines?

       We know for a fact that prevention is the most cost-effective form of treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Big Pharma had it's way, wouldn't it limit the number of preventive treatment options as much as possible? Wouldn't prevention actually be what's worst for business for them?

       That is all. I trust the scientists who went to school for 5-8+ yrs. I trust their research and findings. Did those people have a phd in scienece, or engineering. And the concept of "evil", in subject.

       You mean vaccine safety advocates, who are the ones instead of trying to market a product with fake studies, actually try to find out if vaccines are safe.  No these are the most important studies of all, the non-BS ones.

       Not at all, Big Pharma has tentacles everywhere, so the best and most important ones will often be harder to find.

      <p>
       You should be warning us about the pro-vax studies which aren't using real placebos in safety studies and are removing people from studies if they get sick.  You've got the whole reality upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The so-called anti-vax side are people who have given up lucrative careers to get the truth out, the industry destroys people as soon as they dare find out the harm of a vaccine.  The money is in the pro-vaxx side, so that's why it's full of shills and weak characters, whereas the vaccine safety side is full of decent human beings trying to get the truth out, save lives and protect health.

        Correlation is not causation, as the studies shows the more vaccines the worse the infant mortality.  The reduction of infant mortality is linked to improved nutrition and sanitation.

      <ol>
       <li>
        It's not just the US, if you draw a graph showing which countries give the most vaccines, it's clear that the more a country gives the worse it's infant mortality.  This will be to do with vaccines causing SIDS and many autoimmune diseases and allergies.  Japan found that when they stopped vaccinating under 2's their infant mortality rate jumped up to best in the world, SIDS vanished in the country.  The unfortunate reality is that it is not safe to vaccinating children under the age of 2 as essential detoxifying enzymes are not yet present in the liver, so it any child under the age of 2 is being poisoned in one way or another with vaccines.

       Told by who? There is no World Scientist Boss that tells all of them what to do. There are thousands of studies over decades on their effects. Do yourself a favour and do a little research outside of the anti-vax bubble, how scientific studies and peer review journals work.   You and your bullshit peddling is leading to real harm.
