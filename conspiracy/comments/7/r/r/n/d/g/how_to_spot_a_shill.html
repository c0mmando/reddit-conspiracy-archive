       We can probably use some of the examples I drag in today.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.They are dismissive, sometimes in a very obnoxious way.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.They will try to shut down your narrative by repeatedly demanding proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: (a little late for Clarity on this but fuck it) example of this would be maybe the Vegas shooting, OP would connect the dots to their own Theory and the whole post be shot down because people would be dismissing it wanting proof, where there of course wasn't any. That's not fair. Maybe that OP was on to something. Sometimes those demands are ridiculous. Sometimes it's suspicious. I believe it's a tactic they use to derail a possible true.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.They will not and possibly cannot agree with you on conspiracies widely accepted to be true. At this point I would ask myself why are you here if you don't a LEAST believe in that? Usually the conversation won't continue after probing one of these questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Young Reddit age, high Karma? Possibly (They're obviously supporting each other. Maybe reddit is supporting them also)
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course we can't go around calling people shills. I'd look through their comments and try to pieced together what the accounts narrative is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please share if you notice anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: What is happening here is interesting. It's hard to gauge my tone through text so I just want to say I came to the sub to be convinced and educated. There's huge variety of people here with a wide diversity of knowledge much greater than I. I will certainly concede to a good argument because that's progress for me. That's the way it should work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: And Im grateful this post reached as many eyes as a did.

       I've pretty much realized it's pointless to even pay attention to it except for to make a mental note not to interact with them as much as possible. There's nothing we can do about it. Can't call them out and can't report them anyway unless they blatantly break some rule. Even if their contributions here are mostly to continually use ad hominem attacks, make comments solely to discredit every conspiracy and insult users. As long as they don't blatantly break rule 10 by doing so. 
I've reported a few that continually harass me through pm to the admins, they don't care. I have no doubt at this point that they're complicit.

       It's a sad situation as some days this sub seems all but lost. Guess it was inevitable as look at every other major sub here.

       In my experience, people who call other people shills call them shills because they are arguing with them and the person not only disagreed with them, but proved the wrong too.

       Don't forget the part where they try to frame you as paranoid and unreasonable. That we lack maturity, and believe anyone who disagrees with us is a shill. That is like their #1 or 2 talking point.

       Ehhhh. Seriously? Do you see the post you're replying to? It's literally calling people who ask for evidence to a whacky theory a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask for evidence. It's rarely provided. It's those pushing whacky theories they heard on 4chan for political means that are shills. Asking them to prove theoretical claims isn't shill like behaviour. It's the behaviour of an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fucking bizarre to me that people are here to discuss alternative theories and explanations yet go all bitch meta when they're asked to prove the or assertions. If they want to live in a fantasy land where disbelief is suspended, there's always creative writing or fantasy fiction subs. This is not one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're upset because someone asked you for evidence to something youre parroting because you can't think critically, you need a long hard look on the mirror. Only idiots cry when forced to reckon worth dissonance.

       I ask for evidence all the time too, it isn't the same thing. It is the way they do it. Like say I make a post about a wild theory I came up with, and I lay out all the dots I think are connected, and ask the sub what they think. The shills will come into shit like that telling OP he is a liar piece of shit unless he posts evidence. They ask for evidence when it is obvious based on the premise that there isn't any. There are plenty of babies that get thrown out with bathwater around here, for sure. But if you care and spend the amt of time around here that I do, and really get to know the userbase and patterns of this place, you start to spot the subtle maliciousness.

       that maliciousness comes from the fact that the whacky theories are not being presented in good faith. They're being parroted from 4chan larpers for political means by obsequious establishment cucks who have been brainwashed into thinking that their blind loyalty to the dear leader is rebellious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intentions are clear with these political conspiracy theories. There's no intention to show evidence. That's where the malicious calling out is from. It's not shills. It's people sick of establishment shills spewing lies that they themselves are 100% certain that they can't back up with facts or evidence.

       In the vast majority of cases, the narrative

       a whacky theory. Proven by the fact that posts like this crop up constantly. Your whacky theory has no evidence so try to poison the well that's forcing you to reckon with that fact.

       Ehhhh. Seriously? Do you see the post you're replying to? It's literally calling people who ask for evidence to a whacky theory a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask for evidence. It's rarely provided. It's those pushing whacky theories they heard on 4chan for political means that are shills. Asking them to prove theoretical claims isn't shill like behaviour. It's the behaviour of an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fucking bizarre to me that people are here to discuss alternative theories and explanations yet go all bitch meta when they're asked to prove the theory. If they want to live in a fantasy land where disbelief is suspended, there's always creative writing or fantasy fiction subs. This is not one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're upset because someone asked you for evidence to something youre parroting because you can't think critically, you need a long hard look on the mirror. Only idiots cry when forced to reckon worth dissonance.

       Wait... what? I can understand if they are being dismissive of proof (debunking is not being dismissive), but just asking for evidence is a pretty normal reaction to what can be perceived as outlandish claims. No?

       Outlandish yes. Obviously that's for the individual to decide though. At the same time though these are conspiracy "theories" people are just theorizing. The burden of proof isn't exactly Fair all the time.

       Thats the whole problem here. Burden of proof should rely on both parties researching an then discussing. There is a real problem with users asking for sources, but refusing to any grunt work themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is so easy to take ANY topic, run it through your own personal bullshit meter (google, duckduckgo helps) and then disagree and be ready with reasons why.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many people just throw up their hands and say "Show me!" without having the capacity to critically think for themselves. I vehemently disagree with forcing burden of proof on anybody. Take the 5 minutes and inform yourself.

       It's how they react when they're given the evidence. They'll just move on to the next tactic of attacking or dismissing the source. Then you can post another. They'll attack and discredit that and then move onto the next tactic of derailing.

       That point in OP's post is what allows many people here to dismiss people as "shills." They think asking for proof, or dismissing their source material from "paulsconspiracyblog.com" is shill behavior. Oftentimes users, like me, are dismissed as a shill because I like my conspiracies the have a little bit of evidence behind them, not just my imagination.

       Its a fucking conspiracy forum. Clearly there isn't always going to be proof of every claim. That doesn't mean the claims are untrue, just that they aren't
       <em>
        proven
       </em>
       , something pretty common in the conspiracy world. I don't know why this concept is so fucking difficult for people to understand, its so simple.

       I don't know dude, Hitchens's razor is ringing in my ear when I come across claims like those. For the sake of speculation, then sure it's fine, but I think it's reasonable for people to expect an explanation for "What brought you to this conclusion?".

       So does that mean that all those people are shills? Nah. There are also plenty of snarky people on reddit. I don't assume anyone who I argue with is getting paid to have an opinion. I'd rather just present a decent argument as to why I disagree.

       I really don't think people get into these debates with the intention of changing minds, a lot of the time it's for the onlookers. Not saying minds can't be changed or that that's not ever the motive. I think providing sources shouldn't be a problem for someone who is secure in their beliefs, and they shouldn't just be dismissed as shills. It just seems like an easy cop out. Again, this is just my opinion.

       I guess it's more about awareness. Some pointed out the pointlessness and I agree. I expected to get chewed up. Oh well. It's a tactic it seems. Of course asking for Source isn't only used by Shills. I should have probably had more clarity on that too bad the entire thread was based on that line. I appreciate the reply to the reply. Most didn't bother

       there's a real easy test - do they act like they're interested in the truth?  if you honestly are there are certain things you will do, questions you will ask, avenues you will be willing to explore.  if not, then something is smelly.

       They vastly outnumber any other kind of shill on Reddit by far. Go look at the number of anti Trump subs that grow by the day, any major news sub, theyre everywhere. And it's not "pro Trump" to notice facts.

       Lol, a single example proves nothing. It's the fact that virtually all your comments are either attacking trump/GOP or apologizing for democrats. One comment does not a hyperpartisan make. It's a repeated pattern. It's the fact that your account appear to exist

      <p>
       Right in the beginning of my comment I state it's fucked up what the democrats are doing. It's highly hypocritical and I don't think DACA and dreamers is worth shutting down the government for. It was fucked up when the republicans did it, and it's fucked up when the democrats do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say that you're against extreme partisanship, but yet you are attacking me for pointing it out when a conservative user is doing it.  And the only reason why I pointed out his right wing stance is because of the comment I was replying to. Read it.

       What exactly is the issue here? I acknoweldge the existence of CTR shills and even point out that it's a fact that they exist because their own website acknoweldges it, which liberals and shills try to ignore or say that CTR shills don't exist.

      <p>
       I agreed that she collapsed on camera implying that I agreed there was something wrong with her. And the DNC did fuck over Sanders. That has nothing to do with my reasoning that Trump would have still won. And I used evidence to back up that claim because there was a senator in Wisconsin that had the same exact views and policies as Sanders, and was one of the only ones to vote against the Iraq/Afghanistan war. But, he still lost, which means that Sanders would have most likely lost Wisconsin and Michigan, which means he would have lost the electorally. You again try to purposely misintrepret what I was saying with what I assume is hoping that people just rely on your interpretation of my comment.

       Wait, so now you're attacking me because my comment has nothing to do with democrats or republicans? I thought all of my comments were pro democrat and anti Trump? The title was the following:

       I don't blame republicans for everything and I never accussed independents and moderates of being secret Trump supporters. Democrats have a lot to blame for our societal issues.

       There's nothing wrong with being a leftist just as much as there is nothing wrong with being a conservative. I'm a liberal and not ashamed of that. But, from what I've seen from your history, you mostly only engage with liberal minded people and make accusations and harass them.

       And that's wrong and hypocritical of them. We need to be able to have more sincere honest and civil discussions. I have a best friend who is a conservative republican, and he's one of the smartest people I know. He puts me to constant shame when I try to debate with him on stuff, but we always kept it civil. He works in the DC area, and he tells me how he has to hide his political identity because liberals would attack him in a hateful rude manner. That kind of shit really pisses me off.

       I don't do that. I've said a few comments where you first started talking with me about, but I never accused this place of being Donald 2.0 or attack independents. I have always been civil with every single person that I've disagreed with. And when we did discuss this point before, you were able to prove your point, and I've since noticed that on the front page, it's full of mostly liberal minded people. I think my view was wrong because I just tend to notice to same handful of conservatives in new and rising, because that's where I mostly hang out at. Confirmation bias clouded my judgement.

Just like how an attack on Trump in 2016 was not an attack on republicans, considering many republicans openly hated him. So, all that comment is is an anti-trump comment, and it was one of your examples of how you're not just an anti Trump type poster.

       You posted a comment about your support of a controversial Democrat-pushed policy... to show that you aren't hyperpartisan? Whaaaa? And, for the record, there's nothing really wrong with DACA.

       Wtf? This just seems like a clumsy effort to say something you think a non-partisan would say. Also, the for-profit prison industry gives far more money to Republican lawmakers.

       You know What? I might be guilty of letting questionable pro-trump accounts slide, here. I already explained my reasoning, though. The Trumptards usually don't respond, and they are usually downvoted to oblivion already. The left wing attack dogs, on the other hand...

       Yeah, their shit gets downvoted, though. Democrat stuff is front page, hundred of upvotes type stuff. Democrat downvote brigades are way worse than the donbot ones ever were. Axylotl peyotl or whatever his name is, i don't really agree with him, but I'm pretty sure he has people following him around 24/7 downvoting everything he posts. That's fucked. And he's a mod, which goes against the "Russian mods banning all dissent" narrative.

      <p>
       Plus, the Donald 2.0 narrative, as I said, just pisses me off. The right wing narratives like pizzagate and Seth rich, are much easier for me to not give a shit about because its much more speculative and for all intents and purposes has no data behind it. Donald 2.0 rebuttal data is the front page. People's comment histories.

       Look, man, I'll admit that I might have been wrong about you. If you're really not like the circlejerkers on the front page, then I apologize. I don't want to lump you with them if you genuinely don't deserve it. There were simply some things I interpreted as red flags, per se, in our earlier conversation.

       No worries. I do understand why you would suspect me at least, especially since I am a new account and I do mainly just talk about the whole Russian conspiracy with Trump and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you, I'm also hyper focused on suspect accounts. There was one time where I noticed a thread in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       where every single comment was made by accounts that were created that day and within hours of each other. They were all liberal comments and I tried to call stuff like that out, but it's hard to do without violating the rules. So I would just point out account age, but I did eventually get banned for harrasing users. Apparently pointing out account age is harrasing now adays. I tried to find the thread, but I can't find it. But,
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and similar subs are rife with shills. There's one user there who solely just posts shareblue links every single fucking day. It pisses me off because propaganda shit like that should be banned, but whatever.

       But just because someone has anti-Trump views does not make them a shill. There a e obvious CTR shill subs like enoughtrunpspam, but to call everyone who has an opposing political view than you is a shill is a great way to discredit any viewpoint that is different from you or people who think like you.

       Outlandish yes. Obviously that's for the individual to decide though. At the same time though these are conspiracy "theories" people are just theorizing. The burden of proof isn't exactly Fair all the time.

       What I'm describing in the post is unreasonable though

       It's how they react when they're given the evidence. They'll just move on to the next tactic of attacking or dismissing the source. Then you can post another. They'll attack and discredit that and then move onto the next tactic of derailing.

       That point in OP's post is what allows many people here to dismiss people as "shills." They think asking for proof, or dismissing their source material from "paulsconspiracyblog.com" is shill behavior. Oftentimes users, like me, are dismissed as a shill because I like my conspiracies the have a little bit of evidence behind them, not just my imagination.

       Its a fucking conspiracy forum. Clearly there isn't always going to be proof of every claim. That doesn't mean the claims are untrue, just that they aren't
       <em>
        proven
       </em>
       , something pretty common in the conspiracy world. I don't know why this concept is so fucking difficult for people to understand, its so simple.

       It’s a common tactic for shills or disrupters to attack and accuse others and harass them as they follow them in other separate threads.
