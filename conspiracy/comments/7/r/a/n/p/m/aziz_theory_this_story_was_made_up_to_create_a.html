        <h3 class="title">Aziz theory: this story was made up to create a flood wall for the #metoo movement.</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">42</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-18 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/CALC2.html">CALC2</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The #metoo movement is destroying the careers of many well known and powerful figures in media. Knowing that it could sweep up nearly anyone who has made a poor decision in their lengthy past, why not attempt to set up a barrier that can discredit the movement?</p>

<p>It has proven really hard to argue against this movement. Any actor attempting to push back on the #metoo as a “which hunt” or in need of due process has been swept into the story as a sympathizer or complicit. I am sure the motivation for this to stop is strong. If left unchecked, the #metoo movement could ruin even more careers and break further from the norms of a massive and entrenched industry. </p>

<p>Without any inside knowledge, I offer this concept. Create a story of abuse targeting one of the most outspoken feminist males in the industry and denounce it’s author as crying wolf with a story unworthy of merit. One could then inflate that story, it’s responses and discourse in social channels using bot nets and fake accounts to embolden the narrative that many of those who are voicing their discomfort, are simply misperceptions of what abuse really is. </p>

<p>Who’s reputation could possibly survive this, Aziz. He has no social media profiles, so the only forum for his rebuttal would have to be journalistic third parties. The most volatile space for these actors, producers, and accused to respond in is their own voice. This is why lawyers never have the accused testify. It always looks bad. </p>

<p>The recount of this instance by the young woman plays perfectly into that story arch. It’s full of discomfort, but lacks the malice expected of such an experience. It seems plausible that an industry of writers could fabricate this as a solution to their new found risk.</p>

<p>Movies and film projects are failing. Careers are ending. Deals and value is disappearing and I can’t image intrenched interests will just sit by and let it happen. I didn’t give it much thought until I saw the posts related to this story get such strong traction. The conversation that existed in the comment sections was entirely dominated by Aziz supporters with upvotes counting in the 7,000-9,000 range while other front page conversations weren’t getting a tenth of that. Descent was eradicated with endless downvotes. While I’m highly cognizant that there are many reddit users on the side of men’s rights, I have a hard time believing the numbers accurately portray reality. </p>

<p>Aziz gets political clout with the rain makers and gate keepers who can make or break his career. The young unknown journalist gets a payout for her acting. The babe.com website gets acknowledged and receives traffic. Derivative narrative creates content for news shows and finally puts a framework in place for pushback where doing so has burned those who have previously attempted. Persons in power can then go back to exercising their power to abuse.</p>

<p>It’s just a theory. I have no stake in right or wrong here. For reasons entirely unrelated, I like to watch the prices of bot net rental fluctuate around media events as it can sometimes tells a bigger story of who’s particularly interested in outcomes. These Aziz posts are occurring during big bumps in bot net prices, but maybe I’m looking to hard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t stand Matt Damon, but he tried to make a few valid points during the &quot;Downsizing&quot; press tour and got slammed. It&#39;s true that slapping a chick&#39;s ass and raping a woman or molesting a kid are different levels of inappropriate. </p>

<p>What #MeToo is really doing is keeping the focus away from the male-on-male abuse and kid raping. It may all be a concoction, well beyond that Aziz thing, which is also bullshit--a bad date, that&#39;s all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m getting really tired of the power women are gaining, it&#39;s really starting to bother me. They killed Luke Skywalker so a woman could take over Star Wars, the new Oceans Eleven, all women, Ghostbusters, all women, Oprah .. prolly gonna walk into a presidency , #MeToo making it basically illegal to be a man that&#39;s interested in a woman... soon messaging/talking to women will be considered sexual misconduct , making a Black Widow movie (why) , Captian Marvel, Wonder Woman is the only DC hero that can get any praise , the women of the world could be given ALL the proof in the world that Hillary is a crook and they&#39;d still say we&#39;re sexist for not voting for her. Women are able to accuse men of rape and they go to prison with next to no proof... women get next to everything in a divorce that half the time they ruin intentionally , they are almost always awarded the kids without question even if it doesn&#39;t make sense. The new season of Black Mirror, all female leads ...  it&#39;s all just getting out of hand, they say they want equality, but what they really want, is to take the fuck over. If Hillary had of become President they wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Hillary is president&quot; ... they&#39;d of said &quot;We&#39;re President&quot; ... it&#39;s NOt about equality . Not to mention now the media and government are trying to silence men and make everyone fuckig sissy little bitches with all the trans,bi,Cis, male female Gender X shit ... its ALL getting WAY too out of hand. I&#39;m sorry, but it has to be said.  My Prime minister dances around like a girly boy with his lesbian premier  in pink shirts promoting giving free money to everyone but the actual citizens and veterans and economy at pride parades while holding pot legalization over the youths head to stay in power and saying that everyone needs to be compassionate and accepting of women taking charge .... im sick of it lol. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting theory, but it seems like he had a pretty solid career before this story broke.  He had just won a Golden Globe.  He was already through the gate.  This incident, fair or not, is going to have a measurable negative impact on his career.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I&#39;m surprised nobody has pointed it out here, but babe.net and its parent company The Tab came out of nowhere, they were really just popular on college campuses, until they got their first big investor only last September. Take a guess who it was. Yeah, Rupert Murdoch owns the tabloid blog that put out this article that people are saying &quot;is dereailing the Me Too movement&quot; honestly, once you follow the money and consider who actually benefits from this article, it all makes perfect sense. What honest reason can you possibly give for Newscorp investing in and becoming partial owners of a &quot;liberal feminist&quot; blog? The whole Project Veritas Roy Moore thing proves the far right have an interest in sabotaging the Me Too movement from the inside.</p>

<p>Murdoch had his empire ruined by all of this stuff, so now he&#39;s hijacking the weapon and using it against his enemies and the movement itself, before any more of the elite get taken down. It&#39;s brilliant in the evil twisted 1% kind of way. Liberal feminists everywhere have unknowingly become a pawn in Murdoch&#39;s game, and if you try and explain it to them, they&#39;ll call you a fake feminist and an enemy of the movement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa, didn’t go there at all. That’s hecka crazy. </p>

<p>Sidenote: I’m not going to pretend I’m something better than all this. If true, you gotta respect that game. This sort of thing can only be executed with some serious talent, capital, influence and understanding. I wish I was rich enough to own a couple of politicians and some cool news companies everyone watched. I’d do all the coolest stuff. </p>

<p>I really wish I was powerful enough that others would seek to improve their world based purely on the disgust and contempt they have for my own actions. I’d be a real king. </p>
