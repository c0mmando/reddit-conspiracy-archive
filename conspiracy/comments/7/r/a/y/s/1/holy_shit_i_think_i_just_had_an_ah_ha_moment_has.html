       Has anyone else noticed a lack of Chemtrails in the skies lately? (i know this is a touchy subject, but when you see it first hand it starts to make more sense) Like seriously i have not noticed or seen any chemtrails in the skies for the past 2 months or so and the weather has absolutely been cold, and it has been cold all the way to the Gulf of Mexico too! I just watched a video on weather channel and also noticed ZERO Chemtrails in the sky over Pensacola Beach, FL
      </p>

      <p>
       Not sure how to express this, but does this mean that chemtrails are actually being used to keep the earth warm? Are we actually in a mini Ice Age but the Powers that be are actually controlling the weather with artificial cloud cover called Chemtrails?
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence is there for the past 2 months of noticing almost zero chemtrails and having much colder temperatures for longer durations this winter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone else reproduce these examples in their locations?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Here is what it looks like right now above my place, not one chemtrail in the sky. It has been like this for a couple months now, it has been great actually!

       While I don't believe in chemtrails, I was looking out my window at work on Monday or Tuesday, and noticed a crapton of contrails across the sky.  Much more than usual, and thought "chem trails folks would have a field day with this."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, after 9/11, when ALL US air traffic was grounded for a couple days, there were noticeable changes in temperature.

       So with contrails, do they just pick grid locations all over the states and decide to fly in patterns just to see how cool their exhaust will look in the sky? What about the cloud coverage you can watch it create?

       The planes fly there all the time.  These are normal routes.  The weather conditions (temperature, humidity, etc) determine whether you see a lot of contrails, whether they last a while, etc.  On days when you see none, all those planes are still there, you just don't see them because there isn't a big white line pointing to them.  I literally just watched a plane fly by with a big contrail which disappeared in a minute or two.   I see this most days.  Some days I see lots, because they last for a while.  Some days I see few to none.

       That was a theory of mine. I'd read something about how adding a heating/cooling agent above and below the ionosphere had opposite effects on the other side of the ionosphere. So chemtrails above the ionosphere somehow caused heat below the ionosphere to increase, while cooling the upper atmosphere. Chemtrails below the ionosphere would temporarily heat the upper atmosphere, but would ultimately disperse into space. It's been a while since I researched it though.

       Same here in the SF Bay Area. I distinctly remember "contrails" evaporating soon after the plane. But now they spread out into a cloud. Blew my mind when I accepted Chem trails as real. I don't know why I was surprised. I guess because it's just so obvious. A lot of this is if you're looking.

       Yeah it's been crazy here! About a month ago it wasn't so bad, I thought maybe some funding had been slashed or something but they have ramped it up big time, and Idk if it's coincidence or not but there seems to be a correlation with the chemtrails and fog....anyways, it sucks our beautiful weather is getting grossed out by these shit clouds.

       Every time I visit California I am blown away by the sky and the prevalence of the trails. I used to live there as a kid and the clouds/sky looks dramatically different now. That’s one of the reasons I’m inclined to believe in chemtrails.

       The weather patterns definitely change when the stop spraying around my area (Northern Alabama). Last summer was a perfect example...when they don't spray, we get nice, fluffy 'popcorn' clouds and get isolated and intermittent rain showers. When they do spray, we get an eggshell opaque sky for a day or two after, then a snake-like front that sweeps from west to east.

       Besides slowly poisoning us, Chemtrails block out the energy from the sun that is supposed to raise humanity's consciousness during this Ascension, with varying success.

       Asheville trails were off the charts right before the winter storm. Tight parallel clusters, grids, Xs, essentially

       with trails. I couldn't tell you the last clear day in months.

       And I'm sure it's just coincidence or confirmation bias, but the trails were insane right before the last underpredicted snow storm a month ago. Both cases, I've come down with flu-like symptoms too. I'm laid up in bed right now.

       Contrail formation and persistence is highly dependent on moisture content of the air and temperature.

       Thus, when the air is very cold and dry you will not see many or they will be very short lived. Unfortunately, this only feeds the chemtrailtards, because often when the air is becoming supersaturated anyway from natural processes very long and persistent contrails will often be visible before weather turns cloudy, which it was about to do anyway.

       So what explains when they persist for sustained periods of time when the air is cool/cold and very dry?

      <p>
       What’s is the explanation when there are the short lived ones appearing at the same time as the ones that do not go away?

       And why are there planes flying in figure 8 patterns for hours making Xs in the sky but not figure 8 contrails?

       I’ve never gotten a video because I don’t have the means to do so. The details cannot be seen so clearly with the naked eye because the planes are very high up. My family and neighbors and I have seen it with the help of binoculars and I don’t have a video camera that zooms in that much. Plus their X’s take 20 min to make and I never thought anyone would want to watch a video for 20-40 min of a plane circling around. I’m not terribly into this conspiracy, I have always assumed they were doing this for some reason that was not malicious. And I don’t like that a lot of contrails get mislabeled as chemtrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       My meteorologist in town has pointed out these lines and x’s that show up on the radar are military (he’s ex-military). And this is right near one of the biggest military bases in the country, so I always assumed it might have something to do with that.

       Yeah, I mean they could be anything. But we are certain they are spraying something. They once did it too much and the sun turned black as a result. Over 10,000 people called emergency and law enforcement that day, according to the news. It was a big deal when that happened. The news tried to say it was a sun dog, but that would not explain this away by any means because a sun dog is just a little rainbow spot. This was no rainbow. The sun turned strait black.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I just figure they might be spraying something to keep activity at the base from being seen by satellites.  That’s my take on what I have experienced locally. I’ve never really seen it or noticed it outside my area.

       I’ve always wondered why it can be so prevalent for a while and then die out for a while. Where I am, there is a nuclear power plant. They always spray around that area, and then it blows over towards me. I always sort of suspected maybe it’s a means of preventing visibility of certain areas?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting event was a few years back, we had a city wide panic when the sun turned black. They had been spraying a lot over the previous 2 months, and one day it was exceptionally heavy. So much so, it blocked out the sun making it look outright black and similar, but not as strong as an eclipse... no joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police got a ton of phone calls in as a result. People were freaked because it looked nothing like normal cloud coverage covering the sun. It was the top story on the news as they tried to explain it, saying it was a sun dog... which is not even remotely close to an explanation as sun dogs are rainbow spots in the sky close to the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also have a local weather guy who used to be in the military and one time, the lines of clouds came up in the radar (they do somewhat regularly) but this time he said it was controlled spraying of metallic particles used by the military and not a natural formation of clouds. And he said he sees this regularly on the radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, something is definitely up. We also have a military base close by, so it might be a result of that? I know I don’t like it and doubt spraying is good practice to do. Perhaps it keeps us safe from immediate threats? There is got to be a good reason for them to spend money on doing it, but I highly doubt it’s healthy or really in our best interest.

      <p>
       I think climate scientists would say that we're coming out of an ice age. Because "ice age" doesn't mean that everything is frozen like those cartoon movies. Wikipedia says it means "the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers." See:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age

      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, our colloquial concept of what "ice age" means isn't really accurate.
