       He's (likely) remarking on how everyone who is anti-trump is sick of Trump Spam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I find it sad how all of a sudden this place has become a platform for TPTB through this crap, since we know no one becomes president without their stamp of approval. There is no 4D Chess: Trump, like Obama before him and Bush before him, is beholden to greater powers, and many of us are sick of having to comb through T_D spam. There is a sub to suck his dick in, why do they need every sub to do the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: a poster wrote that the Covfefe thing was a master plan by Trump when a bill came out with that name, then when it turned out it was a troll by his opponents the poster spun a new take where Trump trolls the trolls with their own bill (by firing the press corps, people who don't work for him.) That is Trump spam, and I'm happy to talk with a Trumper, by that sort of low quality garbage does not belong here.

       I think the evidence is overwhelming that Trump was not supposed to win.  2017 was a year of panic and upheaval as a result.  Whether you are a Trump supporter or hater, the entire world was against him: corporations, media, foreign governments.  That leads to the sentiment that this guy can do some good, if not for the simple fact that he interrupted the script.

       He may not have been supposed to win, but he was still a choice of the ruling class (of which he is a member.) Trump was given a caretaker, Mike Pence, who is the biggest piece of evidence that Trump was never in control. Why would Trump ever pick Pence on his own? He wouldn't. Pence is not a friend of his, Pence is a career politician who's role is to keep Things rolling how they want them to. When things go off the rails Pence steps in, such as during the transition. Trump may not have been their first choice, he was their second choice, which is why he was in the running.

       People like to pretend the networks gave him all that coverage for ratings; that's just a façade, they gave him that coverage to make him a viable candidate. Using an Agenda Setting theory framework we know that the news gives us what to think
       <strong>
        <em>
         about,
        </em>
       </strong>
       not what to think. So when they show Trump every day people think
       <strong>
        <em>
         about
        </em>
       </strong>
       him. "Bad" candidates get no coverage which is the biggest hurdle to victory, because no one will evaluate you of they never think about you.

       I think we can also mention that there is a significant amount of genuine censorship against t_d. While you want to complain about muhopinion, truth is t_d has been actively suppressed and multiple subreddits were created specifically for anti trump spam (which we are all aware of). You can still find users clamoring for t_d to get banned or shutdown which is real censorship, but hey, maybe you have actual evidence of this mythical conservative censorship instead of muhfeelings.

       What do you mean? Please explain. I said we protect free speech. If someone is using their words to try and end free speech we counter those words with logic and reason. Is this what you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance someone is exercising their free speech so they could end free speech. Then I would fight for him to be able to say it and counter this individual. I would have to hear his reason as to why he wants to end free speech that way I can counter his points.

       Perhaps if we lived in Leibniz' "best of all possible worlds," but unfortunately we do not.

      <p>
       We've watched this idea fail before: In the 1800's German Romantics were saying that we were evolving and moving towards progress, that the age of reason and culture was coming while barbarism was waning. Then in the 1900's these same Romantics words were used as tools to drive Germany back to barbarism.
      </p>

       Look at the failures of the early communists (specifically those who didn't believe in a central party like those in Berlin.) They believed that people would realize the truth of communism organically, and yet the people never had time to consider the truth because the communists were brutally slaughtered by the fascists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic does not necessarily win out ever. Hoping people will just "give way to reason" is naive to the facts of history. As the priest warned Zarathustra, the people do not want to hear some truth, just something to lighten their burden.

       So what you want us to concede our own ideology. Give way to censorship. Is this what you purpose? No I will stand tall and weigh in. I will not cower. If they do not give in to reason. So be it. but they will have to strike me down. Before I concede. I will champion freedom. Now and forever. I was not wise enough to know before. I was not brave enough.

       German Republicans knew what Hitler was, they knew what he wanted, and they allowed him and his Nazi Party to flourish. Von Hindenburg is complicit in the atrocities committed by the Nazis, as is everyone who allowed his Nazis to continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're in a similar spot today. Allowing fascists and racists to flourish is never a good idea. We can make the choice that Von Hindenburg did not, we can stop the hate now.

       All rights including freedom of speech include certain levels of both responsibility and care. There is a big difference between preventing someone from criticizing their society, and preventing someone from advocating for the genocide of a people. The latter's speech is violating the rights of their subject by calling for an act violating their right to life, and as such is not protected speech.

       And how today is advocating for genocide? Who is doing that? What kind of speech is getting censored? Is it genocidal speech only? Is it speech that is trying to incite violence? What is more comparable to Nazi Germany? A land in which you can speak your mind and have differing opinion. A land that tolerated hate. Of their leaders of their citizens. Where everyone was free to speak their mind. Or one in which everybody has to conform to what is popular. They have to tolerate the opinion of the majority, but anything outside the opinion of the majority will not be tolerated. Where you aren't free to express yourself unless it is in alignment with the majority. So you better get in line if you want to participate. Through your identity out the window. We tell you how to act. We will tell you how to dress. We will tell you have to talk.

       Yes, those are the primary forms of speech being censored. From what I remember right wing terrorists have committed far more acts of violence, and killed more people than Muslims or leftist in the US have in the last few years

       This is the world of fascism. This is the world I want to stamp out. As I said, criticism is protected speech, incitement to violence against people, or violations of their rights is not. Someone who violates other's rights has violated the Social Contract, and is not then a recipient of protection under it. We can be civil and decide not to do terrible things to them, but allowing them to continue their criminal activities negates any semblance of morality.

       What I am doing is applying what we've seen to our current situation. I hate relying on common topoi, but those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it. We've literally seen a similar situation destroy a continent, why would we turn à blind eye to the lessons of the past?
      </p>
      <p>
       I will stress again. Speech which calls for a violation of someone else's rights (outside of appropriate circumstances such as a judge sentencing someone for a crime) is NOT protected free speech. It is an encroachment just like the act itself, and we should not encourage people to participate in this form of speech by allowing it and giving it a forum. Conspiracy to commit murder is a perfect example of this as something with which to sentence these people with. This goes in all directions, punching a Nazi is wrong, unless that person has previously advocated violence against people like saying something like: "For us, it is conquer or die. This is a unique burden for the white man, that our fate is entirely in our hands." which relinquishes his rights within the modern American society by calling for violence calling for the "conquer" of others.

       If a person shoots someone it is a violation of their right to life yes? If someone goes on the radio and tells everyone "you should shoot x" and x is shot, is that person who called for the act not responsible in their death? Their act if speech was the cause of someone's rights being infringed upon; why would it be that only the actions can be right or wrong, if a general gives the order for slaughter of civilians is he not equally responsible as the finger that pulled the trigger?

       I have given you example, points of contention, and you don't address any in specificity. You have yet to demonstrate any way in which your irresponsible formulation of freedom of speech works or is a positive, but have instead relied on scarecrows for your opposition and have repeated common topoi over and over. "Look I'm fighting for free speech.... No I will stand tall and weigh in. I will not cower. If they do not give in to reason...." and then the whole thing about censor-America being more similar to the lead up to Nazi Germany. In the latter case I pointed out that tolerance of hate (or the reciprocal to your position) is the cause of Fascism and Oppression in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am giving you a very clear position for us to talk about: Speech which advocates violence is an act of violence. Acts of violence are not protected rights (you don't have a right to kill anyone you want) so violent speech acts are not protected.
      </p>
      <p>
       My original question was "do we protect the speech of someone who wants to end free speech." you said yes, we just have yo be patient. I gave you an example of such a situation (the Weimar Republic's allowance of Nazis) and additionally I pointed to a situation where patient people ended with a bunch of dead people at the Hand's of people who do not want freedom (Berlin 1919.) I twisted nothing, but responded to your points, and yet you do not hit on the question of violence I've been asking.

       But it doesn't demand responsibility it trust, that others will be responsible. We show them how to trust, by trusting them. The way you put it is as if we can never trust one another to do the responsible thing.

       The price of freedom of speech, is to address the things we don't want to hear. Not to silence them. You only hide the fucking problem don't you get it. It doesn't make the hate go away. It hides it. You can't silence hate. You only hide it.

       But the act of silencing it
       <em>

       eliminating it. It can only spread because we let it, cops protecting a clan rally is protecting/promoting this hate. If we tell them they cannot advocate anything which would violate someone's rights and they do then we don't use the state to protect them. They have violated the Social Contract so they have chosen to not be a part of society.

       You have ignored me thusfar. If you get anything out of this conversation, please take this: Read the source material. What Jeffeson, Maddison or whomever right about about Free speech should also be considered next to Locke. I can explain these positions to you, but it's better that you just read them yourself. Also Read Nietzsche, Marx, read Sartre, De Beauvoir, Camus, Thoreau. All of these Authors will should give you very interesting points to consider as you are growing as a person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immanuel Kant credits Hume very prominently for tearing him from a state of dogmatism. Kant, like many of his peers, was stuck in a continental philosophic perspective which refused to question itself. By looking at Hume's criticisms of what Kant believed, Kant was awaken to write some of the most important work ever. Whether you like Kant or not, his work can't be ignored, and came from him considering, and then working through criticisms of his beliefs.

       I've done a lot of self reflection. I've much to grow still yet. But I can't and wont be persuade to believe that censoring hate speech is the way forward. Because it is a subjective mater. And it will morph as to what is considered hate speech.

       Half the user base wants to shit on anyone who disagrees with them and tell them how terrible they are. It’s happened to me a few times in the past week. I’ve tried a few different methods for responding to them. Sadly, outright trolling seems to be the most effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Answering them earnestly and treating them like human beings just encourages them to spew more hatred, and they are entirely unwilling to even consider anything that goes against the narrative they are hell-bent on protecting and projecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s almost as bad as
       <a href="/r/incels">
        /r/incels

       used to be, honestly. I can only assume these people (not all of the sub, not even most, but certainly a vocal minority) actually prefer the sub as an echo chamber and reinforcement exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s strange but also quite interesting that there are people out there who can damn near hate you for disagreeing with them about what would seem to be something completely subjective, but alas.

       Who cares if they hate you. Let the vitriol be seen, so we can bare witness to the human condition in all it's forms. So we can grow to understand one another. You overcome the hate not silence it. We grind our gears. We work at it to convince. We are all born in ignorance.

       We must learn that is the beauty. They have to be heard. Not hidden.

       Not gonna happen as long as they have the upvote/downvote system, shills can mass downvote the good stuff until it's out of sight and out of mind.

       Ha! Are you really that butthurt over the Q “fire truck” post that got deleted bc it didn’t have a submission statement? It was a dumb post and many around here are sick of the Qtard bullshit and Daddy trump worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       The removal of that post was not censorship. It was just a picture of Trump in front of a fire truck and had no substance for discussion whatsoever. Get over it:)

       This is not what it is, but you a free to express this opinion. I am butthurt if you will on the rise of censorship on the internet and on this forum. That is my point can you counter this point?
