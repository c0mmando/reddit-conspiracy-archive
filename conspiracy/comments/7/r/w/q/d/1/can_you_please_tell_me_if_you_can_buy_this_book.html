<p>the important part in the book (though there are many others) is that the REAL reason for WW2 was actually that Germany AND Japan HAD ALREADY started to print their own money.  therefore they not only had to be stopped but had to be made an example of.</p>

<p>do you see?   this is the answer.   if enough people knew... then one day we could make it happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an enormous difference between government issued value-based currency and central bank issued debt-based currency.</p>

<p>The former is <em>ex-tra-eeeeemly</em> damaging to the latter.  </p>

<p>You see, the true rulers of the world have established and to this day maintain control of world affairs through control of the monetary supply.  Central banks like the Federal reserve, bank of England, bank of Australia, etc are all owned by the same small clique of shareholders who use these institutions to - quite literally - make &quot;money&quot; out of thin air and lend it to governments, corporations, and individuals <em>at interest</em>.  That is, the money is issued as a unit of <em>debt</em> rather than of value. </p>

<p>This has two really really significant implications, about which entire books could be (and have been) written.  The first implication is pretty obvious; that the &quot;governments&quot; we normally perceive as running the show are actually puppet states, always beholden to their creditors.  The second implication is less obvious, but no less consequential; <em>at all times, more money is owed to central banks than actually exists</em>.  This itself implies that the borrowers (everyone in the world who doesn&#39;t own a bank) can never collectively get out of debt as long as the monetary system remains stable.  And, (thankfully), that the system itself is not sustainable indefinitely.  That is, the scheme can&#39;t work for ever.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t do stuff to perpetuate the game for a while at a time.  Some of this stuff is visible on the surface although cleverly disguised; things like fed control of interest rates allows TPTB (the powers that be, if you&#39;re unfamiliar with the acronym) to do their best to stabilize markets and keep the game rolling.  Injecting economic liquidity (which literally means making a bunch of new money, and lending it out) allows TPTB to kind of paper-over otherwise catastrophic periods of high default.  &quot;Bailouts&quot; accomplish exactly the same thing - it&#39;s all designed to keep the global con-game rolling.</p>

<p>Anyway, and to the original point, TPTB also employ methods of control that are substantially less visible to the public.  They do things like install puppet politicians, assassinate loud dissadents, and yes, orchestrate wars.  In particular, we can point to the assassinations of both Lincoln and Kennedy, who each tried to bring about the use of a <em>government issued, value-based currency</em>, which of course would obviously undermine and ultimately destroy the banker&#39;s current Monopoly on the very enterprise of money creation.  Other examples include both world wars (as OP mentioned), and 9/11, which kicked off the &quot;war on terror&quot; and basically gave TPTB a blank congressional check to use the US armed forces to do whatever they want in any country they want.  And what have we seen since then?  The overthrow of any and all major players who were trying to get around the global stranglehold of petro-dollar hegemony.  (Iraq, Libya, Egypt, etc) and current attempts on Syria, with future moves in the works against Iran and Russia.</p>

<p>All major geopolitical events for at least the last couple centuries are tied back to the money creation con game, which is now more or less functionally global.  A very small group of people own the central banks of every major first world nation, and those people have spent centuries honing their ability to manipulate world events to keep themselves at the very top of the world power structure.</p>

<p>Anyway - if what the OP claims is true, then it makes very much sense that WWII was at least in part deliberately orchestrated for the specific purpose of quashing a monetary system which would seriously threaten TPTB.  We&#39;ve seen literally the exact same thing happen this century with the invasion of Iraq.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the RBA&#39;s own webpage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The RBA provides certain banking services as required to the Australian Government and its agencies, and to a number of overseas central banks and official institutions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/about-rba/">https://www.rba.gov.au/about-rba/</a></p>

<p>If the reserve bank of Australia is part of the Australian government, then why does the Australian government have to borrow money from RBA??  The very phrasing of the above paragraph proves that the RBA is a completely separate institution, not a part of the Australian treasury.  It works the same way in almost every developed nation.</p>

<p><em>CENTRAL BANKS ARE BANKS!</em> Not part of your government.</p>
