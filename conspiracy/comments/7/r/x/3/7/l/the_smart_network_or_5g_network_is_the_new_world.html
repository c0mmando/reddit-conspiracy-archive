    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been studying this for a couple months now and I agree...we are walking into full enslavement.  This is the endgame.  The problem is there is nothing we can do to stop it...the technology is already there in your home and in your car.  Look into &quot;spectrum reallocation&quot; and &quot;TV white spaces&quot;.  Basically they figured out a way to get broadband from unused TV frequencies.  Microsoft is leading the way:</p>

<p><a href="http://whitespaces.microsoftspectrum.com/">http://whitespaces.microsoftspectrum.com/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/07/10/rural-broadband-strategy-connecting-rural-america-new-opportunities/">https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/07/10/rural-broadband-strategy-connecting-rural-america-new-opportunities/</a></p>

<p>Also, you already have a &quot;smart&quot; car.  Any car built mid &#39;90s or later has OBD-II system in it.  This is what those stupid diagnostic dongles plug into that cell phone companies are selling everyone.  All it would take is the government to require everybody to have one of those to get their car registered and voila...everybody now has a smart car.  </p>

<p>It blows my mind how people don&#39;t see through the FCC and Microsoft&#39;s ambitious goal to get broadband to rural parts of the country.  Here&#39;s Microsoft&#39;s white paper on their rural strategy using TV white spaces:</p>

<p><a href="https://msblob.blob.core.windows.net/ncmedia/2017/07/Rural-Broadband-Strategy-Microsoft-Whitepaper-FINAL-7-10-17.pdf">https://msblob.blob.core.windows.net/ncmedia/2017/07/Rural-Broadband-Strategy-Microsoft-Whitepaper-FINAL-7-10-17.pdf</a></p>

<p>One notable quote:</p>

<p>&quot;The TV white spaces spectrum is great for: last-mile wireless broadband access; in-building and in-home coverage; and the Internet of Things (IoT).&quot;</p>

<p>Do you really think the FCC and Microsoft would spend billions of dollars just because they feel bad that a bunch of Trump supporters in rural America don&#39;t have broadband?  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong...5G is part of it.  But this has been in place for decades and they have just been slowly conditioning us all to accept it.  5G is what they&#39;re going to use to get everyone to willingly submit because they can download a movie in 3 seconds or have their fridge read their schedule to them.  I mean just look at some of the comments in this thread...</p>
