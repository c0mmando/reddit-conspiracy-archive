        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After the meteor that fell last week in Michigan, I have been sitting on my porch in my free time and watching the sky. My dad told me that meteors don&#39;t usually fall in &#39;just 1&#39;s&#39; and that they fall as groups over a varying area.</p>

<p>So last week I snapped one falling and thought &quot;neat, he was right! This is a nice photo&quot; and thought nothing of it. </p>

<p>Here it is <a href="https://imgur.com/2RBmSZX">https://imgur.com/2RBmSZX</a></p>

<p>But what happened yesterday has alarm bells going off in my head. At the very least, we are being kept in the dark about something big.</p>

<p>Yesterday an even bigger group of these things fell, and super close to my house, I was so shocked that I just kind of stared before taking a picture <a href="https://imgur.com/0GkqiEL">https://imgur.com/0GkqiEL</a></p>

<p>After these things fell (about 5 pieces total) There were helicopters flying around for a good two hours. I was pretty freaked out and just went inside until I couldn&#39;t hear them anymore. Now I&#39;m kicking my own ass for not taking pics of them.</p>

<p>This was all around 6pm yesterday in Southwest Baltimore. I went to my friends online yesterday curious to know if they had seen everything and the only thing they saw was the helicopters unfortunately.</p>

<p>But what REALLY started getting my thinking that something is happening and we are not being told what, is what my friend posted from Norfolk Virginia Saturday Afternoon: </p>

<p>Objects shooting up, straight into the sky &#39;like rocket ships&#39; nowhere near an airport, no where near a center of some sort to chalk these up to, we still have no idea what the fuck they were, but they were shocking enough for everyone around him to stop what they were doing and stare and point for a good 30 mins.</p>

<p>Maybe you guys know? <a href="https://imgur.com/tMhnmgp">https://imgur.com/tMhnmgp</a></p>

<p>Apologies if this post is all over the place, I don&#39;t usually post here but thought this info would be good for people who might be looking into this recent activity, hope it helps!</p>

<p>***A quick edit. I&#39;m chatting with my friend who&#39;s in Baltimore too and told him I was posting about what we all saw yesterday. He wanted me to add that Saturday morning, him and his neighbors saw 5 aircraft, in perfect alignment, fall/flying straight down. They were pretty close and looked like normal planes and were leaving very little/no vapor trails as they fell. He didn&#39;t take pics, but he said people on the street were definitely taking them because they all said &#39;it looks like military stuff&#39;. Maybe they posted them somewhere online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know.  they all just look like different perspectives of vapor trails or clouds, but I think people may be unaware of how shooting stars are. Sure catching one in the day is rarer than at night, but it isn&#39;t because of frequency. For myself, hanging out at night somewhere with low light pollution and clear skies, I&#39;ll notice 3-4 on average a night. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you can’t just snap a picture of a shooting star, it happens way too fast. By the time you pressed the button the shooting star would be gone. Second, if you can see a meteor during the day, it’s gonna be huge and a lot of people are gonna see it. Not just this one guy. The whole story is clearly made up. </p>

<p>Awesome sight.  It lit up and stayed lit for about 2.5 second.  Green debris literally exploded off of it as it fell.  Until it eventually became a thin white streak that fell into the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. Even this is understated.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in Australia and on any given night I can walk out into my paddock and stare at a single spot in the sky for 15 minutes and more often then not I will see a shooting star right where I was looking. Have done it multiple times. If I where to include the entire sky from horizon to horizon there would be at at least a hundred a night.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only ever seen a few big, significant ones in my whole life though. Only 5 or 6 that I have seen lasted more then half a second. It would make my bucket list to see one almost touch the ground and light up the sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bet you won&#39;t. What a wondrous sight. I am truly jealous. I was in the Rocky Mountains in Canada In 2012 and I saw a huge bright green meteor flash across the sky and then went behind a mountain. I&#39;m sure if I was in the right place I may have heard the boom, or even see it touch down. It was on my mind for weeks. Seeing one so close to the ground must be staggering odds! Very lucky</p>

<p>This stuff was out of the ordinary enough to get my fairly normal friends to stop what they were and take pictures, post it on social media. And I know the pictures are shit, but the first two are of very bright &#39;something&#39; burning up in the atmosphere and leaving very big fiery trails. That coupled with all the helicopters swarming the area afterwards made me want to at least tell people about it.</p>
