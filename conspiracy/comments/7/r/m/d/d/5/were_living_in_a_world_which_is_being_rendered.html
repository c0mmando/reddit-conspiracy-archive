       Increasingly I sense that the world is becoming nonsensical, where the idea of taking things for their true meaning has fallen by the wayside. Many elements of Orwell's 1984 have turned out to be prophetic, and one element in particular is the way language and concepts have become twisted to the point that they are almost useless. In the novel, The Party dictates that "War is peace; freedom is slavery; ignorance is strength", and history is constantly rewritten so that people don't see how the current positions of the party often come to contradict their past ones. It may not have become quite as extreme as this in the real world, but I certainly notice plenty of contradictions and nonsensical positions that have become accepted as part of modern society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some examples of this:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hillary Clinton is often considered left-wing, despite the fact she is a neoliberal, globalist hawk, a long, long way away from leftism.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump is treated as a paragon of the modern conservative right, or even the far-right/alt-right, despite the fact he was once a democrat who supported legalised abortion, marijuana legalisation being a state issue, and who was once quoted as saying “I like the idea of amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include a ban of discrimination based on sexual orientation. It would be simple”. I'm not saying Trump isn't right-wing now, he clearly is. But the idea that he is has so swiftly become a contemporary
         <em>
          paragon
         </em>
         of the right, someone who wholeheartedly represents the ideals of the modern hard-right, is a harder pill to swallow. It feels much more like he is simply doing whatever he can to gain money and power.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The idea that Trump is "anti-establishment". I can see that he is outside of the political establishment to some degree, but the Trump family has been an influential part of the elite long before Trump was even alive. If this is what is considered outside of the establishment then it's depressingly clear that the scope is extremely narrow. Or maybe the "anti-establishment" line is all just an empty piece of manipulation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The concept that Brexit was a right-wing movement. Back in the 80s, the EU was widely derided by the left and far-left. The likes of Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn represented the most traditionally left-wing side of the Labour party, and they were not shy to share their grievances with the EU. The politics of the EU has changed little since then, and yet now we're made to believe that supporting the EU is actually a left-wing thing, and criticising it is something only the right or far-right would do. How an unelected group of neoliberal bankers bullishly ruling Europe is possibly supposed to fit in with leftism is never explained, but nonetheless every left-wing newspaper supports the EU wholeheartedly. On the other hand, many of the areas with the most leave voters are Labour strongholds. This is largely ignored by the MSM.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Muslims are one of the most powerful forces of conservatism in the world, and yet in the West their most staunch defenders are liberals, and their most fierce attackers are the far-right. Moreover, left-wingers and liberals often state that Islam "is a religion of peace", as if this is actually the religion's tagline. In reality it's a neologism which was invented by George Bush's speech writer, and the religion's prophet was someone who, according to Islamic texts,
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Banu_Qurayza">
          slaughtered hundreds of Jews and enslaved their wives.
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         So-called liberals are perhaps the worst offenders when it comes to
         <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/nine-10-uk-universities-free-speech-restrict-rankings-joseph-rowntree-cardiff-ediburgh-newcastle-a7577381.html">
          censorship in universities.
         </a>
         Free-speech is of course a fundamental tenet of liberalism.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's becoming increasingly common to find self-proclaimed leftists who support globalism and see anti-globalism as a right-wing ideal. Globalism couldn't possibly fit into leftism less. It means the working man has to complete with the effective slavery that can be found in many third-world countries. It leads to corporations becoming incredibly big and incredibly powerful. It makes tax dodging easier. And yet, many so-called leftists think it fits perfectly into leftism, and looking at the MSM, it's easy to see how they have been brainwashed into thinking this.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I could keep going, but I think I'll finish there. I suppose my last point is that in a world where terms and concepts become meaningless, where context is often forgotten, it becomes impossible to have meaningful discussions. Without the ability to properly communicate, we are powerless. Perhaps this is all part of a larger plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: A couple of other classics would of course be Kissinger winning the Nobel Peace Prize, and Blair being made Middle East Peace Envoy, although they are less current. Still, it all set the stage for the world we live in now.

       I agree with a lot of your points. I've noticed the diminished usefulness for our language to convey meaning whenever I try to discuss non state, libertarian socialism. People think the word is an oxymoron because they've been raised to believe that all socialism is state socialism. They resist with emotion based arguments when I illustrate that this is not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good portion of the time people end up agreeing with my thoughts and the ideas I educate them on, but then they go "well it should be called something else then because it's not socialism." But it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Individualist anarchists vs State socialists has been
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       debate, the main source of schism within socialism, for over a hundred and fifty years. But people are completely clueless about this debate. I can't help but think it's intentional, because people's perception of the word "socialism" as inherently state based makes it almost impossible to discuss in right leaning circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.s. I'm not going to argue with anyone who wants to be all "but all socialism IS state socialism!" You're absolutely, irrefutably incorrect and I'm sick of wasting my life on people who can't read.

       Any which do not take into consideration Orwell's personal politics are not worth discussion. He was against the authoritarianism of state socialism. Trying to make his work have an anti socialist message
       <em>
        in general
       </em>
       in light of that fact is delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the essay I linked, your question doesn't make sense because it comes from the perspective that I'm talking about- that all socialism is state socialism and consequently based on collectivism under the state. Tucker's essay will explain things and I'd wager good money that almost everyone in this sub will find some point of agreement when he gets to discussing the anarchists' views on "the four monopolies."

       You're frustrating the fuck out of me because you're doing literally the exact same thing I said people do in my very first post. You latch on to "socialism" and argue any and every point from the perspective that all socialism is

       Yeah, I'm the one with the blind spot because I've read more of Orwell than Animal Farm and 1984 (complete with a grade school dictation that the point is "socialism bad!").

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Socialism means a classless society, or it means nothing at all. And it was here that those few months in the militia were valuable to me. For the Spanish militias, while they lasted, were a sort of microcosm of a classless society. In that community where no one was on the make, where there was a shortage of everything but no privilege and no bootlicking, one got, perhaps, a crude forecast of what the opening stages of socialism might be like. And, after all, instead of disillusioning me it deeply attracted me. The effect was to make my desire to see socialism established much more actual than it had been before.”

       Homage to Catalonia, of course, refers to his time spent in the POUM militia fighting Franco's forces in Spain. It was from there that he began to hold the disdain for Marxism that he wrote into later works..

       Just stop arguing with me for five seconds and read the Benjamin Tucker essay I linked above.
       <em>
        Read what he has to say about Marxism
       </em>
       . Read what he has to say about anarchism.

       I'm done discussing this further, I already said in my first post that I wasn't going to waste my time with you people but here we are.

       Do you think step2jep has read Orwell’s works more than maybe a casual reading of 1984?
      </p>
      <p>
       But please note that he linked to a random video that was made by John le bonn. He tries to disprove missiles by a misapplying physics.. well step2jep is John le bon and exclusively links to John le bonn content...  most of this content tries to direct you to John le bonns site where all the content costs $20+ per month. Most of his claims are sensational but lack substance and if anyone disagree he calls them normies or conspiritards (people in this sub).
      </p>
      <p>
       His argument style is a mixture of condescension, moving goal posts, asking for impossible proof, ad hominem attacks and latching onto some tiny part of your argument he thinks he can undermine...
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically you are arguing with a shill who is trying to promote his paid website. He tried to post videos directly but got few upvotes so he now does this.

        I could keep going, but I think I'll finish there. I suppose my last point is that in a world where terms and concepts become meaningless, where context is often forgotten, it becomes impossible to have meaningful discussions. Without the ability to properly communicate, we are powerless. Perhaps this is all part of a larger plan.

       You see this kind of crap here all the time. Brainlets like to accuse people of playing "word games" when someone uses a word or phrase in a way that they don't like or understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Words are naturally meaningless on their own. Take the word "bridge." It probably conjures the image of a construction that spans a gap in order to facilitate traffic. But if I talk about the bridge in your mouth, it's clear that that meaning isn't applicable here. The bridges in your PC are another example. Even though there are plenty of buses in there, I imagine there is little foot or automotive traffic across your motherboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these things are bridges, but what saves the word from incoherence is the context in which they're used. "Bridge" describes different things whether two architects are using it as opposed to two dentists.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the root of this linguistic flexibility are their proscribed meanings. Even though they're the same word, the definitions placed onto it can vary because of these previously established contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The incoherence described in the op takes advantage on the ambiguity created by the
       <em>
        implication
       </em>
       of a previously established context. This is used in particular regarding political terms. "Socialism" is a word that's been rendered almost meaningless by this process, as the American media uses it as a nebulous scare-word to try and convince people that whatever they're describing is bad. This utility is impossible if "socialism" is given any sort of concrete definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Capitalism" is another example. By abstracting everything "good" as a result of capitalism and everything bad as a result of socialism, these complex socio economic relationships are reduced to "everything I like" and "everything I don't like." Despite being an arch neoliberal that saved the entire global capitalist economy from imploding in on itself in 2008, he was derided as a socialist for making corporations pay for their employees' health care. It's nonsense that appears coherent only if the people listening have no idea what any of these words mean, and that ignorance is exploited to create a semantic shell game where objective analysis becomes impossible. Critique of Obama and his policies is made impossible and is reduced to the filter of "do I like it/him or do I not."
      </p>
      <p>
       You see a lot of clowns whinging about post modernism or cultural Marxism with similar results. They can't define either in any coherent way and so they become "whatever I don't like," ironically engaging in post modern applications of discerning and assigning meaning. But they don't know that, because they don't know what either of those things are, and most aren't interested in studying them because they "know" that they're bad, either because they've been told our through inference. Post modern analysis suffuses their culture and even their way of thinking to the point that they don't even notice, an they never will because they've never bothered to create any kind of proper context around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is all of this deliberate? Not all, probably. Much of it is just a "happy accident" as far as established authority is concerned. But they're more than willing to capitalize on and less than eager to correct the cultural confusion created by this absence of understanding. They've done The Party one better. They don't have to rewrite history or redefine anything, because they've exploded the concept of meaning entirely, and most people don't even realize it.
