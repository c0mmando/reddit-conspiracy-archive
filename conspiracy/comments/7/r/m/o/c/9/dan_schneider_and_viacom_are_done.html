    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is mocking the victims.</p>

<p>All the things you wrote are unspeakable realities we need to speak about, but who the fuck wants to speak about those things? We use dark humor about tragedies because if we didn&#39;t make tasteless jokes, we wouldn&#39;t talk about the things that depress us all at all, allowing this terrible reality to fester inside us like a cancer. Jokes are a non-violent outlet for our frustrations. Victimsof trauma often joke about their lot themselves, because they need to talk about things nobody wants to hear or they&#39;ll explode. Same thing applies.</p>

<p>Uh, no. <strong>No.</strong> Victims get to poke fun at or make fun of experiences they have had - you don&#39;t. It&#39;s not your place to do that. You didn&#39;t go through the trauma and hurt, you don&#39;t get to make jokes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, no. </p>

<p>We are mocking a tragedy because the thing we really would wanna do (lynch the motherfuckers who act out unspeakable abuses against the most vulnerable among us) is unfortunately illegal. So we have a choice of either ignoring reality (most people chose this path, understandably so), swallowing it whole where it turns into anger and resentfulness which will eventually bubble up again and unjustly hurt someone we love, or we can say the truth out loud, which is also painful. </p>

<p>Packaging it in a sick joke is not the nicest thing to do, sure, but it&#39;s fucking understandable that we do it. And unless you can produce a victim whom we have offended, all you&#39;re doing is signalling your grand virtues. And fine, maybe you&#39;re better than us. Maybe you&#39;re more prepared to deal with these things than the rest of us, but some of us clearly need a sick laugh now and then, or we&#39;ll get ourselves lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>Clearly, we have different viewpoints on this, and I do respect yours. I just wish you didn&#39;t push it on others, as they need no justification or permission to laugh. That&#39;s tyranny.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we ARE in the same boat. Not just us but everyone who still has light in their lives. The fuckers that steal it are not all that many, and the inappropriate jokers are some of our strongest allies. Simply knowing that this shit occurs is fucking painful too, and we shouldn&#39;t assume that they joke for the wrong reasons. I certainly didn&#39;t get that impression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll find that I was not one of the users making jokes. I have a different way of dealing with tragedy, most of the time.</p>

<p>I have, however, studied enough psychology to know that learning tragic or disturbing things leaves a shadow on the soul, an aggression born from frustration, which spreads like cancer when we simply ignore it. Some folks go postal when confronted with such tragedy, others ignore it or rationalize it away. Making dark and twisted jokes about the matter is probably one of the healthier options.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you want evidence and to find the innocent kids who had their hair pulled tight, had him stick it inside her, had tears to see if they read degenerates comments and feel bad about it? If we find them will you read those understandable jokes to them to see how it made them feel?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s your bloody point, man? No I don&#39;t want Dan Schneider&#39;s victims to be forced to read and comment on those jokes. Reading them will make them as sick as simply watching iCarly in passing. Don&#39;t get offended for others, you have no idea how they&#39;re feeling. Chances are that they have made up worse names for Dan childfucker Schneider.</p>

<p>I think jokes isn&#39;t even the right word for this, because I don&#39;t think anyone laughs while writing or reading them. They are jokes with a punchline that&#39;s just fucking real. And that&#39;s more devasting than anything. But it&#39;s a tolerable outlet for the fucking vile things we all would much rather do to those assholes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s funny or appropriate about saying stick it inside her, pull her hair tighter in regards to pedophilia acts? How is that a joke? What&#39;s funny because the sick act rhythms with his last name. Do you guys have single digit IQ&#39;s?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bunch of idiots sitting around trying to think of specific sick terrible acts that may have actually happened to innocent kids and ruined their lives and trying to make them sound like his last name so they can laugh and feel apart of immature group.</p>

<p>Seriously the thought process is some dumb ass actually sitting there racking their brain to think of specific pedophilia acts that may have happened and turn that phrase into a rhyme of the guy&#39;s last name. No one with a mature healthy mindset is sitting around thinking of that shit for an upvote and a laugh.
How am I wrong? What&#39;s your take on the joke? Which ones does your mind find the funniest? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So where&#39;s the humor? Yeah, hundreds of unoriginal redditors doing the same lame meme group think chain done in every sub for post karma but this time detailing specific pedophilia acts that might have actually happened is the epitome of brilliant original dark humor.</p>

<p>So which one is your favorite and makes you laugh the most? What visuals do you get when reading that great dark humor joke? Man there&#39;s hundreds of local up and coming edgy comedians that are a part of the conspiracy forum all with the same joke. And here I mostly laugh at comments in this sub that are unintentional humorous and supposed to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>The funny thing is i&#39;m an equal opportunity offending screenwriter that mostly writes in the comedy genre. And am talking to management and agents with one of my comedy scripts mocking and satirizing Hollywood being passed around and talked about yet it&#39;s 12 yr old Redditor postwhores fishing for upvotes and trying to ft in that are the smart edgy comedians. Oh and they also just care about pedophilia so much and want it all taken seriously by the general public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re being so ridiculous about something that is ultimately subjective. People are just highlighting the fact that, from your comments at least, you can’t seem to grasp that joking about something horrible doesn’t equate to supporting something horrible. Everyone here surely agrees that what Dan Schneider is accused of doing is absolutely horrendous and vile. Jokes about it don’t change that. It’s clear that you can’t emotionally deal with them and that’s fine, neither can I as don’t find it particularly funny either but they’re just jokes and I can accept it’s probably not my brand of humour. </p>

<p>No it&#39;s not some sort of funny joke or satire or mocking of someone in a positive way. It&#39;s just unoriginal, wanting to be edgy and part of the crowd people taking some sort of meme someone else came up with which pretty much just takes child rape and ruined lives less seriously.</p>

<p>Thanks.  This is what I was trying to say.  It&#39;s a really terrible look for the sub to have a whole thread of these.  If one truly believes he&#39;s done these things I don&#39;t see how one could joke about it so distastefully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgive me for asking, but are you directly affiliated with that radio show and YouTube Channel, by chance?</p>

<p>If so...thank you so much for your recent interview with A. J. Benza. I used to work in Hollywood (literally and figuratively), years ago, and I thought that I possessed a very clear perception of who, specifically, all of the &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;bad guys&quot; were. However, I somehow <em>never knew</em> just how hostile a person Benza could be, or that he used to cover up for Weinstein&#39;s misdeeds. I was genuinely shocked at how aggressive and defensive he became, during the interview, and how poorly he handled the whole situation.</p>

<p>(If you aren&#39;t affiliated with the show, then I do apologize for mentioning the issue. I&#39;d recommend that everyone find and watch that interview, though; it&#39;s quite an eye-opener.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about specifics about something being &quot;wrong&quot; because it&#39;s extremely hard to confirm or deconfirm these things. The thing is there is WAYYYYYYY more that&#39;s been posted that hasn&#39;t been confirmed than things that have been. When half of hollywood is accused of doing various bad things, sometimes you&#39;ll get a hit. In other cases, there&#39;s public and semi-public rumors that are brought up, which I don&#39;t see as confirmations either. </p>

<p>Personally, I think the person/people behind CD&amp;N may have minor indirect hollywood connections and just hear stories and rumors, much of which may be embellished or purely made up, with some kernels of truth every now and then. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had minor connections myself at some points. I could&#39;ve told you a former child star is now a crackhead thief who sleeps on random couches, which wasn&#39;t known until he got arrested for meth possession a few months ago. I can tell you Ron Jeremy is a sexual predator (not surprising, I know, but I&#39;ve heard stories from women). But when it comes to child abuse and sex rings, there&#39;s just random suspicions and made-up rumors the same way we might talk about the creepy guy in the office.  </p>

<p>Sumner Redstone&#39;s on his last legs. iHeart Radio is hemorrhaging money and has been for a decade. Paramount has had bomb after bomb, is barely profitable, and talent doesn&#39;t trust them to put together a successful film. A large portion of their better executives have been chased out by the paranoid Redstone. </p>

<p>Either you don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on inside your own conglomerate or you&#39;re a propagandist. </p>

<p>What&#39;s coming has been a long time coming. But when it gets here, it&#39;s going to hit like Mike Tyson in his prime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how the article makes no mention of the exact names and places that are in reference within the article. Good way to avoid getting sued for slander. Which means the article is just made up. If there was any legitimacy in this, you’d name names. Leaving it up to the reader to assume it’s whoever gives you an escape plan to avoid that slander lawsuit. If there was any legitimacy to your claims, you’d put names and force the accused to defend themselves or sue you. Which then means you are either right or wrong and you’ve forced their hand to respond. </p>

<p>The pictures of Schneider are creepy, but you’ve provided zero proof in your “blog” post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dudddde. Like theres SO many connections of pedos that’re high up (from politicians to celebrities) this is CRAZY. 
It has me thinking about a doc I just watched on flix called “i am evidence” - basically about how police arent testing rape kits and there’s 10s of thousands built up around the country.... 
even our lawmakers and criminal justice systems don’t want justice for sexual assault (male or female/young or old)
Wow. Just wow. </p>

<p>Then i think about trump’s weird comment to his daughter on TV</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jokes about analing rape virgin children.
Jokes about tightening the tape holding children down so they can be raped by more people.
Jokes about killing a child during a rape and hiding their body.
Jokes about making a child take his cock.</p>

<p>These are what you&#39;re defending. And somehow, at the same time, claiming the moral high ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Pull her hair tighter&quot; &quot;stick it inside her&quot;.. HUR HUR group high five we totally got him and are taking this so seriously.
Who are these infantile sick fucks saying stick it in her, pull her hair regarding pedophilia as some funny joke?</p>

<p>No it&#39;s not some sort of funny joke or satire or mocking of someone in a positive way. It&#39;s just unoriginal, wanting to be edgy and part of the crowd people taking some sort of meme someone else came up with which pretty much just takes child rape and ruined lives less seriously.</p>

<p>I never seen any frustration just some lame group thinker repeating and wanting to be part of a lame inside joke. Where&#39;s the outrage and taking this seriously in these posts?</p>

<p>All these jokes that are just so mature and full of so much about outrage. Refer to the act of child rape in a joking matter. </p>
