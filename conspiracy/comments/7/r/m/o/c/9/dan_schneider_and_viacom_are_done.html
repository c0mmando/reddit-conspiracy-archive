       So Dan Schneider and Viacom are done because of and auto filling word on twitter, an ambiguous article from a site that provides zero proof, and a youtube video of a podcast? I think Schneider is a scum bag and would love to see him taken down, but c'mon. Also, when you talk like daddy it makes us all dumber.

       Let's not forget the immediate jokes about raping children that come out whenever Schneider is mentioned. Definitely makes the issue seem important and will certainly get others to demand justice for the children . . . right?

       Oh, yeah, it really makes you guys heroes, cracking those rape jokes. Really helping to spread the word and bring this guy down, not making light of his crimes and victims from a position where you're not affected by his crimes at all. Really fighting the good fight with comments about how he ties children down with duct tape or stick his cock in young people.

       Yeah, actually. It's a joke, sure, but it's full of anger and frustration. It's the only way to even process this shit. The actors our kids grow up with have been seriously abused and passed around like a cookie jar, by the people who create the stories our kids watch, often daily.

       If that shit doesn't make you mad as hell I just don't know what's up with you. And if you're mad as hell you better make jokes, because how else are you gonna calm down, stay sane and refrain from breaking things?

       Nobody is mocking the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the things you wrote are unspeakable realities we need to speak about, but who the fuck wants to speak about those things? We use dark humor about tragedies because if we didn't make tasteless jokes, we wouldn't talk about the things that depress us all at all, allowing this terrible reality to fester inside us like a cancer. Jokes are a non-violent outlet for our frustrations. Victimsof trauma often joke about their lot themselves, because they need to talk about things nobody wants to hear or they'll explode. Same thing applies.

       It sure sounds like you're mocking the victims. Making light of their experiences being anally raped, held down and forced to take multiple old men's cocks, tasered to death while being raped.

       Victims get to poke fun at or make fun of experiences they have had - you don't. It's not your place to do that. You didn't go through the trauma and hurt, you don't get to make jokes.

       We are mocking a tragedy because the thing we really would wanna do (lynch the motherfuckers who act out unspeakable abuses against the most vulnerable among us) is unfortunately illegal. So we have a choice of either ignoring reality (most people chose this path, understandably so), swallowing it whole where it turns into anger and resentfulness which will eventually bubble up again and unjustly hurt someone we love, or we can say the truth out loud, which is also painful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Packaging it in a sick joke is not the nicest thing to do, sure, but it's fucking understandable that we do it. And unless you can produce a victim whom we have offended, all you're doing is signalling your grand virtues. And fine, maybe you're better than us. Maybe you're more prepared to deal with these things than the rest of us, but some of us clearly need a sick laugh now and then, or we'll get ourselves lost in the darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, we have different viewpoints on this, and I do respect yours. I just wish you didn't push it on others, as they need no justification or permission to laugh. That's tyranny.

       I could same to you, my friend. But I wrote an edit in my previous comment, because I noticed that I got carried away in my own pain about the whole thing. I didn't mean to put you down in any way, and I'm sorry if I have.

       At the end of the day, we ARE in the same boat. Not just us but everyone who still has light in their lives. The fuckers that steal it are not all that many, and the inappropriate jokers are some of our strongest allies. Simply knowing that this shit occurs is fucking painful too, and we shouldn't assume that they joke for the wrong reasons. I certainly didn't get that impression.

       It's understandable why you do it, to get other low IQ folks to give you an upvote. So some immature folks can feel apart of some lame meme/group inside joke. To be an edgy brah.
      </p>
      <p>
       So do you guys actually visualize the specific child rape acts as you try to make them sound like his name and then refresh the page to see how man upvotes you get?
      </p>
      <p>
       So which specific rape act that might have happened to some traumatized kid that was turned into a joke did you find the funniest? What's your bet one?

       You'll find that I was not one of the users making jokes. I have a different way of dealing with tragedy, most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have, however, studied enough psychology to know that learning tragic or disturbing things leaves a shadow on the soul, an aggression born from frustration, which spreads like cancer when we simply ignore it. Some folks go postal when confronted with such tragedy, others ignore it or rationalize it away. Making dark and twisted jokes about the matter is probably one of the healthier options.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And you want evidence and to find the innocent kids who had their hair pulled tight, had him stick it inside her, had tears to see if they read degenerates comments and feel bad about it? If we find them will you read those understandable jokes to them to see how it made them feel?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What's your bloody point, man? No I don't want Dan Schneider's victims to be forced to read and comment on those jokes. Reading them will make them as sick as simply watching iCarly in passing. Don't get offended for others, you have no idea how they're feeling. Chances are that they have made up worse names for Dan childfucker Schneider.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think jokes isn't even the right word for this, because I don't think anyone laughs while writing or reading them. They are jokes with a punchline that's just fucking real. And that's more devasting than anything. But it's a tolerable outlet for the fucking vile things we all would much rather do to those assholes.

       Fair enough but we've both been around reddit enough to see this looks like what goes on in every forum. Redditors trying to be apart of an inside joke and meme comment chain for likes and to feel a part of the group. That's all this is but on such a serious subject matter these folks claim they care about.
      </p>
      <p>
       This same thing goes on in every sub except this time it's making light of pedophilia for likes and to be in on the inside "joke". It's not some coping mechanism, it's not mature people that truly care it's the usual immature redditor wanting to be a part of sub's joke/meme.

       That's certainly part of it, but it's rather an explanation for what I'm saying than a refutation. It's kinda weak and childish, no doubt, but it's also understandable. People feel fucking hopeless learn something as fucked up as a kids show producer routinely... You know, I don't even wanna get into it. Fucking sick motherfucker. So how to relief that frustration and anger? A hit of dopamine from a quick, angry, cynical circlejerk about that son of a bitch.

       What's funny or appropriate about saying stick it inside her, pull her hair tighter in regards to pedophilia acts? How is that a joke? What's funny because the sick act rhythms with his last name. Do you guys have single digit IQ's?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a bunch of idiots sitting around trying to think of specific sick terrible acts that may have actually happened to innocent kids and ruined their lives and trying to make them sound like his last name so they can laugh and feel apart of immature group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously the thought process is some dumb ass actually sitting there racking their brain to think of specific pedophilia acts that may have happened and turn that phrase into a rhyme of the guy's last name. No one with a mature healthy mindset is sitting around thinking of that shit for an upvote and a laugh.
How am I wrong? What's your take on the joke? Which ones does your mind find the funniest?

       So where's the humor? Yeah, hundreds of unoriginal redditors doing the same lame meme group think chain done in every sub for post karma but this time detailing specific pedophilia acts that might have actually happened is the epitome of brilliant original dark humor.
      </p>
      <p>
       So which one is your favorite and makes you laugh the most? What visuals do you get when reading that great dark humor joke? Man there's hundreds of local up and coming edgy comedians that are a part of the conspiracy forum all with the same joke. And here I mostly laugh at comments in this sub that are unintentional humorous and supposed to be taken seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is i'm an equal opportunity offending screenwriter that mostly writes in the comedy genre. And am talking to management and agents with one of my comedy scripts mocking and satirizing Hollywood being passed around and talked about yet it's 12 yr old Redditor postwhores fishing for upvotes and trying to ft in that are the smart edgy comedians. Oh and they also just care about pedophilia so much and want it all taken seriously by the general public.

       "What the fuck is wrong with you?" You don't find it funny in a thread supposedly angry about pedophilia when someone says pull her hair tighter, then someone else says stick it inside here then another says duct tape tighter like what happens in all these threads with these please upvote me for going along with the meme in the comment chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like wow, who the f are these weird people? Am I supposed to be peer pressured into accepting that? There's something wrong with me for not going along with this shit? And pointing out the hypocrisy, immaturity and how its exactly like every other post karma whoring memes done on this site usually regarding less serious subject matter d not be people simultaneously trying to shame the msm and sheep for not taking this stuff seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       LOL "what the fuck is wrong with you?" awesome. You can't make this stuff up.
Well I never, I'm so offended you don't see the point of laughing about the  "tongue in the shitter, hymen splitter"  comments in a thread supposedly outrage about pedophilia. Don't you see the mature brave caring point we're making with the "goes ham on a preteen clam" posts?

       You’re being so ridiculous about something that is ultimately subjective. People are just highlighting the fact that, from your comments at least, you can’t seem to grasp that joking about something horrible doesn’t equate to supporting something horrible. Everyone here surely agrees that what Dan Schneider is accused of doing is absolutely horrendous and vile. Jokes about it don’t change that. It’s clear that you can’t emotionally deal with them and that’s fine, neither can I as don’t find it particularly funny either but they’re just jokes and I can accept it’s probably not my brand of humour.

       "Pull her hair tighter" "stick it inside her".. HUR HUR group high five we totally got him and are taking this so seriously.
Who are these infantile sick fucks saying stick it in her, pull her hair regarding pedophilia as some funny joke?
      </p>
      <p>
       No it's not some sort of funny joke or satire or mocking of someone in a positive way. It's just unoriginal, wanting to be edgy and part of the crowd people taking some sort of meme someone else came up with which pretty much just takes child rape and ruined lives less seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never seen any frustration just some lame group thinker repeating and wanting to be part of a lame inside joke. Where's the outrage and taking this seriously in these posts?
      </p>
      <p>
       All these jokes that are just so mature and full of so much about outrage. Refer to the act of child rape in a joking matter.

       For me, it's not making light. It's the darkest of jokes, at his expense, to mock him and let him--and everyone else--know he's so well known as a rapist that there are running memes about it.
      </p>

       Some of us have been trying to alert the country about Dan Schneider for years. FOR YEARS. It gets frustrating. This is a lashing out, in a way, but I assure you the outrage is not feigned.

       It's not your place to make light of Dan Schneider and his crimes. It comes across like your, at best, not taking it seriously and, at worst, making fun of the victims. Either way, it's pretty disgusting.

       Again, I'm not making light of it. I'm disgusted and horrified about it, and I've been trying to tell people about Dan Schneider for almost a decade and nobody's really wanted to hear it. Now that people are finally waking up and unable to ignore what's been obvious for years and years, suddenly they've got righteous.
      </p>

       Get off your high horse. I've done more to bring awareness to people of the global pedophile control paradigm than you ever have or ever will, and it's come at expense of my career. I don't regret it, but I don't have to suffer the insults of a judgmental-come-lately like you, either.

       I'm not going to argue with you, but I don't find any of your excuses good enough for the jokes people are making.

      <p>
       Jokes about analing rape virgin children. Jokes about tightening the tape holding children down so they can be raped by more people. Jokes about killing a child during a rape and hiding their body. Jokes about making a child take his cock. Those are what you're defending.

       He's derailing the thread how?  99% of the comments in here are child rape jokes.

       How are the rape jokes truly about the victims?  Maybe this person is derailing a thread of rape jokes to make people think about the actual victims.

       Thanks.  This is what I was trying to say.  It's a really terrible look for the sub to have a whole thread of these.  If one truly believes he's done these things I don't see how one could joke about it so distastefully.

       Yeah, why does this happen every time Dan Schneider is mentioned? And only him? I guess it used to be clever but now it just seems like karma whoring, as well as a distraction from actual discussion on this.

       And these same people will absolutely screwer anyone in the media who makes distasteful jokes about a subject they think is sacrosanct. Yet when they do it, in a much more vulgar manner, it's "to bring attention to the issue."

       Forgive me for asking, but are you directly affiliated with that radio show and YouTube Channel, by chance?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so...thank you so much for your recent interview with A. J. Benza. I used to work in Hollywood (literally and figuratively), years ago, and I thought that I possessed a very clear perception of who, specifically, all of the "good guys" and the "bad guys" were. However, I somehow
       <em>
        never knew
       </em>
       just how hostile a person Benza could be, or that he used to cover up for Weinstein's misdeeds. I was genuinely shocked at how aggressive and defensive he became, during the interview, and how poorly he handled the whole situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       (If you aren't affiliated with the show, then I do apologize for mentioning the issue. I'd recommend that everyone find and watch that interview, though; it's quite an eye-opener.)

       It's amazing how widely known Schneider's crimes are now. I was out for pizza last week and the college girls at the table behind us were talking about it. How all their innocent memories of kids' TV were ruined now, but they also remembered how sometimes there were weird sexual jokes that seemed out of place, like some girl getting repeatedly slapped across the face with a sausage, which sounds impossible, but I don't know.

       I used to watch icarly because my 10 year old nephew thought it was the coolest show ever (at that time).
      </p>
      <p>
       The episode with the girls sticking their feet in the camera and wiggling their toes "for requests by their fans?".
      </p>

       Yeah that disturbed me a little bit, its obvious these girls are being pandered as sexual entity's.

       I used to watch iCarly with my kids as well. It was clever and funny, and I enjoyed it. The iCarly girl (Miranda Cosgrove, I think?) had a deft sense of comic timing and delivery. I enjoyed "Witches of Waverly Place," too, and thought Selena Gomez a reasonably talented young comedienne.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all those kids were being abused. I'm not sure I could watch them again.

       I may have misspoke. I don't necessarily think any of them are incorrect. I just mean to say I can't CONFIRM some of them. The hooker and the other network and a few other ones I just don't honestly care enough to know. They are minor details. But all of the actresses, Schneider, Redstone and Viacom all seem to fit perfectly. And this is coming from a guy who has been covering this for MONTHS. Dan Schneider day is coming!

       You reached out to me very doubtful, I reply to nearly ever inbox I get apart from one topic that received thousands of responses and I couldn't keep up with my inbox.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presuming I haven't done my research is poor form on your behalf, I've got plenty on Schneider but nobody seems to know where these rumours originated from if they do it's not common knowledge, hence the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, such a hostile response to such a basic question tells me everything I need to know about you, I'm pretty confident I know who you are and in honesty wouldn't want any information from you anyway.

       CDAN blog’s early blind items used to implicate Schneider as the potential father of Jamie Lynn Spears baby and Nickolodeon’s BTS frenzy of finding a fall guy boyfriend to pay off and claim responsibility for being the baby daddy.
The site also ran blinds on his abuse of Amanda Bynes.

       A CD&amp;N blind is not huge. There's a world of accusations on that site that have led nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really think Dan Schneider is just an easy target. If there ends up being proof of something he did or people step forward, by all means go after him. But ANYONE in a position like his is going to be under scrutiny and get pedo accusations, real or not.

       I don't know about specifics about something being "wrong" because it's extremely hard to confirm or deconfirm these things. The thing is there is WAYYYYYYY more that's been posted that hasn't been confirmed than things that have been. When half of hollywood is accused of doing various bad things, sometimes you'll get a hit. In other cases, there's public and semi-public rumors that are brought up, which I don't see as confirmations either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think the person/people behind CD&amp;N may have minor indirect hollywood connections and just hear stories and rumors, much of which may be embellished or purely made up, with some kernels of truth every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had minor connections myself at some points. I could've told you a former child star is now a crackhead thief who sleeps on random couches, which wasn't known until he got arrested for meth possession a few months ago. I can tell you Ron Jeremy is a sexual predator (not surprising, I know, but I've heard stories from women). But when it comes to child abuse and sex rings, there's just random suspicions and made-up rumors the same way we might talk about the creepy guy in the office.

       No one thinks the pieces are vanishing. But they're definitely going to be broken up, even without this scandal. This will just make it easier for the pieces to be bought at firesale prices. Which will mean massive layoffs in the medium term, as such things always do.

       Sumner Redstone's on his last legs. iHeart Radio is hemorrhaging money and has been for a decade. Paramount has had bomb after bomb, is barely profitable, and talent doesn't trust them to put together a successful film. A large portion of their better executives have been chased out by the paranoid Redstone.

       There's some internal shuffling, but the big thing that dropped was this.  What it seems to me is that we're trying to get rid of unsavory people.  HR is in overdrive at the moment.

       I like how the article makes no mention of the exact names and places that are in reference within the article. Good way to avoid getting sued for slander. Which means the article is just made up. If there was any legitimacy in this, you’d name names. Leaving it up to the reader to assume it’s whoever gives you an escape plan to avoid that slander lawsuit. If there was any legitimacy to your claims, you’d put names and force the accused to defend themselves or sue you. Which then means you are either right or wrong and you’ve forced their hand to respond.
      </p>

       The pictures of Schneider are creepy, but you’ve provided zero proof in your “blog” post.

       Dudddde. Like theres SO many connections of pedos that’re high up (from politicians to celebrities) this is CRAZY. 
It has me thinking about a doc I just watched on flix called “i am evidence” - basically about how police arent testing rape kits and there’s 10s of thousands built up around the country.... 
even our lawmakers and criminal justice systems don’t want justice for sexual assault (male or female/young or old)
Wow. Just wow.

       "Pull her hair tighter" "stick it inside her".. HUR HUR group high five we totally got him and are taking this so seriously.
Who are these infantile sick fucks saying stick it in her, pull her hair regarding pedophilia as some funny joke?
      </p>
      <p>
       No it's not some sort of funny joke or satire or mocking of someone in a positive way. It's just unoriginal, wanting to be edgy and part of the crowd people taking some sort of meme someone else came up with which pretty much just takes child rape and ruined lives less seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never seen any frustration just some lame group thinker repeating and wanting to be part of a lame inside joke. Where's the outrage and taking this seriously in these posts?
      </p>
      <p>
       All these jokes that are just so mature and full of so much about outrage. Refer to the act of child rape in a joking matter.
