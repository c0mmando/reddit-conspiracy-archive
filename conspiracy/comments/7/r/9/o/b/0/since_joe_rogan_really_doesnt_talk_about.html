    <div class="md"><p>I stopped by to double down on Those Conspiracy Guys.  The show has changed since Paul left but still remains solid.  There is a great episode on Monsanto, their Christian conspiracy episodes are good, and this weeks Heaven&#39;s Gate episode was good. </p>

<p>One thing to note, however, is that their episodes have long run times.  The heaven&#39;s Gate episode is 5 hours and 20 minutes.  Lot of conspiracies, some  great shit taking between the hosts, and they present a lot of material on both sides of most of the topics they cover. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely depends on what you&#39;re interested in - if you&#39;re looking solely for conspiracy related material, I&#39;d recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Henry Lee Lucas pieces are good if nothing else for the &quot;conspiracy&quot; surrounding the Hand of Death cult he claimed to be a part of;</li>
<li>Son of Sam episodes go briefly into the satanic-cult conspiracy/Carr family supposedly intertwined with Berkowitz and the murders;</li>
<li>Timothy McVeigh touches on the conspiracy/misinformation surrounding the actual crime/perpetrators/etc.;</li>
<li>The Illuminati episode is great;</li>
<li>MK Ultra should be required for anyone interested in LPOTL and conspiracy theories;</li>
<li>Their 9/11 episodes were pretty extensive and definitely covered the conspiracy elements;</li>
<li>The Satanic Government episode is pretty brief but a good review of the concept/Franklin conspiracy/etc.</li>
<li>Their Waco episode is also pretty great.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in to them until they 9/11 episode. They definitely stayed away from the better conspiracy topics and basically shilled for&quot;they let it happen... Maybe&quot;
And laughed at the inside job angle. Kinda wrecked their credibility for me on political conspiracy..
Their aliens and cults and killers stuff is good tho</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting you got that impression! I think I came away with a pretty basic understanding of the conspiracy angle (most of the time they were just trying to cover the events/news reports/etc.) and I actually felt they leaned on the inside job angle quite heavily. I&#39;ve always appreciated the LPOTL guys for their willingness to bring alternative ideas into the mix - but, you&#39;re probably right, it&#39;s best not to rely solely on their perspective when making up one&#39;s own mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last Podcast on the Left is great, but give it a few episodes. Their early stuff was consistently excellent, but as the years passed by they started to run out of subjects to do. And some of their most obscure stuff is the best. For instance, a multipart series they did on a gay serial killer in the early 1900s. Can&#39;t even remember his name, but the story was incredibly compelling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t listen to him much anymore because:</p>

<p>The comics he picks these days are shit and it feels like he&#39;s just doing favors to his friends at this point. Plus, he no longer seems able to have &quot;fun&quot; with them anymore. His early casts were comics laughing and having fun...it doesn&#39;t feel that way anymore. It just feels like Joe is really heavy, overbearing, and wants to talk about the same shit with EVERY guest even the ones who don&#39;t care about that stuff.</p>

<p>The conspiracy shit he outgrew, but he won&#39;t go into NEW ones or possibilities of new ones even for fun. He just debunks old ones and talks shit on conspiracy people now.Not saying I miss these episodes but it was pretty entertaining at least.</p>

<p>All the diet/nutrition stuff is interesting but overdone. I don&#39;t need to listen to 5 dieticians a month tell me how everything I eat is fucking killing me and i need to integrate some crazy fucking diet in my life to feel normal. I feel fine and I eat what i want.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need 10 lifecoaches telling me how everything in my life would be better if I quit my corporate job and acted like a LEADER, while Joe makes snide remarks about &quot;office life&quot; and how he&#39;d fucking kill himself if he had to live that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because he does more than just talk about conspiracy theories. You can say that’s what propelled him to popularity but I don’t know if I’d agree that’s solely why he became popular. He consistently has well known guests and discusses a wide range of topics. Even if he doesn’t directly delve into conspiracy theories much anymore, he still talks about relevant issues like politics and net neutrality. He just had an awesome one with a person from FCC (forgetting her name) and Eddie Huang. He constantly has his buddy Schaub on there, and other guys in the know when it comes to MMA, to talk about MMA (and Schaub has a decent following himself). Him and Schaub could talk all day about MMA and tons of MMA fans would tune in. He’s expanded well beyond just conspiracy theories, you may not like it but I actually think it’s made his podcast overall better. All that said, I actually get frustrated when he does discuss conspiracies because I actually agree that it seems like someone approached him and told him to chill out. I think it might be he wants to be known as a well rounded podcaster that deals with relevant issues, not a more popular Alex jones type of guy that sounds fucking crazy and doesn’t have a single legit discussion without sounding like a nut.</p>

<p>It left me with the impression that he&#39;s one of those broadcasters that uses their position to impart their christian beliefs on everyone.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the perspective.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not against christianity per-se but it does bug me if it&#39;s not addressed from all sides.  In fact, religions have some great conspiracy content.  </p>

<p>I could be off base with Clyde but this might be why when I&#39;ve listened to him I get so frustrated with him.  He doesn&#39;t seem to want to explore the conspiracy side at all and simply puts forth the standard narrative.</p>

<p>Again, I could be off base here because I don&#39;t listen to him that much and yeah, he definitely has to cater to his audience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve listened to every JRE since #1. To say that Joe Rogan accepts the official &quot;9/11 building collapse theory&quot; is just an outright false statement. For a good idea of Joe&#39;s general sentiment on 9/11, listen to #911 with Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo. Since the very beginning, Joe has tried to play devil&#39;s advocate with every topic he encounters. He presents arguments for both sides of an issue, pitting ideas against each other. Generally, he presents himself as just a vessel for information and tries to avoid hard-line opinions but there&#39;s definitely topics where he considers himself an expert (MMA, Comedy, Fitness, etc..) and you&#39;ll hear him have hard opinions. However, 9/11 is not one of those topics. I suppose this can be misinterpreted as &quot;accepting&quot; certain theories but if you follow this podcast you know that Joe still very much <em>questions everything</em>, especially the facts surrounding 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you actually watch the podcasts I mentioned. Watch the one with Neil Degrasse Tyson, and you can see exactly <em>why</em> he changes his mind. It&#39;s not strange - it&#39;s a two hour discussion where they go back and forth and examine the facts and logic.</p>

<p>Same thing with bigfoot. He used to believe, and desperately <em>wanted</em> to believe. Then he went out and did some conspiracy shows and changed his tune when he saw how ridiculous it was.</p>

<p>He hasn&#39;t hidden anything, it&#39;s all right there if you want to see it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the guy&#39;s point above is that, even if you change your stance on certain conspiracy theories... you likely don&#39;t change your interest in them. </p>

<p>He can continue to delve into strange topics and conspiracies and speak for hours with experts even if he doesn&#39;t believe in them. </p>

<p>Or find new and enticing theories to research and discuss. </p>

<p>It <em>is</em> weird that the nature of his podcast has changed. There&#39;s nothing subversive discussed, nothing the counters the mainstream narrative. It&#39;s like he&#39;s no longer speaking his mind but, rather, speaking someone else&#39;s...</p>

<p>Honestly in my experience, there aren&#39;t many that seem credible. especially stuff that gets posted to this sub. A lot of confirmation bias going on here, weird logic and assumptions. </p>

<p>Maybe not, I&#39;m not going to claim to know the man, or how he thinks. I would say however that it seems to me he&#39;s unsure, or still has his doubts about the moon landing.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t say there were. Clearly, Rogan is willing to explore theories he does not personally believe in (moon landing, for instance) so why not others?</p>

<p>I think someone else mentioned that Alex Jones was one of the highest-viewed eps on his show, ever. I&#39;m not personally a Jones fan whatsoever but I found that ep fascinating (in part because of how Rogan was able to keep Jones&#39; flighty mind on track). </p>

<p>They hit on Pizzagate, which Rogan is clearly interested in and, AFAIK, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever had his own ep on the subject other than Jones&#39; 911 ep (which I guess was him just allowing Jones to explore it). </p>

</blockquote>

<p>So, just so I understand. The fact that Joe hasn&#39;t dedicated a whole podcast to pizzagate or conspiracy theories of similar interest, could possibly mean that he&#39;s a governement shill or has been &quot;spoken to&quot; about what content is appropriate to discuss? </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s much more likely that he just doesn&#39;t want to do a full 3 hours on a subject that is a convoluted mess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you could fill a book with the conspiracies that have only been exposed, let alone, the ones that are still ongoing. There are TOO MANY conspiracies because that is part of the illusive design of these lies. The conspirators make things so interwoven and complex that it becomes much too easy for an average person to view it all as too intricate or convoluted; thus leading them to drop the subject altogether. Just look at a place like North Korea. Every interaction is controlled there, most everything is meticulously planned out and accounted for, but ultimately, all of these methods were LEARNED from so called “free” countries. </p>

His podcast has grown tremendously in the last couple of years and he&#39;s made a conscious effort to better streamline his podcast in order to reach a larger audience.

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t stop he just has way more access to a larger variety of guests now. He used to mostly talk to comedians. He had tom delonge and jones on fairly recently. He still has conspiracy people on they are just less often. A lot of the conspiracy talk was also in his fight companions when eddie bravo was on. The other thing you have to realise is joe goes through phases where he gets interested in stuff and the guests reflect that also.</p>

<p>Brad Steiger blabbers on about &quot;subterranean worlds&quot;, claiming that the chthonic realm is in fact a physical realm. Greg seems to agree. </p>

<p>Jay Parker, who says he was born into an &quot;Illuminati&quot; family, goes on the podcast, spreading the Jones-esque idea that Satanists sacrifice children to inter-dimensional demons. </p>

<p>1) Aside from the frequent mentions of &quot;Reptiles&quot; and &quot;Alien Gods&quot;, the guest claims that Pythagoras was ordained by a Mongolian shaman. We call this disinformation. Pythagoras was a mystic; but one of the Minoan Kretans. Before dying he dedicated his home as a temple to the Mother Goddess, Demeter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am interested. I felt like he mostly dismissed the idea of reptilians. As far as the Mongolian claim I think that is from April deconick&#39;s book but I don&#39;t know what her source was. So maybe Miguel was misinformed. I would certainly be interested in better reading/listening materials about Gnosticism. I&#39;m much more concerned with and interested in the metophorical and spiritual aspects, I take all historical claims with at least a grain of salt. I&#39;d definitely take a look at anything you think would be edifying but I have to say that endorsing an obvious charlatan like Alex Jones does make me question your judgment a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My bad. I misread your mention of infowars initially. I actually think we probably agree on a lot. I&#39;m very interested in Gnosticism.

Sometimes hearing people I disagree with is the best way to understand what I do believe. I am genuinely interested in any good resources you could direct me to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve listened to any podcasts but there are a few interviewers that I really, really appreciated.</p>

<p>There is one guy named Howard Hughes(not to be confused with the aeronautic mogul). A British guy that directly listens and talks about the topics, regardless of his personal views. What the name of his podcast is? I don&#39;t actually know! I don&#39;t even know if he still produces them, but the handful I listened to were all excellent.</p>

<p>Additionally, I -really- appreciated the &#39;Higher Side Chats&#39;, a play on words from Roosevelt&#39;s &#39;Fireside Chats&#39;. The guy is a stoner, says he was a Gamestop manager. He also makes -excellent- interviews and not one time did he ever ridicule a topic or subject based on personal views, he actually researched the topics beforehand to comprehend the basis and encourage the interviewee to demonstrate and articulate appropriately. Highly recommend!! I know this guy tried to go &#39;professional&#39; and even tried to band together with other podcasters and it ended up falling apart for some reason(this was several years ago), even so, the interviews are all excellent.</p>

<p>I never liked Rogan btw, he tried too hard to &#39;stay in the cool zone&#39;, trashing anything you don&#39;t understand or don&#39;t like is inappropriate especially if you&#39;re a self proclaimed &#39;conspiracy&#39; podcast, so that turned me off on him fast.</p>

<p>However, I listened(watched on youtube) a couple of more recent interviews and it seems as if he&#39;d evolved a little bit and is less likely to trash what doesn&#39;t fit into his world view.</p>

<p>Unrelated, but one interview with an Ex-Baltimore cop was -outstanding-. That cop has some real courage and real honesty.</p>

<p>And yes, Hughes always struck me as very professional.</p>

<p>My experience with the first couple seasons of THC didn&#39;t at all strike me as lazy - truly, that&#39;s news to me if he&#39;s gone downhill and it sucks if that&#39;s the case because, in my experience, he always let the interviews breathe, no matter how esoteric the topic was.

    <div class="md"><p>He never challenges his subjects. I don&#39;t mean by arguing with them, I mean he doesn&#39;t even ask them hard questions. He just lets them ramble and occasionally compliments them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not such a bad thing. His show is a good way to get exposed to really weird stuff that&#39;s hard to find anywhere else. But I think someone who was making an effort to be an active interviewer would get much more interesting content out of most of his guests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, although the extent to which his style is successful depends on the guest. And I think a more active style would be more effective, but that&#39;s a question of personal taste as much as anything.</p>

<p>I do think he lets some guests get away with rampant, flagrant bullshit. The guy who claimed to have written all those Top 40 songs, for example. He basically let a mentally ill guy ramble for an hour, which I don&#39;t think showed much respect for the guest--he was borderline taking advantage of the guy. (To his credit, I think he realized that and pulled back a bit in his comments about the interview.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHPTWeoYbK0&amp;amp;t=3s">Fade To Black w/Jimmy Church.</a> &lt;- One of the best episodes BTW. William Cooper and Behold a Pale Horse!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.richardsyrett.com/home">The Conspiracy Show w/Richard Syrett</a></p>

<p><a href="http://theunexplained.tv/">The Unexplained w/Howard Hughes</a></p>

<p><em>AND Finally the creepiest conspiracy show still relevant today</em> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hourofthetime.com/wordpresstest/milton-william-bill-cooper-mp3-collection/">THE HOUR OF THE TIME w/BILL COOPER</a> </p>

<p>Yes from the 90&#39;s it turns out what we are seeing today in the world has been planned for some time. </p>

<p>If you want to get really creeped out, this is for you. Bill not only breaks down the Illuminati, Order of the Rose Cross, Mystery Babylon, and Knights Templar.. He also dive DEEP in the New World Order and explain what they believe and why. </p>

<p>Remember when he talks about the NWO he is not speaking for what HE believes, he is explaining what THEY believe.. </p>

<p>William Cooper may have been the real deal. </p>

<p>BONUS POINTS for listening to the episodes regarding the Clintons. Yes, even back then. </p>

<p>Double Points for reading how he died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstood his point. They regularly make the point that ANTIFA and these Neo-Nazi dbags are larping. Having that opinion doesn&#39;t constitute a defense in my view. I think the point was not that it was &quot;better&quot;, but that the MSM is trying to work people into a frenzy and people shouldn&#39;t fall for it because these groups aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot; in the sense that they are an actual threat to society or the populace at large. </p>

<p>Personally, I think it&#39;s a valid viewpoint because it isn&#39;t as if these people are actual revolutionaries or will ever accomplish anything. They are just playing and virtue signaling to their respective audiences. Also, if I&#39;m not mistaken, they were highly critical of Chris Cantwell in the two proceeding episodes after he made the point about them larping. In any case, given Adam&#39;s body of work and the 1000 shows he&#39;s done on NA, you wouldn&#39;t be able to make the case he actually shares any of Cantwell&#39;s views or is a Nazi himself. FWIW, I don&#39;t actually agree with Adam that they are just larping, but I think he made a reasoned argument worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>They also explicitly state that you aren&#39;t supposed to agree with them on everything. If you think Cantwell and the rest aren&#39;t larping, that&#39;s okay, but you shouldn&#39;t stop listening because they say stuff you don&#39;t always agree with because they really are just about the only game in town for what they do. Adam and John regularly have theories that they openly admit they don&#39;t know if they are true or not. They also openly admit when they are wrong and make corrections when necessary. To me that is the hallmark of a good conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;ll give them another shot one day :)</p>

<p>Which is to say you really aren&#39;t thinking at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defending Nazis in any context is stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which he didn&#39;t do, but I understand why you think he did. You can&#39;t differentiate between things or entertain any arguments that don&#39;t confirm your own thoughts/feelings/bias. An intelligent person can entertain an argument without accepting it. Perhaps Chris Cantwell and ANTIFA aren&#39;t larping. Saying they are is in no way a defense. And by the way, if he was defending Chris Cantwell by saying he&#39;s larping, then he&#39;s also defending ANTIFA because he says they are doing the same thing. So even if you were right, which you aren&#39;t, it isn&#39;t as if he&#39;s taking the side of nazi&#39;s over their opposition. He&#39;s saying neither group is to be taken seriously, but go ahead and cling to your self righteous indignation anyway, I&#39;m sure it makes you feel good. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That he got an extra 2 years as head of the FBI (which Adam falsely stated was illegal. Wrong, they passed a law to allow it).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t correct either. Mueller is corrupt. They acknowledged previously the law was passed to allow him to stay. The law was passed because the people passing it were corrupt and they wanted to keep Mueller in because he was corrupt. Also, the main point was that he was made head of the FBI SEVEN DAYS before 9/11, because he was corrupt and would keep whatever secrets they didn&#39;t want coming out. His tenure was extended for the same reason. It&#39;s a strange thing to be a in a conspiracy subreddit and have people think it&#39;s controversial/wrong/incorrect to call the former head of the FBI corrupt. </p>

<p>I&#39;m staying for health and social debate topics, but I&#39;m sure pizzagate/alexjones made him a target for some.</p>

<p>Check out Ed Opperman and William Ramsey.  They&#39;ve got more historical researched topics of interest.</p>

<p>Hundreds of episodes on tons of topics. They also put up audio of different documentaries and readings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much about interviews etc, so idk if you can call it a &quot;podcast&quot;, per se; more like a bunch of lectures from different people.</p>

<p>So many topics covered (most on deep state, societal control, pedophile rings, false flags, financial conspiracies, etc).</p>

<p>Site is aesthetically lacking, but lots of neat content going back years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mysterious Universe is not really a conspiracy podcast, it covers a lot more than just conspiracies, but these guys have turned me on to some conspiracies I would never have heard of.  In a recent podcast they did an interview with husband and wife researchers who have been looking into the history of Pacific Island people.<br/>
They have solid evidence that the government of New Zealand found and destroyed evidence that other settlers, some of them white Europeans, had been there far earlier than the Maori.  The government is destroying these finds because they have negotiated numerous agreements with the Maori and if the Maori aren&#39;t the original inhabitants those treaties and agreements are toast. </p>

<p>He also has seemed to move on from his conspiracies of old, he&#39;s gotten over 9/11, and things of that nature and moved on to conspiracies such as how the sugar industry demonized fat, falsified studies on sugar, and made the American public suffer from a carbohydrate induced wave of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and all the nice things that come along with that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In THE SILENT WEAPONS FOR QUIET WARS HOAX, Tavares fraudulently claims that &quot;Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars&quot; is another &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;leaked&quot; government document which she claims &quot;PROVES&quot; that the government or the Bilderbergs are killing us all (or &quot;PLAN&quot; to kill us all) with &quot;SILENT WEAPONS&quot; in furtherance of the &quot;PLANNED&quot; &quot;extinction of mankind&quot;. But, this is not so. Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars (&quot;SWFQW&quot;) is actually a short booklet of political fiction written by Lyle Hartford Van Dyke in 1978-79. (Van Dyke is a convicted felon who spent a decade in federal prison for fraud and for effectively writing checks drawn on his imaginary &quot;trust account at the U.S. Treasury&quot;.). SWFQW is not a secret, leaked or suppressed government document. Van Dyke was not a whistle blower. He was a political commentator. </p>

<p>In 1978-79, Van Dyke wrote and distributed his 44 page document of POLITICAL FICTION entitled, SWFQW. Van Dyke believed (perhaps correctly) that the U.S. had advance knowledge of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and allowed it to happen (killing thousands of American soldiers) in order to draw the U.S. into World War II. Van Dyke was outraged by this perceived treasonous ACT OF WAR BY THE U.S. UPON ITS OWN SOLDIERS and wanted to make the HORRORS of this treasonous act of war PERSONAL to the American public. So, Van Dyke wrote SWFQW and suggested that instead of intentionally killing ITS OWN SOLDIERS in such a treasonous act of war, the U. S. government was intentionally killing ITS OWN CIVILIAN POPULATION in such a treasonous act of war (a clever twist of the perceived facts). (Note that this claim would indeed make the HORRORS of such a &quot;Pearl Harbor-type&quot; war on Americans PERSONAL to the reader.). But, Van Dyke realized that the public would not actually believe his premise (of a U.S. war against the American public) without the presence of the usual weapons of war, like those that were present at Pearl Harbor (armed soldiers, trucks, tanks, planes, ships, missiles, bombs, etc.). So, in writing SWFQW, Van Dyke claimed that all of the weapons that the U.S. was using in this FICTIONAL war against the American public were high tech weapons that COULD NOT BE SEEN OR HEARD (which TAVARES has recently embellished to mean cell phones, cell towers, WIFI, microwaves, &quot;smart meters&quot;, geo-engineering and HAARP, etc.). Because the readers of SWFQW could not actually see or hear any weapons being used against them, Van Dyke&#39;s claims appeared to be true. Indeed, because such weapons could not be seen or heard, there was no way to dispute Van Dyke&#39;s claims of INVISIBLE &amp; INAUDIBLE weapons. All of this actually made Van Dyke&#39;s claims of INVISIBLE &amp; INAUDIBLE weapons MORE (not less) BELIEVABLE to the reader. By using this ruse, VAN DYKE ACTUALLY MADE THE ABSENCE OF WEAPONS EVEN MORE HORRIFYING TO THE READER THAN THEIR PRESENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN. It was absolutely brilliant. Van Dyke openly admits that SWFQW was inspired by an earlier book of POLITICAL FICTION which he greatly admired entitled, &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain&quot; (see below). Van Dyke also openly admits to having incorporated sections of REAL scientific and economic TECHNICAL studies into his work (as did &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain&quot;) to make his work appear more official-looking. Finally, Van Dyke openly admits that he created SWFQW to read like an official governmental document (as did &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain&quot;) in order to make the HORRORS of the U.S. government waging a covert war against its own citizens APPEAR MORE REAL and therefore more terrifying to the reader. It worked.

<p>ABOUT SNOOP4TRUTH:</p>

<p>Snoop4truth is a legal expert and whistle blower who exposes online hoaxes. Snoop4truth did not reveal this information to harm Deborah Tavares. Instead, Snoop4truth revealed this information solely to reduce the CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE that such intentional fraud inflicts upon the American people every single day. Had it not been for Tavares&#39; role in the &quot;Judge DALE Hoax&quot;, Snoop4truth would not have revealed this information here. </p>

<p>The message to all charlatans and hoaxers? Just tell the truth. The truth does not fear investigation. Only lies fear investigation. The truth can be supported by using the truth. Only lies must be supported by using hoaxes (other lies). There is no such thing as a &quot;good reason&quot; to intentionally defraud the American people, not even to make a popular conspiracy theory appear to be true. </p>

<p>In THE REPORT FROM IRON MOUNTAIN HOAX, Tavares also fraudulently claims that &quot;The Report Form Iron Mountain ON THE POSSIBILITY AND DESIRABILITY FOR PEACE&quot; (&quot;TRFIM&quot;) is another &quot;secret&quot; and/or &quot;leaked&quot; and/or &quot;suppressed&quot; government document which she claims &quot;PROVES&quot; that the U.S. government is currently using FAKE WARS AGAINST FAKE ENEMIES to kill us all in furtherance of the &quot;PLANNED&quot; &quot;extinction of mankind&quot; (which FAKE WARS Tavares has recently embellished to mean &quot;global warming&quot;, &quot;climate change&quot;, &quot;engineered drought&quot;, fires, etc.). But, none of this is so. TRFIM was a 1967 book of POLITICAL FICTION written by Leonard C. Lewin which was SO POPULAR and SO WIDELY READ that it actually made the &quot;New York Times Best Seller List&quot;. (So much for Tavares&#39; &quot;secret&quot;, &quot;leaked&quot; or &quot;suppressed&quot; document story.). It is not a secret, leaked or suppressed government document. Lewin was not a whistle blower. He was a political commentator. </p>

<p>It was 1967. It was the middle of the Vietnam War. Lewin was critical of U.S. policy because the U.S. had been in an almost perpetual state of war for decades and he believed (perhaps correctly) that the U.S. economy was far too dependent upon military spending. In criticizing this U.S policy, Lewin SARCASTICALLY observed that U.S. policy makers &quot;MUST HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE U.S. COULD NOT AFFORD PEACE&quot; (meaning that if the U.S. was not actually engaged in perpetual wars, the U.S. government and the U.S. economy might actually collapse). Lewin sought to make a MOCKERY of this U.S. war policy and the ABSURDITY of the beliefs that apparently underlie it. Lewin wanted to publically EMBARRASS and HUMILIATE U.S. policy makers who supported a policy of perpetual war and he wanted them to change U.S. policy. So, he wrote &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain ON THE POSSIBILITY AND DESIRABILITY FOR PEACE&quot; (the book&#39;s FULL title). (Note that the final seven words to this title reveal Lewin&#39;s true thesis statement.). So, in writing TRFIM, Lewin pretended to be an imaginary committee of the U.S. government which pretended to &quot;report&quot; to these very same U.S. policy makers (whom he sought to EMBARRASS and HUMILIATE) that &quot;PEACE WAS POSSIBLE, BUT NOT DESIRABLE&quot; (hence, the FULL title to Lewin&#39;s book). In writing TRFIM (and in pretending to be an imaginary committee of the U.S. government), Lewin pretended to &quot;report&quot; to U.S. policy makers that the U.S. economy was so dependent on perpetual war that if the U.S. ever found itself at peace, IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE FORCED TO CREATE FAKE WARS (called &quot;credible substitutes&quot;) against FAKE ENEMIES (called &quot;alternative enemies&quot;) to prop up the U.S. government and the U.S. economy. (Note here how Lewin MOCKS U.S. policy of perpetual war). Specifically, in writing TRFIM (and in pretending to be an imaginary committee of the U.S. government), Lewin pretended to &quot;report&quot; to U.S. policy makers that if the U.S. ever found itself with the &quot;misfortune of being at peace&quot;, it would be forced, for economic reasons, to create FAKE WARS against FAKE ENEMIES, including FAKE &quot;ALIEN LIFE FORMS&quot; (something that Tavares omits about this book in her hoax) and against FAKE &quot;ENVIRONMENTAL CALAMITIES&quot; (which Tavares has recently embellished to mean &quot;global warming&quot;, &quot;climate change&quot;, &quot;engineered drought&quot;, fires, etc.). (Note here how Lewin MOCKS U.S. policy of perpetual war). It was absolutely brilliant. Lewin created TRFIM to read like an official U.S. government committee &quot;REPORT&quot; to U.S. policy makers IN ORDER TO PUBLICALLY EMBARRASS AND HUMILIATE U.S. POLICY MAKERS WHO SUPPORTED PERPETUAL WAR (by making their policy of perpetual war APPEAR EVEN MORE &quot;ABSURD&quot; THAN IT ALREADY WAS). It worked. As if to prove that Lewin was the real author of TRFIM, when an unauthorized publisher later re-published his book without his permission (and without paying him royalties), HE SUED THE RE-PUBLISHER AND WON A LARGE SETTLEMENT, something that would have been impossible if the book had actually been written by a REAL &quot;committee of the U. S. government&quot; as Tavares falsely claims.

<p>ANALYSIS OF THE THREE FOREGOING DOCUMENTS USED BY TAVARES IN SUPPORT OF HER CLAIMS: </p>

<p>Of the three documents described above, one was actually written by a NASA scientist in an effort TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM HORRIFIC, FUTURE WEAPONS and two were written by private American civilians in an effort (through the clever use of fiction) TO CALL PUBLIC ATTENTION TO POLICIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT WERE HARMFUL TO AMERICANS. So, all three documents were written by Americans in order TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE (not the other way around). But, Tavares deliberately turned all of this around backwards. Tavares falsely claims that all three documents ARE THEMSELVES secret, leaked or suppressed U.S. government documents which she claims &quot;PROVE&quot; that the U.S. government or the global elite are killing us all (or &quot;PLANS&quot; to kill us all) in furtherance of a &quot;PLANNED&quot; &quot;EXTINCTION OF MANKIND&quot;. But, this is not so. And, Tavares knows it. </p>

<p>Specifically, Tavares falsely claims that the three foregoing documents (all of which were written TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE) &quot;PROVE&quot; that everything around us (cell phones, cell towers, WIFI, microwaves, &quot;smart meters&quot;, &quot;geo engineering&quot;, fluoride, &quot;chem trails&quot;, microwaves, HAARP, etc.) are part of an orchestrated &quot;PLAN&quot; described in these three documents above to cause the &quot;extinction of mankind&quot;. But, this claim is not so. The foregoing documents do not reflect any such &quot;PLAN&quot;. And, Tavares knows it. </p>

<p>Certainly, cell phones, cell towers and WIFI emit radiation. Certainly, the chemicals used in geo engineering pollute the air, the ground and the water. Certainly, fluoride is a neurotoxin and so on. All of these things are part of life in our modern society and all of them are harmful. There is no debate about that. The real debate is whether these things (cell phones, cell towers, WIFI, geo-engineering, fluoride, etc.) benefit us more than they harm us. But, that is beyond the scope of this comment. </p>

<p>The point is simply this. All three documents above which Tavares falsely claims &quot;PROVE&quot; a government or elite &quot;PLAN&quot; to cause the &quot;extinction of mankind&quot; DO NOT PROVE ANY SUCH &quot;PLAN&quot;. FACT: The author of each one of these three documents above had an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PURPOSE mind when writing his work (AND THAT PURPOSE WAS NOT &quot;REVEALING&quot; OR DESCRIBING&quot; A GOVERNMENT OR ELITE &quot;PLAN&quot; TO CAUSE THE &quot;EXTINCTION OF MANKIND&quot;). And, Tavares knows it. </p>

<p>DOCUMENTS
<a href="http://www.stopthecrime.net/docs/SILENT.pdf">http://www.stopthecrime.net/docs/SILENT.pdf</a>; (NOTE THE WEBSITE). </p>

<p>In THE SILENT WEAPONS FOR QUIET WARS HOAX, Tavares fraudulently claims that &quot;Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars&quot; is another &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;leaked&quot; government document which she claims &quot;PROVES&quot; that the government or the Bilderbergs are killing us all (or &quot;PLAN&quot; to kill us all) with &quot;SILENT WEAPONS&quot; in furtherance of the &quot;PLANNED&quot; &quot;extinction of mankind&quot;. But, this is not so. Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars (&quot;SWFQW&quot;) is actually a short booklet of political fiction written by Lyle Hartford Van Dyke in 1978-79. (Van Dyke is a convicted felon who spent a decade in federal prison for fraud and for effectively writing checks drawn on his imaginary &quot;trust account at the U.S. Treasury&quot;.). SWFQW is not a secret, leaked or suppressed government document. Van Dyke was not a whistle blower. He was a political commentator. </p>

<p>In 1978-79, Van Dyke wrote and distributed his 44 page document of POLITICAL FICTION entitled, SWFQW. Van Dyke believed (perhaps correctly) that the U.S. had advance knowledge of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and allowed it to happen (killing thousands of American soldiers) in order to draw the U.S. into World War II. Van Dyke was outraged by this perceived treasonous ACT OF WAR BY THE U.S. UPON ITS OWN SOLDIERS and wanted to make the HORRORS of this treasonous act of war PERSONAL to the American public. So, Van Dyke wrote SWFQW and suggested that instead of intentionally killing ITS OWN SOLDIERS in such a treasonous act of war, the U. S. government was intentionally killing ITS OWN CIVILIAN POPULATION in such a treasonous act of war (a clever twist of the perceived facts). (Note that this claim would indeed make the HORRORS of such a &quot;Pearl Harbor-type&quot; war on Americans PERSONAL to the reader.). But, Van Dyke realized that the public would not actually believe his premise (of a U.S. war against the American public) without the presence of the usual weapons of war, like those that were present at Pearl Harbor (armed soldiers, trucks, tanks, planes, ships, missiles, bombs, etc.). So, in writing SWFQW, Van Dyke claimed that all of the weapons that the U.S. was using in this FICTIONAL war against the American public were high tech weapons that COULD NOT BE SEEN OR HEARD (which TAVARES has recently embellished to mean cell phones, cell towers, WIFI, microwaves, &quot;smart meters&quot;, geo-engineering and HAARP, etc.). Because the readers of SWFQW could not actually see or hear any weapons being used against them, Van Dyke&#39;s claims appeared to be true. Indeed, because such weapons could not be seen or heard, there was no way to dispute Van Dyke&#39;s claims of INVISIBLE &amp; INAUDIBLE weapons. All of this actually made Van Dyke&#39;s claims of INVISIBLE &amp; INAUDIBLE weapons MORE (not less) BELIEVABLE to the reader. By using this ruse, VAN DYKE ACTUALLY MADE THE ABSENCE OF WEAPONS EVEN MORE HORRIFYING TO THE READER THAN THEIR PRESENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN. It was absolutely brilliant. Van Dyke openly admits that SWFQW was inspired by an earlier book of POLITICAL FICTION which he greatly admired entitled, &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain&quot; (see below). Van Dyke also openly admits to having incorporated sections of REAL scientific and economic TECHNICAL studies into his work (as did &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain&quot;) to make his work appear more official-looking. Finally, Van Dyke openly admits that he created SWFQW to read like an official governmental document (as did &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain&quot;) in order to make the HORRORS of the U.S. government waging a covert war against its own citizens APPEAR MORE REAL and therefore more terrifying to the reader. It worked.

The Judge Dale Forgeries include: &quot;The Matrix And The US Constitution&quot; (2010); &quot;The Great American Adventure: Secrets Of America&quot; (2012) and &quot;Lawfully Yours&quot; (2014). In the Judge &quot;DALE&quot; forgeries, Tavares, her partner and Rodney &quot;DALE&quot; Class (while pretending to be Judge &quot;DALE&quot;) made intentionally false and fraudulent claims about the law, the courts, judges and lawyers in an effort to fraudulently incite hatred and violence against INNOCENT Americans. Specifically, in the Judge &quot;DALE&quot; forgeries, Tavares and her partners claim, among other things, that all governments and all governmental agencies (including the courts) are &quot;PRIVATE, FOR-PROFIT CORPORATIONS&quot; and that all American lawyers are &quot;TRAITORS&quot; and IMPOSTERS with &quot;NO AUTHORITY&quot; and &quot;NO LICENSE&quot; to practice law. This hoax is explained in detail in the 3rd comment here. <a href="http://projectavalon.net/forum4/showthread.php?99447-Rod-Class-his-many-hoaxes">http://projectavalon.net/forum4/showthread.php?99447-Rod-Class-his-many-hoaxes</a>. But, to fully understand the scope of Tavares&#39; fraud in legal matters with her partner and Rodney &quot;DALE&quot; Class, you must also read the 5th and 6th comments here. <a href="http://projectavalon.net/forum4/showthread.php?99447-Rod-Class-his-many-hoaxes">http://projectavalon.net/forum4/showthread.php?99447-Rod-Class-his-many-hoaxes</a>.</p>

<p>Of all of Tavares&#39; hoaxes, the &quot;Judge DALE&quot; Hoax is perhaps her most diabolical. As a result of this single hoax, countless thousands of Americans WERE INCITED TO THE POINT OF HATRED AND VIOLENCE against INNOCENT Americans. As a result of this single hoax, countless thousands of Americans have WASTED years of their lives, thousands of dollars of their own money, all of their resources and all of their energy FIGHTING AN IMAGINARY ENEMY (an imaginary &quot;evil&quot; justice system described in her forgeries) which is NOT REAL, using IMAGINARY LAWS (described in her forgeries) which are NOT REAL, by employing the legal teachings of an IMAGINARY &quot;RETIRED FEDERAL JUDGE DALE&quot; (described in her forgeries) who is NOT REAL. As a result of this single hoax, countless thousands of Americans HAVE LOST THEIR OWN COURT CASES and as a result, actually LOST their own time, LOST their own homes, LOST their own property, LOST their own money, LOST their own liberty AND PERHAPS EVEN LOST THEIR OWN LIVES IN RELIANCE UPON THE FALSE LEGAL CLAIMS MADE IN THE &quot;JUDGE DALE&quot; FORGERIES. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>PART 5: THE DOCUMENTS USED BY DEBORAH TAVARES</p>

<p>Tavares supports her claims WITH DOCUMENTS. Unknown to her followers, TAVARES CREATES THESE DOCUMENTS HERSELF. Tavares also ALTERS and CHANGES the WORDS and IMAGES of other documents to make them fit her claims. Finally, Tavares PASSES OFF documents of known political FICTIONAL as if they were &quot;REAL&quot; government documents to support her claims. See proof below. </p>

<ol>
<li>THE COURT REGISTRY INVESTMENT SYSTEM HOAX: </li>
</ol>

<p>In THE COURT REGISTRY INVESTMENT SYSTEM HOAX, Tavares and her partners (including Rod Class and Jeanette Triplett) fraudulently claim to have &quot;discovered&quot; a &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;leaked&quot; government document which she claims &quot;PROVES&quot; that &quot;ALL OF THE MONEY&quot; that the public ever pays to the courts for FINES and PENALTIES is forwarded on to the &quot;Federal Reserve&quot; in the same way that she claims that the IRS collects money from the public for INCOME TAXES and forwards it on to the Federal Reserve (thereby attempting to draw a FALSE parallel between the courts and the IRS). In this hoax, Tavares and her partners manufactured a FAKE document to support of their hoax (just like they did with all three of the Judge &quot;DALE&quot; Forgeries described above in the &quot;Judge DALE&quot; Hoax) and they made their forgery LOOK like an official government document. BUT, THEY MADE SOME STUPID MISTAKES! Specifically, they created a FAKE &quot;CASH FLOW DIAGRAM&quot; purporting to show money flowing from the courts to the &quot;Federal Reserve&quot;. But, Tavares and her partners MISTAKENLY used a drawing OF THE &quot;U.S. TREASURY BUILDING&quot; in their FAKE &quot;CASH FLOW DIAGRAM&quot; (mistakenly believing it was a drawing of the &quot;Federal Reserve Building&quot;) AND THEY MISTAKENLY LABELED IT THE &quot;FEDERAL RESERVE BANK&quot; (two stupid mistakes that a REAL government document would not contain). (See proof below.). Tavares and her partners actually used this MISTAKE-RIDDLED &quot;CASH FLOW DIAGRAM&quot; as the COVER of their FAKE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT. (See proof below.). Tavares and her partners ALSO failed to check the lower right hand corner of the page that they used for the COVER of their FAKE government document. The page number in the lower right hand corner of that page is marked page &quot;2&quot;. This means that the COVER page that they used for the COVER of their FAKE government document is not only RIDDLED WITH STUPID MISTAKES (described above), it also CAME FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DOCUMENT which means that TAVARES AND HER PARTNERS ASSEMBLED THEIR FAKE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT FROM PARTS OF OTHER DOCUMENTS (a stupid mistake that a REAL government document would not contain). Finally, Tavares and her partners went through their entire FAKE government document and REPLACED the term, &quot;UST&quot; (for United States Treasury) with the term, &quot;FRB&quot; (for Federal Reserve Bank) to make the interior of their FAKE government document &quot;MATCH&quot; the FAKE cover of their FAKE government document.  </p>

<p>This hoax also reveals that Tavares does not even know what a &quot;Court Registry&quot; actually is. Unknown to Tavares, a &quot;Court Registry&quot; is simply a court-supervised, &quot;escrow-type&quot; account that is typically operated out of a special office at the court house. Litigants in certain types of EXTREMELY RARE cases (when the ownership of money is disputed) VOLUNTARILY deposit money into the &quot;court registry&quot; until the case is over at which time THE JUDGE AWARDS ALL OF THE MONEY DEPOSITED INTO THE &quot;COURT REGISTRY&quot; TO THE WINNING SIDE IN THE CASE. SO, ALL OF THE MONEY THAT IS EVER DEPOSITED INTO A &quot;COURT REGISTRY&quot; ONLY GOES TO THE LITIGANTS THEMSELVES AT THE END OF THE CASE (DEPENDING ON WHICH SIDE WINS). Thus, a &quot;Court Registry&quot; works exactly like an &quot;escrow account&quot; (the party with &quot;clean hands&quot; gets all the money deposited). No judge, court or government agency ever keeps ANY of the money that is ever deposited into any &quot;Court Registry&quot;. ONLY THE LITIGANTS THEMSELVES RECEIVE MONEY THAT IS DEPOSITED INTO A &quot;COURT REGISTRY&quot;. Less than one percent of all cases involve such a short-term deposit into a &quot;Court Registry&quot;. So, such deposits are extremely rare. (Have you ever made such a deposit into a &quot;Court Registry&quot;?). </p>

<p>This hoax also reveals that Tavares does not even know what a Court Registry &quot;INVESTMENT SYSTEM&quot; actually is. Unknown to Tavares, the &quot;Court Registry INVESTMENT SYSTEM&quot; is a merely a system by which the court earns &quot;INTEREST&quot; on the money that is TEMPORARILY deposited into the &quot;Court Registry&quot; until the case is over. IT IS ALL ABOUT &quot;INTEREST&quot;. NOTHING MORE. Thus, Tavares manufactured AN ENTIRE HOAX out of her OWN MISTAKEN UNDERSTANDING of the definition of the term, &quot;COURT REGISTRY INVESTMENT SYSTEM&quot;. (In order to manufacture a really good hoax, YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE LYING ABOUT---AND TAVARES DOES NOT.). </p>

<p>Note: Because she knew that I was going to expose this particular hoax, Tavares took down her epic YouTube video wherein she spends hours peddling this hoax and pretending to review her own FAKE government document. It was absolutely priceless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PART 6: THE DOCUMENTS USED BY DEBORAH TAVARES</p>

<p>THE ALL GOVERNMENTS AND ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE &quot;PRIVATE, FOR PROFIT CORPORATIONS&quot; HOAX:</p>

<p>In this hoax, Tavares and her partners (including Rod Class) falsely claim that all governments and all government agencies are private for-profit &quot;CORPORATIONS&quot;. To understand the extent of this fraud,  YOU MUST SEE THE FOLLOWING VIDEOS! They are simply UNBELIEVABLE! Note that NONE of the private, for-profit corporations referred to in any of the following videos HAVE ANY CONNECTION WHATSOEVER TO ANY FEDERAL OR STATE GOVERNMENT OR AGENCY. Instead, they are all ordinary, private, for-profit corporations with names that SOUND SIMILAR to governments or government agencies (like &quot;Federal Express&quot;, for example). This means that contrary to Tavares&#39; claims, the ordinary, private, for-profit corporation named the &quot;United States Corporation Company&quot; (referred to at 2:00-3:10 in her FIRST video below) IS NOT actually the government of the &quot;United States of America&quot;. <a href="http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;amp;directionType=Initial&amp;amp;searchNameOrder=UNITEDSTATES%201000090&amp;amp;aggregateId=domp-100009-5f172c55-c788-4f81-aa28-1a68b778486b&amp;amp;searchTerm=united%20states%20corporation%20company&amp;amp;listNameOrder=UNITEDSTATES%201000090">http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;amp;directionType=Initial&amp;amp;searchNameOrder=UNITEDSTATES%201000090&amp;amp;aggregateId=domp-100009-5f172c55-c788-4f81-aa28-1a68b778486b&amp;amp;searchTerm=united%20states%20corporation%20company&amp;amp;listNameOrder=UNITEDSTATES%201000090</a> (Scroll all the way down to the very bottom of this link and click on the FINAL document. Tavares refers to this document later in her FIRST video below.). Instead, the &quot;United States Corporation Company&quot; is merely a &quot;registered agent&quot; which accepts &quot;service of process&quot; (civil lawsuits) on behalf of other corporations doing business in Florida and is ACTUALLY LISTED AS SUCH by the Florida Secretary of State, Division of Corporations. <a href="http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResults/OfficerRegisteredAgentName/United%20States%20Corporation%20Company/Page1">http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResults/OfficerRegisteredAgentName/United%20States%20Corporation%20Company/Page1</a> (BE SURE TO SCROLL THROUGH ALL OF THE PAGES IN THIS LINK). (Note: Every corporation doing business in the state is required to have a &quot;registered agent&quot; inside the state to accept &quot;service of process&quot; (civil lawsuits) on its behalf. The &quot;United States Corporation Company&quot; is merely an ordinary, private, for-profit company that, for a fee, provides that service to other such corporations (which are often out-of-state corporations that do not have an office inside the state). <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;amp;Search_String=&amp;amp;URL=0600-0699/0607/Sections/0607.0505.html.">http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;amp;Search_String=&amp;amp;URL=0600-0699/0607/Sections/0607.0505.html.</a>). Further, at 4:30-4:45 in he FIRST video below, Tavares also FRAUDULENTLY CHANGES THE NAME of one such ordinary, private, for-profit corporation TO MAKE IT SOUND EVEN MORE LIKE A GOVERNMENT AGENCY in order to INTENTIONALLY DEFRAUD the American people. Specifically, she &quot;SWITCHES&quot; the name, &quot;Internal Revenue Tax And Audit Service, Inc.&quot; (THE REAL NAME) with the name, &quot;Internal Revenue Service&quot; (THE FAKE NAME) in order to INTENTIONALLY DEFRAUD the American people. This is precisely the reason that she does not show an ACTUAL PHOTO of this particular corporation&#39;s &quot;corporate charter&quot; in her video below as she does with other &quot;corporate charters&quot; of the other corporations referred to in her video (BECAUSE IT WOULD SHOW THE CORPORATION&#39;S &quot;REAL NAME&quot; WHICH WOULD EXPOSE HER FRAUD). See the truth about this particular fraud here. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/04tmhmd08w0m5hz/Internal%20Revenue%20Tax%20and%20Audit%20Service%20Inc..pdf?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/04tmhmd08w0m5hz/Internal%20Revenue%20Tax%20and%20Audit%20Service%20Inc..pdf?dl=0</a> (Note here that this ordinary, private, for-profit corporation, the &quot;Internal Revenue Tax And Audit Service, Inc.&quot;, WAS INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE.); <a href="http://www.hovindology.com/?p=80">http://www.hovindology.com/?p=80</a> (THIS LINK IS EXCELLENT.

    <div class="md"><p>Ground Zero w/Clyde Lewis is available on Soundcloud and could pull the rss link directly into your favorite podcast app.</p>

<p>I was offset by Clyde at first thinking he was too nuts because his presentation is- every show has some eccentric name like &#39;Nephelum Spiritual Agustus Mother&#39; but once you listen it&#39;s all about the &#39;environment&#39; he sets. He&#39;s fairly balanced and talks about all the things he&#39;s also nightly so while he&#39;ll do topics of the esoteric he&#39;ll also give a non MSM take on current events which is nice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve listened to every JRE since #1. To say that Joe Rogan accepts the official &quot;9/11 building collapse theory&quot; is just an outright false statement. For a good idea of Joe&#39;s general sentiment on 9/11, listen to #911 with Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo. Since the very beginning, Joe has tried to play devil&#39;s advocate with every topic he encounters. He presents arguments for both sides of an issue, pitting ideas against each other. Generally, he presents himself as just a vessel for information and tries to avoid hard-line opinions but there&#39;s definitely topics where he considers himself an expert (MMA, Comedy, Fitness, etc..) and you&#39;ll hear him have hard opinions. However, 9/11 is not one of those topics. I suppose this can be misinterpreted as &quot;accepting&quot; certain theories but if you follow this podcast you know that Joe still very much <em>questions everything</em>, especially the facts surrounding 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In THE SILENT WEAPONS FOR QUIET WARS HOAX, Tavares fraudulently claims that &quot;Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars&quot; is another &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;leaked&quot; government document which she claims &quot;PROVES&quot; that the government or the Bilderbergs are killing us all (or &quot;PLAN&quot; to kill us all) with &quot;SILENT WEAPONS&quot; in furtherance of the &quot;PLANNED&quot; &quot;extinction of mankind&quot;. But, this is not so. Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars (&quot;SWFQW&quot;) is actually a short booklet of political fiction written by Lyle Hartford Van Dyke in 1978-79. (Van Dyke is a convicted felon who spent a decade in federal prison for fraud and for effectively writing checks drawn on his imaginary &quot;trust account at the U.S. Treasury&quot;.). SWFQW is not a secret, leaked or suppressed government document. Van Dyke was not a whistle blower. He was a political commentator. </p>

<p>In 1978-79, Van Dyke wrote and distributed his 44 page document of POLITICAL FICTION entitled, SWFQW. Van Dyke believed (perhaps correctly) that the U.S. had advance knowledge of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and allowed it to happen (killing thousands of American soldiers) in order to draw the U.S. into World War II. Van Dyke was outraged by this perceived treasonous ACT OF WAR BY THE U.S. UPON ITS OWN SOLDIERS and wanted to make the HORRORS of this treasonous act of war PERSONAL to the American public. So, Van Dyke wrote SWFQW and suggested that instead of intentionally killing ITS OWN SOLDIERS in such a treasonous act of war, the U. S. government was intentionally killing ITS OWN CIVILIAN POPULATION in such a treasonous act of war (a clever twist of the perceived facts). (Note that this claim would indeed make the HORRORS of such a &quot;Pearl Harbor-type&quot; war on Americans PERSONAL to the reader.). But, Van Dyke realized that the public would not actually believe his premise (of a U.S. war against the American public) without the presence of the usual weapons of war, like those that were present at Pearl Harbor (armed soldiers, trucks, tanks, planes, ships, missiles, bombs, etc.). So, in writing SWFQW, Van Dyke claimed that all of the weapons that the U.S. was using in this FICTIONAL war against the American public were high tech weapons that COULD NOT BE SEEN OR HEARD (which TAVARES has recently embellished to mean cell phones, cell towers, WIFI, microwaves, &quot;smart meters&quot;, geo-engineering and HAARP, etc.). Because the readers of SWFQW could not actually see or hear any weapons being used against them, Van Dyke&#39;s claims appeared to be true. Indeed, because such weapons could not be seen or heard, there was no way to dispute Van Dyke&#39;s claims of INVISIBLE &amp; INAUDIBLE weapons. All of this actually made Van Dyke&#39;s claims of INVISIBLE &amp; INAUDIBLE weapons MORE (not less) BELIEVABLE to the reader. By using this ruse, VAN DYKE ACTUALLY MADE THE ABSENCE OF WEAPONS EVEN MORE HORRIFYING TO THE READER THAN THEIR PRESENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN. It was absolutely brilliant. Van Dyke openly admits that SWFQW was inspired by an earlier book of POLITICAL FICTION which he greatly admired entitled, &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain&quot; (see below). Van Dyke also openly admits to having incorporated sections of REAL scientific and economic TECHNICAL studies into his work (as did &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain&quot;) to make his work appear more official-looking. Finally, Van Dyke openly admits that he created SWFQW to read like an official governmental document (as did &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain&quot;) in order to make the HORRORS of the U.S. government waging a covert war against its own citizens APPEAR MORE REAL and therefore more terrifying to the reader. It worked.

<p>ABOUT SNOOP4TRUTH:</p>

<p>Snoop4truth is a legal expert and whistle blower who exposes online hoaxes. Snoop4truth did not reveal this information to harm Deborah Tavares. Instead, Snoop4truth revealed this information solely to reduce the CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE that such intentional fraud inflicts upon the American people every single day. Had it not been for Tavares&#39; role in the &quot;Judge DALE Hoax&quot;, Snoop4truth would not have revealed this information here. </p>

<p>The message to all charlatans and hoaxers? Just tell the truth. The truth does not fear investigation. Only lies fear investigation. The truth can be supported by using the truth. Only lies must be supported by using hoaxes (other lies). There is no such thing as a &quot;good reason&quot; to intentionally defraud the American people, not even to make a popular conspiracy theory appear to be true. </p>
