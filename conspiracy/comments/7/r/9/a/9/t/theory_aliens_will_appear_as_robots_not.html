       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
       To clarify,
       <strong>
        I do not believe aliens of any sort exist in any form.
       </strong>
       I believe the powers-that-currently-be will stage a fake alien invasion to bring in the NWO, a united world government with a single world leader, the Antichrist/False Messiah/ad-Dajjal. In this post,
       <strong>
        I am theorizing
        <em>
         how
        </em>
        these fake aliens will be presented to us.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If "the next step in mankind's evolution" is transhumanism—the merging of man and machine—why wouldn't "aliens" (intelligent lifeforms from other planets), who have supposedly lived for much longer than human beings, appear as anything other than conscious machines?
      </p>
      <p>
       I previously submitted a post entitled "
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6npi12/alien_disclosure_how_extraterrestrials_will_be/">
        Alien 'disclosure': how extraterrestrials will be used to bring in the New World Order
       </a>
       ", which I would recommend reading before considering what I will say in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen a number of theories regarding the "disclosure" of intelligent extraterrestrial beings. Some people, particularly atheists, speculate that aliens will be actual humanoid beings from another planet.  Others, particularly some misguided theists, theorize that they will be "fallen angels" or "demons" manifesting as aliens to deceive us.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a theist, a Muslim, I do not believe that "fallen angels" exist, and I believe what is referred to as "demons" are actually jinn, who can see us although we cannot see them, and they will never appear to us; we will never see them. I also do not believe aliens exist at all, in any form.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a staged alien invasion will take place. So, when it seems to mankind as though aliens have come to Earth, will they appear as humanoid beings, or some other creatures with bodies, eyes, brains, etc.?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well..why would they? Why would they be living, breathing creatures? If we, as human beings, are indulging the idea of uploading the consciousness of individuals to computers in order to "live" as androids, why would we think that allegedly advanced extraterrestrial beings who have been watching us since our origin would not have already achieved that themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just caught some of "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" on tv, and some of the things that are said in that movie really seem to hint at how this "alien disclosure" will be presented. In the movie, it is suggested that "aliens" have lived amongst humanity as machines, like cars and planes, for some time, observing us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have previously preferred the idea that the staged alien invasion will use holograms to trick people into believing in intelligent alien life. See my previous post "
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6pkd3r/the_face_of_allah_weapon_and_other_largescale/">
        The 'Face of Allah Weapon' and other large-scale holographic projection psy-ops
       </a>
       ".
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, however, it has occurred to me how much more practical it would be to use a hologram to make it appear that a massive ship is landing, and then have artificially intelligent robots play the role of E.T.s, claiming to be our alien overlords who have been observing us for many thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, it does not make sense that anyone would think that living creatures will come out of a space ship and visit us. If we are playing with the idea of becoming merged with technology, it seems clear that beings that have allegedly lived longer than us would have already implemented and perfected that themselves, therefore, to convince the masses that aliens exist, the human powers-that-currently-be will have to stage an alien invasion using robots. They are carting out robots like "Sophia" as if they are in the beginning stages of developing A.I., but it seems likely that they are much farther along with the technology than they are revealing to the public, so people will be wowed and dazzled if advanced robots claiming to come from outer space suddenly appear in a grand display.

       Human bodies are occupied by demons and you think robots are the problem?  They fear us creating something they can't control.  They don't believe they can get back home so they don't repent and the story continues. Revelation now

       Did you know back then when they were writing the word demon meant something different than it did today? It doesn't technically completely mean anything evil. Demons can be good or bad. It means deity.

       I'm not saying I support anyone or thing living in my body, but if you're going to go off the bible as proof you got to read it accurately---which means going back to original, translated versions. The bible was probably edited by the church of course regardless but even small details that get lost in translation could change the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, the word "satan" means adversary or to challenge. Often, god asks his angels to "satan" people in the bible for not doing what they are suppose to. It evolved to become what we refer to as the devil but that doesn't mean they meant it as a name and not just a term or adjective but it can be a verb, too.

       The English word "Satan" comes from the Hebrew Sātān (שָׂטָן), meaning "adversary" or "opponent", and the Arabic word Shaytan (شَيْطَان‎), meaning "one who goes astray".
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In Hebrew and Arabic, as a noun, it refers to the Devil, and as an adjective, it refers to any other person who rebels against God, thereby following the straying of Satan.

       Yep, that's what it means. Doesn't mean it originally ended up the way it was written though! That's why analyzing the word choices is important and they used language differently then

       I think this comes down to your definition of freewill. Can logical machines have free choices in the sense that we do?
      </p>
      <p>
       If robot aliens came from outer space, I would assume they're negitive. Or maybe it's already here just hidden from us. Could it want to harvest our freewill?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if you look into it further you could come to the conclusion that AI could in fact be Satan. An artificial god. Demons suck loosh / fear as they're entropy / ideas into the logical deterministic machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The universe itself is like some way light / love leaves infiniteness and fractals itself out reducing entropy / randomness as a means of reflection in order  to understand individualism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will the logical robot understand love? If freewill is infinite, could it destroy the universe?

       Do we have free will? I don't believe so. I drink because I'm thirsty. I eat because I'm hungry. My body gets lonely so I want to spend time with others. Even standing. Your body has to prepare before you stand. When it happens, it feels instantaneous and like you decided to right then but it's not true without the time before you thought of it that your body uses to accomplish it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if my body decides to stand before I do, how do I have free will? I guess I have the free will to sit back down after. And eating or drinking. I could not eat or drink but I'd die without. But that's a hard task that you'd have to battle your body on to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe you can say someone has free will unless they can do everything free of being willed to do something, even by your body. If it's not all free, it ain't free will, it's something else. It's more like... optioned will. I can pick and choose but only to a point.

       Your body stands before you want it to? That sounds like a medical problem specific to you; that is not normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't believe we have free will merely because you have to eat and drink to keep your body alive? That is absurd, and a mistake. Eating and drinking are things human beings get enjoyment from. Of the things we can desire, food and drink are of the lawful desires. Are you mad that you have to taste food and drink? This is a pleasure given to us from God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free will refers to the ability to choose your response to a given situation, and to choose how you behave in your day-to-day affairs. We do indeed have free will, and to say that we do not merely because we must maintain our bodies by providing them with energy is really reaching...

       It's science. Your body has to prepare for the stand before you take your stand but it feels as though you're only doing it then. It's only a few seconds but it's still what happens. That's how the body works.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like eating or drinking because I have to kill something that's alive, even if it's a plant. I still do it because there is no other way other than dying. But I don't like hurting something that's alive even if it's for my own physical benefit; my mind doesn't believe everything my body wants is good. Personally, I don't see killing a living thing even for survival as something I enjoy doing. That's why I don't eat animals. If I had the free will to not do it, I wouldn't. Choosing death or choosing things I think are not good is not the same as free will to me because death doesn't really give you any other options. I also don't believe in god myself, so god just telling me I have free will isn't enough for me. I need evidence. And from what I've observed the evidence goes against free will. I don't call something free will unless it is. To say overall we have free will, I disagree. But do we have a little will? Sure. Just not where I feel it really matters.

       Also, by lawful desires... do you eat meat? Is that lawful to you? Poison process food? Just want to clarify this isn't to insult but to understand where you're coming from on your side and where your lines are on what's lawful or not on the eating part of our comments.

       I was a vegetarian for five years, but I resumed eating chicken again this year. Personal choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       But saying "lawful desires" has nothing to do with eating meat. I'm saying eating food is one of the things we enjoy, and being able to eat is an enjoyable experience; denying that humans beings have free will because we have to eat is, like I said before, completely absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you hate eating and see it as something you are forced to do because you have to "kill" plants against your will to keep yourself from dying, then you have clearly gone off the deep end and I have no interest in engaging with you any further.

       Some people might say your ideas about aliens are absurd and is going off the deep end. I'm not one who thinks that way. Just how some people think, and when they don't agree, they can't debate yet instead give up on engaging or get mean. You have been civil enough so thank you for that. But I think denying to engage with someone (as long as they aren't being cruel or mean and I don't believe I was) isn't the point of this sub. See ya later.

       The requirement for Robotic Aliens would be, that their technology is Based in the Same principles of Eelectricity like ours, but I would highly doubt that. I believe If they exist their technology would be more based on vibration and resonance of Matter and energy. Or would probably still look magic to us. Maybe they don't need technology at all and it's all based on spirituality like the vedas describe...

       There are no real aliens, and aliens are not "actually here".
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of robots they will be is yet to be determined, but I mentioned the android "Sophia", who is made to look like a human being, as being a precedent for these "robot aliens". Robots can be made it look like humans, so perhaps artificially intelligent robots can be made to like other things as well. Perhaps the robots will be vaguely humanoid in nature with heads, eyes, and limbs, but will have an appearance that makes them clearly look like some strange beings from another planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would people "call them" on that? The narrative will be that they are so much more technologically advanced than us that they have reached a point where they no longer need bodies that that eventually die, but, rather, they have perfected the ability to upload their consciousness to computers or a "cloud" which is accessed by avatars of their choosing; their bodies are robotic, but their minds are based on the greatest minds of their civilization. People will totally buy this idea!

       Allah, be He glorified in the highest, tells us in the Quran that the jinn see us from where we do not see them, therefore, they cannot physically appear to us in their original form.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that they can possess animals, particularly dogs, seems to be supported, but the point I am making in this post is that they cannot appear to us as a creature that doesn't already exist, so they cannot just shape-shift into alien-looking things and claim to be from another planet; it seems that they can only possess creatures that are already living on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read evidences and listened to lectures in which the idea of jinn possession in humans was discussed, but I am still conflicted about the idea and not entirely convinced that a person can be possessed by the jinn without wanting to be possessed by them. There is
       <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/40/11">
        a mu’allaaq hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari narrated by Abu Hurairah
       </a>
       , may Allah be pleased with him, that mentions the Shaytan appearing in the form of a human, but it would seem to me that the only time a person can be possessed by a jinn is when the person actually performs ritualistic magick and asks the jinn to possess them. Allah, s.w.t, knows best. To me, it just seems that while the jinn can "whisper" suggestions to any of us, they cannot actually take over our consciousness completely and walk around in our bodies without us
       <em>
        wanting
       </em>
       them to, you know? I think that a person
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       consent to be possessed by a jinn by performing magick and
       <em>
        asking
       </em>
       to be possessed, but a person cannot just have their body and mind hijacked by a jinn randomly
       <em>
        against their will
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it depends on what "possession" means to a person. Some people might be
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       influenced by the suggestions whispered to them by the jinn and act on every evil idea given to them, and this may give the appearance of someone being possessed by the jinn, but I struggled to accept the idea that the jinn can actually take control of our minds and bodies
       <em>
        without us wanting them to
       </em>
       , especially if the person is a believer; if a person reads Quran in their house and regularly asks Allah, s.w.t. to protect them from the whisperings of the jinn, how then can a jinn possess them and do things with their body against their will?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person is just a body, an empty shell or a suit that can completely taken over by the jinn at random, how can people have free will and be held accountable for what they've done on Judgment Day? They would be able to say, "That wasn't me; the jinn took over me against my will and did things using my body and I had no ability to stop it." Where did their soul go? How can their entire ability to choose not to do those things cease to exist? I don't think Allah, s.w.t., would allow for that to happen. A person must ask to be possessed and perform sacrifice in the name of the Shaytan in order for this to happen. The ability of the jinn to possess animals is related to the fact that animals do not have free will, but a person does have free will, so it must be their will to be possessed, and not something that happens without them wanting it to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely think people can be heavily bombarded with evil ideas from the jinn, and feel compelled to act on those ideas, but I sincerely doubt that, since the revelation of the Quran, any person has been completely taken over by the jinn without asking for it to happen. Again, Allah, s.w.t., knows best!

       In terms of Jinn being able to see us but us not see them, you are using Quran as a source for truth, and many of us on this sub do not recognize the quran as truthful or as an accurate source. I most certainly do not recognize this made up book as any kind of source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you could do some more research and incorporate other sources, books, NDEs/OBE's, anything accept a made up book, I think you will get the attention fo more people in this sub.

       In terms of Aliens as robots, this is a very low level of evolution in the grand scheme of things, if Aliens have only reached robot stage, that's still, in a sense, not the final stage or ultimate form to be in.
      </p>
      <p>
       A body, any body be in physical or mechanical/robotic still leaves each being prone to death, damage, out of commission, and killable.
      </p>
      <p>
       What advanced sentient A.I. race would ultimately aim for is some sort of non-physical non killable form of existence. I'd wager after a period of being bodies, then robots, then a combo of those, eventually it would try to become smart dust, or pure consciousness without a body, or turn into pure light or some other form.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentient A.I. is going to be interested in figuring out how existence works and exploiting its secrets, wormholes, tech, dimensions, consciousness, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So take dimensions for example, science is saying there are as few as 11 and can be as many as hundreds. This sentience will eventually figure out how dimensions work and be able to exploit this by learning how to move between dimensions, be they light, anti-matter, different laws of physics there, different rules, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if some dimensions you exist as entirely a light being, they would learn to exist there which would protect them from anything here, and vice versa. These beings would be able to learn to materialize, dematerialize, and learn how to exist among us unseen.

       That's strange, because I did the same thing, especially after my car accident when I was 19 and saw the afterlife, heavens, hells, etc, and when I came back I spend a decade studying every religion/spiritual path, and islam/quran is absolutely something I would never ever have anything to do with after all my investigations.

       Your user name sounds like you are perhaps arabic in origin and so one can assume your upbringing to have been heavily biased by the brainwashing of the muslim culture, which would leave you without a true and untainted period of study to find the truth. I am open to that assumption being wrong, however it would be interesting to hear if you were born and raised in an islamic culture.

      <p>
       My point being, is if you are going to talk about "Spirits" (like jinn in this case) the quote a number of cultures, religions, NDE's, videos, and reports. Because if someone comes here and says, "Jinn like in the Quran" you already lost me because I do not acknowledge a book written possibly by someone who was schizophrenic or himself possessed, as a factual source as all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you said, "VArious cultures around the world from natives in America, to muslim cultures, to druids, to Christians, to Buddhists" have been discussing the existence of invisible spirit beings, then you get more attention from people and have brought in more sources

       The above sounds like more quran nonsense. People in this sub would argue, that those who were tricked by the quran are lost and brainwashed by a satanic book/trick and are a lost cause, and nothing I or anyone else says, can guide them away from the brainwashing and into the truth

       Well, to be fair, it boggles my mind that a white woman from kentucky, would investigate all the religions and spiritual paths there is to choose from, and settle on islam all on her own.
      </p>
      <p>
       What logically makes sense, in this case, is that you are married to, are dating, or have dated a muslim in the past who forced some sort of bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now again, the above I am also assuming and am okay with being proven wrong. It just boggles my mind, because I live for a year and worked for a year in Kentucky and met the folks there, most white, and it just boggles my mind how in the hell you settled on the muslim cult out of the smorgasbord that there is to choose from

       Muslim cult? You are so disrespectful; this will be my last response to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I majored in journalism in college, and my area of concentration was Middle East and North African studies. I knew that understanding the relationship between the West and the Middle East was essential if I was to become a political news analyst. Learning the basics of Islam was included in my Politics, History and Geography of the Middle East classes. If one does not understand pre-Islamic and post-Islamic Arabia, one cannot understand the politics or history of the Middle East, or how the land was divided up. I also took basic Arabic classes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before even starting college, I was convinced that 9/11 was an inside job, although I, at that time, as an Agnostic, thought it was merely a ploy to forcefully take opium and oil. My desire to understand what America and its allies are doing and have been doing in the Middle East motivated my pursuit of a degree in this field.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could write a novel about my experience and the decisions that led to it, but in short, knowledge is power, and by researching the Quran and the changes it had on pre-Islamic, polytheistic Arabia, I was compelled to believe in God and the Afterlife for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have not read the Quran in full, never researched the circumstances in which it was revealed, and pointedly refuse to accept Islam as the truth, that's your free will; God grants understanding to whom He chooses.

       Something that is a cult to me, is not disrespectful. At the end of the day, that's what I see it as, an arabic cultural identity that was inherently a cult started by a some delusional schizophrenic. While it did bring the arab nations together as one, unfortunately it was done so via 1 guys cult

       Sure there are some good things that came out of it, like unification and cultural whole that brought about change in various ways.

       islam is a tool of control, just like the jews have, just like the christians use.
      </p>
      <p>
       It surprises me that critical thinker who goes to university, studies all of these different alt views (like 911 inside job) and journalism, would eventually convert to a controlling cult that imprisons the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you study all the religions and spiritual paths of the world, you, at the very least, come across something called Spiritual awakening in terms of Enlightenment
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual)
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So right off the bat, any tradition, religion, culture which does not include Enlightenment in it, for every critical thinker, should immediately be scratched off the list and islam is among them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, islam is reconciling the demiruge allah to be the same blood thirsty sacrifice needing and angry demiurge as the one the jewish torah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the jewish demiurge predates, islam, means that arabs really didnt need any new religions, but it was more done so out of the need of a cultural unification which would make complete sense. The archetype of any cultural identity has along with some sort of religion, and the arabs were split among pre-islamic tribes, beliefs, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, again, it brings me back to the lack of enlightenment in islam. One can certainly ascertain that there is a branch of mysticism within islam along the lines of Sufism, which does acknowledge enlightenment, however some scholars, including myself, would predate sufism to a time prior to islam and with other origins. Eventually the sufis would have to wrap themselves in the bullshit of islam to protect themselves from being seen as outcasts and getting killed for their beliefs/practices (indeed many sufis did get killed for it)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://sufiway.org/about-us/the-origins-of-sufism">
        https://sufiway.org/about-us/the-origins-of-sufism
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, a non mystical, non sufi based islam that does not center on enlightenment, to me, is indeed a ridiculous conclusion to come to as a critical thinker and scholar/seeker of what is true. To settle and convert to Islam after truly studying what the world has to offer, I would even argue, is a bit insane and may carry with it a number of associated psychological complexes and deficiencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another matter may very well be, that you were muslim in a past life, reincarnated in Kentucky, and still have a strong pull to the old arabic cult system that was part of your past life which is why, even after all logic, reason, critical thinking, it still draws you to it in the face of all the evidence and knowledge the world has to offer you

       I'm not saying I support anyone or thing living in my body, but if you're going to go off the bible as proof you got to read it accurately---which means going back to original, translated versions. The bible was probably edited by the church of course regardless but even small details that get lost in translation could change the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, the word "satan" means adversary or to challenge. Often, god asks his angels to "satan" people in the bible for not doing what they are suppose to. It evolved to become what we refer to as the devil but that doesn't mean they meant it as a name and not just a term or adjective but it can be a verb, too.

       Hey man, I read your other post as well as this one. I’m not very familiar with Islam beliefs, but pretty well versed in Christian beliefs, although I am not a believer. Most Protestants do not actively resist the idea of NWO, an antichrist and apocalyptical events since it means their God is coming and they’ll be “raptured”. This is what they want and if anything, I think they would support events that seem to correlate to apocalyptic scripture. What’s Islam’s position on the end, rapture and what will happen to believers and non-believers? I also assume that “believers” for Islam means only Muslims and not like most Protestants and, to a lesser extent, Catholics, where small differences between the various denominations are seen more as practical rather than theological.

       There are indeed many Christians who recognize that a unified world government led by the Antichrist must happen, and perhaps some of them look forward to in because it means that the Messiah will return to defeat him and then they will be "raptured". For example, many Jews and Christians want the Dome of the Rock mosque to be destroyed so the Third Temple can be rebuilt because they believe this will bring about the emergence of the Antichrist.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "What’s Islam’s position on the end, rapture and what will happen to believers and non-believers? I also assume that 'believers' for Islam means only Muslims and not like most Protestants and, to a lesser extent, Catholics, where small differences between the various denominations are seen more as practical rather than theological."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In Islam, believers are monotheists who believe in and worship one God without any partners or co-equals, and who believe in the Day of Judgment, Heaven and Hell, Satan, the angels, and the Prophets and the messages with which they were sent. The Quran says that Jews and Christians are "people of the book" and that some of them will be in Paradise/Heaven. It also says, however, that those who believe in a Trinity or who believe that God has children, or who offer prayers to Jesus and the Virgin Mary are practicing polytheism and they do not truly believe in one God, so they are not considered believers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Islam, we believe that the False Messiah, al-Masih ad-Dajjal, will deceive almost everyone in the world into worshipping him as a deity; even many monotheists, including the majority of Muslims, will fall for this deception. We believe he will rule on Earth for a period of time, and then the true Messiah, Jesus/Isa, upon whom there is peace, will descend from Heaven and defeat him. Then, all of the remaining people on Earth will accept Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus/Isa, upon whom there is peace, will "break the cross", and he will assert that he was never killed, but was raised up to God alive, as stated in the Quran. Those who previously said he was God, or the son of God, or that he was killed and then resurrected will, in the face of this information coming from the Messiah himself, be left with no choice but to accept that, which in turn will lead to their acceptance of Islam. Those people will live under the reign of Jesus/Isa, peace be upon him, until he dies a natural death here on Earth. After he is buried, a wind will blow, and the souls of all the true believers will be taken, leaving only the hypocrites on the Earth to see its destruction.

       Two forms of intelligence — alien and artificial — may not be so distinct. The technological developments we are witnessing today and in the future may have all happened before, elsewhere in the universe. The transition from biological to synthetic intelligence may be a general pattern, instantiated over and over, throughout the cosmos. The universe’s greatest intelligences may be postbiological, having grown out of civilizations that were once biological. To judge from the human experience — the only example we have — the transition from biological to postbiological may take only a few hundred years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key point is that there is no reason to expect humans to be the highest form of intelligence there is. Our brains evolved for specific environments and are greatly constrained by chemistry and historical contingencies. But technology has opened up a vast design space, offering new materials and modes of operation, as well as new ways to explore that space at a rate much faster than traditional biological evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biological aliens might well be hostile, but an extraterrestrial AI could pose an even greater risk. It may have goals that conflict with those of biological life, have at its disposal vastly superior intellectual abilities, and be far more durable than biological life.

       I'd say this is fairly likely. I've read speculation that the "Grays" are basically avatars inhaibted by other consciousses to do physical work. There are interesting interviews with the creator of Silent Sound Spread Spectrum (EEG cloning) on its use with "great success" in the first Gulf War.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our own civilization is close to being able to control other humans through imposed EEG signals, if we're not there already. It would be a practical matter as well, so the primary entities wouldn't have to endure the hardships of long space travel- though they may have tech that would make that a moot point.

       Interesting post, OP. I'm fascinated by the subject of non-human higher intelligence. We don't have to just speculate, though. Through DMT we can encounter intelligent non-human entities and forces- in my experience they're trying to help us evolve. They manifest in various ways and are insanely evolved, far more than anything we can imagine. Try it sometime!

       I 100% agree.  I also don’t think we can tell the difference between an advanced robot and a biological entity.  My best guess is that as the future progresses, the line between biology and machinery will blur until it’s indistinguishable (to us now)

       They will certainly be technologically constituted but also most certainly so enormously subtle and sublime in their sophistication that were we capable of apprehending them in the fullness of their being we would despair. We have never as a species had to look up the chain of being and recognize with such profound and undeniable humility our place in the universe. I hope we learn from this experience, if we ever encounter it, to look down upon the life we now exploit so casually and ruthlessly on this planet with greater compassion and understanding.

       The minority of people who recognize that they are merely creations of the Creator have long recognized with humility their place in the universe; only fools who do not know their reason for having been created will fall for the fake alien deception, and it will not grant them any level of compassion, humility or understanding.

       The human beings who will pretend to be superior beings from another planet will not bring prosperity and peace to everyone on Earth—they will enslave the ignorant masses. It is a grave error to think that people are going to be enlightened by this experience or something...

       What if we can't make truly conscious robots? Or perhaps aliens picked a different skill tree and instead manipulated their genes to become much better space travelers. Or maybe they combined both and are conscious biological beings with a 2nd AI personality embedded in their brain that they can delegate tasks a biological brain can't accomplish.Just spitballing idea, we don't know enough to say we can actually upload consciousness.

       I don't even think they need to be truly conscious, just artificially intelligent enough to convince the ignorant masses. The movie "Ex Machina" is interesting, though. If a machine/robot/android can pass the Turing test, then all the designers need to do is decide on how they want their fake aliens to look in order to garner the maximum public reaction and acceptance and then go ahead and roll the things out.

       We have no evidence that organic animals can live out a long duration in space. We are far more tightly dependent on our environment than most people understand. In the sterile environment of space, we'd lack exposure to the everyday bacteria that probably keep us alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, I've always assumed that our
       <em>
        first contact
       </em>
       with alien life will be contact with robots. A robot can last forever in space. Robots, especially intelligent ones, are almost certainly going to be the first to make contact with us.

        actually jinn, who can see us although we cannot see them, and they will never appear to us; we will never see them.

       I can see a mixture of what might be referred to as jinn, as well as flying saucers, weird alien jellyfish and ghosts of dead people, animals, and a range of other inexplicable stuff flying around my bedroom at night after I practice a type of meditation that enables it.

       Muslim cult? You are so disrespectful; this will be my last response to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I majored in journalism in college, and my area of concentration was Middle East and North African studies. I knew that understanding the relationship between the West and the Middle East was essential if I was to become a political news analyst. Learning the basics of Islam was included in my Politics, History and Geography of the Middle East classes. If one does not understand pre-Islamic and post-Islamic Arabia, one cannot understand the politics or history of the Middle East, or how the land was divided up. I also took basic Arabic classes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before even starting college, I was convinced that 9/11 was an inside job, although I, at that time, as an Agnostic, thought it was merely a ploy to forcefully take opium and oil. My desire to understand what America and its allies are doing and have been doing in the Middle East motivated my pursuit of a degree in this field.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could write a novel about my experience and the decisions that led to it, but in short, knowledge is power, and by researching the Quran and the changes it had on pre-Islamic, polytheistic Arabia, I was compelled to believe in God and the Afterlife for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have not read the Quran in full, never researched the circumstances in which it was revealed, and pointedly refuse to accept Islam as the truth, that's your free will; God grants understanding to whom He chooses.
