       'Virtue signaling', as some may call it, is simply a ploy to garner a reaction based upon your emotion. The mainstream media and information providers know it is easier to get a response from someone's emotion rather then rational, concise thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be seen ALL over Reddit once you recognize what it looks like and control how the posts you see affect you.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7r6802/trump_administration_bars_haitians_from_us_visas/">
        top post
       </a>
       in /WorldNews right now has the title, "Trump administration bars Haitians from U.S. visas for low-skilled work". Naturally and understandably, someone will read that title and say something along the lines of, "How could Trump do this? He's saying all Hatians are low skilled workers and won't allow them to have the benefits we have here but as an immigrant! All immigrants deserve a chance!".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's playing your emotions and everyone is falling right into it. Reddit also knows an extremely high percentage of people only read the headlines, so writing a emotionally effective title will trigger the responses they want - upvotes for visability so
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       people see it and
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       people react emotionally without actually looking into the article any further.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, if any of the 44,000 people who upvoted that post read into it any more, they'd read that Haiti was already on a very small scale immigration policy. Less than 100 Haitians per year were allowed into this country and most simply went to agricultural duties. Agricultural duties is not highly skilled work like engineering or mathematics. I would know. I used to work on a family friends farm for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, essentially, Donald Trumps ban on Haitian immigrants due to low skilled labor does not make any marginal change whatsoever. It barley makes a dent and if nothing was said, would go unnoticed,
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       , Reddit being the political platform it is, knew the right words could trigger emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is easier, as I said before, to react based of your emotion than it is a clear, well thought out and concise thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is gaming everyone and the psychological campaign being played seems to be working on most, but not all. This is happening with every political subreddit regardless of the party affiliation. It's disgusting, sneaky, low, devious and ultimately moraless.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit is at fault too. I ask that when you read a post title, you pull yourself away from it and actually read it.

       Screw the Haitians. Voodoo cannibals and white people murdering animals, the French should’ve have never gone there in the first place. We should be shooting their boats out of the water before they land on Florida shores. Remember the Miami face eating guy? That was a Haitian, and he wasn’t even high according to the toxicology!

       You are very right. This is an online tool like anything else. It's controlled. It can't always be trusted. Though, I suppose nothing can be. Not that Reddit is all a terrible place but no one should be fully believing anything on here or relying on it for all their information.

       So you must loathe how this administration is killing medicaid, the ACA, destroying consumer protections (CFPB, EPA, FDA, USDA, SEC)  and threatening to privatize Social Security?  Right?  Or how they are further eroding union rights, worker rights or deregulating regulations on banks?

       So basically you're the one with your head in the sand?
      </p>
      <p>
       All GOP administrations try to starve the beast and destroy the protection we put in place post WWII to protect the old (SS) or the sick (Medicaid, SSDi).  They want to roll back the environmental protections, worker protection and financial regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's right there in their platform:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://gop.com/platform/reforming-government/">
        https://gop.com/platform/reforming-government/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And you specifically said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        our own citizens homeless, freezing on the streets, 20 percent of our citizens need food assistance, 100 million on some sort of welfare, and these idiots who are only capable of thinking with their emotions cry and whine that we aren't letting enough people in that won't be able to take care of themselves.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       All of which would be helped by bolstering these protections the GOP is committed to destroying, in their own words.
      </p>
      <p>
       So which is it?  Blame the immigrant for 20% of people in poverty?  Blame the immigrant for financial institutions cheating and causing a near depression in 2008?  Do we blame the immigrant for GOP governors refusing to expand (for free) Medicaid?  Do we blame immigrants for the GOP refusing to reauthorize SCHIP that saves children's lives?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is it?  The immigrant or the GOP?  One specifically tells you they are fucking the poor and disabled and elderly.  The other, immigrants, are a nebulous thing that just might be a boogeyman, especially for a group that is telling you what it's doing.

       You're on a conspiracy sub. If you feel like being self congratulatory and it's a stroke to your superiority complex because I don't want to get into a circular discussion about your partisan talking points with your labels designed to illicit emotional responses from others so they automatically discredit my opinions, then have fun with it. Or take it to r politics where it belongs.

       How does he have his head in the sand when he is saying that this doesn't start with Trump, it's been going on for a long time. I'd say since the early 90's at least. 2000-2008 were the big military boom years, but that doesn't get the coverage without the telecommunications act.

       So, it's been a shitswizzling 30 years designed to make them loads of money. Clintons, Bushes, Obama, Trump...all the same.

       That's a fairly binary way of looking at most of this, but yall gotta toe the line and continue the battle between left &amp; right and using said emotional triggers to belittle or 'work over' other users.

       That's why people don't hang like EXPOSED or BREAKING when spreading anything about Clinton especially when they tell us all the times shes going to get arrested. She's super slippery apparently. Must be hard to catch an old lady with issues post stroke and a boot and gps tracker

       I've done my best to filter these type of posts.  I've used RES filter to filter emotional trigger words like horrifying, terrifying, and frightening. Can you guys think of any other key words to filter that would help to see less of these posts?

       Yes, a lot of the people who run the social media on the internet has said they do this on purpose. People don't care about the truth as long as things are worded in a way that triggers an emotional response.

       It isn't just Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       All media oulets or media generating websites, use emotions in order to make you reply to a post. Once you reply you start an 'arguement' the bigger the 'arguement' the more posts it attracts. Which in turn attracts more extreme views on either side, which creates more arguements and so on and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, if somebody shows me one more fucking facebook arguement with the opening statement of "OMG have u seen what this person said about X, what a fucking arsehole!", i may just put my head into a blender.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more people who visit a media creating website in order to join in on the arguement are just adding revenue to that website. Bots argue to waste time and to attract attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       DO NOT ENGAGE IN LENGTHY DISAGREEMENTS. They are usually bots. When you see the posts "prove it" or "explain because you're full of shit" followed by endless one or two word goading. I see it all the time on this sub. Put your point forward and move on. The bots are designed to waste your time.

       Completely agree. And it will be interesting how media, both legacy and social play out in the next few years. Reddit is becoming Facebook.
