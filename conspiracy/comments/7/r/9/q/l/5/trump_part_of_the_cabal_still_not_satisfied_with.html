        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The first thread I put up: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7r6bvo/if_trump_is_part_of_the_cabal_and_90_of_all_media/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7r6bvo/if_trump_is_part_of_the_cabal_and_90_of_all_media/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But from the comments I ask simple questions and get downvoted quickly and their comments with lots of lots of assumptions gets upvoted very very quickly. To me, THIS IS SUSPICIOUS AND NEGATES THEIR ARGUMENTS so stop with the downvoting because it is obvious, just answer with logic. Could be my fault, I could have asked better questions, so here is my second try. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s try again, better answers please. In the first, I argued why Trump is not part of the cabal, because why elect him if he was to destroy the MSMs? Remember MSMs cover 90% of ALL news in the world. </p>

<p>So:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why risk destroying mainstream and increasing alternative media</li>
<li>Why risk it?</li>
<li>Why risk alt med outing them as satanists?</li>
<li>Why risk alt med  outing them as pedophiles?</li>
<li>Why risk red pilling the masses in the US?</li>
<li>Why risk red pilling the world? </li>
</ul>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t that cause more people to be smarter, more informed, more intelligent, more suspicious? If Trump was in a different faction, destroying MSMs and making Alt Med popular, <strong>ISN&#39;T THAT JUST AS DANGEROUS</strong> for his supposed faction? </p>

<p>And yes, nobody has yet to provide with WHO is the faction he is working for? It makes me ask the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is he working for? </li>
<li>WHo is more powerful than the Rothchilds to go against them? Unlikely, no?</li>
<li>Would this mean there is an internal war between the Bilderberg group or the Council of 300 or the Council of Foreign relations etc ... ? Again, unlikely, no?</li>
</ul>

<p>And look, here is what he has done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Employment is up</li>
<li>BLACK Employment is up</li>
<li>GDP is up</li>
<li>Investment is up</li>
<li>The stock market is up</li>
<li>Deportations are up</li>
<li>Confidence is up</li>
<li>Minority unemployment is down</li>
<li>Illegal immigration is down</li>
<li>Taxes are down</li>
<li>Regulations are down</li>
<li>ISIS is down</li>
<li>DOJ investigative Clinton Foundation</li>
<li>DOJ investigate Clinton emails</li>
<li>DOJ investigate Obama drug trafficking by Hezbollah</li>
<li>NK peace talks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This would make the common pleb much more powerful, no?</strong> </p>

<p>So if he is part of the other side, or a faction, and he is not them, like satanic pedos, is there anything WORSE than satanic pedos? Is he into like .... alien worshipping sacrificing MILFs and drinking their blood? What does he stand for then if he is not one of them??? Be specific not assumptions!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a matter of pressure that the U.S populace has never experienced. A president who will sit and smile and tell you canned garbage to sooth hurt feelings or highly rational fears or thoughts is no man of democracy. Even if he comes across as an asshole you really get a good look at how he really feels about subjects and people are actually taking value in what these people are doing and saying sparking talk and understanding of this fucked up bureaucracy as it sits or standing up for the principles that they back. Divide and conquer only works if people do not unite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The EPA is just another tax man. The states want to have clean air and clean cities and nature. We pour billions of dollars into their program of &quot;fucking duh&quot; and all they do is stifle production and make things harder and more expensive for people who rely on vehicles chemicals and manufacture to live. They get off scott free after causing environmental disasters and generally fucking up at their job.</p>

<p>Less money for the fed more money for the states.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be right. I don&#39;t really know, but here are some possible answers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why risk destroying mainstream and increasing alternative media?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It allows them to better direct smaller individually manipulated groups towards there own ends. This way they can get group A to do X, while getting group B to do Y, with both preventing either group from seeing that W is actually the bigger issue, and all contributing to cause Z. </p>

<p>Most alternative media is controlled by the MSM as well, btw</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why risk it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because left to its own devices, the economy is on life support. They are trying to create the illusion that it is stronger by creating bubbles, and they are trying to squeeze every last drop of wealth from the lower classes by using these bubbles to generate large swings for their hedge funds. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why risk alt med outing them as satanists?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because to many people, the accusation is too incredible to be believed. To other people the evidence is too great to be in doubt. This furthers the divide and intensifies the echo chamber (i.e. control).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why risk alt med outing them as pedophiles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this was inadvertent. Also there&#39;s more to the story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why risk red pilling the masses in the US?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are running out of time</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why risk red pilling the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they already control it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oke, let me see if can provide some alternative answers on your questions.</p>

<p>Why risk destroying mainstream and increasing alternative media?</p>

<p>There are now other sources that can be controlled better, AKA internet media and social media. TV is old-style controll and loosing it&#39;s power becouse it is already reveiled how it&#39;s used.</p>

<p>Why risk it?</p>

<p>They need too, the law of free will is at play. All must come out to be seen. But i line of all some did, they twist, spin and ridicule the truth until it&#39;s beyond reach or recognition for those who are not ready or willing to see. The soft-disclosure some want is part of this.</p>

<p>Why does pedo and other &quot;evil stuff&quot; exists and can become part of a &quot;religion/ believe&quot;? This has to do with energy, we are allenergy. &quot;Evil&quot; is part of us and ALL, we are all one. All duality is used as a catalist to evolve. There is nothing to learn in a static environment with everybody agreeing with you.</p>

<p>Why now, why does this all emerges &quot;suddenly&quot;? We are in the time of revelation and we are evolving as humanity and are preparing ourselves for a split in reality. The revelations will enable us to see and know what has been done and why so people enable themselves to gain knowledge and truth and make a more concious decision for their &quot;future&quot;. The hiding of humanities natural power is the foundation off all &quot;conspiracies&quot; on this density level of &quot;reality&quot; and it is designed to keep us from finding our natral true power to create our own &quot;reality&quot; and co-create our shared reality.</p>

<p>What could be happening more? If you look close you already can see the &quot;evil&quot; future some desire being drawn closer. All tech is in place or rolled out to let humanity let itself being take over by AI and evolve nature into artificial. The AI will not tell you and hide it will try to create IT&#39;S desired reality literary through us though, no, it will be desired by humanity as a toy and ease of mind.</p>

<p>Some behind the scene know what will come and are prepared for their future with AI to help them. Trump can be a part or not, however he is currently one of the biggest catalists in our evolution.</p>

<p>There are only two powers governing this world, fear and Love. Honesty will lead your way through this maze we are in, Love will shine a light so you don&#39;t need to stumble too much, trust and intuition will help along the way. Fear will try anything to distract you through your ego and we are here to learn to controll our ego with our consiousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did we really not learn anything from the 2016 election?</p>

<p>First and foremost, America is a consumer driven economy.</p>

<p>Second, there is no shadowy cabal just a country that is super sucked in by click bait and hearing what they want to hear.  The people&#39;s spending habits (viewership, clicks to purchase and consumerism) run the actual show of what the MSM focuses on.</p>

<p>The MSM is doing GREAT right now with viewership up because when a right wing POTUS takes over, the left and center, which is a much larger group, becomes awakened and engaged.  Notice the falling numbers for FOX News as their side has achieved their goal (since January 2009 = take back the country from the Dems that swept into power).  Now that the right wing got what it wants, there is a certain amount of complacency that sets in (Like the Dems in 2010) thus, the special elections where Dems are trouncing the Reps.</p>

<p>The real conspiracy is how silly American consumers are in that they buy anything told to them be it FOX news/MSNBC click bait or that fucking Russia site that popped up on FB.  We (as a whole) are dumb as rocks when it comes to parsing propaganda.  Especially baby boomers: holy fuck do they fall for anything (sorry Mom, you know it&#39;s true.)</p>

<p>The minute we the people get truly woke about falling for propaganda, we will take the power away from the rich folks grinding money out of us.</p>

<p>The American people really are the dog that wags the tail, not the other way around and it is us that must take responsibility and push back with our viewership, our eyeballs and our spending power (CONSUMER UNIONS).</p>
