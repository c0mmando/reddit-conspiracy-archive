        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Democrats are pushing for this shutdown because they are hellbent on getting amnesty for a significant population of illegal aliens who were recipients of the unlawful Barack Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive amnesty program. The White House and congressional Republicans have been more than willing to offer a deal and proposal to handle this problem, but the Democrats have been unwilling to give up chain migration, the visa lottery, and funding for President Trump’s planned border wall.</p>

I find it humorous that someone who frequents a conspiracy board would call for more ways for the government to track us. Personally I think voter ID laws are a violation of my constitutional right to a secret ballot. If voter ID laws are enacted than we&#39;d have to make sure that identification is easily obtained and free or else it becomes a de facto poll tax. Nobody should be unable to vote because they can&#39;t afford it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this is where negotiations and deal making come into play.  You should know that McConnell could have brought last night&#39;s vote to a vote on Thursday night, but refused to.  All the major republican players assured everybody last year that CHIP, DACA, Community health centres would all be dealt with before the end of 2017.  It is refreshing to see the democrats actually have a backbone for once.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and wasn&#39;t the vote lost by 1 vote or something? Please correct me if I am wrong, not American. From what I saw 5 (r) voted against their own party right? The vote was lost by 1 vote with 5(d) voting with the  Rupubs. Why is only the Dems fault when the R couldn&#39;t cement the votes of their own party even when getting 5 votes from the other side? I am genuinely interested and not trying to shit on either side. TY </p>

    <div class="md"><p>“You have to get everybody in a room. You have to be a leader,” Trump told former Fox News host Greta Van Susteren. “The president has to lead. He has get Mr. Boehner and everybody else in a room, and they have to make a deal. You have to be nice and be angry and be wild and congeal and do all sorts of thing, but you have to get a deal.”</p>

<p>Trump just invited to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) to the White House to possibly hash out a last-minute deal and he been wild and angry, unexpectedly undercutting his own party at seemingly every turn.</p>

<p>But he’s also spent the past week blaming Democrats. Which is not where he once believed blame should fall.</p>

<p>Trump also said that “20 years from now and 100 years from now” people would not be “talking about” the various members of Congress who failed to reach an agreement and avoid a shutdown. Instead, the now-president told Van Susteren, they would be talking about the president</p>
