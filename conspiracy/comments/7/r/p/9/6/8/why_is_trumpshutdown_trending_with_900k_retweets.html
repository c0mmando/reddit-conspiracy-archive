       The Democrats are pushing for this shutdown because they are hellbent on getting amnesty for a significant population of illegal aliens who were recipients of the unlawful Barack Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive amnesty program. The White House and congressional Republicans have been more than willing to offer a deal and proposal to handle this problem, but the Democrats have been unwilling to give up chain migration, the visa lottery, and funding for President Trump’s planned border wall.

       They were gonna blame this on Trump no matter what. The hypocrisy of the left in this country is amazing. And dems need the votes of illegals that’s why they care so much about Daca. Like they give a fuck about those people.

       Remember when republicans shut down the government because they wanted to get rid of obamacare? This hypocrisy goes both ways. The minority is gonna always use leverage when they have it. Stop expecting the other side to be over than your side when they are in the same position.

       Ok go back and read comments from the same democrats then who are shutting it down now. I think Nancy Pelosi in 2013 called it political arson. Now it’s ok to do for some reason. They are trying to attach daca legislation to this when daca doesn’t expire for another month.

       And who was shutting the government down back then? The republicans. Who's bitching about it right now? This goes both ways dude. The republicans shut the government down over obamcare. The democrats wanted DACA. There is no bigger man here. Both sides play politics. Stop pretending the republicans more mature than this. The next time a democrat is president, this will happen all over again and you'll be saying the exact opposite shit you're saying now.

       At least the 5 Republicans voting against it are standing on principle. The democrats are doing it out of politics because god forbid Trump does anything easy. By the way I hope you all enjoyed the raise on your paycheck from the tax cut he signed. I sure did.

       SS: An alternate reality exists for these anti-Trump bots (or useful idiots) and they refuse to see reality. Trump can make these deals but only when people negotiate in good faith. He's trying to defend us from the hordes at the gate and yet still people organize against him.

       The derangement syndrome is real, he's trying to do the best by Americans but the rest of the world disagrees with American exceptionalism and does whatever they can to diminish it.

       The GOP has total control of the government and are still unable to govern.  They couldn't even convince  enough of their own members to vote for this garbage bill. They grotesquely held CHIP hostage for votes and it backfired. Totally inept

       CHIP should have been settled months ago and not used as a bargaining chip for the budget vote. Remove that and you've got your votes. The problem is the GOP has no clue how to govern.

       There was a bipartisan deal made already and Trump decided after consulting with his White House staff that he wouldn't sign it so that version of the bill wasn't proposed.  The House didn't provide any alternatives and went home for the weekend.  It's on the GOP.

       You've got this exactly backwards. For 8 years the GOP obstructed government and the democrats gave concessions to get things passed. It's the GOP that is not negotiating in good faith (as admitted by Lindsey Graham). Refusing to grant concessions or even allow the Dems to have a voice in their back room deals.  This is why we need a  strong third party to break up both of these worthless groups

       The only way the GOP can ever win is by suppressing votes and gerrymandering. I find it humorous that someone who frequents a conspiracy board would call for more ways for the government to track us. Personally I think voter ID laws are a violation of my constitutional right to a secret ballot. If voter ID laws are enacted than we'd have to make sure that identification is easily obtained and free or else it becomes a de facto poll tax. Nobody should be unable to vote because they can't afford it.

       So this is where negotiations and deal making come into play.  You should know that McConnell could have brought last night's vote to a vote on Thursday night, but refused to.  All the major republican players assured everybody last year that CHIP, DACA, Community health centres would all be dealt with before the end of 2017.  It is refreshing to see the democrats actually have a backbone for once.

       and wasn't the vote lost by 1 vote or something? Please correct me if I am wrong, not American. From what I saw 5 (r) voted against their own party right? The vote was lost by 1 vote with 5(d) voting with the  Rupubs. Why is only the Dems fault when the R couldn't cement the votes of their own party even when getting 5 votes from the other side? I am genuinely interested and not trying to shit on either side. TY

       “You have to get everybody in a room. You have to be a leader,” Trump told former Fox News host Greta Van Susteren. “The president has to lead. He has get Mr. Boehner and everybody else in a room, and they have to make a deal. You have to be nice and be angry and be wild and congeal and do all sorts of thing, but you have to get a deal.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump just invited to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) to the White House to possibly hash out a last-minute deal and he been wild and angry, unexpectedly undercutting his own party at seemingly every turn.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he’s also spent the past week blaming Democrats. Which is not where he once believed blame should fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump also said that “20 years from now and 100 years from now” people would not be “talking about” the various members of Congress who failed to reach an agreement and avoid a shutdown. Instead, the now-president told Van Susteren, they would be talking about the president
