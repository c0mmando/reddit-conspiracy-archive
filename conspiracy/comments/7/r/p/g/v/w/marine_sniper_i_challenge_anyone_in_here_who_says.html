<p>Marine sniper:</p>

<p>I challenge Anyone in here who says the Earth is spinning to provide YOUR OWN EXPERIMENTATION and Documentation of your results by testing this.  I am providing my OWN experience as a trained US Marine weapons expert here:</p>

<p>I&#39;m a former US Marine Infantryman Weapons platoon Sergeant whom has Never Once used Coriolis Effect when firing long range weapons.  Every bullet spins out of a rifle barrel in a perfectly Straight line trajectory called a Line of Departure, as it follows the long bore of the rifle and travels in a perfectly straight line Until the bullet is met with wind resistance, distance, and it&#39;s own weight causes it to DROP in mid flight during trajectory.  This is what creates an ARC trajectory.. Not the bullet &quot;hugging&quot; The Earth in flight, as some globe theorists suggest.</p>

<p>In response to a globe defender claiming that bullets &quot;ARC&quot; and Hug the Earth in flight because of &quot;gravity&quot;:  LoL What is this blasphemy people speak that a bullet flys in a &quot;rainbow&quot; arc out of your rifle?  What kind of acid are these Globe lovers taking before handling a weapon?  There would be no such thing as a Sniper being able to hit a target from 1000 meters if he had to compensate for some imaginary gravity pull of his bullets or &quot;spin&quot; of the Earth.   </p>

<p>I&#39;ve Mastered several weapons systems including the M-16, Mini 14, Mp5, Uzi 9mm, 240 Golf machine gun, SMAW 83 mm warhead rocket launcher, Mortars, Dragon, grenade launchers, and also trained with STA Platoon Snipers and fired long range sniper rifles.  </p>

<p>Weapon systems like Mortars and Artillery shells are fired UP at an angle, and thus these have a greater ARC of trajectory in flight.   Those rounds also fly straight out of the barrel, until they are met with wind resistance and the weight (mass and density) causes the round to start falling back down to Earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Av6ArwdMsE8">https://youtu.be/Av6ArwdMsE8</a></p>

<p>Rob Furlong, longest kill shot in history at 1.5 miles.. the ONLY thing Snipers account for is distance, elevation, wind factor, and the DROP of the bullet after density and mass causes it to fall.  Nothing else.  Spotters adjust based on the miss of the first shot only.  </p>

<p>Debunking Coriolis Effect: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=14O63m9jtfk">https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=14O63m9jtfk</a></p>

<p>You begin to understand just how ridiculous this notion is when you consider that mainstream science tells us that everything inside the atmosphere Moves WITH THE EARTH and we don&#39;t feel the spin because of conservation of momentum.  So how is it that everything moves WITH the Earth, EXCEPT BULLETS??   </p>

<p>Coriolis Effect isn&#39;t real:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=67iB-qNOUO0">https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=67iB-qNOUO0</a></p>

<p>AT NO POINT does any of these weapons systems require an adjustment for this alleged &quot;Coriolis Effect&quot; to account for your imaginary curvature.  At no point in my entire military weapons career did we EVER even hear the words &quot;Coriolis Effect&quot;, much less train our Marines how to calculate this BS.  Think about it.. if the Earth is a spinning ball and we are trying the fire a weapon system, we absolutely should have to account for WHICH direction we are facing when firing.  So if the Earth is spinning West to East.. I would have to make a different  adjustment for ALL FOUR directions N, S, E, and W!!  So if there was a Coriolis Effect &quot;adjustment&quot;.. why isn&#39;t there FOUR Adjustments, one for each direction you are facing?? </p>

<p>Railguns fire a projectile over 100 miles over a flat plane.  A rail gun is essentially a giant rifle.  All rifles fire a straight line trajectory and not an ARC trajectory.  This is not an Artillery weapon or Tomahawk missile that fires UP at an angle to create an ARC..</p>

<p>Also, airplanes, hot air balloons, gliders, and other flying systems DO NOT account for the alleged Spin of Earth.. so why would a speeding bullet at 1,700 miles per hour need to account for it??  Globe supporters never think further than what your indoctrination schools you, this is why you don&#39;t have the Cognitive reasoning Abilities or logical thinking Flat Earthers employ!  Coriolis is a Bogus made up myth to support the Heliocentric Fairy Tale. </p>

<p>This magical force &quot;gravity&quot; you believe in isn&#39;t real either, and it is only DENSITY that causes things to rise or fall.  </p>

<p>Gravity isn&#39;t real and Electromagnetism is the strongest force: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=fzH1tfNf6lU">https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=fzH1tfNf6lU</a></p>

<p>Gravity debunked:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=I5FiaPhcMdo">https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=I5FiaPhcMdo</a></p>

<p>Here in reality, on Earth, we have what is called Layers of Density where all objects of greater density sink to the bottom of our system and all objects of less density rise on top of our system.  Nothing more is needed to describe this process of density and Bouyancy.  The air we breathe is light and nearly massless.. The Earth underneath us is heavily dense.. and everything in between are a certain level of density.  Whatever is more dense will sink below whatever is less dense, like what happens with a density tower..</p>

<p>The manual for learning how to be a Marine sniper has no mention of Coriolis Effect.<br/>
FMFM 1-3B Sniping (U.S. Marine Corps) Manuel; 1984
Marksmanship Training explains effect of:
the path of the bullet, elevation, weather, wind, still/moving target, range, height of snipper/target, terrain atmospheric/light conditions.</p>

<p>The sniper must know the general principles of:
perspective, vanishing point, perspective drawing, delineation, and geographical areas of intelligence operations: </p>

<p>--- This says NOTHING about the Coriolis Effect</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It should be noted that I&#39;ve upvoted every single person who&#39;s disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said.</p>

<p>In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn&#39;t do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they&#39;d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.</p>

<p>My mother&#39;s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He&#39;s not particularly successful as an engineer, but I&#39;ve met lots of other engineers who aren&#39;t as good as me at physics, so I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s not just a result of him being bad at it. I&#39;m also pretty good at engineering. I don&#39;t have a degree, and other than physics I don&#39;t have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).</p>

<p>I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I&#39;ve come across. Every question of existentialism which I&#39;ve seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven&#39;t been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I&#39;ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there&#39;s no aspect of psychology which I don&#39;t have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud&#39;s theories.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a good enough writer that I&#39;m writing a book and so far everybody who&#39;s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that&#39;s not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I&#39;ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if that will suffice as evidence that I&#39;m intelligent. I&#39;m done with it, though, because I&#39;d rather defend my maturity, since it&#39;s what you&#39;ve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.</p>

<p>I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn&#39;t just faking it, I&#39;d even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self&#39;s actions, it shouldn&#39;t be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren&#39;t harming others. I don&#39;t have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don&#39;t care what a person&#39;s fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don&#39;t have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that&#39;s not really an impressive moral, but it&#39;s unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty much a pacifist. I&#39;ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I&#39;ll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don&#39;t attack, I&#39;ll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don&#39;t fight back. I&#39;ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I&#39;m never in a situation where I&#39;ll be worse off after a fight. If I&#39;m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I&#39;ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I&#39;d prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don&#39;t believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it&#39;ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit &quot;women are crazy&quot; circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don&#39;t think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren&#39;t awesome.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don&#39;t believe it&#39;s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything&#39;s OK when it&#39;s really not (and that&#39;s a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I&#39;m kind of tired of citing these examples and I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re getting tired of reading them, if you&#39;ve even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I&#39;m pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I&#39;m a pretty good moderator.</p>

<p>All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So gravity does not exist, but bullet drop due to mass/density does? What exactly is the difference in your imagination?</p>

<p>Sure, gravity, in the sense of F=m*g is by all accounts an incomplete theorem as it breaks down in the subatomic realm, but it&#39;s still an exceedingly reliable measure to predict the behaviour of objects on the macro scale.</p>

<p>A bullet shot from a rifle horizontally will always have roughly the same Time To Impact, whether it is shot out at supersonic speeds or merely dropped from the tip of the barrel (disregarding aerodynamic effects along the way for simplicity&#39;s sake).</p>

<p>The Coriolis Effect is likely not taught to Snipers because it&#39;s practically negligible at most distances (due to minimal spin across such short time-frames) and because it&#39;s too complex to calculate reliably, as it is dependant on <a href="https://loadoutroom.com/thearmsguide/external-ballistics-the-coriolis-effect-6-theory-section/">where on Earth you&#39;re standing, how fast your bullet travels, and which direction you&#39;re facing.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravity or the Coriolis effect?</p>

<p>I mean, gravity exists in some Form, right? A ball does return when you throw it up in the air. It&#39;s a function of mass, density, aerodynamics, air resistance and height differential, your post basically indicates this too, and yet it exclaims that gravity isn&#39;t real? How do you not see the contradiction?</p>

<p>And the Coriolis Effect can be shown with a ball on a merry-go-round. When we applied our observations on the effect from the merry-go-round to the globe Earth model, several things about the cloud&#39;s behavior and the ocean streams have been predicted, just as we find them in reality. The model fits our observations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t seem to be reading past the first sentence of my replies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heliocentrism and everything that goes along with it is entirely philisophical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, yeah. Our sun ain&#39;t the center of anything. There countless points of shared gravity in our solar system alone between the sun and planets, all the satellites, perpetually shifting around a shared centre of gravity. Our galaxy also has a shared center of all masses, billions of whatevers away from our system, and yet still guiding its path. All of this follows the inverse square law, just as sound does, meaning the effects become exponentially weaker as distance increases linearly.</p>

<p>We know we don&#39;t really understand gravity nearly enough, and I think that&#39;s due to the lack of understanding of what Tesla talked about. That everything is founded on sound and vibration. Think cymatics or acoustic levitation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>including evolution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there are unsettled questions about evolution and unnecessary dogma surrounding it. I believe the basic premise is correct, but I&#39;m not convinced our own story is portrayed correctly. It seems to me that humans have been humans for much longer than most anthropologists, and also biologists are even prepared to consider. </p>

<p>We are not our first iteration, and we won&#39;t be our last.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the big bang</p>
</blockquote>

<p>might have been a big rebirth. In fact, it might be a continual death and rebirth of everything in existence as our reality expands and increases its complexity in a perpetual <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fj_Ks05q4GxA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;amp;f=1">ride around the donut.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>as well as most of history as we were taught.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s for fucking sure. And don&#39;t get me wrong, mate, there&#39;s plenty of stuff about space we&#39;re being misled about. Bubbles in Space and all that. Our rovers are finding plastic forks because they&#39;re exploring Devon Island. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t wanna convert you or anything, man, but I do hold the strong asshole – I mean opinion that there&#39;s plenty of reason to think we&#39;re being fucked with, but not one of them being that the Earth is not a lump in space, held together by macro versions of the effects we have replicated and observed on Earth for millenia. </p>

<p>We certainly don&#39;t know WHY it all works or WHY it all functions on principles that are strangely reminiscent of computer code. We also don&#39;t fully understand (though we&#39;re starting to intimate) how everything is really just vibrations of different intensities and wavelengths intermingling and interacting, like the sounds of a cosmic orchestra, speaking forth and manifesting at the same time. We&#39;re starting to get a sense of this knowledge, but we don&#39;t really know what to do with it. What the hell does it mean that everything is vibration? How do gravity waves fit into that picture? Is our orbit determined, not by a continual force, but rather by an interaction of waves forming an interference pattern and a path of least resistence? That seems to be the way science is beginning to point to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of the rest of our discussion, the fact that you&#39;re calling me a liar just because I disagree with you should be a red flag, even to you. It may be that I&#39;m wrong, that is ALWAYS an option, but I am not lying. Why should I?</p>

<p>In the video which you provided the gyroscope is allowed to go for 15minutes. Assuming that the video was shot in the UK, I&#39;ve heard in looking into this for this comment, that the period of complete rotation should be a little less than 35 hours. That amounts to an expectation of about 2.5-3° of movement. I recognise that the experiment you&#39;ve linked does not show this. The question now is, is this due to the Earth being flat and stationary, or due to a flawed experiment?</p>

<p>I&#39;m openly leaning towards the latter possibility, but I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong for thinking otherwise. There have been claims of failure of the Foucault pendulum experiment, due to its sensitive starting conditions, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMxLVDuf4VY">but it&#39;s also been repeated successfully many times.</a> </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust any authority (be it a youtuber or a classic scientist) by default, so I&#39;d have to see the experiment being performed and repeated myself to claim anything for sure, but yeah. That&#39;s all I got for today.</p>

<p>I hope we can continue this discussion some other time, as long as you can refrain from calling me a liar. I really don&#39;t take kindly to that. All the best.</p>

<p>No, but I&#39;m starting to think I should be. The globe model predicts a period of complete rotation (of the pendulum plane around the central spin axis, relative to Earth) of 24h clockwise at the north pole and 24h counter-clockwise at the south pole. It predicts no rotation along the equator and periods of &gt;24h as we move from the poles towards the equator. The professor in the video I linked claimed that the pendulum rotates all the way around in about 35h at the latitude of Hannover. The elongation of the period is determined by the distance to the central spin axis of the Earth and is both predictable and testable.</p>

<p>That second expiriment is as intriguing as the first, but ultimately also unconvincing. Without sound or at least an RPM meter, we have no way of knowing whether the gyro is even on during the 6 hours. </p>

<p>If it is on as claimed, then we have contradictory experimental outcomes from the same prediction. That would indicate that there is either something wrong with the Foucault pendulum experiment (which was successfully replicated many times once the problem of the bias during the initial condition was accounted for by burning the string, rather than cutting it or releasing the weight manually), or there is something wrong with the gyro experiments. I don&#39;t know either way, I might have to see if I can replicate Foucault&#39;s experiment myself to be sure, but I&#39;m certainly leaning towards a flawed experimental setup in the gyro cases. You&#39;ll obviously think otherwise, which is fine by me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proof 140) 
Foucault’s Pendulums are often quoted as proof of a rotating Earth but upon closer investigation prove the opposite. </p>

<p>To begin with, Foucault’s pendulums do not uniformly swing in any one direction. Sometimes they rotate clockwise and sometimes counter-clockwise, sometimes they fail to rotate and sometimes they rotate far too much. </p>

<p>The behavior of the pendulum actually depends on 1) the initial force beginning its swing and, 2) the ball-and-socket joint used which most-readily facilitates circular motion over any other. The supposed rotation of the Earth is completely inconsequential and irrelevant to the pendulum’s swing. </p>

<p>If the alleged constant rotation of the Earth affected pendulums in any way, then there should be no need to manually start pendulums in motion. If the Earth’s diurnal rotation caused the 360 degree uniform diurnal rotation of pendulums, then there should not exist a stationary pendulum anywhere on Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice copy-pasta. If you read my comments in full, rather than just the first sentence, you&#39;d notice that I have written much the same thing. Yes, the Foucault experiment is sensitive, and if it&#39;s not adequately set up, it can produce counter-intuitive results. However, if it is adequately set up (controlling for any bias of the first swing by fixing the weight with a piece of string until the weight is perfectly still, then burning the string with a candle, causing it to release the weight without adding sideways movement), ideally, though not necessarily, in a vacuum chamber and using a special pivot joint that also doesn&#39;t add any bias to the pendulum. I never said it&#39;s an easy experiment, but it&#39;s still very reliable, at least as far as I can tell, when all known sources of bias are carefully eliminated.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t follow your logic here. We have established that the Coriolis effect on a swinging pendulum is extremely hard to even detect at the best of circumstances. Any regular grandfather-clock pendulum is fixed in one dimension, so it&#39;s mechanically resisting the Coriolis effect because it&#39;s fixed to the clock and by extension to the Earth itself.</p>

<p>Any regular pendulum (and any plane for that matter, which often comes up as an extended argument) stays on course by tiny continuous readjustments, either by the pilot in aeroplanes or by friction in a conventional pendulum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah I just thought you might find it interesting. The chart shows how much curvature drop-off there should be over the given distances on a ball with a radius of 3959 miles.</p>

<p>So if you take off, level out at treetop height, fly one hour at 500 miles per hour... you&#39;d be 31.7 miles up in the air.</p>

<p>Airliners fly at 6-7 miles.</p>

<p>That is how much curvature there is supposed to be on a ball the size of Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, gotcha. The problem isn&#39;t with the formula or the measurements, but with the way you think an airplane maintains its altitude.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s imagine a plane with fixed wings, meaning it can&#39;t change the aerodynamics of its wings, even if it wanted to. Kinda like a paperplane with a steady rotor pushing it straight forward at a fixed spead. We&#39;re also assuming that the air is perfectly still, so as to simplify the thought experiment. We then let that plane fly off from our treetop height in a perfect level to the ground, at a speed that causes it neither to rise nor to descend. That&#39;s the kind of condition an airliner will have for most of its journey at cruising altitude.</p>

<p>Our plane&#39;s altitude is now a function of its forward velocity, gravitational pull downwards, and aerodynamic lift upwards. Gravity is constant, our velocity is assumed to be constant, and our aerodynamic properties are assumed to be constant. You claim that the plane would continue to fly straight as the Earth curves away under it, which would be true if the airpressure were the same, all throughout the athmosphere. In fact, our plane would even begin to rise slightly, as the gravitational pull would weaken according to the inverse square law as we increase our distance to the Earth&#39;s center of mass.</p>

<p>The thing is, our athmosphere&#39;s pressure is itself a function of height, so as our plane flies straight and the ground begins to curve away, the wings experience just slightly less lift due to slightly decreased airpressure, and so it sinks towards the initial level of our treetops. </p>

<p>This, of course, happens continuously, not in steps. You can imagine an airliner surfing with just enough speed on a sea of air with just enough pressure which in combination produce just enough lift to counteract the Earth&#39;s pull, and that sea of air curves along with the Earth. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s why a plane flying straight needs no additional adjustment to curve itself along the Earth&#39;s surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Well, if the &quot;effect of gravity we observe&quot; is not due to F=m*g, but a simple function of buoyancy as Flat Earth theorists seem to indicate (and please correct me if I&#39;m misstating the FE premise), then the effect of gravity should vanish in a vacuum chamber, correct? AFAIK, that is not the case. Any disagreements on this?</p>

<p>Other than that, I&#39;m not sure anyone has ever explained Gravity sufficiently. I know there&#39;s a problem there, especially when trying to reconcile gravity on the macro-scale with effect on the subatomic-scale. I just don&#39;t think that this means the Earth is a Flat disc, or that it makes the theory of gravity any less useful in every-day life. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also I&#39;m an RC pilot, fixed-wing, heli and quad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would explain why you disregarded the pressure differentials within the atmosphere though. It&#39;s too small a gradient to be relevant for RC flying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s quite clear that you still don&#39;t get the gyroscope experiment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do get the gyroscope experiment, but I recognize that I&#39;m not smart enough to know how this discrepancy is reconziled. So I tried to see if any of the mechanisms are discussed in <a href="/r/flying">/r/flying</a>, and lo-and-behold, there&#39;s a post explaining how the artificial horizon is maintained. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/11g96n/what_are_the_limitations_of_the_artificial/">See for yourself.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell:</p>

<p>Most modern gyros have a self-erecting mechanism composed of pendulous vanes under the rotor that normally exhaust the same amount of air each when the rotor is spinning in the horizontal plane (remember that most gyros are powered by a vacuum pump). When a force displaces the rotor from its vertical axis, one port will open more and its opposite partner will close more, applying a counter-force to the original displacement.</p>

<p>Older gyros will tumble if certain angles are exceeded, but they usually have a caging mechanism which, when pushed, resets the rotor position and locks the gimbals to a straight-and-level indication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a real problem, but evidently, one that was solved a fair while ago. It might also be the reason why the first video you linked didn&#39;t show any movement as the erecting mechanism counteracts small amounts of drift (as opposed to the quick rotations he provoked at the start and end of the experiment), but that&#39;s just one possibility.</p>

Nice to see you take the time to present facts and truth from your practical experience, people thing the world is a globe based on indoctrination and theoretical musing and mathematical models, not observations and natural science aka the zetetic method. Reality is not words, or numbers in an equation, we live in a spiritual realm not a spinning whirling ball that formed after nothing exploded into everything for no reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am contrasting the classic dichotomy between the atheistic meaningless random world view from people who religiously follow current scientific findings like big bang cosmology, with a purposeful spiritual realm. The earth can be a spinning ball and a spiritual realm, but I figured we were talking in the context of natural science like the OP, so not talking about sci-fi stuff like spinning balls in space. Have you ever heard of occultism and secret societies? Knowledge is power? You are easier to control and manipulate if you are conditioned to believe whatever you are told, and if you can be successfully manipulated on something so fundamental like the nature of your existence than you will easily believe elections are real, society is fair, you should wear this and say things like that, etc. </p>

<p>This is complete bullshit.</p>

<p>You certainly have to take into account the CE if you&#39;re shooting over 1000 yards. </p>

<p>Verification of drop-charts is a common issue, due to the CE. </p>

<p>The earth rotates form the west to the east, and if you shoot west, you have to understand the target rotates up-and-towards the shooter. If shooting east, the target is dropping and moving away.</p>

<p>At 1000 yards, a full Minute of correction could be needed.</p>

<p>So, why are those verification-cards off often? They are shooting in different directions with long-range rifles. </p>

<p>ANYONE trained on a SWS in the US Army sniper school, or USMC scout sniper school, would be trained in understating this principle, especially if they are using a .50cal SWS in training. </p>

<p>You must have not of read that well. Why? Well, it&#39;s not the US army sniper program manual. That&#39;s the &#39;US Navy SEAL Sniper Training Program&#39;. It says so in the pages, and on the link description.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain since you lack this nuance in observation:</p>

<p>That manual is given to people who already go through the USMC scout sniper program. That&#39;s called </p>

<p>For instance, I have read the &#39;SEAL combat boarding manual&#39;, and the &#39;US Navy SEAL manual&#39;; they give information most relative to that mission particular, and not &#39;basic information&#39; that would be conducive to a marksmanship manual. Notice the manual you posted does not list much in the way of marksmanship, outside tables you&#39;d seek to look at and memorize for a particular outfit and mission.</p>

<p>Likewise, The CE really only comes into play with the variables I mentioned. 1000 Yards and direction. Do you shoot an m24 over 1000 yards? HELL NO!</p>

<p>You shoot 50. cal rounds. You shoot heavy calibers.</p>

<p>So, not only are you not looking in a manual that will cover a weapon system that shoots over 1000 yards, expecting to find a reason for that manual to mention such in BASIC operations reference; you&#39;re not adept enough to know where to look to find answers to this question.</p>

It is said that the rotation takes twenty-four hours and that its speed is uniform, in which case, necessarily, days and nights should have an identical duration of twelve hours each all the year round. The sun should invariably rise in the morning and set in the evening at the same hours, with the result that it would be the equinox every day from the 1st of January to the 31st of December.

<p>There has been Helio-centric, Geo-centric, Lunar-centric and constellation based clocks of reference, for time, in the past. Some ancient calendars even account for time by counting a tablet four-times, and then subtracting one. That tablet equals 366 days. They account for the missing time by that extra half-day. Those were the Mayans. </p>

<p>The US calendar system is based on the Gregorian calendar. This has 365.25 days, and has to be adjusted with leap days and leap seconds.</p>

<p>There is even scientific units of time. that are so small, they are only to be metricized in the realm of math. These, in turn of calculation of compounding variables - say in space-navigation - would amount to accuracy in common tasks we would need to mechanizes, and do. </p>

<p>You seem to have trouble grasping the fact, these things are so, as they exists as nature, but that we conceptualize nature via models and methods like this (which makes them real - when applied to numbers/models).</p>

<p>The caldera is problematic, but that does not mean the nature of the earth, as it is commonly known by the community of global inquiry, is wrong about it being a rotating globe cast in orbit of a sun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Four conclusive experiments performed by the top scientists of their day proved that the Sun, Moon and stars revolve around us, and that Earth is the fixed, motionless centre of the universe. </p>

<p>The Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Airy&#39;s Failure and Sagnac experiments scientifically proved Geocentrism and nearly crushed the dying Heliocentric theory until Mr. Einstein came through with his Special Relativity mathematical denial of the proven Aether and philosophically (not scientifically) banished the Aether from study ever since. </p>

<p>These studies and peer reviewed experiments are never covered in any university courses. These conclusive peer-reviewed and repeated scientific results are nowhere debated or denied, merely suppressed and ignored. The fact of the matter is that Geocentrism has been conclusively proven for over a century.</p>

<p>In 1913 Sagnac conducted an experiment to test the speed and constancy of light and proved the existence of the Aether (Disproves relativity) Therefore, The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted using an interferometer clearly demonstrated that the Earth was motionless. The Michelson-Gale experiment detected the Aether/Firmament passing over the surface of the motionless Earth. Airy&#39;s Failure, demonstrated that it is the stars moving relative to a stationary Earth, and not the fast orbiting Earth moving relative to comparatively stationary stars. </p>

<p>I trust that this will be an empty promise. I guess I&#39;ll do the same assuming that you show your picture first. Your claim was parroted from a flat earther, and even that one didn&#39;t show any evidence for its assertion.</p>

<p>Flat earth is broken to the point that basic Sun rises/sets are all that&#39;s needed to debunk it.</p>

<p>Every single flat earther that I&#39;ve come across claims that the Sun is &quot;close&quot;, so let&#39;s put some claims to the test. If the Sun is supposed to be close in the flat earth &quot;model&quot;, why doesn&#39;t it change in angular <strong>size</strong> or angular <strong>speed</strong> over the course of a day when viewed through a solar filter?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4</a></p>

<p>This only gets worse when you take into account the equinox Sun rises and Sun sets. On those days, the Sun will rise due east and set due west regardless of your latitude.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/lKipXJf">http://imgur.com/lKipXJf</a></p>

<p>An experiment has already been performed on the equinox with over 20+ participants. The results support the globe earth and matched predictions, while it made no sense on a flat earth. Unless you believe that there are multiple Suns at the same time. Flat Earth is broken to the point that Sun angles and geometry are all that&#39;s needed to debunk it</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V03eF0bcYno">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V03eF0bcYno</a></p>

<p>Does your flat earth even qualify as a theory? You&#39;ve had many years so what type of relevant map, model, or predictive power do flat earthers have that compares to the globe?</p>

<p>Even your density/bouyancy as replacement for gravity makes no sense. Objects of different densities will fall at the same rate in a vacuum, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkhxPm15PFo">that you can measure the difference in weight according to your location. Such as objects weighing less at the equator and more the further north/south you go, which fits with the globe model.</a></p>

NO. It&#39;s applied / empirical.</p>

<p>This is the theoretical one.

<p>Learn to read. Here&#39;s what I said:</p>

<p>&quot;Every single flat earther that I&#39;ve come across claims that the Sun is &quot;close&quot;, so let&#39;s put some claims to the test. If the Sun is supposed to be close in the flat earth &quot;model&quot;, why doesn&#39;t it change in angular size or angular speed over the course of a day <strong>when viewed through a solar filter?</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The Sun&#39;s <strong>glare</strong> isn&#39;t its true apparent size. Use a solar filter, and try again.</p>

<p>Again, another video without a solar filter. The equinox Sun angles experiment, which is pretty obvious that you didn&#39;t watch, already debunked the &quot;close&quot; Sun. Here it is again:</p>

<p>Sure it is. Where&#39;s your relevant map, model or predictive power that compares to the globe? You have none. It should be a hypothesis.</p>

<p>Of course you don&#39;t. You have a &quot;model&quot; that&#39;s broken to the point that basic Sun sets/rises is enough to debunk it. Your attempt to change the subject is hilarious.</p>

<p>Considering that so far you&#39;ve done nothing but parroting your leaders, I recommend that you honestly investigate which of those have been taken out of context by flat earthers. Not to mention that none of them had anything to do with the flat earth. At least you acknowledge that they attempted to prove geocentrism instead of the flat earth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to wonder where you copy/pasted that. No doubt from another flat earther, such as the one which pretended that polaris can be seen 20 degrees south.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quoting Gabrielle Henriet, “The theory of the rotation of the earth may once and for all be definitely disposed of as impracticable by pointing out the following inadvertence. It is said that the rotation takes twenty-four hours and that its speed is uniform, in which case, necessarily, days and nights should have an identical duration of twelve hours each all the year round. The sun should invariably rise in the morning and set in the evening at the same hours, with the result that it would be the equinox every day from the 1st of January to the 31st of December. One should stop and reflect on this before saying that the earth has a movement of rotation. </p>

<p>How does the system of gravitation account for the seasonal variations in the lengths of days and nights if the earth rotates at a uniform speed in twenty-four hours!?”</p>

<p>The only place I feel that flat-earth proponents do themselves more harm than good is when they try to explain gravity with buoyancy. As I understand it, buoyancy depends on gravity because the upward force exerted by a fluid on an object is equal to the weight of the volume of fluid displaced by the object, which depends on the gravitational force on that fluid. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think it explains any better why heavy objects outweigh light objects than gravity does. There&#39;s still a force acting on any object that pulls it down and while the globers catch-all explanation of mass and gravity doesn&#39;t wholly suffice, I think using the buoyancy argument just amounts to saying &quot;what goes up must come down.&quot;</p>

<p>But, like I said. Great post. You know you are doing something right when the top comment is a not-clever personal attack with 44 upvotes.</p>

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</p>
