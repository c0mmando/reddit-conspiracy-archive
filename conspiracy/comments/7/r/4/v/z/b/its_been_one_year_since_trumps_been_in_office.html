       The Senate just pushed through the
       <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s139">
        FISA Reauthorization Act
       </a>
       and it looks like Trump will sign the bill.  How is this any different from Obama?  What meaningful changes have happened under Trump?  Are the "coming arrests" real?  Could the divide between the left and the right be fake/contrived to keep us distracted?  Could the Russian "collusion" also just be theater for distraction?  Is QAnon theater for those who are conspiracy minded?
      </p>
      <p>
       We're still in Syria.  We're still funneling funds to SA to destroy Yemen.  The Forth amendment is still on hold.  We're being surveilled continuously.  "The Wall" could also just be to keep people from leaving the country as well as keeping people out.
      </p>
      <p>
       SA supposedly arrested elements in its government that were corrupt, yet, the net result is that those netted were set free if they relinquished their vast fortunes.  Trump signed an emergency EO to freeze funds of those accused of human trafficking.  What if this has nothing to do with removing corruption, but is a last ditch attempt to stave of a bankruptcy by the US and SA?
      </p>
      <p>
       How much of what we're seeing could be theater, and how much is concrete verifiable positive change?  Where's the proof that Trump is not just another part of the system of control?  Why should we be inspired and hold off our contempt for "government" if in this last year nothing has changed?

       Much of the rest of what you point out is geared to spin up US productivity, probably to stave off the problems exported inflation that is about to return to the US.  While it is being sold as a "put American's back to work", its really about increasing productivity so that the dollars returning to the US don't topple the banking system.

       I want my liberty back.  I'm not interested in more jobs.  I'm not interested in stories of removing corruption.  Show me how my liberty has increased or will increase under Trump.  Show me that I will be left alone and not spied on continually.  Otherwise, these are just hollow accomplishments.

       I'd disagree. Bush we saw the introduction of the mass surveillance state as something that was no longer a conspiracy but law. With Obama we saw the destabilization of low-class jobs with the implementation of ACA. Due to the health insurance requirements nearly every grocery store I've seen has lost 50%+ of their full-time staff and people are struggling not only to find fulltime jobs but many had to settle with multiple parttime jobs and suffer along with everyone else from drastically rising premiums. All the while the level of passive acceptance of further data-collection of everyone in the world has further cemented itself in the hivemind of the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Trump, we haven't seen anything drastic yet but the train seems to be running down the same tracks.

       As a lefty, I'm more worried about how this administration has begun dismantling consumer and environmental protections that assist the left and right.  The EPA, FDA, USDA, SEC, the CFPB all being torn apart while tax cuts for the rich once again pump up income inequality and the debt, while they go after social security, medicare and medicaid, while we cede our world leadership position to China and ignore a Russian dictator that is literally laughing in our face while their boy Trump does nothing.

       As I see it, its a move required so that productivity can be increased.  The US is facing a problem of inflation because oil producing nations are starting to request other payments besides dollars.  Those dollars held by countries that need oil are now about to return to the US.  One way to defend the dollar is to ramp up US productivity at the expense of the environment (like China's done).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for China and Russia authoritarian governments, its party due to the CIA messing with countries via color revolutions and other nasty tricks.  Inciting violence and coordinating instability in countries is a very common tactic.  Only authoritarian countries that restrict and heavily monitor internet and all aspects of society can thwart this type of attack.

       The war on government aka starve the beast is a tired game that always claims to produce benefits in the future of more jobs and more trickle down and then you finally get a chance like they did in Kansas to test the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kansas is an utter failure.  The tax cuts kill services that are actually cheaper than the bill the state government had to pick up for the alternatives.  Infrastructure crumbles, businesses flee and they really never wanted a tax cut to begin with.  Some US Chamber, Grover Norquist flunkie used Rebecca Mercer's money to make believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tax cuts for the rich never works.  Destroying the infrastructure to live in a Libertarian fantasy is nonsense.  The US service economy runs efficiently when the middle class does welll and the poor have a safety net.  Period.

       China I mean yes, TPP and withdrawing from the Paris Accord, talking shit about walking away from NATO, UN, acting like an idiot allowing the the Chinese leaders to look like statesmen, getting mired in the NK bullshit, now nations are starting to trade oil in the yuan and on and on.  This shit has real world implications.  I mean I can see wanting to not be world policeman but ceding our leadership just cuts us out of the pie eating.

       russias meddling is way overblown. I mean what was proven? They hacked the dnc emails exposing peoples own words, they hired some online trolls and paid a few hundred grand? Million? in ads. I saw that the trump admin said they would enforce the russia sanctions in late january. If they don't that will be suspicious however
