    <div class="md"><p>yes, I see your TDS clouds your view of the facts. it has nothing to do with the economy. </p>

<p>Kim does not respond positively to diplomacy. its been tried a million times, and he always abuses any grace given to his regime. it was literally long overdue that leaders stop being civil with him. Donald doesnt back down, and let him know &quot;his button was bigger&quot;. this accurately conveyed the reality of the situation. Trump acted like the adult reprimanding the child. </p>

<p>Did you see the story of a NK city being damaged because of a failed missile launch? do you think that was an accident? are you aware that US B-2 bombers fly 24/7 over North Korea, unchallenged?</p>

<p>between these two events, Kim just got his ass handed to him verbally and got a swift &quot;big button spanking&quot; in front of the whole world, and learned his only weapon is totally useless and only hurt himself. </p>

<p>all the sudden wants to behave and be a well mannered person who wants to come out and play the sports with the rest of the world...like a good little boy.</p>

<p>yes. <strong>YES</strong>. The President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump <em>does</em> deserve a Nobel Peace Prize...<em>for shitposting</em>.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first i thought it was a positive but there more I thought about it my theory has become this; I belive NK and SK are coming together now and will continue to do so at the behest or Russia and China. Creating the illusion that NK wants to come to peacefull agreements with other countries will cause America to further alienate themselves because of Trumps agressive reactions to NK. This probably sounds pretty outlandish and maybe I’m way off, but China has been patiently working towards becoming thw most powerful country in the world for a long time now and Russia is helping them do it by trying to divide and bringing down America. </p>

<p>Im not American and not pro Trump, but this is bad news for everyone. The world under China as a super power as opposed to under America is a very different world and not one I think people in the weat are going to like.</p>

<p>China and Russia have said they’ll cooperate with America, in regards to NK sanctions, but then continue to supply oil and other things, knowing that America can’t really enforce them.</p>

<p>In Australia alone Chinese
Property investors have helped to drive up property prices by investing billions in Australian land making it harder for Australians to by property. This has been going on for decades, its a slow burn and I think putting Trump in office is one of the final stages, and subsequently the Koreas coming together will be a part of that.</p>

<p>I know that was a bit of a rant and i left out a bunch, i dont have time to go into depth anymore because im about to walk into work. I will make a follow up post later if anyone is interested in hearing about my theory further, but i could be wrong, and if I am please let me know :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the very same happened also 3 times before. And it&#39;s only the Winter Olympics with 2 north and &gt;90 qualified South Koreans. So it looks like the south invited the north to make it look better for both. Win Win. The north is having a modern ski resort, but mostly for apparatchiks and foreign tourists. Nobody from there qualified.
Now with the &quot;unification&quot; there could be a few more starters from the north which is the goal of the North.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the sentiment of people here is that Moon is kinda sacrificing his own people to pander to being friends with Kim. His parents were from the North and some are skeptical that he is actually from Goeje. That&#39;s besides the point. He is forcing only the woman&#39;s hockey team to compete with athletes that really have no business competing in the Olympics, under the guise of &quot;unification&quot;. He started out pretty strong at first after the Park Geun hye scandal but people are becoming a little skeptical about how he is dealing with the North. Don&#39;t get me wrong, tons of people want re-unification here but not at the cost of ignoring his own people. I don&#39;t claim to be a SK political buff but friends and co-workers are saying that he has an agenda to drag everyone into a sort of socialized middle class. Whether that is good or bad, I don&#39;t know but I think he for sure has an ulterior motive when he deals with NK.  </p>

The re-unification of North and South Korea would likely have the approval of both China and Russia due to a plethora of shared common political and economic and defence interests, and where would that leave America and the west in regards to global power? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, I see your TDS clouds your view of the facts. it has nothing to do with the economy. </p>

<p>Kim does not respond positively to diplomacy. its been tried a million times, and he always abuses any grace given to his regime. it was literally long overdue that leaders stop being civil with him. Donald doesnt back down, and let him know &quot;his button was bigger&quot;. this accurately conveyed the reality of the situation. Trump acted like the adult reprimanding the child. </p>

<p>Did you see the story of a NK city being damaged because of a failed missile launch? do you think that was an accident? are you aware that US B-2 bombers fly 24/7 over North Korea, unchallenged?</p>

<p>between these two events, Kim just got his ass handed to him verbally and got a swift &quot;big button spanking&quot; in front of the whole world, and learned his only weapon is totally useless and only hurt himself. </p>

<p>all the sudden wants to behave and be a well mannered person who wants to come out and play the sports with the rest of the world...like a good little boy.</p>

<p>yes. <strong>YES</strong>. The President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump <em>does</em> deserve a Nobel Peace Prize...<em>for shitposting</em>.   </p>
