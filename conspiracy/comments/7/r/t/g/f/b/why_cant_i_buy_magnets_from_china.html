        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m in the US and was trying to get neodymium magnets from Ebay. I thought it would be nice to have good magnets to go on my fridge. My order from Nov 15 never arrived after 8 weeks. I contacted the seller 3 days ago and we agreed they would resend the shipment. Today I find that order has completely disappeared from my order listing page, and there is no refund notification from Ebay, and no refund on Paypal. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago someone had a post, I think on here, that permanent magnets will no longer be sold to the US. Are authorities finally cracking down on Ebay sellers? </p>

<p>EDIT 1: Sounds like the rumor about banning permanent magnet sales was false, and the seller likely had their Ebay account removed for some other reason, thus resulting in the order being completely removed from my order list. It&#39;s happened before, about once a year. Lots of Chinese sellers list unrelated items together to lower the price, and make their item appear earlier in search listings sorted by price. </p>

<p>I filed a complaint with Ebay and the seller has about 5 days to respond. If there is no response from the seller,  Ebay will refund me the money.
And I ordered magnets from another person so I can continue to make my fridge magnets. :) </p>

<p>The law is there to stop massive collection of rain water needed to maintain some local ecosystems. Not residential rain water collecting...but more like on the industrial scale. </p>

Most of the &quot;crazy&quot; laws are due to aholes like that. Idk, but it could be that someone did some weird shit &amp; got regs added regarding magnets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had multiple resoviors set up the size of 20 olympic size swimming pools, literally big enough for boats. Rainwater (or at least most of it) needs to absorb/runoff in order to protect incredibly delicate environmental balances. So even though he was <em>technically</em> on his own property his actions were harming the property of others + the entire surrounding area.

    <div class="md"><p>Ooo, what an intriguing story! I&#39;ll look it up. Water in particular is a tricky thing. Near my hometown there are two nearly dry rivers that used to be huge roaring things. One was affected by diverting for farming, lakes, &amp; wells &amp; both  by the Hoover dam. As someone who came up in the desert &amp; so respects the hell out of water, I&#39;m a pretty big proponent of slowly, but surely, doing away with those, ultimately harmful, types of human interference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if the Rare Earth Element battles are still going on. </p>

<p>China has attempted to corner the market in order to drive up the prices. This has been going on since the 90s. </p>

<p>Trade embargoes of REE let a lot of military analysts see how real of a threat, China was to the stability of the Global Economy.</p>

<p>Unless something has changed recently, China has the only large scale mining of REE’s right now. They stopped shipment of all REE’s Japan for a few months, we can only assume they still have some limitations.</p>

<p>I just don’t see how this would impact fridge magnets...</p>
