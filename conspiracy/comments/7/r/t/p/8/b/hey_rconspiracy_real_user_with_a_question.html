<p>Today I was watching a video and as I was sitting I started to notice that the video editing cuts started to become almost rhythmic, to the point it started to hurt my head. So my question is whether or not there is any based evidence that video editing can be used to effect/manipulate the brain? Or is this just more a case of bad editing?</p>

<p>Sorry if the question seems odd or anything but I&#39;m rather new to the world of conspiracy so I thought I&#39;d start here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what this phenomena is called but I remember reading about it a few years ago, it&#39;s when TV shows or ads use a jump cut (an abrupt change of scenery or subject, almost always visual in nature) to catch or recapture your attention. It&#39;s successful due to the nature of our &quot;reptile&quot; brains and how our attention is subconsciously directed toward changes in our surroundings as a form of self preservation. I&#39;ve found this style of editing seems to be more successful when combined with an increase in emotion just prior (often suspense, fear, anxiety).. I can&#39;t find any sources at the moment unfortunately, all I&#39;m seeing is tips on film editing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if this counts. But, I recently graduated with a marketing degree. I had to take a few psychology courses as they where required courses for the degree. </p>

<p>Marketing is broken down in to a few sections: demographic (age, sex, income) and psycographics (attitude, aspirations and day to day lives). This criteria is then absorbed in to the brand to build the campaign. Mainly it&#39;s how you determine the proper way to reach your intended audience. Psychology is just as important in marketing as the brand itself. </p>

<p>When you take in to account the research and begin to build the campaign (my personal feelings are about honesty. Inform the audience of what the product can do. Not what you wish it could do) you have really have one of two options: lying your ass off with deceptive marketing (embellishing the strengths, making promises the product can not deliver) or build the product up with facts and a happy jingle/tag line. </p>

<p>But before you can even build the campaign you need to know the intended demographic. When you couple that with the psycographics essentially you&#39;re building a personality of what or who you want to buy the product. That is marketing in a nut shell. And you are not too far off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A thousand times, this. School man... they’ve changed so many programs in universities over the last 15 years because of the results they’ve seen. Ethics and politics aside, the world has been changing at a frightening pace and the regulatory capabilities are staggeringly behind what they should be.</p>

<p>I took a class almost 10 years ago now in one of my last semesters as an undergrad called Computers, Internet &amp; Society. Back then the Iranian revolution had just happened with the Green a Revolution following, all the while being broadcast on no other news source but Twitter and other forms of social media. The country had blacked out the media, but there was still internet/vpns/hotspots, you see.  The point is that what I learned from that class, that social media manipulation had been used for good, but... on the flip side... it most certainly would be used for manipulation for nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>Back then I totally saw it being used for political &amp; election manipulation. I just had no idea a clown would be used as the scapegoat. Either way, I hope it will lead to a tighter regulation on politics itself, not the internet which we still have yet to truly grasp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think in years past edits were much more complicated and labor intensive to perform.  Film actually had to be physically cut and spliced, video tape used complex systems involving timecode based systems that added some flexibility, but required a lot of equipment.  </p>

<p>Combine this with each camera needing a distinct recording device (or roll of film) and you wound up with fewer cameras and fewer potential edits.   Live events might have been different because they could switch sources that went to tape and generally weren&#39;t recorded individually per camera.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all digital editing that makes it so easy to do crazy, manic edits, and I&#39;m sure this also enabled crazy manic edits as a &quot;style&quot; seen in all the latest action movies.</p>

<p>I think some people are sensitive to this kind of thing -- I know a couple of people who won&#39;t watch &quot;home video&quot; because the amateur camera work is so wobbly and jerky, it makes them queasy.  It&#39;s probably related to the same kind of inner-ear balance thing that makes some people get sea sick easily on boats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I believe what you speak of to be true. The effects are both long term and short term, causing lowered attention span, headaches and  anxiety over the short term. The even deeper symptoms over the long term including types of neurological degradation. No proof other than I am highly sensitive to otherwise subconscious suggestions.</p>

<p>Basically it attacks your psyche, in tis sense: if a group of people were spread out throughout a room, shouting at you very loudly, from different points throughout the room, very rapidly, but each member of the group only shouting every once in a while, while you&#39;re blind folded in the center of the room, your brain would be racing to process what is going on. Causing anxiety and dread, moreso than just being yelled at, while blind folded, by one person, or a group of people clustered together. What happens with quick switching, is your brain is trying to process the POV of the current camera, when it keeps switching it causes intense stress on your mental capacities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m a film student, did a few courses in film making and in IT before. The one constant I&#39;ve realised from my teachings is HOW to make people think. Hell I&#39;ve had lecturers flat out TELL me that general masses are dumb and its our job to manipulate them. We affect their judgement, get them encaptured by the story and then manipulate not just emotions but thoughts.</p>

<p>Music, movies, all forms of media are in a power struggle between those who enjoy the art of it and want it to grow and for the betterment, then the corporate/government side of it that pushes their own narratives.</p>

<p>Who controls the past controls the future, and who controls the present controls the past.</p>

I haven’t had cable in 10 years and it’s been the best thing I’ve ever done. Cable companies call me monthly and offer me the best deals, like $10 a month for pvr and hbo package etc. I say no each time. You want me to watch advertising? Pay me!

    <div class="md"><p>I think in years past edits were much more complicated and labor intensive to perform.  Film actually had to be physically cut and spliced, video tape used complex systems involving timecode based systems that added some flexibility, but required a lot of equipment.  </p>

<p>Combine this with each camera needing a distinct recording device (or roll of film) and you wound up with fewer cameras and fewer potential edits.   Live events might have been different because they could switch sources that went to tape and generally weren&#39;t recorded individually per camera.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all digital editing that makes it so easy to do crazy, manic edits, and I&#39;m sure this also enabled crazy manic edits as a &quot;style&quot; seen in all the latest action movies.</p>

<p>I think some people are sensitive to this kind of thing -- I know a couple of people who won&#39;t watch &quot;home video&quot; because the amateur camera work is so wobbly and jerky, it makes them queasy.  It&#39;s probably related to the same kind of inner-ear balance thing that makes some people get sea sick easily on boats.</p>
