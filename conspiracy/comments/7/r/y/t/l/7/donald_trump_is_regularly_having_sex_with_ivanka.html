       Just imagine for a minute #PizzaGate would have received only a fraction of this attention from the media.

       This double
       <strong>
        standard is disgusting
       </strong>
       , how can you invite someone like that into a talk show if everything he does is basically the same as they accused #PizzaGate people for.
PizzaGate put people in danger? Fair enough!
      </p>
      <p>
       He also puts people in danger, up to the moment until a crazy guy thinks he has to free the world from D. J. Trump, it's all fun and play.

       I've not made up my mind about this, there does seem to be some smoke. Trump's comments about, and relationship with, his daughter is weird. I don't think anybody can deny it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the pictures, though....Trump's a media whore, always been one. Any photo shoot takes THOUSANDS of pictures, and the photographer is constantly telling the subject what to do, where to move, how to site, etc. You can take one picture that's completely different from all the others, but that's the one they use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read "Open," the autobiography Andre Agassi, which is very good. He was involved in an all-day shoot for Canon cameras, and at the end of it, as a joke, literally the last five minutes of the day, they had him say "Image is Everything" into the camera. THAT became the theme of the commercials and the ad campaign, and it was a severe blow to his reputation. He thought it was just tossed off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jennifer Aniston's foldout bareass shot on the cover of Rolling Stone was initially taken for US magazine (also owned by scumbag Jann Wenner), she had no idea it was going to end up where it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe there's something shady going on with Trump and Ivanka. Maybe she's not even really his daughter. I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person who made the comment about high level Freemasons being handlers is in the ballpark, I think. Trump is a builder, obviously a freemason. Not sure he's been programmed, not sure what he is at all, honestly.

       But that picture could easily be dictated and posed by the photographer. I don't find it damning or conclusive. The one with her mile-long legs stretched across his on the bed where she's giving him a kiss is even creepier, IMHO.

       Who strokes their dad's chin like that? You dont think its creepy?

       And right behind the statue of parrots fucking? Yeah maybe it was dictated by the photographer, its still fucking creepy and any sane person would say no.

       Interesting Freudian slip.

       Like I said...if a photography told a media whore that he wanted his daughter to stroke his chin, the media whore would tell his daughter to do it. Creepy, but DIRECTED creepy. Maybe it was the magazine or the photographer who was excited to create the subtext of underaged sex and incest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parrots are not having sex, FYI. The bottom parrot is turned half-sideways away from the parrot behind it. Just because somebody on Twitter tells you that's what happening doesn't mean you shouldn't look at the picture and think for yourself.

       Like I said: There is smoke here. There may be something going on. I will continue to observe and let my cognitive analysis evolve.
