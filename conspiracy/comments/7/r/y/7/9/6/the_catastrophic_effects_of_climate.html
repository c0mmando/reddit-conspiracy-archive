I’m posting on this sub because honestly I don’t know where else to post it on Reddit, this shouldn’t even be considered a conspiracy, it is a fact that we are being sprayed like lab rats day and night all over the globe. I challenge anyone, DO NOT BELIEVE a word a say. If you truly claim to care about the planet and the people around you, do the honest research and see what you find. I will be listing all the sources I have that contain a mountain load of information that prove climate engineering programs have been going on for decades and the effects of these programs on humans and the environment is deadly.

    <div class="md"><p>Im not sure whether they are adding chemicals to fuel without the pilots and people knowing.. however.. those videos of &quot;the chemtrails turning on and off&quot; show nothing. Look at the sky.. are clouds/blue sky uniform? No, depending on the air pressure and hummidity in precise areas there will be cloud. Its not uniform. Where there is a cloud raining there can be blue clear sky 2 meters beside that. Well as a jet flies through the sky there will be condensate clouds appearing in the spots where pressure is right for a cloud.. then as it keeps flying and there isnt the right hummidity/pressure it will look clear. Its common sense? We need proof by people testing the fuel pf jets and showing theres other harmful chemicals in it. Hard proof. And like I said im not against the idea.. they probablt are spraying. The videos showed nothing though </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not an expert in the field but aside from the videos, go out on a clear day and watch as the jets leave the trails and the trails turn the clear day into a sky covered in a silvery white haze. Even if the videos dont prove anything, the hundreds of documents, patents, studies, and pictures all prove this is going on. The most alarming thing about it is the amount of steps being taken to cover this up from all sides. Did you know that in the US there is a federal gag order on all weather service men prohibiting them from discussing climate engineering? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive watched jets.. that haze is scientificaly condensate aka water.. it spreads out afterwards and dissappears as water should. Why downvote me for that? As I said im all for believing they spray but you need better evidence. Those are youtube videos you linked.. you cant trust youtube for facts on such topics. It does no justice. Youtube is controlled. There are some real papers out there saying they have messed around with geoengineering but nothing says they do it daily on a large scale. You need to keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions. They probably are addig harmful chemicals to fuel without people knowing... if i was them i might. Need better evidence though than youtube videos... test some fuel or something. Crazy claims simply get dismissed.. youtube videos for proof get us nowhere.</p>

<p>The information on geoengineeringwatch.org explains this and proved this far better than I could, I’m not advertising the website for any other purpose than to get the word out. They don’t sell anything and they are not politically aligned with anyone, it is simply a resource website trying to sound the alarm on climate engineering, look through their studies and lab tests and their pictures of trailed skies from all over the world, tell me what you find. They have a mountain load of data on there for free for anyone to look at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All my claims are based on facts though, what more do you want besides photos of this happening, the documents stating that they have planned to do this, the studies showing that what they STATED they want to spray is showing up in our water/air column and all throughout the environment, the film footage of jets turning nozzles on and off, and renowned Geoengineers stating on the record that this is what they want to do. Do you think the military industrial complex does things after they ask for permission from the American people? Absolutely not. Most of the jets spraying aren’t even commercial airliners, they don’t hold passengers in them, do you really thing commercial airliners fly in the same path back and forth in crosshatch patterns? That is absurd, you are dismissing this without even doing the research </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude ive done research. Youre on an extreme end of this and cant even see it. Planes fly back and forth a lot yes.. those are often main routes. Do you know how many planes would have to fly around to achieve this? Can you peove they are all military/non public? Thats not a fact. They stated they have looked into geoengineering vie spray but they never admit doing it latge scale or all over.. just testing it out. The film footage shows planes flying.. as they fly there are areas of low and high pressure and humidity where clouds do and dont form - same thing happens with commercial jets. Thats fact! I dont think they tell or ask people first. They dont care. In this day and age though we need solid proof to get anywhete with such things and this is all mostly bullshit unfortunately. My guess is they add chems to jet fuel secretly. Maybe they do spray from military jets too but that would take a crazy amount of resources and coverups from pilots and rhey would be knowingly spraying them selfs too?? Test the fuel.. get a picture of these nozzles.. something solid. Ive watced them test the ground/water.. guess what.. aluminum is naturally occuring in dirt so yeah itll come up in many tests. We need better proof.. this just makes you seem crazy man.. it doesnt help the cause. </p>

<p>Plenty of data on geoengineeringwatch.org to prove its going on, your reasoning behind why it can’t be going on is purely out of emotional reasoning with no factual basis behind it. I’ve provided you with pictures, footage, documentation, studies and lab tests that prove its going on, all you’ve told me is that it can’t possibly be going on because the power structure says it isn’t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try real hard to give you benefit of the doubt and i read more links you just sent thru geoengineeringwatch. Do you ever click the blue underline source links yourself? Some dont work, some lead to so conspirazy sites talking about morgellons fibers and morgellons disease.. some actually talk about eavy metals in say the UK but if you read it says they get into paper, food, all industries.. and they add spraying at the end. You should learn about critical thinking man.. itll do you justice.. you seem to just be a sheep following the first thing you read. I mean no offence.. i think its likely they do spray and do other horrble things without our knowledge. They do it to themselves too then.. and the earth in general. Maybe they have tech that heals them so they dont care. Anyway.. you need to really look at every little angle on this orherwise youre believing aomwthing without real proof. Most those links are bunk.. you dont even think about all the small details about what you read about and then you post it as proof.. it makes you seem a bit crazy im sorry to say. If they are spraying then youre helping hy spreading the news but youre helping them by making it seem like a crazy conspiracy. Im out. I wish you good health, peace, and luck.. and i hope if they are spraying it bites them in the ass eventually.. theres so many other things to worry about too.. the food you eat and water you drink is poisoned.. maybe you should worry about that first as you have more control over your diet and you can find ways to filter the water. Peace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sure they have pattents on it as they have looked into spraying and even admit it a few times. They never admit to large scale spraying though. And the nozzles.. man.. u make blanket statements without thinking everything through. Wouldnt the pilots and the ground maintenence crew and plane mechabics all k ow about these nozzles? That would mean thousands and thousands and thousands of people know about this and live in the chemical spray and cover this up. That sounds ridiculous. If they are spraying.. i would fathom that nobody really is told.. and somewhere along the line they add chemicals to the fuel without people knowing/seeing. So as it flies around its dropping chems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive looked into it. Theres not much proof.. theres a lot of fakery.. a lot of crazy people run such sites and dont help the cause of whats really happening always. Like i said above.. these videos and such are easily debunkable. The problem as it stands is theres no proof yet... we honestly need to test the fuel for whats inside.. or take a picture of these spray nozzles on mainstream jets.. now thats irrefutable proof! I think they do add chems but this stuff unfortunately isnt proof.. jets make clouds.. that proves nothing unfortunately. Ive seen weird clouds since i was a kid. Maybe they sprayed all along. We need proof.. find a pilot or a ground crew worker to secretly take a sample of the jet fuel for testing.. something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe a single word you say. There is a real problem concerning these chemtrails. People are getting sicker and food is becoming less nutritious. If you watched the documentary, a lot of aluminum is getting into the land, the trees, and the atmosphere. New GMO seeds are being sold that are resistant to toxins and heavy metals. To me it seems that they are creating an industry to force farmers to grow patented seeds that will make them an even stronger monopoly.</p>

<p>Weather modification is real and it has created a lot of problems. You saw all those wildfires in california? Nothing like aluminum particles spread out to cause intense fire. I sacrificed a lot to educate people on these threats, I need people to realize that this world is reaching a point where greed is all and not the health and safety of humankind.</p>

For those concerned about having too much aluminum in the body, you can test hair samples, especially recently grown ones and to chelate heavy metals, you can take cilantro, chlorella, and eat some brazil nuts to restore zinc and selenium.

    <div class="md"><p>Name calling again? You just told me to leave emotion out of this. </p>

<p>1) I saw this already, how does that prove anything? How do we know these are real results? How do we know how to interpret the results? Maybe some tests are taken near factories or road pollution - did you know that pollution from traffic and industry and even from break pads/rubber tires is super bad for you and lingers in the air as well? It&#39;s probably containing all these bad chemicals in the air as well. So how do you know its from planes spraying? We don&#39;t. That&#39;s called critical thinking. Not just posting links from conspiracy sites and saying ITS PROOF, YOURE BLIND IF YOU DON&#39;T SEE THAT?</p>

<p>2) more links, okay I click the first one, &quot;1998 The state of Minnesota finds unexplained aluminum. Go to this URL, go to page ten and put aluminum in the PDF search engine. Or scroll down to second paragraph (page 10).&quot; LINK IS DEAD, okay next.</p>

<p>Clifford Carnicom’s rainwater tests of 2001 :<a href="http://carnicominstitute.org/">http://carnicominstitute.org/</a> .. links dead, takes me to a conspiracy website.</p>

<p>Carnicom independently isolates barium 2001 : link: <a href="http://carnicominstitute.org/">http://carnicominstitute.org/</a> - AGAIN LINKS DEAD, TAKES ME TO MAIN PAGE OF WEBSITE</p>

<p>2002 Therese Aigner, professional, accredited enivrionmental expert/engineer tests in 2002 Over three months :link: <a href="http://www.rense.com/general21/conf.htm">http://www.rense.com/general21/conf.htm</a> - when you read this and scroll down, it takes you to the &quot;PROOF&quot; - another link to :The sample data (&quot;Results&quot;) is available in the original form at <a href="http://www.carnicom.com/contrails.htm">www.carnicom.com/contrails.htm</a> Click on &#39;Lab Tests Are Positive&#39;, then on Page 3. - click that and back to, &quot;<a href="http://carnicominstitute.org/">http://carnicominstitute.org/</a>&quot; main page.. NO FUCKING PROOF. ALL BULLSHIT EMPTY PAGES WHEN YOU FOLLOW THE SOURCES THEY PROVIDE???? DO YOU EVEN CLICK YOUR OWN SOURCES?</p>

<p>2002 Canadian journalist Will Thomas obtains tests from Alberta Canada. <a href="http://holmestead.ca/chemtrails/soilradar.html">http://holmestead.ca/chemtrails/soilradar.html</a> ~ 
soil samples showed damaging EC readings 4.6 to 7-times higher than this maximum permissible level, A life-long plane spotter, Dickie also wondered if there could be a connection to events unfolding on ATC radar scopes. So some random people writing on a website is proof to you? How do you know any of that is even real? Even if he did see more planes than normally, how do you know the higher levels in the soil of those plants was because of spraying? Could be from traffic? Pesticides, top soil problems, etc? more critical thinking issues by you to just accept what you read at face value. </p>

<p>2003 United Kingdom: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987704000222">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987704000222</a>  - The high levels of Ba stemmed from local quarrying for Ba ores and/or use of Ba in paper/foundry/welding/textile/oil and gas well related industries, as well as from the use of Ba as an atmospheric aerosol spray for enhancing/refracting the signalling of radio/radar waves along military jet flight paths, missile test ranges, etc. THEY ADMIT IT COMES FROM PAPER/FOUNDRY/WELDING/ETC AND THEN CLAIM ITS ALSO FROM CHEMTRAIL SPRAYS.. NO PROOF, MORE CLAIMS OF BULLSHIT. </p>

<ul>
<li>Im not even going to continue on to more geoengineeringwatch links because everyone I look at continues with this trend, then other sources of proof you use youtube videos showing clouds form behind planes and weird weather stuff as proof? Lastly you use the CIA saying &quot;potentially could use&quot;. My god you&#39;re a crazy person.</li>

<p>Hydrogen water cost too much.  I bought 60 cubic feet of hydrogen gas for $40.00.  The rest of the stuff needed to meter out the gas cost about one years worth of hydrogen water, the 60 cubic feet of hydrogen gas is enough for one person for over 50 years.
