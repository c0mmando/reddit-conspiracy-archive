    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m waiting on the 9th for sure. I&#39;m not gonna pull my assets out of the market though, it&#39;s more of a curiosity on my part. However, if the guy is right once again, his website will probably get enough publicity for someone involved in the conspiracy to notice, and the pattern will change.</p>

<p>I read his posts to the google group (or where ever that was) and found them quite interesting. His website on the other hand is a complete mess, and is quite frankly making me doubt the guy. It just seems like the ramblings of a mad man. That, or he&#39;s too brilliant for me to comprehend :p</p>

<p>edit: Monday is 9th, not 10th of February.</p>

<p>glad to see this come up here, he&#39;s a cryptic nut, his website&#39;s just been full of photos and no narratives, let&#39;s see if he gets this date right or if he&#39;ll end out another john titor...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those of you who don&#39;t know <a href="http://www.enterprisecorruption.com/">http://www.enterprisecorruption.com/</a> is the website run by the guy who predicted the September 15th stock market crash to the day back on July 18th.</p>

<p>He has been counting down the days until February 10th.  Some random peices of information he&#39;s thrown out include a Wikipedia link to the Khadr family.  So, who wants to speculate on what this means?  Is he just messing with people?  Could there be another false flag attack possibly in Canada that is then pinned on the Khadrs?  Too early to tell? </p>

<p>edit-date changed, thanks haven</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IIRC he believes that a group of people are making lots of money through what&#39;s best described as coordinated short selling. On the 6th of February this group will short a specific stock, or the market as a whole. Then, after hours on Friday or early Monday, they&#39;ll reveal some horrible news (this group is powerful enough to make these things happen, or has access to information to just expose bad news). As a consequence the stock market will crash on Monday 9th of February. At that point they&#39;ll buy back the shares they shorted, and pocket the difference.</p>

<p>So the 53 Enrons he&#39;s talking about, is the 53 times (since we started counting time) this group has made the market crash and made lots of money doing so.</p>

<p>Edit: The first business day after the conference is done, is Monday the 9th, not Monday the 10th of February.</p>

<p>lol retreat 5th to 7th.  Thanks, Reinhardt of Google Finance forums.  Everytime these Legatus assholes leave the country, something big goes down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>according to those that are trying to piece together the data he&#39;s given, R&#39;s telling us to watch for the 10 or so companies that just had their CEO&#39;s replaced before the Legatus pilgrimage. it isn&#39;t going to be an economic collapse, mind you; you&#39;ll see a sharp drop in stocks, but the Dow at &gt;3000 prediction he&#39;s made isn&#39;t supposed to happen during this pilgrimage. </p>

<p>R hyped this up in December, but recent months have shown February is going to be more to show the timing of the market, not a global collapse.</p>

<p>Also, R predicted February 9th to be the day. he even commented that people were counting wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he has hinted, often. until you know what to look for, it&#39;s tough to understand what he&#39;s saying.</p>

<p>most of the people that hang out on wiredpirate.com have narrowed a few of them down. one of the biggest to avoid is Seagate (CEO replaced, about to announce massive losses after money laundering). safe bet seems to be Intel and AMD (more gains on AMD, tho) related to investments coming from Innovation Park at Notre Dame (which R said to invest in heavily).</p>
