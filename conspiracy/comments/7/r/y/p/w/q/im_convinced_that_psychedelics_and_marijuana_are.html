       Psychadelics, yes. You take mushrooms one time and you'll know that there is more to life than working 9 to 5. Marijuana, possibly. I know, initially, it was  banned because of  ability  to threaten the textile industry. It also has many positive effects on your mental state and alters your way of thinking, usually for the better.

       I don't know if that was the intent of the invention and I'm not who you asked, but if  you get the chance read Jack Herer's "The Emperor Wears No Clothes." In it he has copies of a share-holder's report issued by DuPont basically saying they were going to make a lot of money becasue of changes they managed certain branches of government to make to certain laws. Believe it was blatantly referring to their nylon invention wiping out hemp being used as rope.

        In DuPont’s 1937 Annual Report to its stockholders, the company strongly urged continued investment in its new, but not readily accepted, petrochemical synthetic products. DuPont was anticipating “radical changes” from “the revenue raising power of government … converted into an instrument for forcing acceptance of sudden new ideas of industrial and social reorganization.” *

       And because it was an easy excuse to arrest minorities in the 20s and 30s. I don’t think “the system” fights counterculture as much as it did back then, but it’s the root of the perpetuation of those laws, which just become false facts to a lot of people  still to this day.

       People keep repeating this argument as if black people are forced to sell drugs. Poverty is not an excuse to break the law. No one is crying for the white meth cooks because they were just trying to make money. Stop trying to twist everything into white on black injustice. Arresting criminals for committing crimes is not racist.

       And white guys were using insider information to trade stocks before it was illegal. Now that it is illegal do you think the SEC is racist for arresting them?

       That is an ignorant reductionist view that does not reflect reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, the Natives lived in tribal hunter gatherer communities, in tent "cities". If everything the settlers had was stolen from the Natives they would have tents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, conquering someone does not make you a racist in any kind of meaningful definition of the word. By the idiotic way liberals use it  literally everything is racist. You are racist. It means nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, slavery existed sine before written language. Blacks enslaved other blacks and traded them to whites for guns. Were the blacks racist? Your logic eats itself. Slavery is not done because of racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country was built by the blacksmiths, the leather tanners, the craftsmen, the loggers, the farmers etc. That slave labor was used in some industries does not mean America was built by slaves. It is only by brainwashing that people swallow that drivel.

       Umm... no this has nothing to do with black people. Psychoactive marijuana (aka
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       <em>
        hemp
       </em>
       ) was essentially non-existent before large numbers of South American immigrants brought their harmless pastime with them. Marijuana was then criminalized for many reasons like threatening textiles and other industries. It was also worked into the anti-immigrant rhetoric with claims that it would make black people and Mexicans into crazed white-women-raping lunatics. Just look at some of the propaganda from when prohibition began, it certainly has a racist bent.

       Institutional racism is a form of racism expressed in the practice of social and political institutions. Institutional racism is also racism by individuals or informal social groups, governed by behavioral norms that support racist thinking and foment active racism. It is reflected in disparities regarding wealth, income, criminal justice ...

       The only government programs that are racially biased are biased in favor of minorities and especially blacks. So of course institutional racism exists.

       We're talking about the beginning of marijuana laws and who was affected by it. At that time people who used marijuana were more likely to be black or Hispanic.
       <br/>
       Someone made the comment that those people broke the law. Well, it's a stupid law and it is and always has been applied more towards people of color. For example making rock cocaine "crack" a much more sever offense than powdered cocaine at a time when whites were using a lot of cocaine, but in powder form, is a form of institutional racism.

       So when people say "drugs are banned as a way to arrest black people" do you say "no, that is just one reason"? Fuck no you don't. You tell the libtard that said that they are right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every country in the world has banned drugs. Therefore it is absolutely absurd to think drugs would not be banned in the US if it were not for racism. That is not a false equivalence, it is logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If drugs would be banned in the US even if there were no racism then how the fuck do you go around saying that racism is the reason for drug laws?

       Every country in the world has not banned drugs. Do you just make shit up to suit your worldview? It’s false equivalence because different countries ban different drugs for different reasons and to assert them at they all do it for the same (non racists of course) reasons is absurd. Your last paragraph is asking about a hypothetical situation and has no relevance to this in any way.

       Here we go again, a liberal using an exception to a rule to argue that the rule does not exist. Effectively every country in the world has banned drugs.

       They don't all have different reasons. They ban drugs because drugs are bad. They get people addicted, destroy their lives, and cause them to cause a lot of damage to their communities and families. That is not absurd. Frankly if you really think that you are retarded.

       I’m not a liberal so you can knock that shit off right now. Your only arguments have been fallacious. You’ve offered no counter point to anything I’ve said other than your personal opinions. Not all the same drugs are illegal everywhere, so your argument falls apart on that basis. You insinuate that because most countries ban some really bad drugs that means all countries ban all drugs which is just flat out untrue.

       This quote works so well for you because it confirms your bias. But if you could step back for a second and realize that this one man does not control everyone or speak for everyone you might actually understand how weak this evidence is.

       My argument was never that there were not a lot of people who supported this legislation on the basis that it would justify arresting blacks. Neither of us knows how prevalent that idea was, though you may think you do. My argument is that when the law was passed no one was forced to break it.

       When I smoke cigys my lungs shut up immediately I have to go to hospital and have been to intensive care as a kid many times for being around second hand smoke.. Although when I was late teens I got into chop bongs tobacco and weed through being shouted them free not getting any respitory effect and slowly getting addicted to tobacco.. To this day 10 years later I smoke a cigy I'm in hospital I go in a car ride with a mate that smokes with all windows open and hang my head put the window I'll be in hospital condition but treat myself with prednisone cause that's all they fkn do.. But I can smoke a half ounce of weed with a full pack of ciggerettes in 1 day and not get any negative effect even makes me cough out shot and breathe better after as if the tobacco wasn't there, somehow the weed makes my body tolerate tobacco.. Has anybody done a study into this because I would really love to know how to explain this to people cause I have had 100+ intense arguments with people not to smoke near me cause it kills me so fast I will no longer let anybody smoke near me no matter how kunty they are, They always argue the point but u smoke weed? Immediately I think are you fking retarded weed doesn't have 100s of unnatural chemicals in it!!!! Argument over! But I've course they go on and on and try sneak one up anyway sick of fighting over something I know as fact that they don't know anything about, and Ive argued points to people of all age groups proffesions it gets intense when they've seen me have a chop bong which I am not addicted to anymore but enjoy, but the argument still doest make sense they can't understand that smoke weed with a little tobacco through water effects the body different than 2nd hand smoke and smoking cigys through a filter, I don't know the science behind it, I have tried looking into it can't find anything. But it makes sense doesn't it? I understand the hypocritical part of it which pushed people to argue into fights etc but what aboutbthe science so incan put people in their place.

       Yup how many pounds would you have to smoke in 15minutes to die from it? Yet most us remember a time we drank and are surprised we didn't die or get ourselves killed.

       I don't know, in my experience after a long tolerance break, when I smoke or eat edibles the weed provides deep thought provocation. It's pretty spiritual to me at that point vs everyday smoking. I ate edibles once and I swear it was crazy as hell. I contemplated allot that day of life. If you have never ate good edibles please try?
It is wayyy different than smoking in my experience

       Yep. And a lot of people overlook the fact that cannabis is actually classed as a psychedelic, albeit a mild one. I've had some profound realizations when under the influence of it, breakdowns of regressive thought models instilled by society, an increase in childlike wonder, curiosity, ego-loss, empathy, deep self-examination, etc. All the type of stuff that you get tenfold from the stronger psychedelics.

       What are people meaning about breakdowns of regressive thought models?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is thinking with weed better than thinking deeply without it? Or would the governments scare be that it is more likely to think in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've read things about meditation techniques and thought without needing drugs. Some opinions I see make it seem like you can't think deeply without weed, but there are examples of non productive citizens that smoke alot of weed.

       From my experience, you grow up in a certain culture, era, society, etc., and you are kind of indoctrinated from an early age with your culture's values and assumptions. So, being born in hyper-consumerist late 20th-century America, I was kinda programmed to view my fellow humans as competitors, and to place importance on superficial/material things like money, "cool" clothes, flashy possessions, social status, etc. Mainstream American culture is generally very shallow, materialist, and just spiritually bankrupt. We are expected to accept things like war, poverty, inequitable class divisions, etc. as natural and inevitable parts of life. Psychedelics just make it easier to see how all of this shit is ultimately an empty construct that has been foisted upon us, and that our species is capable of so much better.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about psychedelics is, they don't really give you anything that isn't already there inside you. They just make it easier to access these deeper levels of thought and experience. I believe that even the Greek etymology of the word "psychedelic" is roughly "mind-discovery." So you're really just discovering latent parts of your own mind and reality (as opposed to other drugs like alcohol, benzos, opiates, cocaine, etc. that are more about getting "fucked up" and making yourself temporarily oblivious to reality).

       No, I mean psychedelic. It shares enough qualities and effects with the "major psychedelics" to easily be considered a milder relative, which is why it is often included in full lists of psychedelic substances. The main (almost only) difference is that it isn't much of a hallucinogen (although even this has its exceptions, as many people can and have experienced slight visual distortions/closed-eye visuals from cannabis).

       Acid 20 or so, shrooms around 5, DMT countless times, Salvia 3 or 4.

       DMT is my total favourite not just because of the experience but because it's a 30 minute love affair, not a full day then a night laying awake trying to sleep while your bones ache.

       I'd love to try DMT again. Mushrooms completely changed my entire personality and outlook on life. I haven't tripped in like two years or something, but as I'm sure you know, the experiences stay with you long after the actual psychoactive effect is over. It's beautiful stuff, and gives me hope for humanity's future.

       I had a ton of the stuff a couple of years ago... somehow manged to find 3 vendors on clearnet selling it very cheap... my last purchase was 5g for £100 delivered. I kid you not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had so much I was paranoid keeping it in my house so tried to use it all up but, after trying it once, all my friends were reluctant to do it again. When it was finally gone all 3 vendors stopped replying to emails so that was that. I haven't found it since and the forum where I found the vendors has since been closed.

       Yeah. I think back to my younger days when I first got really stoned, and it really was very much a mind-blowing, psychedelic experience. It's not
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       pronounced now (probably because I'm more habitualized to it from frequent casual use), but it still manages to take me by surprise all the time with deep shifts in perception. I think that's one of the main things that sets psychedelics (and I'm including weed in this) apart from like every other drug is that they are not nearly as predictable. Like for instance, when you drink a bunch of liquor or pop some pain pills, you pretty much know EXACTLY what the experience is going to be like, you know exactly how you're going to feel. But psychedelics are continually surprising, and you never quite know exactly where the experience will take you. Which is why one day you might smoke some weed and have a really mellow, laid-back experience, and then the next day you might smoke and feel all unsettled or paranoid or whatever. One of many characteristics weed shares with its stronger "major psychedelic" relatives.

       Some weed is actually within the psychedelic spectrum. Its rare but when I first started using it, I got heavy visual trips similar to that of what shrooms give. I've also talked and met people who can't smoke weed because they have scary trips on it every time.

       The saying is is that, "You go into a trip with everything that you bring with you."
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have a panic attack or a terror reaction while on marijuana, it is because you have anxiety issues, worries, concerns, and stress that you have not addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you use the way marijuana affects you to build up that panic and make it visible to you, if you would address the core of the issue during the trip you can transform a bad experience/panic attack/whatever into a freeing and liberating emotional event.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just have to have a heart that's bigger than your fear to do it.

       While what you say is true in some cases, many people simply don't respond well to cannabis and it isn't necessarily a reflection of their issues, we're just made differently. I agree that a panic or terror reaction while on marijuana could be because of anxiety issues, worries, etc., but I commonly see people with all sorts of fear and unresolved issues smoking weed and feeling fine, and plenty of people who have done a lot of work on themselves suffering from adverse effects while high.

       That is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any particular reason to be all panicky. In fact, people typically say that I'm a very analytical and rational person, so the idea of me freaking out and getting emotional is hard for them to understand sometimes.
      </p>

       I think weed makes your personality a bit more malleable, and for some people that's great and for others it's horrible, I suppose.

       I'm not sure which side I land on, but I do try to use it as a tool and not as a crutch.

       I have had several panic attacks both on weed and when perfectly normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't promise that this works for everyone, but for me, taking the panic (when I have a specific thing that's causing the panic) and addressing it, taking it to its logical conclusion and deciding what my reaction to that conclusion will be showed it actually manifest seems to help.
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems a little vague so maybe a scenario will help.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, I have had panic attacks thinking that my friends are somehow out to get me in some way, (this is definitely a paranoia type event, pretty common with marijuana).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I decided that if they were going to try to "get" me then they weren't my friends, but since I could not actually pinpoint the method in which they were going to "attack" me in this panic scenario I had created, then in response to that, I would be the kind of person who, if they did actually decide to attack me or get me in this paranoia situation, that they would become quantitatively worse people for actually executing their attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I responded to the fear of the paranoia of the panic attack by saying that I would show love, care and consideration to them in the mean time; to be an honest and true friend to my friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then if they actually chose to hurt me (or whatever my unrealized fear was), then I could write them off with a clean conscience knowing that I had done everything I could to give them no reason whatsoever to turn on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that decision allowed me to unravel the fear that had gripped my heart and the panic attack went away.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a unexpected side effect of this choice, I have actually sort of developed a much better friendship with my friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly believe that whatever that fear was came from an insecurity I had about my role relationship with my friends. And working through that gave me a space inside of my own identity to fill, to serve a need that built up the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I don't know if this will help everyone, but it really helped me and it would make me happy if it did help you and other people as well.

       Best way to address it is putting yourself in a great set and setting both physically and mentally. Going to depend a lot of the substance &amp; the person using it. For me meditation (sitting legs crossed, deep breathing with my hands in the air) has always helped. That &amp; painting for me works wonders, something about the colors &amp; the instant creation of something. Re-assuring yourself that your fine exc. exc.

       For me, all the paranoid energy is from all the female energy of the plant's valence as a spirit combined with all the female energy in my space from the women in my life. As a man, I have to ground that energy, then run my own female energy. Kind of a hassle, but it fixes it.

       If you read Carlos Castaneda, he talks about how it deep trance you can move the "window" through which you perceive the world to a new location in your spiritual reality.

       Marijuana can also be used to move the window, if it is used for that purpose.

       That's really cool, I'll check it out. I've experienced something similar to that when I used to meditate all the time. I could literally feel my body floating away and it felt like I left my room.

       Also, DMT transported me to what looked like the inside of some colorful, kaleidescopic room with a giant acorn in the middle. I think that was my pineal gland.

       I was doing some research on the pineal gland recently. Super interesting stuff. Many consider it to be a "third eye" of some sort, and the flouride in our water supplies calcifies the pineal gland and essentially makes it useless. If anyone has more information on this II'd love to hear.

       Some say that's the whole reason behind adding fluoride to the water. The pineal gland is an enigma. It really is. It can produce DMT, possibly the strongest chemical on the planet. It's found in numerous animals, and plants, crazy enough. It's, Also, believed that DMT is released when you enter REM sleep and when you die. There's another way to release it, too. Deprive yourself of light and sound for three days, and you'll induce a DMT trip. Even with so much calcification, our pineal glands are still capable of producing a strong effect. Imagine how strong it was for people 5,000 years ago. There's numerous accounts in the Bible of going into a cave for extended periods of time and coming out with a revelation from God or having seen God. Very fascinating stuff.

       I think they are eating acid. Eat acid long enough and that lovey dovey connected world peace stuff goes out the window...I say this from experience. Have at least 1000 acid trips under my belt. Went from. "Give the elite lsd and we will have world peace!!"

       You could study up on the effects of psychadelics, reading  every article about the way it makes you feel. You'll know everything about it. But without experiencing it firsthand, you'll never

       Maybe it's just how I think, but that doesn't really make sense to me.  I do have some suspicions that it could be a false epiphany, where the only thing they give you is the feeling that you have had the epiphany, like people with manic episodes sometimes have.

       That's why thinking about it doesn't do it any justice. You have to experience it to see what all the fuss is about.

       You can grow mushrooms yourself. It is illegal, but purchasing the spores is not. They're used for study in mycology. And there's tons of videos on how to grow them. Just need a little bit of money and resolve to do it. You can also make DMT. And the materials used for it are legal, but making it carries a 20 year prison sentence if caught. 
Both, take a lot of effort, but if you're interested, those are just a couple of routes you could take if you're unable to find it.

       Unfortunately marijuana does affect your ability to concentrate for prolonged period of time. I talk from experience, it improved my study time as a math major. It for sure should be decriminalized because alcohol is just as bad for concentration, but the recovery period is shorter.

       Nah, I know quite a few lsd and mushroom heads that have zero clue what is going on in the world. There trips are just them checking out of a false reality into another false reality. Also, almost everyone I know that smokes weed are video game attacks, netflix and internet dweebs. They have no clue. Weed and other drugs seems to only enhance your personality more.

       You probably haven't ever had a really deep trip, if that's your sentiment. They can be the most amazing tools at helping people see through the illusion. DMT is the queen of them all, in my experience- seriously worth trying.

       Explain the question. In context we were talking about DMT, which hurls people into a separate dimension filled with intelligent entities. That sure lifts the veil, because you come to see that there's a lot more to the world than the meaningless, mechanistic, material thing that we're lead to believe it is. There are other beings, other realms, and it seems that this is where the real action is- at least, that was my conclusion, and a lot of peoples' conclusion.

       Quantum physics is also backing up this "reality," as it were, as non-locality theory has been proven, and "many worlds theory," which says there are many overlapping dimensions invisible to the naked human eye, is currently popular.

       Psychedelics don't make stupid people smarter.  I too know people who use(d) psychedelics who treated it as nothing more than a colorful amusement park.  As for the intelligent people I know, it opens them into vast new areas of thought.  I personally consider the first time I took LSD to be one of the most important experiences of my life.  Everything you consider status quo, normal, expected, routine... it's just one point of reference in an infinite ocean of possibilities.  It's very liberating if you approach it from the perspective of "I want to know the truth."

      <p>
       To be subdued, in your definition i would assume asleep is the term, by society is to accept and strive for the meaningless hurdles that ultimately serve the others. If someone can define what it means to be happy with a night on the couch absorbing some good ol free imagination then more power too them.

       Its those that tell others that they are unhappy because of "". Those people who push others to see, feel and do thing contrary to their personal understsnding of what it means to be happy.

       Much like you. Im sure you feel you have insights and understanding into this world. From your persepctive im sure you do.

      <p>
       But to condone the belittling of others due to percieved naive nature is no better than the control of others for preordained ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, and everyone else on this planet, are no more enlightened than any other. Anyone who claims to be so is false. Define happiness as something you accomplish rather than find. Define understanding as something subjective rather than real.

       So what if others try to find their happiness in a smaller pallet than you?

       looks like I triggered you. I use to be a mega stoner and it only put up barriers not break them down. It made me feel content with where I was in life. I don't think there is anything wrong with cannabis but the over consumption of anything is no good. People who think cannabis is going to break down mental barriers are delusional. Any "waking up" I ever did had nothing to do with weed. The moment I stopped using it daily was the moment my life was taken off pause.

There is at least some evidence that piracetam can reverse some age related changes in the brain that are associated with Alzheimers or dementia, for example.

       There are some reports that JFK took LSD with one of his girlfriends, yes. I don't know the degree to which it affected his views on the war, but I wouldn't be surprised.... Bobby Kennedy also, his wife took LSD therapeutically and testifies in Congress that it should remain legal, which was a losing cause.

       Acid in your teens is the equivalent to that deep insightful movie that doesn't hit home until your older, I think it's a much more beautiful experience later in life and taking it an early age is watching something youre not ready to fully appreciate. But good on you lady, I'm proud of you.

       It was a joke I'm 28 I know all about hallucinating drugs and there is a reason so many people have spiritual awakening when doing some of these..mushrooms were my favorite. I grew out of it now but there was definitely a connection with nature and a unknown force to me pretty much every time I ever used them. Self awareness and enlightenment. My buddy made dmt in 5 gallon bucket loads when it first came out. He would have a burner address and prepaid card order a tree bark and extract dmt outta it somehow but it was the real deal and people loved it.

       Oh man, that is one of those boring arguments that people throw away without thinking too much.

       It could have been ended better, but you should also speculate how it would be now if there haven't been hippies in 60's? We might not have even that little bit of studies done with psychedelics that we now have now.
      </p>

       Movements in 60's had great role bringing meditation and yoga practices to the western world.

       I hear that if you take a dissociative you can, "become the paint on the wall." It's as if you're consciousness is in the paint and you see things as the paint sees things. The paint being one example of things in the room you can 'become.'

       It did. And then CIA  artificially created the hippies in order to undermine the antiwar movement — and it worked. Check out Dave McGowan.

       The CIA literally is either the Illuminati or the tool of them. They know their straw house is ready to fall at the slightest gust of social unrest, yet they’ve still managed to keep the dictatorship of the rich alive.

       Unfortunately it wasn't really drugs that fueled the 60's. The biggest unknown motto of the 60's was do as thou wilt. This quote is from Alister Crowley also known as the most wicked man in the world. Many artists such as Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and a little later on all the members of Led Zeppelin were heavily influenced by his philosophy. The meaning of do as thou wilt means do whatever you want, which fits the 60's pretty well with the hippie movement free love and anti war sentiments. But the ultimate meaning of that quote is do whatever you want and screw what it does to other people. This is really what fueled much of the 60's counter culture for example Jim Morrison believed that he sold his soul to the devil while he was high on LSD and writing the Doors first album. Even his bandmates recount Jim giving off a weird energy during their shows and Ray Manzarec claimed he felt Jim's energy taking him over. There's a quote from Morrison that says he's concerned with chaos and actions that have no meaning as they are a path to freedom which is a very Crowley statement. As for Led Zeppelin Jimmy Page owns and lives in crowleys old house where Crowley was rumored to have committed ritual human sacrifice. Finally Timothy Leary, a symbol of the 60's, actually believed he was the reincarnation of, or at least channeling the spirit of, Crowley. Leary also conducted many psychological experiments that today would be considered highly unethical. Many people think that Milgram was bad but none of his studies created a terrorist.

       I wish I could find it but I once saw a pretty credible mapping of large concentrations of mycellium networks and early advanced societies - in SE Asia and Latin America. It was pretty stunning. This is the sort of "fringe history" I'd like to see explored more, but those bent on division of all aspects of humanity prefer to talk about aliens and mythical giants. Thanks "History Channel".

       I've read this somewhere too... but it was so long ago I'd probably never remember the source (though I suppose I could go look).  Something about some alkaloid or molecule or something that exists within magic mushrooms that is not found to occur naturally anywhere else leading some to believe that these mushrooms are not from this earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also read that Santa Claus was originally a guy that would climb into your hut from a hole in your hut's roof to deliver mushrooms to you.
"Thanks Mushroom Santa :D"

       It is very interesting!
I also seem to remember something about the mushrooms acting as an antenna... either the mushrooms themselves or the 'active ingredients' once consumed... channeling the cosmic knowledge to our brains.

       I found a huge pdf years ago that I printed out at work and put into a binder to read. But that was about four computers ago.... before I really started saving(hoarding) everything. The binder is probably in a box somewhere in my basement. I wish I could remember the name of the document!

       I delved into growing a few years ago and I was amazed at how easy it was, following the PF tek method. When you think about it, the sheer speed with which they form is "alien" in itself. I still have some old spore syringes, I hear they have an impressive shelf life if stored properly - might have to do another grow :)

       The Hebrew word in Genesis translates only to "fruit." In some cultures, the word "apple" is used to denote the fruit of some plants and that may have contributed to this misnomer. There is nothing that definitively identifies what kind of fruit Adam and Eve ate.

       It doesn't really. Amanita trips often induce a deep sleep coupled with intense and frightening dreams. Lighter doses give  more dissociative/drunkenly effect often with generally disphoric/creepy vibes.

       You're right on point, OP. That's why they were banned, psychedelics, including all research, and only recently have we begun to have some research permitted, thanks to the hard-working people at
       <a href="http://www.maps.org">
        www.maps.org
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, not everyone has a life-changing or deeply magical experience with psychedelics, but a lot of us do. Shouldn't we be asking: Where do these things come from? How did they get here, why do they do these extraordinary things? DMT is the most dramatic and profoundly revealing of all of them.

       I've always used a classic meth pipe, with the bubble on the end. But as long as you're somehow vaporizing it, you're good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about intentions exactly, but set and setting as well as method are hugely important. Definitely don't combine it with alcohol. Minimize caffeine and anything else except maybe weed; this isn't a party. Come in with a real clear head and relatively empty stomach; maybe meditate beforehand. Ideally, do it at night. Then most importantly, take *massive hits of it- get as much into your lungs as possible, and then hold it for literally about a ten count. That's the part almost no beginners do right; they don't hold their hits long enough. If you're going for a breakthrough you might take three hits, or at least two.

       Stories like this one, as told by Terence McKenna, actually happen:

       Thanks! I was specifically wondering if you’d personally experienced the difference between smokable dmt vs. ayahuasca. I have some friends who’ve done both &amp; some who’ve done one or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s all pretty fascinating &amp; def on my bucket list. Based my my experiences with mushrooms, I feel like I’m in for a bit of a spiritual bitch-slap either way. 😂

       Good luck. I actually haven't had a chance to do ayahuasca, but smoked DMT I've done somewhere around 200 times, and it's the gift that keeps on giving. Start with low doses, perhaps.

       That's a term I've heard- rose pipes, I thought it was. They're ironically easier to get in semi-shady neighborhoods, like you said, than in Boulder where I am. That's alright, we have the internet now.

       We already know how these things get here, and why they do what they do. It's all molecules, it's Atoms. Protons, Neutrons and Electrons, and the sub-atomic particles. The interactions these have throughout space-time, their evolution so to speak.

       We're all part of the same system, and that system has some pretty damn interesting interactions with itself. It's not spiritual or magical, it's just the system we have.

       Lol, kind of. I don't think you've smoked DMT. You really, really should go for a DMT breakthrough someday. It's very much "spiritual and magical." Yes, atoms, protons, neutrons, electrons all exist and play a role in what's happening. That doesn't explain how or why people have these life-changing encounters with intelligent entities that teach us things on certain psychedelics, most notably DMT.

       Couldn't similar experiences be chalked up to similar brain chemistry between subjects? Similar to how most people who use cocaine experience increased heart rate.

       It's not just that the experiences have a lot of commonalities- people often encounter jaguars, Mayan imagery, and twisting snakes- it's the nature of the experiences, which involve reported alien contact and encountering intelligent entities. There's some really excellent literature on this subject that I recommend, starting with Graham Hancock's book "Supernatural: Meetings With the Ancient Teachers of Mankind." Hancock points out that these experiences don't seem to fit in our common understanding of evolution. How or why do they happen? Shamans have an answer. I think you have to spend some real time exploring with DMT (or salvia) to even begin to understand the significance of the phenomenon.

       No doubt one can experience imagery of pre-existing notions such as a jaguar, the human form, or recognizing a past civilization. I think the more interesting question is, would you see a jaguar if you had no concept of a jaguar?
      </p>
      <p>
       These have to confided to our previous notions of how things work. Such as the brain chemistry involved, otherwise you have to replace those concepts as well.

       I mean what if it just stimulates an area of the brain that is responsible for producing such feelings. The strong feelings of spirituality that can be achieved with religion, meditation, psychedelics, etc all share some similarities.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of makes it all suspect to me is that you can communicate the feelings and more abstract concepts of those experiences after the fact but if there is really another layer of hidden knowledge and meaning that can be unlocked then shouldn't there be a way to implement that into your life more concretely?

       You're right, those things are all similar. I personally meditate a lot. And I can tell you that you can get into these other realms even without dmt, including visually. It's been easy for me because of how much dmt I've just been fortunate to have access to, and also I don't drink alcohol, which Bill Hicks pointed out is like taking a black Sharpie to your third eye. It's all just a matter of practice, you can have dmt-like experiences without dmt, especially if you know where to look. Weed helps me a lot with it, edibles mostly.

       Yeah, I'd bet that many people wouldn't have these similar experiences if the ideas weren't communicated between the drug users. As someone who has done this drug many times, I haven't ever experienced a jaguar, Mayan imagery, twisting snakes, and whatever. I
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       felt like I came into contact with alien/other beings, a Hindu goddess, and a "machine elf", but that was

       after I had read about that stuff.

       You may see the jaguar but have no frame of reference or method of explaining it. That's the issue with a lot of psychedelic ventures. For example I had experienced seeing a strange text overlay on everything. I couldn't fully explain what it was but once I stumbled across Allyson Grey's paintings of

       . I experienced it before being aware that it was something that happens and got the reference to explain it afterwards.

       Maybe I'm wrong but didn't the government ban research on psychedelics because they found them to be mostly useless on their own? I know in the early to mid 1900's a lot of research was done into using LSD to cure alcoholism but the studies kept showing that LSD on its own did very little and that it was the combination with counseling that really created the results? Even the new research today only shows they as a tool in therapy and not some kind of take home prescription.

       I don't know where you're getting that about experiments taking place in the 90's on LSD. Most of the experiments were in the 1960's, and they showed that LSD had a ton of potential in curing alcoholism, enhancing creativity, relieving depression, etc. At the same time, the CIA and military experimented with LSD as a mind control agent, but it didn't really work out for them; check out the book "Acid Dreams" on that subject. Anyway, all psychedelics were banned because of hysteria due to the hippy movement fueling anti-war sentiment and creating a vast counter-culture that was blamed on psychedelics, not because psychedelics didn't show therapeutic promise. If you want to research the early studies, here's a resource:

       drugs outside of psychedelics are interesting because they are like dark magic, and have the potential to make you temporarily superhuman (i.e. no need for sleep/exhaustion, no pain) but at the same time can work to deeply enslave you as you become used to living under their effects for any period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       at that point your need for the substance creates pain when it isn't there, and the effects wane when you do get a fix. so it keeps you enslaved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive never heard of psychedelics acting in this manner. Other drugs do have the potential to be powerful tools in your life, but your also burning your life force away every time you take them and risking spiritual enslavement that is very difficult to escape from.

       Make sure the acid IS acid (how you do this can become complicated).
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice would be mushrooms - and if you can't positvely identify the correct ones, you should NEVER take them until you can.

       You never know what you get. You can go into those sort of trips and secretly want it to go 1 direction but you don't really have that much control. After all you wont be sober so you cant be 100% sure what mental state you will experience. Your depression could be a chemical  imbalance so maybe you can't "Cure" it but a different perspective could make sober you see life in a new way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't say its naive because people do report life changing experiences but there is also plently who just have a fun trip which is memorable but they come out the same person. Then there are people who have un diagnosed mental disorders which get brought out by taking a drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I know is the mushrooms are showing a lot of promise for depression. Acid is sorta like you're in a car and can control to some degree what you experience but shrooms is like being in a rollercoster, you're in for the ride.
      </p>
      <p>
       Important thing is to just mostly go with the flow. Either one can give you a different perspective and its possible you wont like what you see, maybe you're an asshole for example, you might not like finding that out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will be fine if you treat it like a learning experience, you're ready to do some deep soul work and face what ever the trip brings.

       Yes. As someone who broke out of their depression because of acid, I would say that things like Eckert Tolle, or other writers have helped me more.

       You don't need acid or drugs to do that. Ultimately, it's up to you. That's the lesson you'll learn- but acid just tends to spoon feed you it in a powerful and poignant way. Acid is a catalyst for greater change only if you're willing to accept and act upon what you already know needs to be done. I've had great trips when I had great intentions, but I've also felt like a crack head staring out my kitchen window at 5am because drunk me decided to dose myself after a night of drinking. I gave away my acid because I was too depressed to use it responsibly. It's been a year and a half since I did that, and I've learned how to live better in that time without the acid than I did when I was dosing myself to solve my problems. It takes a long time to absorb the "lessons", so don't let it stunt your growth because you're chasing an easy fix.

       Try Cannabidiol (CBD). Studies show it is the Great Moderator for neurochemicals. If your chemicals are too low (like in depression), it brings them up. If the chemicals are too high (like schizophrenia), they bring them down. There is plenty of CBD oil out there, just get some from a reputable seller.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half my family has mental illness so I'm very familiar with it. It's a real illness from real causes. How the chemicals get at the wrong levels I have no idea.

       It simply comes down to a matter of respect for it. If you don't prepare yourself appropriately and have no respect for the unique gift psychedelics can be, then you're more likely to have negative experiences.

       Actually not everyone was doing it. That's why there was and is so much repression and oppression for the use of psychedelics. It's still only a tiny minority using psychedelics, and even pot smokers are a minority of citizens in the US. The majority of non-psychedelic users range from greedy to indifferent to outright hostile to their use.

       Similarly coffee is accepted and encouraged because it helps people focus on mundane idiotic tasks at work. Of course, it used to be that people would gather at coffee houses and discuss critical political issues of the day.

       I mean work places encourage coffee because its lets you have more energy and grind through repetitive tasks. Society is fine with coffee for work and alcohol for when you get off. Alcohol will inhabit your frontal cortex, sure its fun but if you look at the grand picture it is weird that the cycle of coffee and alcohol is so widely accepted.

       There's plenty of drug combinations that can expand a person but the ones generally accepted are more focused to grinding out a work day then inhabiting your brain to relax at the end.

       I spread his quotes on a daily basis. Man was far beyond his time, really wanna work on making a booth with a bunch of headphones and speakers at EDM events sharing his thoughts. I agree with much of what he shared outside of the timewave zero stuff. Sad that he's so unknown to the general public.

       They (the mushrooms) talk to you. I've had the entire stoned ape theory "told" to me by the mushrooms before I ever knew who Terrence McKenna was. It's like a conglomeration of voices that are all speaking different words of full sentences. (Ten words in a sentence=10 different voices) Combine that with a dream like visualization of the story being told. (If you've seen Dr.Strange they do an amazing recreation of being this high)

       You lose connection with your physical body at high doses. Sometimes forgetting that you are a human. The dissatisfaction that comes with being back in the flesh is difficult to handle. I usually end up crying

       5 grams? How many average mushies is that? I've seen somebody do like 50+ best way I've seen them done is you go to a party of mature adults with tea frozen as ice cubes throw a couple in each persons drink, because every bodies buzzing you don't get the paranoid buzz as easily next thing entire party laughing and having the best time or dry and crush into antibiotic case for sales.

       Crick, co-discoverer of DNA, felt it statistically impossible for such a complex string of proteins to have been jumbled together by accident, a cosmic instant after the formation of the Earth. Like, as soon as Earth was ready to harbour life, life arose. He wrote a book saying that, in his opinion (i.e. the opinion of one of the discoverer's of the universal living molecule) it was statistically more probable that life itself came from extraterrestrial origins. He called the theory 'directed panspermia', because he thought aliens had bioengineered some kind of spore-like DNA-receptacle to cross the galaxy.

       "Living spores have been found and collected in every level of earth's atmosphere. Mushroom spores are electron-dense and can survive in the vacuum of space. Additionally, their outer layer is actually metallic and of a purple hue, which naturally allows the spore to deflect ultraviolet light."

       I think he got the initial ball rolling on the 2012 date being
       <em>
        significant
       </em>
       , but never actually claimed that the world would end. Others jumped on the 2012 date and made it about a doomsday. Additionally, he admitted that it was a purely speculative theory, not to be taken seriously. He would have been laughing at doomsday preppers and people selling their houses even harder than the actual skeptics.

       Yes. I honestly think we will look back and see 2012 as the dawn of the “digital age”, with everything before marked by the entrance of digital media into the mainstream consciousness, and everything after marked by the predominance of that digital consciousness

       Hey man, i get you. Of course the world ending in 2012 was ridiculous, but if people didnt think random things that dont really make sense, then we would never advance because nobody thinks anything. Most of modern science would seem like pipe dreams a couple of centuries ago.

       Wow. Reality would be so much more sinister and fucked if all these things were out in the open like common knowledge (but then there'd be a revolution). Right now it's like in the subconscious with everyone myself included too afraid to believe it's true. It's like "Nah...couldn't be....really?....holy fuck..."

       Don't feel bad,   I grew up around some of these families in Washington DC,  was 9 when JFK was offed.    You can guess how ancient I am right now,   and other than getting as far away from that shit as I could,   it has still taken my whole life to assimilate.   But as Lilly Tomlin said,   “No matter how cynical you get, it is impossible to keep up.”  because it keeps going lower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe its a bit like Invasion of the Body Snatchers kind of thing.   Or that great indie film They Live (1988) where the special sunglasses showed a different reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope to never meet a wild animal that is as fucked up.    In the meantime,  having a dog with me for the last 20-25 years has cheered me up a lot,   and the ordinary nastyness of life,  minus the extra level of nightmare level insanity by people who dream up Mutual Assured Destruction is almost endearing now.    Oh,  and one more thing,   Dr.  Strangelove.    When Stanley Kubrick was stuck,  the subject of total nuclear devastation was impossible for him to translate into the kind of art he understood,  (and you can see from other efforts that it has never really worked)   he added the twist of overthetop irony,  sarcasm,   and that is also an under rated element of what eventually ended the nightmare of the Soviet Union,  people just started making fun of it,  because the insanity actually is beyond expression.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live now through a time in the US like the end times of the Soviet Union.    The limits of big brained experts being able to fix things is long past.   A collective understanding is needed,  one that will surpass the pettiness of those who allow themselves to be carried forward by a mob and turned into what they have become.
      </p>

       Its tricky moving through denial.   Lots of us have spun out.   We are learning as we go.

       They don't control the narrative on the internet, unlike they have been on radio and tv since it's inception, so that's a BiG problem for them. That's why one of the tactics that's widely used now is misinformation, they throw so much stuff out there, so it's harder to pick apart the facts.

       Right, it's false tribalism.  Once you realize there are two types of people in this world it all seems to fall together.  There are those that want to be left alone, and there are those that just won't leave you alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that won't leave you alone tend to be the violent, self-righteous, and ignorant.  The others, for the most part, are peaceful, mindful, and accepting.

       Double think is really in play here, and it's sad.  Too many people have bought into the idea that freedom is slavery and slavery is freedom.

       Frightening isn't it how a civilization can lose its way in just over a hundred years.  The Founding Fathers sitting in Philadelphia weren't bothered with controlling a system or the way people thought; they wanted to allow individuals to be free to pursue happiness.  The government should not give a hoot whether people are sitting around talking or not.  They should be concerned only with ensuring that the individuals have the right to do so if they want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have now too many vested interests in the society we have built on money and credit, and those interests also have the power to ensure that thier interests stay protected.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose you could get into an argument with others who say the world is a nasty place and you need a strong army to maintain your interest and you cant afford that if everyones sat around smoking hash all day though.

       It's seemed obvious to me that the best way forward is a loosely affiliated proliferation of Utopias that people can self-sort into. The only unifying principal between which being the absolute guarantee to leave and go to another that better suites you, with as few barriers to this process and as much assistance as possible.

       And then the Utopia with the most guns and weapons decides that another utopia doesn't deserve the resources they have, and a war is started, and the cycle continues. There will be no true utopia until resources are unlimited, and that's not likely to ever happen because it's human nature to hoard and control.

       Bull, Atomically Precise Manufacturing guarantees the end of scarcity. When the best possible building material is carbon and our problem is we have too much of it, things look a lot better. No energy isn't the limiting factor because APM makes it trivially simple to make/capture/store as much as we need.

       Of course they want that. Good luck stopping it. It's like holding a river back with your hands. For a tiny example of this, look at how well the electric car is being repressed and marijuana is kept illegal.

       They had the power and resources to make countries worldwide lock tens, maybe even hundreds of millions of people in cages for smoking and selling a plant that makes you lethargic and hungry. And populaces and legislators just accepted this gross global injustice for decades for no other reason than "it's drugs".
      </p>
      <p>
       If marijuana is being legalized and the electric car is being properly developed, it's because they are allowing these things to happen because they've moved onto other methods of profit and control. They have the TPP and the non-neutral internet now. They can control every single piece of information the average person is exposed to. Why do you think the US is so divided at the moment - it's because the Oligarchs are manufacturing petty tribalism to keep them from uniting and becoming powerful.

       No, they can't. They want to, feverishly, but they can't. Control is slipping, and in their desperation to re-establish it they've shown their hand. The curtain is more scant and flimsy than it's ever been, and each move to tug it over an embarrassment only serves to expose more rot to the sunlight.

       Each individual's utopia would differ. I'd be highly surprised if you'd find any two individuals who enjoy the same things. Many people enjoy other people's suffering. In essence, the current landscape of media and always connected devices is the closest thing to a truly universally utopia system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think your idea is a bad one. I totally get it. But the actual execution is virtually impossible. Ultimately utopias can't work anyway because people will tune misery to the baseline their exposed to. When there is real suffering, there can be true light. In the absence of suffering, the bar gradually changes and utopia declines. It's why organized societies in general collapsed.

       I don't think so, human variation is vast but not infinite. Plus, we're deeply social creatures, so I find it impossible to believe that the ideal society for everyone is isolation. Maybe I should be saying utopia instead of Utopia; the idea is a network of societies designed explicitly from the ground-up maximize human flourishing, as defined by the participants. I'm not talking about making perfect the enemy of great, that's an obvious and easily-avoidable trap.

       And many people enjoy that others can take satisfaction through their suffering. Plus AI constructs and virtual reality. Plenty of room for all stripes, as long as it's voluntary.

       I think there are ways off the hedonic treadmill, and this would be one of the best ways to find them. Worth trying, anyhow. As we're clearly in a dystopia now.

       Well there are many theories out there; the usual Rothschild/Rockerfeller NWO infiltration of the upper reaches of Freemasonry etc.  I don't really know.  But I do know that Federalism won, and instead of being a federation of self-governing sovereign nation states, after the Civil War the USA felt its manifest destiny best suited by a strong centralised Federal government.

       you'd have to be a moron to believe this. the founding fathers wanted freedom for "individuals", sure. Those individuals were landed gentry. They were all about controlling a system to keep the common man down. Nothing has changed before or since then.

       Nah, the Founding Fathers wanted a fairly controlling government, controlled primarily by the rich. The Bill of Rights wouldn't even exist if it hadn't of been for the minority political party making a big fuss about personal and state rights.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The Senate was the favored house, as it allowed states with a small population of rich people to outvote the larger masses of poor people.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Electoral College could only have rich, white, male landowners on it, and there's never been a requirement for them to vote the way their state votes. The intention was, again, if a candidate who would be harmful to the rich is chosen by the poor people, the electoral college could just put the competitor in office, and thereby having a 'pet' president who would only help the rich.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The intent of the US government has always been to control what people think. Even our Bill of Rights isn't all that great. For example, the First Amendment actually only prevents the government from stopping you from speaking your mind. You can still be punished after. The government could throw you in jail for criticizing them; they just don't because it's bad PR. It's only now that the government has gotten bigger, and ensuring secrecy has gotten tougher, have people actually started noticing the ways in which our government actually manipulates us.

       They don't need drugs to sit around and talk, the point is that youre more likely to sit down and talk if you take drugs, because it's more likely that you will question why things are the way they are.. but im sure there is plenty of people sitting around and talking about society and it's structure without drugs. Drugs are just the facilitator.

       The post above me implys exactly that. And Yes it is worse in my opinion, the fact that people need drugs in order to think critically or discuss things critically is incredibly sad. I'm not here to hate on drugs they are fun and have there uses. But there is a reason the concept "sex drugs and rock and roll" includes drugs.

       I'm certainly speaking specifically to psychedelics, something you clearly have a very limited experience with. It's not that you can't learn things without them, but these are referred to as "plant teachers/ guides" for a reason.. Use them with care, and use them with respect as to the transformations they can achieve, and you have an extraordinary research tool. Know what you're using, decide just why you're using it, and you can have a rich experience. They're not addictive, and they're certainly not escapist, either, but they're exceptionally valuable tools for understanding the human mind, and how it works. Ecstasy/MDA for example was invented for therapy when invited and first used they refereed to it as a year of therapy in six hours. These substances are incredibly helpful to society and even people like Bill gates and Steve jobs both have stated that if it wasn't for LSD they would have never been the people they became. The fact that you think all drugs are used for the resource of fun and fun alone is telling me that you've barely dipped your toes into any of these topics / substances. If you have any other questions I'd love to continue the conversation. If not thanks for taking the time to read this alone &amp; I wish you a nice life! :)

       I've done psychedelics I guess not enough to have the kind of  breakthrough you are talking about. I mean they certainly have some benefit. But I feel like focus and meditation can replace anything psychedelics can produce.

       I also understand your point of view on the topic, I once thought similar until I had a near death experience and a natural DMT trip (the doctor told me this happens as a last stitch effort of the brain; but he left out the part about it originating from the pineal gland..)

       I’m currently taking a class called Addictive Disease Concepts.  The textbook states that the illegalization of drugs began on three premises: toxicity, correlation with criminal behavior, and dependence.  The text also goes into how, although all three of these concerns are somewhat valid, they were also somewhat misguided.  Not enough was known at the time regarding how best to go about any of.  Making drugs illegal was supposed to take the problem away.  Instead, it created a whole host of other problems.  Over two centuries later, we are able to have a more clear picture of what’s going on.  The fact that new drugs are being invented all the time, and there will always be more research necessary in order to understand it better means that society will have to constantly adapt and change to new information and regulation.  It’s such a can of worms, and so much money is involved that it’s not likely we will see our society do what’s truly in the “best” interests of people, at least not in my lifetime anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of what I “know” about drugs and addiction is based on my personal experiences with both.  I’ve done a LOT of drugs in my life.  I’ve also been through and witnessed a LOT of addiction and all of the garbage that goes along with it.  Regardless of what I end up learning in this textbook look at the subject of drugs, I know one thing is for certain.  I have nothing but POSITIVE things to say about my experiences with psilocybin, DMT, and cannabis.  All three have contributed to some of the most beautiful thoughts I’ve ever had.

       I don’t think it’s sad at all.  Nor did I say that drugs were the source of ALL of my beautiful thoughts.  I said some.  Further, I experienced these thoughts when I was in my late teens, early twenties, before I had really experienced much “real” adult life.

       These psychedelic experiences helped pull me out of deep moments of depression.  They lifted the fog enough so that I was able to see my life in a more honest way.  Once the drugs wore off, those positive, beautiful thoughts and perspectives didn’t just go away.  They lasted, and continue to last.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you that the birth of my children, and the first time I fell in love, and the moments where I got to experience lovely bits of life and nature with my family are THE most beautiful moments.  However, the psychedelic experiences allowed me to have another layer within those sober moments.  I was able to feel the sacred nature of each of our souls participating in the moment as individuals, and as a pair or a group.  I was able to stop and look more closely at the things around me, and realize just how much beauty goes unnoticed when we are in a hurry.

       Sorry, I don’t normally do this on Reddit...but your take on what I said is so far off base, that I’m gonna go ahead and tell you to shove it.  You really have no idea what you’re talking about.

       I've come to accept what it was. For a long while it was for worse. Caused psychosis in college. I'm good now tho. I think if I had other psychedleic trips before it it would have been easier.

       I totally agree, but the spirit molecule is essentially just a bunch of weirdo's blabbering... it's like there was no point to anything they were saying. Awful documentary for how nuts of a subject DMT is IMO.

       Sadly I havnt had the opportunity to try DMT and likely never will as there is not a huge market here for it in NZ, but out of mushrooms, acid, and a few other drugs I have experimented with the high percentage Mexican tripping weed has given me the most unbelievable 7-20 minute trips, I only bring it up cause I can't explain it properly but one of them all I can explain towards the trip was everybody in the world was everything holding each other up in lines hands to back and on top of each other and I could see many people I knews faces and out of the blue I fell and everybody feel cause of me it was way more intense and unexplainable but that was the base of one of my trip, another was seeing everybody I knews faces everywhere in front of me and trying to talk to them I can't remember what they did or said really but I was fkt each time I've come out of a trip I am told I was doing something or acting in a way that was way different to wat I was experiencing and it looked like everybody else just took a trip buzzing out at me .. Twas beautiful the most intense hallucination next to DMT I could imagine.

       Read the book, written by Dr. Strassman himself. I've exchanged emails with him, and he said that he was slightly disappointed with how the video documentary came out. His book is much more detailed in the accounts of the DMT participants and his own feelings about it. By the by, he wrote a follow up, called DMT: The Soul of Prophecy, and now is completely fascinated by it. He is studying religious history and the role that DMT played in direct communications with the divine.

       I believe that with the advent of acid, we discovered a new way to think, and it has to do with piecing together new thoughts in your mind. Why is it that people think it’s so evil? What is it about it that scares people so deeply, even the guy that invented it, what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they’re afraid that there’s more to reality than they have confronted. That there are doors that they’re afraid to go in, and they don’t want us to go in there either, because if we go in we might learn something that they don’t know. And that makes us a little out of their control. – Quoted in the BBC documentary, ‘The Beyond Within: The Rise and Fall of LSD,’ 1987

       Terrence was right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've taken tons of mushrooms, ayahuasca, san pedro, kambo (not really a psychedelic), smoked DMT and salvia, some of it at heroic doses. I can say that the truth of the extent of our enslavement is a recurring theme.
      </p>
      <p>
       These substances allow us to shed layers upon layers of social and cultural conditioning, and for me, when I take them, it feels like waking up from a dream, into a state of much greater lucidity than what I normally experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've encountered beings who gave me teachings, saw aeons coalesce into a single instant, even saw a few weird glowing globes in the sky post Ayahuasca at one point. My gf just rolled her eyes at me when I pointed it out. I guess she couldn't see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I feel psychedelics are instrumental to breaking the many chains that hold us down as humans and divine beings. They hold the capacity to connect us to our truth, to universal truth, to pure being without the illusion of subject, object, and sequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think anyone who seriously wants to change this world would do well to find qualified shamans, who are in my experience some of the most positively revolutionary individuals in our world today, and go through the grueling, blissful, ugly, and beautiful process of breaking down deeply ingrained cultural dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world may be fucked, and it's not going to last. You, me, all beings, however, are stuck with having a mind, with having experience. What we do with it is up to us, and few states are as ripe with potential for change and evolution as the human form.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wisdom, compassion, and the tools that uncover those intrinsic qualities, is what is going to emancipate humans everywhere.

       Do you still believe in things like ancient history, or that people really die or get hurt at things like the Boston Bombings?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, then I would say you need to do more drugs. Or, much, much less drugs.

       We are talking about the undoing of cultural conditioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the drugs really work in the way claimed, then one would think that the cultural conditioning to believe 'the news' would be one of the first things the drugs would help a person to see through.

       No, it's not magic, it still takes time and learning.  I think it helps people recognize archetypes more, but you still have to THINK.  Ancient history isn't all fake, and "the news" isn't completely phony either.

       anything, and you'll try to ridicule me either way.  How about that the Revolutionary War was a complete sham, or that Napoleon's plan to invade the U.S. worked?  Why was Hitler so interested in "ancient" history?

       Good or bad depending why your taking them, who your around, were you are etc.  Keeping it illegal makes it more likely people will get a negative buzz out of paranoia and be doing it around criminals etc. It could be embraced and used positively if legalised I personally believe

       I realized that while I was high myself back when I smoked. I saw everything from like 30 other angles after sitting by myself and thinking about things...and my brain MADE ME think honestly about it and with some type of “ultra-empathy” that allowed me to
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       what I was thinking about from each of those angles to truly understand it. Hell, my biggest problem was forgetting those feelings after a few hours or days and losing my connection to the thoughts they were tied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed fucked me up in a weird way, though. I saw
       <em>
        through
       </em>
       everything. I started to find “trying” harder and progressively more pointless. Ultimately, I decided to quit, take what I learned, and try to fit it into a normal life.

       What you say about weed seems to be a base effect of it, people who smoke weed are more likely to care about being happy now not to worried about the future, I smoke weed, I believe this due to things I've seen.. Miserable old folks working their entire lives and the only enjoy work now cause its all they've ever done, they can't enjoy the little things anymore and die with all this cash they could have used to live a happier life.. A big example was that mentally I'll grandma that tried to treat her grandsons? Leg herself because she stringed out, he lost his leg, soon she passed and he inherited 90 million.. That's an illness people enjoy today and tomorrow don't wait to die or until your so addicted to work you can't enjoy anything else

       Sure, but like there is much more evidence that such drugs are killing people (see the video of the guy on Reddit earlierv this week jumping out of a moving SUV) than evidence of people on such drugs actually identifying and changing key constructs in the world we live in.

       The world as you know it was basically shaped by psychedelics, everything from the phone in your pocket to to the music you listen too. Psychedelics aren't dangerous in the slightest when treated with respect.

       These structures exist for a reason.  Not all minds can deal with the extreme elements involved in psychedelics.  I am a strong believer in these medicines being used to help people with depression or PTSD, but they can't help everybody, under poor supervision they might actually hurt you a great deal.  For instance how you deal with a trip where you go to hell instead of heaven could be a profoundly destructive experience to your psyche.

       Not the reasons you think they do. I truly do think they can help everyone. So can alcohol or anti-depressant but both are legal and far more dangerous than the natural occurring psychedelics. &amp; most "bad" or scary trips are actually the one you learn from the most. Under poor supervision or under education a car can kill. That doesn't mean all people can't benefit from cars if taught how to properly use them. &amp; if we had them legalized more people would be educated on how to use them safely. Psychedelics have only been illegal for a very short period of time in human history, they've been used in almost every culture of the past and have greatly benefited almost every aspect of culture as we know it today.

       The issue is with a single dose you can trip, and that trip may be profoundly bad, way worse than drinking too much alcohol.  You may throw up or get sick from alcohol, but it doesn't profoundly change your mind.  Shamans typically used such substances in ancient cultures, but I'm doubting whether the entire population used them.  If you have any source material stating otherwise I'd consider it.  This sort of experience is not for the weak of mind.

       Then do 1/3 of a dose.. Depends on the substance, micro-dosing mushrooms for example makes them into performance enhancers people use them for MMA training, hell micro dosing is huge in the coding world right now for that reason alone and its extremely extremely rare that these substances will ever have a lasting effect on the mind. We have receptors for these substances for a reason, and DMT the king of all psychedelics is already found within the brain. Shamans over watched people using them not just used them alone. I'm camping right now, but I know certain native american tribes used psychedelics as a coming to age, meaning every adult male and many of the females took them. Again these substances for what they do, are incredibly safe. Especially at micro doses, the most dangerous thing about them is getting caught with them, no reason for them not to be legal, and far far far from being dangerous.

       I don't have a problem with microdosing, I am a strong believer in the power of this substances, but they must be respected.  And too often I know ignorant people don't respect these things before they use them in higher quantities.  The issue of a shaman is an important distinction, it means ancient people realized you needed a guide on your spiritual journey to the edges of consciousness and back again.  If it were legal then there would be specialized places for people to go to be properly supervised and counciled afterwards.

       Have you experienced any of these "revealing" sensations yourself, or are you coming from a more literalist framework? Some of us happen to believe, to know in our bones even, that the divine is real.

       Anybody with basic understanding of neuroscience will tell you that those sensations come from excess level of Dopamine, Serotonin and Oxytocin in the brain. Or other biochemical alterations the drug induces.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clearly not some spirits contacting you. Even if that's what the experience shows you directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I propose not some hard sealed atheistic belief that that stuff isn't real. I propose an omnistic belief that perhaps that spiritual stuff some people experience is just one way of explaining it. A scientific perspective is simply another way of explaining it.

       One, the "they" that is in the phrase, "what they don't want you to see", is the powers and principalities of the world, and not any one specific person, group, or interest.

      <p>
       It's probably better described as the Gestalt unconscious thought of the world.

       And two, if you have the opportunity to look at yourself from A New Perspective and see that you might possibly be doing things in a way that isn't best aligned towards your own interest as a being, why would you be against that?

       Marijuana is more of making your brain more malleable. I believe that's exactly why ordinary everyday things turn amazing, because you become a child experiencing it for the first time.

       If you go to church high every Sunday, then you are probably more likely to have an even stronger faith in God.

       If you get high and immerse yourself in society and mainstream culture, then that becomes life and reality.

       The thing is, weed is good for occasional use and if you have a stable state of mind. It becomes problematic when you smoke that shit everyday.

       And like you, I have woke stoner friends and also know "sheep" who think John Oliver is a good news source talk about how weed will save humanity or some nonsense like that.

       That's pretty close minded to say if it didn't work for me and my friends it doesn't work at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyways, usually when I'm stoned I think about things (obviously) which, sometimes, includes my job and I come up with solutions to certain bugs that I know I wouldn't have come up with sober. I say that because I've smoked enough to notice a difference in thinking high v sober.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not bad if you're more "dumb" while high lol I'd say the majority of the time I feel dumb while high. It's honestly what was described above as "thinking outside of the box". But it ultimately goes back to being different for everyone. If you're "dumber" while high (I don't like using that because it sounds derogatory), then embrace it. It's just what happens to you. No need to be weird about it bro lmao

       it's not closed minded at all, its similar to how scientist conduct experiments, by observation . i used to live in the hood in NY where all people do is smoke TONS of weed. And let me tell you something boy , none of them made anything out of their lives till they decided to stop smoking. INFACT most of them know its a problem its why they always say "NA i quit bro" they'll last like a few days to maximum a month and go back to it.

       I gave you clear replies earlier that weren't that hard to comprehend. If you're having issues with that, that's on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're saying is that you witnessed a group of people not do shit with their lives after smoking weed therefore weed makes you dumb (to put it simply). Take that to anyone who has completed a high school education and they will immediately point the flaws in that argument. The one thing you're [supposed to be] taught is that personal exprience means jack shit when arguing.
      </p>
      <p>
       "My friends and I easily passed highschool so that means everyone should easily pass highschool" That's true with your logic. I would love for you to tell me with full sincerity that you agree with that logic.

       WRONG,  its not only different for everyone , its also useless for everyone and society other than recreational. You want to think
       <del>
        outside the box?
       </del>
       outside your realm and see how irrelevant weed is? try DMT you'll only need to break through once in your entire life and never need it again and will be a better person from it for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the person not getting it is you, you said you solved a problem here and there and now weed is incredible meanwhile most hoods in america use weed , then move onto something stronger i am not just talking about my inner circle.

       Because there is  no such thing that will make you smarter. A drug isn't going to make you gain knowlege but a drug can make you lose memory (dumber).

       You don't need to alter your mind with mushrooms or synthetic poisons. Meditate, eat well, reflect, spend time in nature, read. Expand your mind and you will see past all the bullshit. You don't need drugs.

       This.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alan Watts once said regarding psychedelics, when we get the message, hang up the phone. And I believe the message comes in a variety of different forms but it all involves becoming more present and active in our current realities. That is to say, if you are using psychedelics to escape your life, you are doing it wrong. The point is to take the message of unity and interconnectedness of a psychedelic trip and implement it in our actual lives, bettering ourselves, our relationships, and hopefully the community at large. Psychedelics should be used to bring you closer to reality not farther away from it.

       There's no dichotomy here. You don't need anything at all, you're already perfect. Yet, technology such as meditation, knowledge of nutrition, as well as psychoactive plants exist, and in many cases they maybe be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, you don't need them. All you need is to sit down and watch the mind, but for those of us who find that hard to do, psychedelics present an effective path to transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychedelics aren't necessary, but they're not necessarily an obstacle either. I would generally recommend sticking to the natural kind though.

       Psychedelics are like taking a flight over the path up the mountain. You can see all the twists, turns and even the destination. However they are no replacement for walking those trails for yourself.

       I really think that you should try mushrooms before associating them with synthetic poisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I don’t see why they can’t be considered a tool. Just like meditation and eating well, it will help you see the bigger picture.

       I'd like to think I see the bigger picture already. IMO, what people experience while under the influence of a mind altering substance are simply hallucinations. Different hallucinations for different people, depending on their mental health and capacity, and their surroundings and personal beliefs. End of the day they are just hallucinations.

       Personally I view them as a way of interacting with my subconscious. Is it really my subconscious or just hallucinations? I have no idea, however it has been beneficial for me.

       There are multiple paths to achieve expanded consciousness. Whether it be through meditation or psychedelics or both, I say go for it. Glad you have found a way that works for you.

       They’re not poisons, you ass, they’re medicine. They help facilitate mind expansion and healing for those who don’t have a grasp of the tools or time to meditate like a pro or immediate transform their life into an image of perfect health. You should try them, maybe it would help you be a little less condescending.

       With no question, they will strip you down of all mental barriers hoisted up and enforced by society.  The veil will be lifted and there is no going back.  Not that it's a bad thing, but can cause a great ordeal of stress attempting to readjust to whatever the fuck it is we have been conditioned to deem normal.

       Alan Watts once said regarding psychedelics, when we get the message, hang up the phone. And I believe the message comes in a variety of different forms but it all involves becoming more present and active in our current realities. That is to say, if you are using psychedelics to escape your life, you are doing it wrong. The point is to take the message of unity and interconnectedness of a psychedelic trip and implement it in our actual lives, bettering ourselves, our relationships, and hopefully the community at large. Psychedelics should be used to bring you closer to reality not farther away from it.

       This is by far the best way I've seen it put. That's what it's all about, man, what can you do RIGHT NOW to improve your life? Acid puts the idea in your mind, but if you don't try to incorporate into your life, it's essentially a waste.

       This so much. I personally experienced this off of cid, my veil was lifted about a year ago after I did 2 micro(before the most I had done was 6 regular). It has been EXTREMELY stressful haha. I wouldnt change anything though. Most of the the mental barriers were lifted and it was such a shock im still not sure if it made me insane. Life is so different now.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I will say ive sworn off nonorganic drugs. LSD is a powerful tool, I experienced its power and im scared to see what's further down the rabbit hole. So ima try some magic mushrooms and see how it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess im trying to say you gotta be careful, because I didnt expect any of what happened, and I feel like I almost didnt make it back.

       I can very much confirm this. For the last 2 to 3 years I've been taking a bunch of psychedelics up until recently. Some of the things that your Consciousness shows you wont always be fun and can give you a great deal of PTSD and anxiety, and in extreme cases put you in a state of psychosis.

       I’ve always had a hard time mentally but I have been too proud to get something done about it. It’s like a war going on in my mind. I knew I wasn’t about to get on anti depressants cause they would just numb me. Talking to people about my problems wasn’t really an option in my mind. I’ve get that the problems I deal with are my own, and getting other people involved is a waste of time, as everyone has their own issues. I started vaping thc about a month ago after not having any thc in my system for a couple years. At first I was just using it to help fall asleep (only using indica) Now I’m using a hybrid of Sativa and Indica and I’m the happiest I’ve been in 13 years. I feel motivated and I’m starting to spend time with people again. It’s amazing what it can do. These “drugs” still have a bad stigma attached to them from when we used to devilize them. However, living in Colorado, that tide is seriously changing. I think anything done in excess can be a bad thing. But if you moderate yourself, it can be an amazing tool.

       This is another reason its illegal. When it was harder to get I used to smoke way too much of whatever was available. Now its a known dose of specific oils in a vape pen. Puff here or there througout the day and I am good. Maybe a little number or 20mg edible a couple hours before bed and my life is very enriched.
      </p>
      <p>
       Colorado is just such a shining example of how bad this needs to be legal. It is painful to think of all the lives ruined over this still. Anyone against it at this point is a criminal. There is too much knowledge available to claim ignorance of why it is actually legal.

       My girlfriend and I did a large amount of psychedelics when we first met. Started with LSD and eventually stopped at Ayahuasca. I can confirm that it does just that. LSD and mushrooms opened us up, my girlfriend ended up quitting the military, and I moved away from the southern part of the US. When we finally ended up doing Ayahuasca, that was the end of it. I won't go into what happened afterwards or what I experienced, but I do believe people who are looking for something higher than themselves often look for that in psychedelics. We finally ended up finding that after Ayahuasca. That stuff is seriously not of this world. At least the experience.

       Man, I'll try my best. I did a two night session at a place in Florida called soul quest. The first night it made me deal with a bunch of stuff from childhood and some emotional problems I never dealt with from the start of me taking psychedelics. I had some really bad anxiety, I literally thought I was dying. I projectile vomited, out of both ends, lol. Then after purging I immediately felt my anxiety go away and felt this very non human presence starting to surround me...or hang out with me...or something along those lines. It started describing to me what was going on in my head and why the things had happened to me in the current life I had chosen. It showed me that we were all tiny drops of a gigantic pool of consciousness that we mistake for god. I had very intense visuals when I closed my eyes. I kept seeing a giant face that was vibrating different florescent colors. And hovering in this void of vibrating particles. And that's when it get hard to explain. I started seeing a mixture of mental pictures and a internal voice speaking to me. Towards the end of the trip for the first night I heard in my head tell me that we would be working on more the next night.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the next night, I went into it with a lot less anxiety. I didn't throw up or have stomach problems. The Ayahuasca was much more gentle. It didn't talk to me as much, but the visuals were very intense. I noticed that anything I thought was met by a deep philosophical explanation. But I noticed that any time I asked a very serious question, like what happens after I die, it would tell me that now was not the time. So more or less, it made me deal with what I could actually handle and digest for my first session. But later showed me that the next time I decided to do Ayahuasca that we would be going much deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about Ayahuasca is that what happens to you doesn't immediately digest. More or less, the following weeks and months turn into "ah ha" moments. I realized that the entire time I was speaking to my subconscious almost the entire time. Aya brought me to a place where I could communicate with my deeper self, and I realized at that moment that we were all tiny bits of God/consciousness. And that's when I realized I had found what I needed the entire time I was doing psychedelics. I had found who I truly was and I didn't need anything like that anymore. I would like to do Ayahuasca again, because I would like to get to a point where I'm finding even more out than I ever thought I could, if that's possible. But my girlfriend and I have since stopped doing all of that. We don't even smoke weed anymore. Minus the occasional glass of wine, we dig just being ourselves and experiencing life with one another.

       How can our sub conscious selfs have so much knowledge that we dont?
       <br/>
       Why did you and your girlfriend quit?
       <br/>
       Can I find the way without the aid of psychedelics? I feel too overwhelmed and weed has helped me the very few times I have done it.

       What does it mean that we are tiny droplets of consciousness, could help me understand?

       Well, I will describe it as best I can with what I could piece together. The giant pool of Consciousness is where all of life is getting it's consciousness from. And if that the is the case, then all intelligent thought comes from that same consciousness and I think that is what alot of people semi witness in moments of intense emotion or passion and mistake for god. And if our subconscious comes from that place that every existing being will end up going back to and adding it's experience to that collective consciousness, then I would say that our subconscious is connected to a great intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me and my girlfriend quit doing everything because it became too intense. One hit of LSD was doing what 4 hits of LSD would do, two years after heavy dosing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I would think that clean eating and practicing deep meditation seems to do it for the majority of people who are dedicated. Some people just don't have the patience to do that and dedicate their time to it, much like my girlfriend and I lol. So psychedelics seem to be a jump start for people. Just read the book "be here now", a guru said kind of the same thing. Weed just gives me crazy amounts of anxiety now, where it use to be very beneficial for me. That part I haven't been able to figure out.

       Another perspective is that societies depend upon stability and convention to operate :   rapid and out of control change is hard to manage and interrupts the normal flow.    This is a problem because they tend to postpone necessary adaptation,   and they also can tend to punish,  strangle,  or delay innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any creative process becomes difficult,   and certain substances also have other side effects that are prone to abuse by charlatans or when people are in a state of despair.    Repression goes beyond mere conservative tendencies and becomes psychopathic control,  domination,  and exploitation.    Elites are going to want to use these substances for their own means to either exploit,   or to push demand to products they can exploit,   for example the pharmaceutical industry that is fine with drugs as long as they are granted the monopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR:   Fear.   Greed.   Evil psychopathic fucks.

       They take down social barriers and give light to what's really there. Everyone's too concerned about trends and how they look and the judgement of others and psychedelics take away that judgement so you now don't care about other people. It also comes at a cost, everyone will look at you differently and think they are smarter than you because you don't seem to care about the stupid shit they care about. This should be on r/trees lls

       I would spend a month or two researching DMT itself before you take it. If you have never done any psychedelics before, don’t touch it. And know that there is nothing you can do to prepare yourself for what is about to hit you except to open your mind and body to the impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people choose to smoke DMT in its crystal form. It might seem pretty degenerate smoking from a “meth pipe”, but that’s honestly the most effective way to ingest it. Effects can last 3 hours or more when orally ingested along with an MAOI, such as an ayahuasca brew, but that’s a whole nother story. Clear your entire day, despite the 15-30 minute duration, have someone who has experience in psychedelics tripsitting you for the entire duration (as you might go “unconscious” and they’ll be monitoring your breathing), and DOSE CORRECTLY. Your trip may vary from a heavy body-load with intense visuals and otherworldly thoughts to a full-blown trancelike state where you completely lose consciousness and separate from your own reality. While in this trance you might use languages that don’t exist in this plane to speak with formless beings, in a body and consciousness that isn’t your own. You’ll feel like you’re being ripped from your own mind and thrown into a universe that you don’t understand whatsoever. I keep using “you” as a reference point but that’s irrelevant because all sense of self stops existing when you’ve “broken through”. Time? Some say it feels like only a few seconds while others say it lasts a millennia. You’ll be abruptly thrown back into your body by the end of it, questioning where you are and what the fuck just happened. You might remember just a fragment of your bright and confusing adventure, or have vivid recollections of that unintelligible “conversation” you had with Lord D’rr’thrax of nether realm 16.

       I don't like the "natural substance" arguments. Cannabinoids, psilocybin, amygdalin (cyanide precursor), mycotoxins, all occur naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your argument for wanting shrooms to be legal is because it's naturally-occuring, you're also making the argument that your neighbor should be allowed to propagate black mold freely in the adjacent apartment unit, or grow poison ivy in his back yard just to burn and fill the neighborhood with irritating smoke.

       I smoked for the first time a few years ago and I have dramatically reshaped my worldview. I was always a staunch republican. Since then, I've realized how much we are misled to believe a story we are being told. That shift in perspective has led me on an enlightening journey. I really feel I've grown as a person and feel like I can see truth more clearly.

       I believe you are wrong. If it would really brake the mental barriers there is NO way that it would be legalized in certain states. What is actually happening is that they are trying to purposefully normalize it. There is no real vote, democracy doesn’t exist. The elites will do whatever they want, just look at the situation with net neutrality. If they want to legalize something, they will. They want to legalize the use of marijuana because it disperses you from God. It’s one of the pathways to demonic possession, this is said by a satanist, not me.

       Marijuana is illegal because hemp competed with the cotton industry way back when, and people who smoked it were often associated with people who protested against war. Marijuana actually competes with many industries and there has always been a strong desire among industry titans to keep this plant illegal for that reason, economics.
      </p>

       As for psychedelics, I imagine lots of people have been hurt using them and instead of teaching people how to do things safely, we'd rather practice abstinence only education and law.

       That's one reason but it's not the only one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are others:
       <br/>
       1) Pot and psychedelics threaten profits for alcohol, tobacco, big pharma and many other industries.  So they fight like hell to keep them illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) They provide an avenue for populating private, corporate prisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) They prevent an income source for "off the books" funding for many black ops programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) They provide an avenue/reasoning for militarizing the police forces around the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       and many other reasons.

       If you ever experience the decline of someone you know due to an addiction you might have a different opinion. Marijuana should not be considered in the same context as opioids and synthetic drugs. But had drugs destroy lives. Good people become monsters. They severely damage their families and communities.

       I do want to try micro dosing. And educational aids. But I'm not going to risk my job for it. I think it should be legal but I don't think there is some explanation beyond a heavy handed response to drug abuse.

       I tripped last night on some shroom tea. I love the deep thoughts and the mental gymnastics. I felt like I could see into the other side and we interact like oil and water. I felt like I was thinking on a higher level, which with the number of connections your brain makes while high on psilocybin maybe I was.

       no, the truth is mostly just compounded fear and ignorance. i doubt anyone in power realizes the true potential of what they do, because if they did, they'd be fully in support of mass enlightenment.

       Absolutely. Experiences I had years ago on LSD, and even more so from mushrooms, had a profound, life-long effect on my worldview. It gives you a peek at some kind of mysterious "other side" of life. I actually felt connected to everything/everyone, plugged into whatever this thing called existence is, and it made me a spiritual person, where before I was pretty much your typical materialist-minded, hard-line, angry young atheist who dismissed anything "mystical" or not espoused by mainstream science. And it's hard to talk about it without spouting tired cliches, but it really was like having blinders removed and seeing how completely batshit off-the-rails insane our entire culture is. It's obvious they don't want those kinds of paradigm-shattering shifts in perception to be widespread among the populace. It's without a doubt a massive threat to the status-quo of imperialist late capitalism.

       yes, mushrooms break down the socially programmed part of your brain
      </p>
      <p>
       weed makes it easier to develop inner dialogues, conducive to understanding narratives that run counter to the mainstream

       That's wrong. It's stupid drugtalk assigning too much power to substances and attaching too much truth to your own thoughts.

       You can learn about yourself on psychs. You don't get to discover new great truths without new information. A substance alone can't do that regardless of the effects.

       Quick question, as a contrast to your opinion, how many different possible combinations of Legos are there in a box of Legos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is a box of Legos that is only designed to build a spaceship only capable of being made into a spaceship?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have to add additional pieces of Legos to the box of Legos in order to make the Legos into a different shape?

       And if, a different shape is capable of being made out of the Legos that are currently in the Box only designed to be made into a spaceship, is the new shape of no value whatsoever?

       I liked your metaphor and I like legos. My answer is that you can make lots of other things with the given bricks. Nothing larger though. Is rearranging the same collection of things giving you anything truly new?

       I don't know many people who use psychs and those that I do know don't claim to have it all figured out, so I can't comment on that, but I do believe that many people need therapy and can't or won't pay for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those people, when, in the right mindset they use cognitive behavioral self therapy to analyze their own actions and outlooks they can help resolve many issues that would have taken years of paying someone else to help them with.

       Cbt sounds interesting, didn't know that is a thing. Glad psych use has worked out for you. My personal experience with psychedelics is inconclusive so far. The pros and cons have been sort of a wash for me, but I have enjoyed the research!

       Ive always been taught the mind is what connects the body to the soul and that creates life. Unhealthy thoughts can turn into depression, suicidal tendencies, and premeditated harm.
      </p>

       Your brain is like a computer always processing everything and storing memory. The system we live in doesn’t work for us it works against us, and makes us overheat causing us too slow down.

       It's maybe true for psychedelics, but marihuana it isnt in the same category. Pot makes you confortable. I can go and argue that in any case, POT makes you cool with things and not able to act on your ideals.
I am a addicted stoner trying to leave marihuana, and you can go and take a look at r/leaves the experiences of the addictive pot users... nobody will talk about liberation or open mental barriers, ironically, they talk just the opposite.

       Hmm, i think that's part of the mystic of drugs in music or art, mostly. People love to buy the
       <em>
        ideal
       </em>
       of a alternative doped mind that comes to show us the truth or the beauty in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never heard that from marihuana (well maybe with some reagge bands), but did heard and see the role of cocaine has in musicians and bands. I think this is part of entertainment industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, artists tend to be weak to addictions, and are much much more exposed to drug dealers and shitty entertainment sellers (like managers who buy booze and bring whores to the camarin)

       Absolutely. I'd heard this quote or similar long before I ever dabbled in any psychoactive substance. Then once I did, it became immediately apparent. I also believe that's why alcohol is the most readily available and commonly used drug. As a drug, alcohol sucks. It's a fairly strong CNS depressant but is very disorienting at large doses, is very unsafe, addictive, difficult to take at times, etc. But alcohol calms and depresses. You are in a more suggestive state. You are more willing to accept bullshit.

       this is not to be taken seriously, but once when I was high I had the thought that weed was the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" from the genesis story in the Bible. Also on a more serious note, pretty sure the Sumerians and their "gods" who were the fallen angels gave us the knowledge to get high on various things.

       I've done a shit ton of psychedelics and every time I do it I have new revelations. It helps me think, I listen to music differently. I hear the waves and see the beat. One of the most interesting thoughts I have during a trip is how interesting life is, why we are here, how did we get here? Every time I'm high I can't help but think life is just a simulation and none of this shit really matters. It helps me live my best life. I may not have a lot but I do have what I need &amp; for that I'm thankful.

       You're right of course.  But this isn't a theory, it's history.
      </p>
      <p>
       When one of the MK ULTRA sub projects went south, and the use of naturally occurring substances for the purposes of better handling of sensitive material were shown to have a stronger effect in the opposite direction, at first they were just defunded in favor of more easily controllable implant technologies pioneered by DelGado.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, once LSD in particular escaped the lab, all bets were off.  That single molecule in the right circumstances could undo psychological conditioning that it takes years of training and reinforcement to inculcate in test subjects such as armed forces personnel and agents from various agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the company at the time loved to fuck with Hoover's boys in the experimental stages, ruining more tgan a few careers in the process, the Marines and Army also supplied subjects as did hospitals in the US and Canada along with certain universities.   However a few doctors had some rather-unusual experiences.  They banded together loosely to promote societal change through the use if these substances.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Pandora's box opened and upper and upper middle class white kids suddenly started seeing the "system" for what it was it began to degrade the very foundations of the social order.  Revolution was in the air.  Panicked messages flew at a glacial pace through the bureaucracy as the "system" worked overtime to reel in this one little molecule.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took criminalization and a shit ton of psy ops to finally put the lid back on.  Once the "hippie" problem was dealt with (with cocaine, heroin and meth networks, Mockingbird style disinformation dissemination and political maneuvers) the "system" could go back to focusing on undoing Roosevelt's programs and continue siphoning off the wealth of the nation through the military industrial machine.

       Good thinking OP. I think other reasons are that they compete with the liquor and pharma cartels (this one is obvious). Also, the private prison cartel depends on immoral drug laws to fill up and maximize profit. In addition, it conflicts with the push to starve government to justify privatizing everything. Look at all the new tax money they now have in Colorado thanks to legal weed, which is being used to improve government services. This is the opposite of what the neo-cons want.
      </p>
      <p>
       For sure though, all of the stated reasons are bullshit cover stories.

       When I started smoking marijuana, I had already begun looking deeper into the hidden world. What I noticed was when I would smoke and think or talk through whatever I was trying to figure out, the 'Aha' moment would come on faster. What would take me days or a really clear spell to figure out would just slot into place and it all became a clear picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course, they dissapear fast and once you're sober or at least not at the peak of the high the pieces would fall back apart and I'd forget what I actually figured out. To combat this, arm yourself with a notepad haha. This brings to mind when I was looking into Scientology, more specifically the 'engram clearing' rituals they perform. They describe the engrams as painful/traumatic stored past events, or scars in the mind that create a cycle and bring you back to your lower/stuck self when they're activated. This can hinder people for life without knowing that they are stuck in negative feedback loops. There are many other researchers coining their own terms for these "block/engrams/loops" that are all eerily similar with a name change, but this was the main one I was looking into. Makes a great Wiki read hunt.
      </p>

       Engram 
“a definite and permanent trace left by a stimulus on the protoplasm of a tissue. It is considered a unit group of stimuli impinged solely on the cellular being.”
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think taking psychedelics and marijuana(to a smaller extent)  temporarily clears your mind of these mental barriers so we can get a better handle on reality.

       In college last year I smoked a lot of weed, like everyday. Some of it was synthetic off the dark web (not the wisest decision, as I found out afterwards it was likely laced with PCP). Long story short I began realizing that I’m just a part of the system. College felt like a complete scam, especially having to pay for and take bullshit Gen Ed classes that have no benefit to me other than waste my time and dumb me down. So, eventually I smoked too much of the synthetic shit and ended up in the hospital with a mental breakdown. Smoking the synthetic stuff was a mistake, but not the natural. I haven’t done any drugs since then, but the experience has woken me up. I now see that society has been rigged for centuries. Where there is money and power, there is corruption. Everything makes sense now.

       I agree, although I'd caution people against the idea that marijuana, or even all psychedelics are completely harmless. Having a megadose of weed brownies at 25 really fucked me up and caused some lasting issues. Also, edibles are metabolized by the liver and produce a different drug than smoked cannabis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, all these issues could be solved if these drugs were legal in a therapeutic setting, but we definitely won't have that any time soon, sadly.

       I agree completely but there's a valid counter point that being stupid baked/tripped off your ass while driving is way dangerous (I can vouch for that) and we see how many people follow the drinking and driving rules currently (though they're a bit absurd). I'd love to buy both at the local grocery but if you had a population of people driving and tripping way more than normal, we'd have bad times. Though self driving cars are already taking over...

       I wish we could say society would act responsibly with it and be careful with regards to others (self driving cars and uber negate that part). I'm always in favor of more rights for the people as long as the elite don't trick or poison us from it. Maybe, get busted once and can't get more for 6 months (if it's driving related). Honestly, with self driving cars and robots replacing workers across the board, I see vast legalization so people are groovy and pacified.

       Whether it's strict and lax punishment, people will do as they do. Like subsidies and rebates, we need a proper incentive for people to want to enjoy it responsibly. I'm still way for making things legal and available, I just think it'll be a bigger shift in societies thinking than we can fully grasp and technology will move things even quicker.

       Agreed, most do it responsibly but never everyone. I think the sellable part is class. Make it sexy and it'll sell itself (hard to imagine a mushroom commercial though). You can still get in trouble if you're highly intoxicated in public on anything. The drunk driving laws don't apply to you if you don't drive inebriated or otherwise... My vote would be to make very low potency forms of all medicine/drugs/intoxicants legal and accessible and let people (properly informed) take what they want.

       Including that obscenely wealthy plutocrats are committing crimes against humanity by hoarding socially recognized/protected property rights, which, in an age of automation and rapidly advancing technology is arguably worse than slavery and Holocaust combined.

       I've never done psychedelics, though the mind-opening possibilities of them intrigue me. On the other hand, I know people who have done them, and overall I'd consider myself more open-minded and unconventional in my thinking than they are. I guess I don't see the results I'd expect to from people who have had and reported to embrace such "out of the box" experiences.

       The fact that you boast that you're more woke than your friends makes me think that you would benefit from a little time in a box where you don't know anything. I would recommend Alduous Huxley's The Doors of Perception if you don't want to take the literal leap.

       I don't mean to sound like I'm boasting. I have read The Doors of Perception. One of my favorite quotes is "I know that I know nothing." It's just an observation of people who have tripped, reported perception altering experiences, but then seem to just go back to who they were before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe some people genuinely take hold of their perceptions and actively apply them to their beliefs and life choices, while for others the implications are too scary and run back to consensus reality. I think we've all seen on this sub how cognitive dissonance works in some people, maybe that's what's at the root of it, how a person could experience a greater reality, but then drop it and go on like nothing happened.

       I swear the most cliche things always get upvoted on this sub drugs are fun but they arent necessary. Everything you "learn" while on drugs can be learned while sober. Why do drugs help you "see what is really going on". What have people "learned" on drugs that they couldnt have learned sober?

       Drugs are a lot of fun until they aren't.  They help you look at the world with different eyes.  That feeling is very seductive and its easy to fall into a trap of making that special, altered reality your regular reality.  Unfortunately, the real world goes on all around you while you are playing in wonderland.  You wake up and realize a lot of shit has gotten past you and you missed a lot of opportunities.  Now you are old and you need to figure shit out.

       The most cliche in every sub.  I think people have experiences on drugs because their own daily routines, do not allow for critical thinking.  So when they take drugs they're 'freeing' their mind to think about things outside of their realm.  Most drugs are euphoric, one way or the other, so when you take them is hard to not listen to your subconscious which cannot lie to itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, you have them sober.  But your normal mental routines, do not allow for creative, alternate routes of the happiness your brain is truly looking for.

       When I take mushrooms my ability to read people goes up exponentially. I frequently play at the Hard Rock in Hollywood and always do best while using, it's like I am ultra aware of player 'tells' and the possible hands available from the cards layout (more than my usual). It definitely opens the mind in ways that should be explored, I have had amazing experiences.

       During a couple of psychedelic experiences I have literally felt my body morph into different animals. On 5 Hits of LSD, I painted a mural of sea creatures in a friends house, and as I was doing so I felt my body literally transforming into a turtle, a shark, a seahorse, a jellyfish, and a giant squid over the course of about 8 hours. Another time, in a sensory deprivation floatation tank, I swam along through all the oceans and rivers in the world, shape shifting into different animals. To someone that hasn't done high level psychedelics, it might seem like a novelty or something experienced in a dream. But it was, to me, literally as real and concrete as everyday reality. Those experiences converted me from someone who cared nothing about the health of the environment (or even my own health) to someone who is deeply commited to living a life in accordance with nature, and taking care of my body equally well. And once you realize how commercialism and the global economy is turning the planet to a toxic waste dump, it's impossible to continue with the charade of modern life. This path led me to sustainability, self-sufficiency, gardening, and permaculture, and the realization that the entire American ideal has been built on a Type 1 Error. So yeah, I can vouch for psychedelics as being an enormously formative and life-altering event, (Note: They can also be very dangerous, even to someone who considers themselves a veteran, I literally almost died due to ego death on a bad Mushrooms trip, ended up in the hospital with a brain hemmorhage due to hitting my head under the influence.) I guess it's sort of like what Alan Watts said, "Once you get the message, hang up the phone".

       They can fuck up your life. You can see lots of examples of stoners and junkies who's lives are screwed. In smaller doses, at the right time in a person's life, they can help people who are stuck. But, there is no way to predict who will be helped, and who harmed.

       Likely not because they break down mental barriers. Money comes first for the ruling elite, so they're likely banned because the pharmaceutical industry would much rather treat the gigantic population of mentally ill and depressed with their own highly profitable meds. That and most substance laws date back to highly conservative Christian times where all drugs were considered evil.

       I disagree, in my view marijuana is a gateway drug into causing cognitive dissonance. Why? Because you smoke it and obviously it's less dangerous than alcohol, so you immediately think the government is a liar. That cognitive dissonance from realizing marijuana isn't "bad"
like you've been told makes you start looking at other things differently,

       Psychedelics make you less susceptible to propaganda. It doesn't make you more enlightened or see beyond the real world it just makes you question things as seeing and hearing isn't always believing. After all remember that time the walls looked like they were melting? Yeah that didn't really happen so it makes you look more intently at blanketed and exaggerated statements. Also the government did a lot of research into LSD and found it to be mostly useless but potent. This actually makes LsD a bit dangerous even tho the average person can experience it with little to no side effects. Someone could also take way to much, we are  talking 100-1000 times the necessary dose, which can cause extreme emotional and mental distress leading to PTSD or the emergence of otherwise dormant mental illness because that person took to big of a shot. For example look at Pont-Saint-Esprit, screwing up your dosage could keep you awake for days and even lead you to accidentally cause your own death. During the mass Poisoning several residents of the town threw themselves from windows some to make it stop others because they believed they could fly. And marijuana is illegal because the timber oil and cotton industries lobbied to make Hemp illegal int he early 20th century as hemp (marijuana) was a cheap alternative for their raw materials. Also prohibition had just ended so the head of the DEA was about to lose his job unless he found a new substance to crack down on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Final note on psychedelics the only pharmaceutical value they offer is in combination with real counseling . Shrooms won't make your depression go away on their own. LSD and Ibogain won't cure your addictions on their own. MDMA doesn't magically cure PTSD. The only real medicinal use for any of these psychedelics where they work on their own is shrooms for cluster headaches.

       Isn't the foundation of philosophy based on the premise of questioning everything? Weird how we are still talking about ancient philosophers when that clearly isn't a strength...

       I had this EXACT same thought the other day.
      </p>
      <p>
       My experiences with psychedelics (mushrooms and Acid) have opened my mind more than I ever thought possible. When partaking, I feel as though I'm tapping into a collective conscience that is ever present yet just out of our grasps during waking consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel as though I understand the cycle of life and death better, my individual purpose, and the collective purpose of nature better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I forget any money trouble or relationship issues, they matter not, there is only love.
      </p>
      <p>
       (This coming from someone who never tried weed until 25 and psychedelics until 30 and lived a rather conservative life style prior.)

       I feel the same. I'm 18 and tried physcadelics. I feel more connected with people and nature. I'm more caring to people.  Even people I don't know. I also cherish great moments I had more than I ever did before.  I feel life is more than just working a 9-5.

       Marijuana and psychedelics used to be illegal because the .gov wanted a productive workforce to make money which could be taxed to fight off the Germans and the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now marijuana is becoming legal because a certain political party wants your mind to be pliable and unquestioning, easily manipulated by your emotions.

       I 100% agree. I think it also not just the high itself but how a mindset can be transformed after the high. That is what is really concerning to those who seek to enslave us under their own intention of doing the right thing aka Sheep Hearding.

I'm just seeing things that others aren't. Cannabis has definitely opened my eyes into seeing the truth of the world around me.

       I'm convinced of this too. It's why drugs really will save the world. The root of the problem is in our minds. Enough people turn on to their compassion and the bizarre mystery that's suffusing us, and the capitalist ecocide has to end.

       Everyone who agrees or upvotes this post is having (subversive) added to their government profile. It’s so trivially easy to maintain a database of usernames and real people these days with the computing power that exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t disagree with “control”, as humans are capable of great savagery, and with thousands and millions of overlapping but conflicting (of the deadly kind) perspectives the result is chaos with mass violence— it is simply a fact that we are not sufficiently self-disciplined and self-aware to manage ourselves in the midst of opposition and opportunity. Of course, that we now possess the knowledge to elevate us only makes the systems of human management (governments and institutions) brightly display their secondary goal: profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the TRUE problem with many current systems of governance— the elevation of life seems secondary to profit.

       I had a close friend of mine who grew up in Kentucky, he was fairly liberal, but extremely patriotic, he came from a military family. Another friend of mine mentioned a 9/11 theory to him once and he flew off the handle and started freaking out and stormed out. A few months later the two of them were doing Mushrooms together and she started explaining all the facts and shit. After a few hours when the trip calmed down they put on Loose Change, I doubt he would have been so receptive to that information if it weren't for the psychedelics. It's not like these two friends aren't very close, but his mental barriers for a subject that sensitive were just so powerful, sometimes you need an external variable.

       I doubt it. Be specific about what you think is going on? How you think the drugs would help? All they do is make you chill out and see things in different perspectives than you would normally. They might make you more peaceful but peace is useful for governments as much as war

       Quite to the contrary, consciousness comes down to vibration or "cycles" with most people starting our partially in sync with the universal common consciousness, what eastern religions call the "third eye" is just a shift in frequency of your own consciousness closer to the common consciousness. Plenty of animals are closer to the common consciousness than humans.

       The majority of drugs will take you further away from this, with one exception DMT, as dmt is secreted by your brain as you die to give you understanding and peace in your final moments.

       Recently I read a book about the damage that worrying causes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that if the marijuana were legal, a lot of medical issues caused by stress and worry would simply vanish.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is, off course, totally opposing the wishes of the fucking pharmaceutical / medical lobby.

       I agree, simply they help people think outside the box we have been manipulated our entire lives to think inside of? Most older folk I talk to don't even want to hear real news, they just care about work and getting by each day and only what's around them and gossip so much boring bulsht over and over.. I cant be around these people they find it mentally streesfull very depressing and to much on their psyche to think of anything other than what they see each day..

       A home owner can have their property taken if they have one plant over the government allotted amount. Seizure is a big thing these days. The only reason for the pretend legalization is so authorities can take properties.

       Basically.  When I took LSD all I could do was laugh at how utterly pointless our existence is. How we are the ants building at hills for others to sit and get what they want. How their threats only have power due to everyone complying and how spending so much time scared is worthless.
      </p>

       Do what you love and spend it with those you love. Literally fuck politics, news. I even think conspiries are unhealthy after the trip because there isn't a solution. Kennedy got killed by the CIA? So what? What we ever going to do about it?

       Allllrigjt that’s enough Conspiracy Theory for a lifetime but TL;DR The British fucked the Chinese over with opioids and the British realized how easy it was to hook a nation and make them drug dependent. So not much to do with “TALKING” more to do with not having a drug dependency. (I don’t think this really applies to Marijuana but others? Of course.)

       I recently had my first breakthrough on DMT, and among all the other perspectives and understandings that I came back with, one was that there is no way that TPTB (I wouldn't even say it's governments) don't know what consciousness really is, why we are all here, where we came from, and the sheer indescribable beauty of being and love  available to all of us, hidden in plain sight. To try and hide it by laws and the very real threat of prison time is definitely the biggest conspiracy of them all, and one I understand now will be known by everyone when they die [spoken like a true space cadet; I know how it sounds].

       I think thats possible, though I believe its more likely because it create a market with the overhead of any botanical garden that can produce remedies far cheaper than perscription drugs.   They also don't have to same side effects which lead X% of people to take one drug as a way to counter act issues caused by another.  Marijuana would also directly impact the massive market developed around treating the symptoms of cancer and its symptoms.  These are billion dollar industries, bound by legions of beaurocrats all tied up within the system to ensure it functions as its supposed to, income for the super rich.  Thats why people are still debating whether its harmful eventhough it was definitely proven decades ago to be perfectly benign and in fact helpful with many psychological problems AND can, if tuned appropriately, completely remove the need for NSAID pain relievers.

       I disagree here.  I don't think we want the average psychedelic-user(specifically) making important decisions about our society.  Marijuana?  Well, I think its legal in DC, so its not stretch to think some of our lawmakers are partaking when in DC for session.  I know I sure would be with that clusterfuck.

       I'm sympathetic with people who have chronic pain they try to manage... But personally I try to watch everything I eat and drink, limiting the amount of substances that have mind-affecting properties... even caffeine, alcohol, and otc cold medications. Even most tap water in major cities is laced with the medications people pee out and/or is pumped in by the govt.

       It’s illegal because TPTB realize you can be controlled through the dangerous drugs such as meth, crack, and heroin. Psychedelics and cannabis remain outlawed because they are uncontrollable; meaning that the drug has no physical dependence for the user (psychological, maybe). I understand all these drugs remain illegal at any level regarding the US Coding of Controlled Substances but think about it... When was the last time someone OD’d on pot? Never has that been found on the death certificate of any person as the primary cause of death “Acute toxicity of cannabis.” That just sounds fake lol. So we keep the more dangerous drugs at a level that would remain controllable to the general public (I.e. low income cities, DEA turning a blind eye on how the drugs enter the country via gangs/cartels) and they make the psychedelic drugs more controllable to the general public by attributing it’s dangers and effects to the equivalency of heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cycle continues and continues. The DEA blames a lack of scientific and medical use as the reason cannabis remains schedule I. Even though how many states have passed some form of decriminilazation on the drug for either recreational or medicinal purposes. They also don’t disclose that in order to really study the drugs effects in needs to be declassified. Currently there is only 1 location in the country where this drug is studied at the federal level.
       <em>
        I bet this supports honest and non-bias research.
       </em>
       So if the federal government is the one that is controlling the research to further validate the DEA’s preconceived beliefs, how will reform ever pass on the national level?
      </p>
      <p>
       It won’t. And that’s been clear as day with the given administration. You have the Keebler elf dictating from his tree hole information he clearly has no scientific or medical understanding of. This is a man who is on record stating that marijuana is only slightly less awful than heroin. Either Jeff Sessions has preconceived beliefs that 2018 is 1938 and Reefer Madness is ramping up to wage war on all Americans OR he has personal interests on keeping the drug as Schedule 1 at the federal level. Follow the money and it will lead you to more of the reasoning why this drug remains illegal at the federal level.

       I recently got to try LSD for the first time at 24 years old. I have now been dosing twice a month for the past 4 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have made some of the most positive changes that I have ever made in my life. I feel better than I ever have before. Down 24lbs, quit drinking, quit smoking cannabis etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       After taking it for the first time I became slightly obsessive with learning about LSD and it's history.. I came across a video of clinical trials with LSD from back in the 60's/70's that had commentary from both the doctor and the patient they dosed. At the peak of his trip, he stated "I... I just feel like I have no enemies in the world"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that alone says a LOT about why it's illegal. Its not easy to monger fear with the general public if they feel they have no enemies.

       From my experience, you grow up in a certain culture, era, society, etc., and you are kind of indoctrinated from an early age with your culture's values and assumptions. So, being born in hyper-consumerist late 20th-century America, I was kinda programmed to view my fellow humans as competitors, and to place importance on superficial/material things like money, "cool" clothes, flashy possessions, social status, etc. Mainstream American culture is generally very shallow, materialist, and just spiritually bankrupt. We are expected to accept things like war, poverty, inequitable class divisions, etc. as natural and inevitable parts of life. Psychedelics just make it easier to see how all of this shit is ultimately an empty construct that has been foisted upon us, and that our species is capable of so much better.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about psychedelics is, they don't really give you anything that isn't already there inside you. They just make it easier to access these deeper levels of thought and experience. I believe that even the Greek etymology of the word "psychedelic" is roughly "mind-discovery." So you're really just discovering latent parts of your own mind and reality (as opposed to other drugs like alcohol, benzos, opiates, cocaine, etc. that are more about getting "fucked up" and making yourself temporarily oblivious to reality).

       They don't control the narrative on the internet, unlike they have been on radio and tv since it's inception, so that's a BiG problem for them. That's why one of the tactics that's widely used now is misinformation, they throw so much stuff out there, so it's harder to pick apart the facts.

       Shulgin was a weird character. Aside from the obvious inventions of hundreds of psychedelics detailed in PiHKAL and TiHKAL, he was a member of Bohemian Grove and gave lectures at Burning Man.

       I was doing some research on the pineal gland recently. Super interesting stuff. Many consider it to be a "third eye" of some sort, and the flouride in our water supplies calcifies the pineal gland and essentially makes it useless. If anyone has more information on this II'd love to hear.
