       GAIA (Gaea) was the goddess of the earth. She was one of the primoridal elemental deities (protogenoi) born at the dawn of creation. Gaia was the great mother of all creation--the heavenly gods were descended from her through her union with Ouranos (Uranus) (Sky), the sea-gods from her union with Pontos (Sea), the Gigantes (Giants) from her mating with Tartaros (the Pit), and mortal creatures born directly from her earthy flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaia was the chief antagonist of the heavenly gods. First she rebelled against her husband Ouranos (Sky) who had imprisoned several of her giant-sons within her womb. Later when her son Kronos (Cronus) defied her by imprisoning these same sons, she sided with Zeus in his rebellion. Finally she came into conflict with Zeus for she was angered by his binding of her Titan-sons in Tartaros. She birthed a tribe of Gigantes (Giants) and later the monster Typhoeus to overthrow him, but both failed in their attempts. Typhon= Satan/ That old serpent/ the great dragon. All of the Titans were imprisoned within Tartaros.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. 2 Peter 2:4 
- For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness ...
      </p>
      <p>
       In the ancient Greek cosmology earth was conceived of as a flat disk encirced by the river Okeanos (Oceanus), and encompassed above by the solid dome of heaven and below by the great pit (or inverse dome) of Tartaros. Earth supported the seas and mountains upon her breast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Known as the "father of all monsters", Typhon was a fire-breathing dragon who had one hundred heads that never slept. After the Titanomachy, Gaea wanted to punish Zeus for imprisoning her Titan children in Tartarus; thus, Typhon was born. Neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a plague to men. The earth created Typhon to be the equal of Zeus, and to over throw him.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a great battle in heaven. Zeus swooped down on his Chariot from heaven and struck the great Typhon with lightning bolts. When Typhon hit the earth the entire earth trembled, and shook. Still unable to kill Typhon, so Zeus imprisoned him within Tartaros.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not either was their place found any more in heaven. Angel=messenger, fallen=failed. Fallen angel =failed messenger
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucifer = Prometheus. The light bearer. He created man, along with his brother, who are now imprisoned within Tartaros. He gave man fire from heaven. Which angered Zeus, cause he didn't want man to have any advantages to be like gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
      </p>
      <p>
       13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit" Hell=Tartaros
      </p>
      <p>
       The later poets frequently connect Typhoeus with Egypt, and the gods, it is said, when unable to hold out against him, fled to Egypt, where, from fear, they metamorphosed themselves into animals, with the exception of Zeus and Athena.
      </p>
      <p>
       "[Leto i.e. the Egyptian goddess Buto] taking charge of Apollo [Egyptian god Horus] from Isis, hid him for safety in this island [Khemmis (Chemmis)] which is now said to float, when Typhon [Egyptian god Set] came hunting through the world, keen to find the son of Osiris. Apollon [Horus] and Artemis [Bastet] were, they say,children of Dionysus [Egyptian Osiris] and Isis, and Leto [Egyptian Buto] was made their nurse and preserver; in Egyptian, Apollon is Horus, Demeter Isis, Artemis Bubastis."
      </p>
      <p>
       Herodotus, Histories 2. 144. 1 : "Before men, they said, the rulers of Aigyptos (Egypt) were gods, but none had been contemporary with the human priests. Of these gods one or another had in succession been supreme; the last of them to rule the country was Osiris' son Horus, whom the Greeks call Apollon; he deposed Typhon [Set], and was the last divine king of Aigyptos. Osiris is, in the Greek language, Dionysos."
      </p>
      <p>
       The reptilian race is not the aliens.  You are not indigenous. Which goes along with the idea that reptilians exist through the ancient dinosaurs that roamed earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the devil is a dragon, then why does every image we are presented with of the devil appear as a horned goat man? This would be the demonization of the Greek god Pan. This demonization was no accident, but rather a deliberate twisting of pagan ideals as Christianity spread its influence throughout Europe. After the Council of Nicea issued the Nicene Creed and the Roman Catholic Church was established in 325 C.E., Christian theologians (beginning with Eusebius) transformed Pan from a benign nature god to Satan the great Adversary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pan is the universal agent known as phosphorus, that gives light and life to the world. In Lévi's writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. Lévi called his image "The Goat of Mendes", possibly following Herodotus' account that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat's face and legs. Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly copulated with a goat.
      </p>
      <p>
       At several places in the Delta, e.g. Hermopolis, Lycopolis, and Mendes, the god Pan and a goat were worshipped; Strabo, quoting (xvii. 1, 19) Pindar, says that in these places goats had intercourse with women, and Herodotus instances a case which was said to have taken place in the open day. The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity. Diodorus compares the cult of the goat of Mendes with that of Priapus, and groups the god with the Pans and the Satyrs. The goat referred to by all these writers is the famous Mendean Ram, or Ram of Mendes, the cult of which was, according to Manetho, established by Kakau, the king of the IInd dynasty.Lévi called his image "The Goat of Mendes", possibly following Herodotus' account that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat's face and legs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baphomet is a term originally used to describe an idol or other deity that the Knights Templar were accused of worshipping and that subsequently was incorporated into disparate occult and mystical traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       33rd degree Freemason, Manly P. Hall had said in the Secret Teachings of All Ages;“Pan was a composite creature, the upper part–with the exception of his horns–being human, and the lower part in the form of a goat. ” According to Hall, the symbolism of the goat relates to the pre-Christian God Pan, Dionysius.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Goat-God was accepted by the later Greek Mystery Schools as the symbol of the Temple Builders. In fact, the Dionysian Artificers was such a mystery school. They viewed practical Temple Construction as a source of understanding the mystery of Nature and God; thus being one of the early esoteric schools from which Masonry has inherited certain symbols and teachings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another famous 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Freemason, Albert Pike had written in Moral and Dogma, in describing the 28th degree; "The Gnostics held that it [universal agent] composed the igneous [pertaining to fire] body of the Holy Spirit, and it was adored in the secret rites of the Sabbat or the Temple under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the hermaphroditic goat of Mendes." Pike further stated; ""... Satan is not a black god, but negation of God ... this is not a Person, but a Force, created for good, but which may represent evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or Free Will. They represent this Force; under the mythologic and horned form of the God Pan; thence came the he-goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the Light-bearer."

       The precept you used about Lucifer falling are the true children of God watching those at the tippy top rebelling against God falling from power.

       They worship Baal, a false God of the flesh. Although he has many names, at the end of the day, all false God's are worship of the flesh. I.E. they worship the matrix.

       Baal simply means lord. It isn't a direct name. I am not blaspheming. Same gods over and over, just different names for different locations. Hebrew, Egypt, Greek, Hindu, christian, Jew, catholic, etc. All the same. Don't doubt my faith, because you simply can't comprehend the grander scheme.

       No. Baal does not mean the God of Israel.

       These are two different entities but both can have the title LORD depending on who you are talking to.

       Because the prophets of Baal have ruled the world for their period and it is almost over. You have to understand that God gave the world to Satan to punish his chosen people.

       Get it? The Bible is only meant for the bloodline of Israel. It condems all other 17 nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rulers of this planet know this, so they hide it and worship Satan by worshiping the Matrix, thus completing rebellion against God by worshiping the flesh.

       Just like Baal, Satan isn't a name either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan (Hebrew: שָּׂטָן‎ satan, meaning "enemy" or "adversary"; Arabic: شيطان‎ shaitan, meaning; "astray", "distant", or sometimes "devil")
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore by that definition you can replace Satan with simply meaning enemy, or adversary.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan
      </p>
      <p>
       Here the devil , or Satan is the the great dragon/old serpent. Therefore Satan is a dragon, or serpent. Not a fallen angel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Devil (from Greek: διάβολος diábolos "slanderer, accuser") here devil would simply means slanderer, or accuser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would make the serpent a best of the field which the Lord had made. Not a fallen angel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fallen simply means failed, and Angel simply means messenger.
Fallen Angel means Failed Messenger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars. 2 Then being with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth. 3 And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads. 4 His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, to devour her Child as soon as it was born. 5 She bore a male Child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was caught up to God and His throne. 6 Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Python used to dwell on Mount Parnassus, in central Greece. Wherever the Python went, it diffused an obnoxious smell and spread mischief and death. Python was once sent out by Hera, the wife of Zeus, in order to chase the pregnant Leto, a lover of Zeus, so that she couldn't settle anywhere to give birth. Zeus felt sorrow for Leto and transformed her into a quail (ortyx) in order to give birth to their twin children, Apollo and Artemis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male Child. 14 But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent. And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. 2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon (Apollo).
      </p>
      <p>
       And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, 8 but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them[a] in heaven any longer. 9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Known as the "father of all monsters", Typhon was a fire-breathing dragon who had one hundred heads that never slept. After the Titanomachy, Gaea wanted to punish Zeus for imprisoning her Titan children in Tartarus; thus, Typhon was born. Typhon confronted Zeus and in their first battle, managed to repel almost all of the Olympian gods and tear out Zeus' tendons. Hermes managed to get the tendons back and give them to Zeus,. Zeus recovered his strength, he made a sudden descent from heaven on a chariot drawn by a winged horse. Hurling thunderbolts, he pursued Typhon who eventually threw his lightning bolts against Typhon and overwhelmed him. He finally trapped him underneath Mount Etna.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt, [855] he leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him. But when Zeus had conquered him and lashed him with strokes, Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned. But when the blessed gods had finished their toil, and settled by force their struggle for honors with the Titans, they pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by Earth's prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them.
      </p>

       The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes erected a statue of Zeus Olympios in the Judean Temple in Jerusalem.[65] Hellenizing Jews referred to this statue as Baal Shamen (in English, Lord of Heaven).[66]
      </p>
      <p>
       Dragon , and Lucifer are never mentioned being the same beings in the Bible. The dragon would be Typhon he made war with the gods in heaven, and was cast to the earth. The Olympian gods were not cast to the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demon-Disembodied spirit, Not a fallen angel. To mate with the daughters of man, and have sex with them, and create children they care about, they would be physical beings. Daemon comes from the Ancient Greek word δαίμων, which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit.

       You say Baal is Satan, and Devil, so he has 3 titles now, but you have given no name. You say lightning falling from heaven is people in power, losing power? That is really, really reaching so far I can't see the analogy.

       Seeing as Typhon was struck with lightning , and fell from heaven to earth by a literal lightning bolt of Zeus. I would say my analogy is a lot closer.

       I assure you they are the same stories of different gods, or Baals. 
What you seem to believe would be blasphemous to me. Your perception is your reality, and that is great, but you are not really presenting your case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The serpent race is talked about in every religion known to man to have ever existed on earth. That being said, what you believe can't be verified by other religions throughout time. I think you want to believe so hard that you will make anything fit your beliefs, and will dismiss anything that contradicts your beliefs. That is not very open minded. I have no dog in the fight.

       The serpent is the the left hand of God since it clear that Yahawashi (so called Jesus) sits on his RIGHT HAND.

       God created Satan to try the souls of men, Satan is controlled and created by GOD himself. This is clear in Job.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Job 1:6-9
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
       </p>
       <p>
        7
        <strong>
         And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
       </p>
       <p>
        9 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You see this back and forth here? God knows very well that Satan is his creature and Satan knows that he is a servant of God. Again:

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is why we see people chase after the fast cars, hoes and money and at the end of it, they feel empty. Because once the spirit of Satan gets what he wants from you, he leaves you high and dry to accept your judgement. Many entertainers even sing about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as the serpent chastised Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, he has been doing it ever sense. The serpent merely represents spiritually the left hand of God, his evil side. For there cannot be good without evil and God understood this.

       My case has been presented quite thoroughly using only the scriptures to back up what I am trying to convey. I need not to add unto the word of God for there are great consequences for doing so. As a youth I allowed Satan (this matrix) to program me to do wicked things not knowing that what I was doing was wicked. When I found God I understood why everything I had done changed me and why the people I used to hang with no longer wanted to hang. They hated the words of the father.

       Every nation on the planet has held the Israelite's captive, I find it no surprise that you will find references of the Hebrew story line in every nation. From middle east, to China (moab), to Africa (hamites), to even here in America (transatlantic slave trade).

Manufacturing the end of the world. To make you believe it is out of your hands, and the will of God. God didn't destroy the world with a flood , because it was his will. Man had become greedy , and violent , and was thus destroyed.

       Notice that it doesn't say the Love of the Lord or some other bullshit? That's because God is not an entity you can reason with. What he says goes, he sets up the game board and he tells us when it's finished. It is not our choice but his. Everything we see built and computed by the
       <em>
        Matrix
       </em>
       was created by him. Therefore, you have no real say. Why do you think these scientist are all scrambling to figure out if we live in a simulation? Because they've realized they don't control the narrative of our reality. A stronger, much more wise entity does.

       "Yes God gave Adam dominion over the earth, nothing new here. Also, the us were the other creations of God. I.E. The angels."
      </p>
      <p>
       Prometheus, son of the titan Themis, created mankind from clay and Athena breathed their divine spirit into them. Prometheus is even said to have created all life there is. Finally he created monkeys in all their shapes and sizes, and after monkeys he created Man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prometheus only created men and Zeus later created woman, Pandorra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prometheus clearly took the side of humanity in their struggle with the gods of Olympus. He saw, however, than without fire, Man would remain not much more than an animal, so he tried to convince Zeus, that fire should be given to Man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zeus refused and war broke out between Man and Zeus who wanted to cleanse the Earth of them. Prometheus intervened and made Man sacrifice to Zeus, however, he wrapped the meat in skin and the bones in fat. Zeus chose the fatty good looking parcel. He was not amused when he found all that was wrapped in the fat were the bones. Again he denied Man fire and Prometheus came and stole it in a hollowed stick of fennel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next he started to teach man cooking and firing pottery. He taught them about the stars and the Arts, but took away their knowledge of the future and gave them blind hope in return.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zeus found out that Man had gotten hold of Fire and, rightly, blamed Prometheus. Together with Hephaistos, his son, they moulded a woman out of clay as beautiful as Aphrodite, as modest as a maid. Athena dressed her, Aphrodite gave her grace and Hermes gave her a lovely voice and a tricky mind. This woman they named Pandorra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pandorra beguiled him with her looks and her voice, and gave this mix of sweetness and deceitfulness to all other woman. Pandorra opened the urn and all that was bad escaped in to the world. When Prometheus found out he was very sad, a last look in the jar showed him that all was left was hope, which he shook out and sent out in to the world, to give solace to Man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the world grows miserable and Zeus decides it needs to be destroyed. He saves a Deukalion and Pyrrha, children of Prometheus and his brother Epimetheus, by putting them in a boat before he floods the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of their children is named Hellen, who gives rise to the Hellenes, or ancient Greeks.

       The Hopi refer to a race of reptoids called the Sheti, or "Snake-Brothers", who live underground. The Cherokee and other Native American peoples also refer to reptoid races.

       In pre-Columbian mythology from Colombia, Bachue (the primordial woman) transformed into a big snake. She is also sometimes called the "Celestial Snake" (Serpiente Celestial).

      <p>
       Many users of the drug Dimethyltryptamine (the active ingredient in many South American shamanic potions such as ayahuasca) have seen reptilian humanoids or reptilian disincarnate entities and aliens while hallucinating (Strassman 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Cecrops I, the legendary first King of Athens was said to have been half man, half snake. The ancient Titans and Gigantes were sometimes depicted as winged man-like beings with serpents instead of legs, for example on a fresco on a temple in Pergamum. In these images from Pergamum, some of which depict the gigantomachy, one sees the giant Klyteios with huge serpents in place of legs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boreas (Aquilon to the Romans) was the Greek god of the cold north wind, described by Pausanias as a winged man with serpents for legs.
Indian scriptures and legends the Naga are reptilian beings said to live underground and interact with human beings on the surface. Some are alleged to turn human. In some versions, these beings were said to have once lived on a continent in the Indian Ocean that sank beneath the waves. Indian texts also refer to a reptilian race called the "Sarpa. The Syrictae of India were a tribe of men with snake-like nostrils in place of noses and bandy serpentine legs.

       In China, Korea and Japan, underwater realms where the Dragon Kings and their descendants live are referred to, as well as the lineage of humans from a race of dragons. This lineage was often claimed by Asian Emperors, who were believed to be able to change from human to dragon form at will, much like the modern concept of shapeshifting reptilians. However, the dragon is seen as good rather than evil in Eastern tradition.

       the Middle East, reptilian beings ranging from certain Jinn to dragons and serpent-men have been spoken of since ancient times. In one of the apocryphal books purporting to be the lost Book of Jasher, a serpent race is described.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Book of Genesis, God punishes the serpent for deceiving Eve into eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil by decreeing, "Upon thy belly thou shalt go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of your life" (Genesis 3:14 KJV). Traditionally, many have felt this implied that the serpent (a snake or reptile) had legs before then. Thus It is therefore often portrayed in Western art as a humanoid (woman) with a snake's tail, and sometimes lizard-like feet, as in a detail from Bosch's Last Judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Middle Ages down to modern times, the Devil was often conceived as a humanoid with reptilian characteristics, as were demons in general. and the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Africa, some shamans claim to bear extensive esoteric knowledge of a race of reptilians called the Chitauri, whom they say control the Earth. They also claim to have accounts of a reptilian race who created them and used them to work their gold mines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rhodes contends that the majority of the reptilian humanoids are descendants of the dinosaurs and are biological byproducts of Earth evolution. He also states that human attention has been intentionally misdirected away from the underworld toward deep space, so the subject of underground Earth dwelling Reptoids and lost ancient civilizations can remain secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       A subterranean Nazi-friendly super race is sometimes associated with accounts of reptilian humanoids, and also with the telekinetic super race depicted in Vril: The Power of the Coming Race.
      </p>

       The brain stem is the oldest and smallest region in the evolving human brain. It evolved hundreds of millions of years ago and is more like the entire brain of present-day reptiles. For this reason, it is often called the 'reptilian brain'. Various clumps of cells in the brain stem determine the brain's general level of alertness and regulate the vegetative processes of the body such as breathing and heartbeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's similar to the brain possessed by the hardy reptiles that preceded mammals, roughly 200 million years ago. It's 'preverbal', but controls life functions such as autonomic brain, breathing, heart rate and the fight or flight mechanism. Lacking language, its impulses are instinctual and ritualistic. It's concerned with fundamental needs such as survival, physical maintenance, hoarding, dominance, preening and mating. It is also found in lower life forms such as lizards, crocodiles and birds. It is at the base of your skull emerging from your spinal column.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic ruling emotions of love, hate, fear, lust, and contentment emanate from this first stage of the brain. Over millions of years of evolution, layers of more sophisticated reasoning have been added upon this foundation.
Our intellectual capacity for complex rational thought which has made us theoretically smarter than the rest of the animal kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we are out of control with rage, it is our reptilian brain overriding our rational brain components. If someone says that they reacted with their heart instead of their head. What they really mean is that they conceded to their primitive emotions (the reptilian brain based) as opposed to the calculations of the rational part of the brain. There are almond-shaped groups of neurons located deep within the medial temporal lobes of the brain in complex vertebrates, including humans. Shown in research to perform a primary role in the processing and memory of emotional reactions, the amygdalae are considered part of the limbic system.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not either was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.

       . There they learned to continue their heritage with false God's retaining on bits and pieces. If it wasn't for Yahawashi turning up on the scene the gentiles/heathen Israelite's would have never came out of such worship.

       These reptilians that you keep talking about are a race of people. These people have he same characteristics as snakes, I.E. they shed their skin.

       There is only one group of people on the planet that Yahawah marked with the mark of Cain which is why vampire movies use the same reference. They burn in the sun, they need blood and usually do it using pagan methods, they shed blood at an astronomical rate, all throughout history and they are red.

       You would have to be a little more specific. If I reference the Bible . Then it is in there. Please be more specific.

       The point is, it is  the same gods. when Zeus fought the Titans he claimed himself god of gods. King of Kings. No other god was his equal, and only Zeus be worshipped. Sound familiar(The Bible/God of the Old Testament.). It sounds like you simply worship cronus instead of Zeus. The Jews also worship Cronus.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say Abel came back as Jacob? Therefore, you believe in reincarnation of Abel into Jacob? Where is the definitive biblical proof of this? The conclusions you come to don't fit. My interpretations at least fit , and have similarity. Snake is a snake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Primitive man could only interpret the best he could. When witnessing advanced technology would seem improbable to describe, but in these modern times we understand now.
      </p>

       If there are only two lineage of Cain, and Abel. Why Mark Cain? There must have been other populations of people on earth to Mark Cain as to enact the seven times revenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jonah, and the whale/big fish-submarine technology. Jesus birth- artificial insemination. The story of Noah and the flood. We know it is impossible to put two of every animal in a boat, and multiples of livestock, in all the world, but you could take the dna of the animals and then repopulate the earth. The three wise men/magi followed a traveling star to the birth of Jesus. Must have been some sort of flying craft as a star can't do this. Pimitive man witnessing this type of technology would be baffled as if witnessing magic. Beasts  like the Leviathan are described like being a solid metal aircraft that could bomb cities.

       21 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
      </p>

       Sealed like a welded metal?

       28 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
      </p>
      <p>
       30 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
      </p>
      <p>
       31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
      </p>
      <p>
       32 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
      </p>
      <p>
       More light like lights on a plane, and terrible sounding fire from it's mouth/exhaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       33 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       34 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
      </p>
      <p>
       This great weapon/aircraft struck fear in their primitive minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this is not a debate. I doubt either of us change our views on them matter. Advanced technology would at the time seem like magic , and they tied to describe these events the best they know how, but in these modern times we should begin to understand this.

       What I think you are hinting at, I could be wrong, but to me it is if you are saying that white people are the serpent race, and black people are the true israelites? White people are serpents because they have redskin that peels, and blacks are Israelites because they have been slaves to everyone? If this is what you believe the scriptures do not back your claims.

        23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:

       <p>
        26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.

       I think you may have a huge surprise in store when you finally do meet your maker. The fallen angels, and angels that did not rebel, have to be the of the same origin, therefore the same color skin. If the fallen angels appear white then the angels in heaven would be white. What is so hard to understand? They rebelled against their black god, therefore he cursed them with white skin?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all judged on the person we are. You may be saved by grace, but we all will be judged on judgement day. Whether black, white, Latino, whatever you will pay the piper his due. You will not be saved by the color of your skin. That is a pipe dream. You have filled your head with racist propaganda so you will rebell from the white man , and use it as justification. Why? You are being played by your Jewish masters, but not realize this.

And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while. Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. ...

       Here is more context to what you were posting:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Jude 1:3-6
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.
       </p>
       <p>
        4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
       </p>
       <p>
        5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
       </p>
       <p>
        6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is one precept saying that there were rebellious angels.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this was talking about Israelite's. How do we know?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Matthew 22:30
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage,
        <strong>
         but are as the angels of God in heaven."
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, the Israelite's are the saints, the angels, the gods of this planet. Unfortunately, our power has left us because we did not deserve his protection and must learn why we need him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Revelation chapter 9 is talking about
       <strong>
        thermonuclear missiles.

       If apollyon is the devil then why he descends from heaven when the trumpet sounds. The stars that fall are angels represented as stars. 
The bible says Satan was cast to the earth chained up. It says Apollo co.es down from heaven. You have no answer just. Uh he is evil. I am good. White man evil. Black good. White man was given power over this earth for a reason you can't begin to understand. I say Abraham wasn't black. You say yes he was cause moses this, and moses that, but your proof lies in what it doesn't say in the bible? That makes no sense. Reincarnation is bullshit. You die and wait for judgement day. You say I lack faith, but you literally believe nothing the bible actually says. Only your interpretation which is bypassed towards yourself, and your ethnicity. 
You still have failed to explain why the lord in Hosea says you will call me Baal no longer, but is hi. You can't explain why Apollo descends from heaven after the trumpet sounds when the angels that sinned are chained in darkness. You are not chained in darkness. You are not a Jew, or a god either. Embrace your heritage and be proud. Surely your family doesn't approve of this.

       Yes because Rothschild lives the life of luxury, heaven/hell on this plain is a condition. You cannot understand this because you are not meant to get it. So Rothschild (the richest man on the planet) being brought down. The Angels of Satan are demons, (people who follow him).

       Because you read the Bible then you interpret it. It is wisdom to understand that if both Moses, Mary, Joseph and the messiah hid among the Egyptians, they had to be the same color.

       Already explained, you did not accept it. Baal is the name of the false God that Rothschild uses. The Israelite's, were persecuted, enslaved and forced to learn white Christianity aka the Devil AKA BAAL.

      <p>
       The Apollyon is reference to the Devil, once again as I've told you. So simply look at it as Edom's doing. These are nuclear warheads that are being described.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the angels chained in darkness, you used one precept and I defeated you once one looks at the entire chapter. Face it, you don't have wisdom. It was talking about the Israelites, who would not listen to God.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I am not chained in Darkness. I believe and have faith that the son of man will come to save me regardless if my people have been made the tail long ago, we have no money, we have no standing army, we have no guns, nukes or anything else that the so called white man has. I know for a fact after reading the Bible that God LOVES the underdog, it's when he does his best work.

      <p>
       I do embrace my heritage as Israel, which is why I show myself approved, not by reading other doctrines or coming up with my own thoughts and opinions but using the precepts written in the greatest song ever sung. I also care not about what my family thinks.

       You have explained nothing on your side, even science (created by Edom) condems your point of view. The world started off melanated, there is noway that the people claiming to be Jews today are the sons of the Jews of antiquity for they were all dark skinned.

       No the star that falls is wormwood
Just as we've been seeing meteorites all over the place.
 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
      </p>
      <p>
       11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is completely different. Not even same chapter. This star is called apollyon and has the key to the bottomless pit/tartarus.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
      </p>
      <p>
       See here it says and to HIM was given the key.
And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.
      </p>
      <p>
       11 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directly named the Greek god Apollo. Or in Hebrew abaddon. O ye of little faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a reference to a nucleur weapon. This is the Greek god Apollo opening tartarus.

       I apologize, you do not quote precepts so it becomes a little confusing trying to debate. Most of your gibberish is just linked with different precepts from one book to another with no quotes or even precept numbers to follow. You're literally all over the place.

       When Apollo opens the bottomless pit to punish us all, because of people like you. You will see some of the reptilians you don't believe in. When they torment you for days on end you can tell them how you don't believe in their existence. 
The gods have always used the serpent race to instill fear in man. Then the gods come along and kill the serpent/dragons, and we then again worship them all over again. Same story in every religion on earth since the beginning of time. Even the Bible.

       No man in history has ever "walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire" or "fallen from heaven." Man is not capable of the things the great serpent can do.
Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone [was] thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou [art] the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee [so]: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou [wast] perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee

       That doesn't explain what I sent you. Maybe you were made to serve, not lead, therefore you don't get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt."
You can be sure God was not punishing four legged beasts by afflicting them with boils.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leviticus 20:15-16: "And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."
      </p>
      <p>
       This certainly could not be a four legged beast that a man or woman could lie with. If it were, God would not demand the death penalty for a dumb animal with no reasoning power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 19:13: "There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount."
Now we have a beast with a hand. Do you believe God told Moses to talk to the camels, donkeys, cattle and tell them not to touch the mount?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 7:20: "Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast..."
Jeremiah 21:6: "And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence."
Would God refer to a four legged beast as an inhabitant of a city?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 27:6: "And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him."
The Negro race has always been used as servants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 31:27-30: "...the seed of man, and with the seed of beast...But every one shall die for his own iniquity."
How can an animal die for his sins and iniquity? They cannot because they do not know God’s Laws so they cannot sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 31:34: "And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
      </p>
      <p>
       Ezekiel 14:15: "If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts."
Only two legged beasts could stop man from passing through the land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ezekiel 29:11: "No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years."
Now the beast inhabitant not only has a hand but a foot as well. Animals have hoofs or paws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jonah 3:7-8: "Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands."
What manner of beast would wear sackcloth; have the power of speech and, once again, we see that the beast has hands?
      </p>
      <p>
       Zechariah 8:10: "For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast..."
Here we have beasts that can be hired.
The great boast of modern civilization is its unparalleled degree of enlightenment when compared with preceding ages.

      <p>
       A question like this is only asked when someone is either not an Israelite or they are scoffing. The Bible breaks down into formulas, like how Numbers 1:18 says that God goes by the father's side. That follows up throughout the entire Bible you will find not one contradiction.
      </p>

       So if we know that the laws, statues and commandments are only for Israel, then why would an animal know sin? It is but a dumb animal. So why even ask a question like this?

       Fool, sackcloth represents poverty, it was to beg God for mercy via Humbleness. Even the king participated, did they throw sackcloth on the animals? Most likely not, but they probably didn't give them as much food and water as they normally would have and made them humble down in their own way.

       Take your time to read, you are not ready for someone as blessed as me. I'd tell you to use wisdom but I know it is not found within you so I will explain it. Here is something to ponder on, if this was thousands of years ago, what do you think they did for transportation, cutting larges fields of grass, traveling, moving large items etc. Use that and perhaps you will answer your own question.

       Is not ezekial 28 referencing him as the anointed cherub? That means he is not mentioning a man. The king of Tyrus would be a god king, or angel.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a cherub? Don't say a guardian, because that is what a cherub does, not what it is.

       The reference of a Cherub is God telling Ezekiel this is what he is supposed to prophecy. It is clear that the Bible insinuates God made a metaphor. He had anointed the King of Babylon to power (Again God controls both sides), to punish the Israelites.
      </p>
      <p>
       But their sin raised to high which is why in precept 15 on down in Ezekiel 28. God is litterally marveling at his own work (creating such a wicked creation) in these precepts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the same thing that happens in Revelation (the end of this reality).
       <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/china-hypersonic-glide-vehicle-ballistic-missile-destroy-us-defense-767716">
        America will be nuked by a multitude of nations all at once and destroyed within one hour.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the outcome that we are witnessing happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So understand that this is metaphoric, the king of Babylon was not an actual cherub. He was a man liken to a cherub in the scriptures.

       Jesus/Dionysus/Bacchus
Elements, such as the celebration by a ritual meal of bread and wine, also have parallels. The omophagia was the Dionysian act of eating raw flesh and drinking wine to consume the god. Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus' followers could achieve communion with the god. Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion.
As with Jesus, December 25th and January 6th are both traditional birth dates in the Dionysian myth and simply represent the period of the winter solstice. Indeed, the winter-solstice date of the Greek sun and wine god Dionysus was originally recognized in early January but was eventually placed on December 25th, as related by ancient Latin writer Macrobius (c. 400 AD/CE). Regardless, the effect is the same: The winter sun god is born around this time, when the shortest day of the year begins to become longer.
In the common myth about the birth of Dionysus/Bacchus, Semele is mysteriously impregnated by one of Zeus's bolts of lightning--an obvi­ous miraculous/virgin conception.
The miracles of Dionysus are legendary, as is his role as the god of wine, echoed in the later Christian story of Jesus multiplying the jars of wine at the wedding feast of Cana (Jn 2:1-9).
"This story is really the Christian counterpart to the pagan legends of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, who at his annual festival in his temple of Elis filled three empty kettles with wine-no water needed! And on the fifth of January wine instead of water gushed from his temple at Andros. If we believe Jesus' miracle, why should we not believe Dionysus's? (Leedom, 125)
Dionysus's miracle of changing water to wine is recounted in pre-Christian times by Diodorus
Dionysus a solar hero, born of a virgin on "December 25th" or the winter solstice, performing miracles and receiving divine epithets, being killed, giving his blood as a sacrifice, resurrecting from the dead after three days in Hades/Hell, and ascending into heaven
Included in the twelve Olympians, as the last of their number, and the only god born from a mortal mother.
The cult of Dionysus is also a "cult of the souls"; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead. He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god.
In Greek mythology, he is presented as a son of Zeus and the mortal Semele, thus semi-divine or heroic: and as son of Zeus and Persephone or Demeter, thus both fully divine, part-chthonic and possibly identical with Iacchus of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Some scholars believe that Dionysus is a syncretism of a local Greek nature deity and a more powerful god from Thrace or Phrygia such as Sabazios or Zalmoxis.
Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Persephone, the queen of the Greek underworld. Diodorus' sources equivocally identified the mother as Demeter. A jealous Hera again attempted to kill the child, this time by sending Titans to rip Dionysus to pieces after luring the baby with toys. It is said that he was mocked by the Titans who gave him a thyrsus (a fennel stalk) in place of his rightful sceptre.[21] Zeus turned the Titans into dust with his thunderbolts, but only after the Titans ate everything but the heart, which was saved, variously, by Athena, Rhea, or Demeter. Zeus used the heart to recreate him in his thigh, hence he was again "the twice-born".
According to a legend, when Alexander the Great reached a city called Nysa near the Indus river, the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus. These travels took something of the form of military conquests; according to Diodorus Siculus he conquered the whole world except for Britain and Ethiopia.[27] Returning in triumph (he was considered the founder of the triumphal procession) he undertook to introduce his worship into Greece
It is a measure of Bacchus's ambiguous position in classical mythology that he, unlike the other Olympians, had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated"
Dionysus was of the few Olympians with the power to remove deceased mortals from the underworld, and thus restore them to life. He descended to the underworld (Hades) to rescue his mother Semele, whom he had not seen since his birth, making the descent by way of a reputedly bottomless pool on the coast of the Argolid near the prehistoric site of Lerna, and bypassing Thanatos, the god of death.
The Dionysia and Lenaia festivals in Athens were dedicated to Dionysus. On numerous vases (referred to as Lenaia vases), the god is shown participating in the ritual sacrifice as a masked and clothed pillar (sometimes a pole, or tree is used), while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine. Initiates worshipped him in the Dionysian Mysteries, which were comparable to and linked with the Orphic Mysteries, and may have influenced Gnosticism
In the Orphic tradition of ancient Greece, Dionysus Zagreus served as its patron god connected to death and immortality, and symbolized the one who guides reincarnation.
Many identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying-and-returning god In The Bacchae where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity, which is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate.
Other elements, such as the celebration by a ritual meal of bread and wine, also have parallels. The omophagia was the Dionysian act of eating raw flesh and drinking wine to consume the god. Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus' followers could achieve communion with the god. Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion.
Dionysus savior-god whose birth was observed on DEC-25. He was worshipped throughout much of the Middle East as well as in Greece. He had a center of worship in Jerusalem in the 1st century BCE. Some ancient coins were found in Gaza with Dionysus on one side and JHWH (Jehovah) on the other. In later years, his flesh and blood were symbolically eaten in the form of bread and wine. He was viewed as the son of Zeus, the Father God.

       Yeah yeah I'm the fool, but it just happened that when he came he was the exact copy of Dionysus. Down to the miracles he preformed.

       What a coincidence.

       What did the captive black Israelites know all the exact miracles he would preformed while he was here, long before he actually came?

       They did not go by Black Israelite. They went by either those who knew who they were Israel and those Israelite's and those who didn't know who they were, I.E. gentiles. This was due to the King of Greece banning them to continue their practice and thus destroying their heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Paul was so important, he was the spirit of unity. He urged the Israelite's to not hate the gentile Israelite's who didn't follow the customs of their forefathers.

       Believe in that, it clear the Bible is not for you, again, you promote something other than the Bible at every turn, you don't believe the messiah is ever coming and you believe that it is Dionysus is the true so called Jesus.

       Can't you see that it is because God ordained that his elect would never forget him? Therefore, they knew what had to be done. There were those among us who hid in the caves to worship God.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        8 Moreover there went out a decree to the neighbour cities of the heathen, by the suggestion of Ptolemee, against the Jews, that they should observe the same fashions, and be partakers of their sacrifices:
       </p>
       <p>
        9 And whoso would not conform themselves to the manners of the Gentiles should be put to death. Then might a man have seen the present misery.
       </p>
       <p>
        10 For there were two women brought, who had circumcised their children; whom when they had openly led round about the city, the babes handing at their breasts, they cast them down headlong from the wall.
       </p>
       <p>
        11 And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keep the sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a conscience to help themselves for the honour of the most sacred day.
       </p>
       <p>
        12 Now I beseech those that read this book, that they be not discouraged for these calamities, but that they judge those punishments not to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        13 For it is a token of his great goodness, when wicked doers are not suffered any long time, but forthwith punished.

      <p>
       First you stopped us from doing so but people still did it even if they faced death. It was those among them that survived it all that had the knowledge of who they were still. The rest followed suit to the laws of whatever system that was in place. Those stories in Greece came from our knowledge from the script writers of Israelite's who followed the customs of Greece I.E. the gentiles. This happened in every nation that the Israelite's were ever held captive/sojourned.

       In this video you linked, there was triangles, UFOs, objects flying in the sky hovering. What are these flying triangles to you? It was in this video exactly for what reason? I am very seriously curious about what you believe this is?

       these chariots would have been  physical flying objects? Even Jesus ascended on a cloud. I am not denouncing the word of God, merely your interpretations of it. All of your proof is simply interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't prove that the ancient Israelites were black people, ie. you. You interpret it to mean that. That is fine, but an interpretation is not proof. As a debating Christian you should understand this.

       Science can prove that the first humans were so called black. It's just natural. But this truth is not about skin color alone. That is just to give understanding on who the Israelite's are following the scriptures narrative.

       The Bible states this as Apollo. You said that Apollo was edom. Man.
It says a angel fell down from heaven. That is not edom. Right?
You contradicted yourself yet again.

Just yesterday you said that Apollo is edom, but he is chaining the dragon you believe to be the devil/Satan. This is a contradiction. Nothing more.

       No it really is, you have to erase everything you know about it to read it the correct way. The devil has controlled this artifact for many centuries and has spread lies on the father and his message he left in this book. When I first started, I remember finding out things that I grew up hearing were in fact so wrong it was disgusting. I found that I had been lied to majority of my life from people who seemingly didn't even open the book themselves to fact check it.

       So coming into this saying that the information of the world is correct is complete and utter bullshit.

       Yes, an angel of the LORD on the LEFT hand side I.E. the dragon , that old serpent , which is the Devil , and Satan who is in the physical manifestation of Edom.
      </p>
      <p>
       See you reference the devil, and Satan is two different entities. Edom is Satan/man. Devil is Great dragon. This doesn't matter anyway sense seeing how the word devil, and Satan are more like insults than names, or titles. Ancient insults like the word fool you use all the time, that the Bible forbids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been to many churches myself, Baptist, penecostle, Catholic, Methodist, etc.
I assure you that they all interpret the Bible differently , and condemn each other to hell. They all read the same Bible, and worship the same god, but are so far away from each other it is embarrassing .
      </p>
      <p>
       All the churches I went to can't answer my questions. Just like you. They say oh don't think about that, that isn't important, just listen to our interpretation. 
Well interpretations are like assholes, everybody has one. You may as well insert the word opinion, instead of interpretation, cause that is all that it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the basic strategies in a divide and conquer tactic. We will never come together to solve anything, problems, because we are so divided up by race, religion, politics, etc. The Bible is mostly Jewish propaganda. Plain and simple. Just like the television. You watch the television enough it will brainwashed you. Your teachers have used the Bible as a tool to divide us .
      </p>
      <p>
       You can wait for a black god savior to come and save you from your horrible plight. I think that there would be a million Africans that would gladly change places with you in a heart beat. You have become spoiled in modern times. You forgot how bad you really used to have it. I am not that gullible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you find it convenient that there are a million different religions, and a million different interpretations? This is so the human race doesn't come together and shake off the evil Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep referencing to lineage. That doesn't mean they are black. There are two types of Jews. Your Hebrew jew that is dark skinned, and ashkenazi Jews, who appear more white skinned, and have lineage to ancient germany. This is probably the two types of Jews, not black African, or Mexican latinos, etc. This is just wishful thinking on your part. You wish you were a Jew, so you have to rationalize why.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep referencing how I am suppossed to debate you by using scripture, but you won't look at anything other than the Bible. You are like a child that puts his fingers in his ears, and says na, Na, Na ,Na I'm not listening. Why do I have to stick to certain guidelines when organized religion, and everything they teach is a joke? What you believe is a black version of organized religion. Free your mind and your ass will follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every organized religion really doesn't believe in the supernatural either. They rationalize word of god to be man, or something that man can understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked you about the flying triangles in the video you linked, and what you believe that it is?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have witnessed one of these flying triangles personally. It set and hovered for a few minutes, then shot of at incredible light speed. I have personally witnessed ghosts. If everything are reincarnated , why have I personally witnessed ghosts, and I have seen a child ghost too. Did not a child need to reincarnated, and not live eternity till judgement day as a ghost? I have seen incredible things, and experienced incredible things, not visions in my head, or spirit world bullshit, but in the real physical present world. What you teach to a man like me doesn't add up. I know I am merely white, and not a black god like being like you, who can't understand, but my personal experiences tells me there is a hell of a lot more to the world than your simple rational explanations for everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jonah and the whale is impossible to survive in the belly of a well. Use your damn brain. It had to be a submerged craft, like submarine of some sort. We know putting two, and four, of every animal on earth on a boat is impossible. Use your brain , sir. Noah had access to advance genetic technology. Taking the DNA of the animals, and re cloning the animal population. Gene splicing also explains some of the of creatures that represented several animals, or animals mixed with human genetics.  Don't think of Noah as a primitive nobody. He was a highly advanced genetics expert. With access to highly advanced technology.

       Where do you believe the cross symbol comes from? 
Why was Jesus crucified upon it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The cross symbol is the symbol of the sky god. Jesus was nailed to the symbol of the sky god. Why? When primitive man witnessed a plane flying over head , with the wings it looks like a cross when directly over head. Constantine saw this in the sky, and changed to Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       However before the Milvian Bridge battle he and his army saw a cross of light in the sky above the sun
      </p>
      <p>
       I assure you the Bible is speaking of advanced technology, and primitive man is trying to explain the best he knows how.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could any church that teaches the Bible, or preachers who went to school to be a preacher, could possibly understand this? They can't. They have been propagandized to near death. Like you. They will not listen to a word of it, unless it goes along with their religion the have been indoctrinated in.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will come around to this idea in the future.

       The illuminati, and knights templar are bringing about a false end of the world scenario using the bible as a tool. Im afraid even the very elect will be decieved. If the governments use project blue beam and create a false messiah in the sky, merely a hologram, would you fall for it?

       I believe it is merely population control. They want to dramatically reduce the worlds population, by having us destroy ourselves. They compare their created, manufactured, end of the world. To the flood of genesis. I am afraid if we keep waiting around for a savior we will all die in the end.

       Science can prove that the first humans were so called black.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I agree the black race was created first. When the Annunaki (predates Bible) came onto earth they mind minerals like good, and precious stones themselves. It started a problem, so they created the black race to work the mines. This took several tries though at creation. The white race was made later as a servant also. To tend the gardens of God. This actually predates the Bible. A lot of the Annunaki tablets became a lot of the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those images ancient old show Giants. By simple observation 9. feet is too short. Look up the images of the Annunaki tablets. The gods were I would say at least 15 to 20 feet tall.

       so you believe not in an Immortality food to be eaten?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
      </p>
      <p>
       23 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here he says become one of us, and uses the word cherubim's gaurding the way. Man has left the garden at this point.. The King of tyrus  was called a cherub. The anointed cherub. Therefore, if cherub was in the garden after man had been banished, a cherub can't be a man. The king of tyrus would not have been a man by the word of scripture.

       As for the King of Tyrus being anything other than a man, it is clear that this is metaphoric. He is referencing the spirit of Satan (the serpent) dwelling and influencing the King of Babylon.

       cherub original translation comes from Cheroub
      </p>
      <p>
       Latin cherub, from Greek cheroub, from Hebrew kerubh (plural kerubhim) "winged angel,"
      </p>
      <p>
       Greek pteron, meaning “wing,”
Greek angel is Angelo's meaning "messenger"
      </p>
      <p>
       This obviously means, in the original translation, winged (feather) messenger.
So a winged messenger of God and anointed guardian..

       No matter what you try to rationalize ,sir. Cherub means winged angel. If you made a cherub of gold it would be a golden winged object. If it represents a Chariot it has wings. 
Why would you think the ancient primitive man always referenced wings?
Angels always had wings? What to you is this symbolic of?
      </p>
      <p>
       It means the ability of flight. Wings means flight. A winged angel of god, by the original translations,,  would be- A messenger of God with the ability to fly . Could that be flying in a type of craft? Sure. I don't believe the angels personally had wings, but had the ability to fly lie birds, when ancient man could only dream of such things, and tried to describe the best they can.

       I am not saying that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The omophagia was the Dionysian act of eating raw flesh and drinking wine to consume the god. Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus' followers could achieve communion with the god.
      </p>
      <p>
       This pre dates the Jesus bread, and wine rituals.
This isn't a black Israelites practice. This was a Dionysus practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We celebrate Jesus birth the same as Dionysus.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with Jesus, December 25th and January 6th are both traditional birth dates in the Dionysian myth and simply represent the period of the winter solstice. Indeed, the winter-solstice date of the Greek sun and wine god Dionysus was originally recognized in early January but was eventually placed on December 25th, as related by ancient Latin writer Macrobius (c. 400 AD/CE). Regardless, the effect is the same: The winter sun god is born around this time, when the shortest day of the year begins to become longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus and Dionysus are both born of a virgin miraculous birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the common myth about the birth of Dionysus/Bacchus, Semele is mysteriously impregnated by one of Zeus's bolts of lightning--an obvi­ous miraculous/virgin conception.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black Israelites would have known that Jesus would turn water to wine at a wedding, when they were captive black Israelites?
      </p>
      <p>
       The miracles of Dionysus are legendary, as is his role as the god of wine, echoed in the later Christian story of Jesus multiplying the jars of wine at the wedding feast of Cana (Jn 2:1-9). "This story is really the Christian counterpart to the pagan legends of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, who at his annual festival in his temple of Elis filled three empty kettles with wine-no water needed! And on the fifth of January wine instead of water gushed from his temple at Andros. If we believe Jesus' miracle, why should we not believe Dionysus's? (Leedom, 125) Dionysus's miracle of changing water to wine is recounted in pre-Christian times by Diodorus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dionysus died and resurrected after three days.
Would the black Israelites have known this in captivity long before?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dionysus a solar hero, born of a virgin on "December 25th" or the winter solstice, performing miracles and receiving divine epithets, being killed, giving his blood as a sacrifice, resurrecting from the dead after three days in Hades/Hell, and ascending into heaven Included in the twelve Olympians, as the last of their number, and the only god born from a mortal mother. The cult of Dionysus is also a "cult of the souls"; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead. He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would the captive black isralites have now Jesus was going to be twice born, or teach born again?
      </p>
      <p>
       A jealous Hera again attempted to kill the child, this time by sending Titans to rip Dionysus to pieces after luring the baby with toys. It is said that he was mocked by the Titans who gave him a thyrsus (a fennel stalk) in place of his rightful sceptre.[21] Zeus turned the Titans into dust with his thunderbolts, but only after the Titans ate everything but the heart, which was saved, variously, by Athena, Rhea, or Demeter. Zeus used the heart to recreate him in his thigh, hence he was again "the twice-born".
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a legend, when Alexander the Great reached a city called Nysa near the Indus river, the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus. These travels took something of the form of military conquests; according to Diodorus Siculus he conquered the whole world except for Britain and Ethiopia.[27] Returning in triumph (he was considered the founder of the triumphal procession) he undertook to introduce his worship into Greece
      </p>
      <p>
       Would the black captive Israelites have now there coming Messiah would have to travel to and from by boat?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a measure of Bacchus's ambiguous position in classical mythology that he, unlike the other Olympians, had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated"
      </p>
      <p>
       Would they have now Jesus will bring the dead back to life just like Dionysus?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dionysus was of the few Olympians with the power to remove deceased mortals from the underworld, and thus restore them to life. He descended to the underworld (Hades) to rescue his mother Semele, whom he had not seen since his birth, making the descent by way of a reputedly bottomless pool on the coast of the Argolid near the prehistoric site of Lerna, and bypassing Thanatos, the god of death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dionysia and Lenaia festivals in Athens were dedicated to Dionysus. On numerous vases (referred to as Lenaia vases), the god is shown participating in the ritual sacrifice as a masked and clothed pillar (sometimes a pole, or tree is used), while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initiates worshipped him in the Dionysian Mysteries, which were comparable to and linked with the Orphic Mysteries, and may have influenced Gnosticism In the Orphic tradition of ancient Greece, Dionysus Zagreus served as its patron god connected to death and immortality, and symbolized the one who guides reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would they have relayed the story of Jesus and Plate while in captivity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Many identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying-and-returning god In The Bacchae where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity, which is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dionysus savior-god whose birth was observed on DEC-25. He was worshipped throughout much of the Middle East as well as in Greece. He had a center of worship in Jerusalem in the 1st century BCE. Some ancient coins were found in Gaza with Dionysus on one side and JHWH (Jehovah) on the other. In later years, his flesh and blood were symbolically eaten in the form of bread and wine. He was viewed as the son of Zeus, the Father God.

       Sounds just like Jesus huh?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The omophagia was the Dionysian act of eating raw flesh and drinking wine to consume the god. Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus' followers could achieve communion with the god.
       </p>
       <p>
        This pre dates the Jesus bread, and wine rituals. This isn't a black Israelites practice. This was a Dionysus practice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes I told you to worship your pagan religion, that's what you want do in your heart.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We celebrate Jesus birth the same as Dionysus. As with Jesus, December 25th and January 6th are both traditional birth dates in the Dionysian myth and simply represent the period of the winter solstice. Indeed, the winter-solstice date of the Greek sun and wine god Dionysus was originally recognized in early January but was eventually placed on December 25th, as related by ancient Latin writer Macrobius (c. 400 AD/CE). Regardless, the effect is the same: The winter sun god is born around this time, when the shortest day of the year begins to become longer.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yahawashi was not born on December 25th. That date is a day for Pagans to worship Baal, this is where the writers of the movie
       <strong>
        The Purge
       </strong>
       got their idea from. When our book was taken and used by others, they incorporated the idea of linking his birthday to this pagan ritual and even took St. Nicks ( A so called black man from Russia who gave toys to orphans) and changed it into Santa (Satan) Clause (Claws).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yahawashi was born in the spring time, it is spiritual that he would be born during a time of renewal, not in the winter when everything dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Luke 2:8 KJV
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jesus and Dionysus are both born of a virgin miraculous birth.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, wrong. Jesus had a father unlike your Greek savior.
      </p>
      <p>
       First we simply continue the story the same way it has always been.
      </p>
      <p>
       God told David that he would send him a
       <strong>
        KING THROUGH HIS SEED.
       </strong>
       (2 Samuel 7:12-14).
      </p>
      <p>
       David was of Judah as was Joseph as was Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Matthew 1:18-19 King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph,
       <strong>
        before they came together,
       </strong>
       she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is saying that they had no marriage ceremony, it was unbecoming of a woman at this time to have sex before marriage, even though it is sex that confirms a marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       19 Then Joseph her husband,
       <strong>
        being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So grandpa Joe put her away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when Yahawashi goes missing:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Luke 2:48 King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us?
        <strong>
         behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, referring to Joseph, the virgin birth is a made up conception by the catholic church to worship the woman. Why? Because rebellion, God is a man.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Exodus 15:3 King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        3 The Lord is a
        <strong>
         man
        </strong>
        of war: the Lord is his name.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       All the rest is bullshit from a King who was known for so much
       <strong>
        whitewashing
       </strong>
       they literally gave it a term
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization">
        Hellenization
       </a>
       hell is the root word.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no doubt about it, the so called white man is the strongest, most prideful, most deadly, most cunning predator the world has ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even then, I still have faith that the devil shall be brought down from his high places, to worship the feet of those whom they have made small.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Jeremiah 22:13King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       Wow you are hard headed.

      <p>
       So you don't believe in real gods, just evil whites?
And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
      </p>
      <p>
       2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

       3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically says AND AFTER, they were the men of renown. They were the kings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you also blaspheme and not believe there were true giants of stature?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not truly believe that they lived expansive life spans of hundreds of years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sons of god are the angels, or it would say sons of man.

       You use the term devil as a name, but we know its not . we've been over this. 
Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you consider gods work of serving in the natural order of the world, your proper place, as unrighteousness.

       You prosper more than your ancestors could have dreamed for their small part. You are being rewarded now. What is so bad about your life?

       If there were giants from the angels intercourse with the women of men , who became the men of renown, then what is so hard to believe that the reference to the king of Tyrus couldn't be just that. A god king whom the lord condemns? He says he is a cherub.

       Your attempt to write me off as some sort of common racist is futile. I showed you there are white Israelite's via video twice. What you are trying to do is put the words of God in a box. I never said there were only Black Israelite's. The southern kingdoms are black (Benjamin, Levi, Judah). While the other 10 northern tribes (Native Americans, Latinos), left for America long before the southern tribes were forced to come over here. Although brother Gad was a formidable opponent, unlike Judah who was more of a priest, Gad and Ruben would never surrender. Only 5% of my brothers and sisters left.

       That is stupid and directly contradicts the bible, and everything it says.
The difference between you and I is you choose what to believe, what to rationalize, what is a metaphor, etc. You don't read the word of god as the word of god. If you did you would believe . you don't truly believe. If you did when he says giants, that man was as if a grasshopper to, were just that what the bible says.

       If giants, serpent race, fallen angels, etc. Is what a called upon man of god has to deal with, then he wouldn't call on you. You would just rationalize the unrational, and wet the bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word of god is not so cut and dry, because just like the serpent race, giants are in every religion, and account of history for every civilization that has ever lived on earth. Some that are so old they predate the bible by a long shot .
      </p>
      <p>
       When David slew Goliath a giant, you take away from the word of god when you say, oh no David slew a great warrior, not a giant of stature?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't contradict the bible. Instead of true faith, you are like a walking encyclopedia of rationalization, because you fear not being taken serious if you believe in the supernatural events of the bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are talking to a white man with true faith. A true believer. Not a rationalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe in the biblical cosmology of the earth, or science lies about a spinning globe with no foundation spinning on nothingness, or do you believe the earth is on its foundation, and does not move. The bible is a flat earth book. Do you believe in the flat earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you blaspheme, and mix man made science in with bible? The bible is no doubt a flat earth book. With a firmament dome above, four corners of the earth, laid on its foundation,etc.

       Hey, look. I really do have some respect for a good black person. If to believe the Bible, and be a good Christian , you have to make it a black god, then fine. I'm all for it. Whatever it takes for you to listen to the words of god. As long as it doesn't warp into some twisted jihad crap. I'm fine with you believing this. I believe in what the Bible tells us. Maybe you just can't imagine real Giants, or good Kings with supernatural powers, etc., but I can , and I know.

       You have to ask yourself:
      </p>
      <p>
       All these so called poor black,Hispanic,native american,whites sitting on these corners yelling to society that the world is ending and nothing happens to them. The police literally watch them at times screaming about how the white man is the devil and go into all this stuff about our government being corrupt and do nothing. People walk by get into debates with them, sometimes heated arguments just because they read something from the Bible. It's interesting to watch, I've heard no reports from any of the camps of someone coming up and trying to fatally hurt them or anything. What is protecting them? Those were the thoughts that were running through my head when I first understood what they were claiming. How do they have so much faith in something that could only
       <em>
        possibly
       </em>
       exists. How did they have that much faith in the words of some old book translated a million times? Why did it even survive?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's when I decided to read for myself using their concept, I had to see what they were talking about. It began to make sense and I've been studying ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it coincidence that the first amendment would protect them? I don't think so. I think the freedom of speech was a gift from God just as much as I think the 2nd amendment is a gift to Esau.

       Well I now what it means to me. I was asking your opinion. I guess wanting to know someone else's different opinion on something is , to you, not me, meaning I am dumb, and don't now anything.

       That would be typical of your people. Taking kindness for weakness, and not listening, only speaking.

       So called Europeans are not to labeled the serpent race but rather the seed of the serpent. So called white people might attribute some of the characteristics of the snake but rest assured, we all come from Adam, via Noah.

       The beasts of the field are the animals you are expecting to see anytime you watch a b.c. movie, I.E. lions, horses tigers, monkeys, zebras etc. You might see a lion sitting around in a throne room casually because they were tamed.

       You know there is an opposing white doctrine to your black is god religion right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I
      </p>
      <p>
       God's first Divine Law, when He created the earth and everything upon it, was everything after its kind whose seed is in itself. He states this very clearly ten times in the first chapter of Genesis. It applies to all living matter, even vegetable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genesis 1:11: "And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so."
      </p>
      <p>
       Genesis 1:12: "And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
      </p>
      <p>
       Genesis 1:21: "And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
      </p>
      <p>
       Genesis 1:24: "And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and Beast of the Earth after his kind: and it was so."
      </p>
      <p>
       Genesis 1:25: "And God made the Beast of the Earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
      </p>
      <p>
       In Genesis 1:27-31, it says God created male and female, tells them to be fruitful, multiply and have dominion over every living thing, and God beheld everything that He had made and it was good. Everything that God made has its seed within itself, therefore it is good because it produces only its own kind. Like begets like. Never do the simpler forms of life violate this law unless forced to by the higher form, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       When different races mix, they do not bring forth their own kind; their offspring are mongrels or hybrids. This is a transgression against Divine Law, upsetting Nature's delicate balance and producing that which is not good. Little wonder that, so often in the past, God has destroyed His own children for mongrelizing, and, you can be sure, He will again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deuteronomy 7:6: "For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth." The Adamic Race is to have dominion over every form of life previously created. This includes not only the four legged beasts, but the two legged as well. The Negro is an articulate member of this Beast Creation. For proof that they are beasts, and God calls them exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 23:10-11: "And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard."
      </p>
      <p>
       If wild or even domesticated animals were beasts of the field, just picture what would happen to your gardens and vineyards. Note the distinction God makes here between the "poor of thy people" and the "beasts of the field" the poor of thy people shall eat first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 9:9: "And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt."
You can be sure God was not punishing four legged beasts by afflicting them with boils.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leviticus 20:15-16: "And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."
      </p>
      <p>
       This certainly could not be a four legged beast that a man or woman could lie with. If it were, God would not demand the death penalty for a dumb animal with no reasoning power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exodus 19:13: "There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount."
Now we have a beast with a hand. Do you believe God told Moses to talk to the camels, donkeys, cattle and tell them not to touch the mount?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 7:20: "Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast..."
Jeremiah 21:6: "And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence."
Would God refer to a four legged beast as an inhabitant of a city?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 27:6: "And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him."
The Negro race has always been used as servants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 31:27-30: "...the seed of man, and with the seed of beast...But every one shall die for his own iniquity."
How can an animal die for his sins and iniquity? They cannot because they do not know God’s Laws so they cannot sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 31:34: "And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
      </p>
      <p>
       Ezekiel 14:15: "If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts."
Only two legged beasts could stop man from passing through the land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ezekiel 29:11: "No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years."
Now the beast inhabitant not only has a hand but a foot as well. Animals have hoofs or paws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jonah 3:7-8: "Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands."
What manner of beast would wear sackcloth; have the power of speech and, once again, we see that the beast has hands?
      </p>
      <p>
       Zechariah 8:10: "For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast..."
Here we have beasts that can be hired.
The great boast of modern civilization is its unparalleled degree of enlightenment when compared with preceding ages. While marvelous advances have been made in the realm of many sciences, in other respects we are still groping about in a clouded maze of misconceptions. Colleges and universities have been taken over by aliens and are teaching as truth philosophies which have no substance in actual fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, because the doctrines of the atheistic school of natural development are accepted as the acme of scholarship, specifically the theory of the evolution of the species, the door to understanding has been fastened shut in regard to the true origin of the races.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible stands as an impregnable bulwark against today's modern slogan that all men, regardless of color, are blood brothers. The patriarchs of the Bible, the prophets of old, the apostles of the early Christian Church, do not support this view. Nevertheless, under the operation of the Law of the Lord, all are entitled to equality of justice and righteousness in judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple truth regarding the origin of the races demonstrates conclusively that the Negroes and the White Race do not have a common ancestry.
      </p>
      <p>
       A full grasp of this fact will go a long way toward solving racial problems which are menacing the entire world today. When the undeniable truth is known and acted upon, it will bring about an abrupt and complete cessation of the present attempt to elevate the colored races or Jews to positions of authority over those whom the Lord instructed: "Thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother."
      </p>
      <p>
       So we respectfully ask that you bring to this study an open mind in search of truth. And we feel that if you do you will find that a careful weighing of the evidence presented herein will result in an astounding comprehension of aspects of the story the Bible tells which has long been hidden from view

       He never wanted it, all your people care about is the Matrix. You have to conquer everything because naturally that's what you were made for. This is why your history with paganism and devil worship is no shock to those of us that see the truth. You are bound to the flesh and that is why you love to sin. Why genociding entire races is just a shrug of the shoulder.

       You have to stop pulling from Job without the full context because Job is one of the most metaphoric books in the scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
       The morning star is a reference to those who hold power in the heavens. The spirit of Satan as I've mentioned before works for God. As I've also mentioned before, Satan is God's creation and everything he does is because Yahawah instructed him to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at the start of the book you pulled this from.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Job 1:6-12 KJV
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        6 Now there was a day
        <em>
         when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here we see that the Israelite's go to talk to God, Satan comes along with them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        7
        <em>
         And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       God even asks Satan, where are you coming from? Satan replies from going throughout the world trying men, which is exactly what Satan was created by God to do.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        8 And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
       </p>
       <p>
        9 Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
       </p>
       <p>
        10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
       </p>
       <p>
        11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
       </p>
       <p>
        12 And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yahawah and Satan even go into a full blown conversation about one of the elect (JOB). Satan even goes on to say, "you put a protection around him, that's why he's so blessed" let me see if I can try him.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shows us that Satan is controlled by God. Meaning Satan is God's top angel on the LEFT side, while Christ is his top angel on the RIGHT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will Christ rule over Satan? Of course he will because he is/will be the brightest morning star.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Revelation 2:26-28
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:

       Sir let me put it this way. There are a million different types of Christians, all with there own set of interpretations, that you will all disagree with and damn each other with. How are you correct over a Pentecostal, a catholic, a bapstist, etc. And you will all damn each other to hell and say you are incorrect amungst each other for eternity.?
      </p>
      <p>
       For every ass there is an interpretation. Which is just that simply an interpretation. Which doesn't mean you are correct. That is what an interpretation is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The morning star is a reference to those who hold power in the heavens.

      <p>
       That would be an angel then. What the hell are you arguing about?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could line up a million different Christians, and they will have a million different interpretation . Simply put, you all don't know much because you refuse to look at history and the other religions of the world. You say the other religions are myth. Those religions would say the bible is a myth. Even the bible believers call each other damned for not believing an interpretation. Quit interpreting everything, and read the damn book for what it says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like your misguided interpretations, most christian interpretation of the bible is in the eye of the beholder. Nothing more.

       Who is Yahawashi coming to save?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets find it:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Matthew 15:24 King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        24 But he answered and said,
        <strong>
         I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

      <p>
       <strong>
        John 4:22King James Version (KJV)

        <strong>

       Who did Paul Pray for?

      <p>
       <strong>
        Romans 9:2-5
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
       </p>
       <p>
        3 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ
        <strong>
         for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        4
        <strong>
         Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;

       </p>
       <p>
        5
        <strong>

      <p>
       So we have this reoccurring narrative that salvation will only be to the Israelite's throughout the entire Bible and yet for some reason, it doesn't sink in for some, certainly not Esau who seeks it carefully with tears.

       Who is god? I am that I am is not enough to go on. 
The Jews worship Cronus/Saturn. He is not Zeus. Is this god? You seem to think you know god. Who is god?

       Why would your god let such misery happen to your people?

        Moses was born a Hebrew – Israelite from the tribe of Levi (Exodus 2:1-3). He spent 40 years in the House of Pharaoh (Acts 7:23) and from the time he was an infant, passed as the Pharaoh’s grandson (Exodus 2: 6, 10). This was during the same time that Pharaoh ordered all Hebrew males under the age of two to be killed. So, if Pharaoh, was a black-skinned descendant of Khawm / Ham, which he was, it would of course follow that Moses was black-skinned also.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moses was raised in the house of Pharaoh, as the grandson of Pharaoh, when Pharaoh ordered all other Hebrew males to be killed at birth. If the Israelites were a white-skinned people, how could Moses the Hebrew survive (secretly) in the house of Pharaoh among black-skinned Egyptians for 40 years, and not be noticed. Scripture tells us that Moses killed an Egyptian, after he saw him mistreating a Hebrew. So Moses had to flee from Egypt for his life because Pharaoh found out and sought to kill him (Exodus 2:12-15).

       It is clear who has the nappy wooly hair in the world. It is also clear that if we took a peice of brown brass and tossed it into a furnace and pulled it out, it would be an even darker brown.

If god made you he made white, like all other races for a reason. So Cain is the evil whites, serpent genesis is evil whites, dragon revelation evil whites, edom evil whites, etc., etc., etc.

       If Greek myth has no purpose then why all the ancient sites, and temples. Athens named after Athena, Zeus daughter? Countless statues, sites, architecture and temples for something that holds no purpose , because they don't bow down to a Jewish god? Hindu, Buddhists, Muslim, etc. They do not bow down to Jewish gods therefore their religion, myth, history is made up and has no purpose also? Why must we have a Jewish god for the past to be validated? Seems like the bible has become a brainwashing tool if anything in these modern times.

       Sooo if I don't believe the black race is the true Israelites then I have no faith. Judge not lest ye be judged. My faith is unwavering. It is all in the family. That is why as humans we aren't allowed to judge the gods, or a servant of another master. You will simply be judged for the life you lived, and these white gods you hate so much will be your judge.

       No. If you don't follow the laws, statues and commandments of God you have no faith. The skin edification is nothing but to show you that the world is inverted and that now the children of Israel are persecuted by your leaders. Black is color.

       The difference is, Yahawah has existed the longest and provided the context to this reality. Everything around you surfaced because of this ancient artifact.

       I read everything you wrote me. You just fail to accurately make your case. The claims you make don't hold water. You are simply talking out your ass, then send biblical quotes that hold no water to tour claims, and say oh you can't see the spiritual side, or you mean your misguided interpretations. 
You need to quit interpreting the bible as you see fit, and read it for what it says. Like Satan the devil the great dragon that old serpent is just that a serpent, snake. Have you been so propagandized you can't simply read the bible for what it says, not what you think your interpretation means. Maybe we should all do a lot less interpreting and start taking the bible for what it says. You can rebell all you want from the white man. No black god will save you. You will just find yourself in more trouble and heart ache than before.

       Some Christians will be irked by your mixing of religion and myth, but I think it's a valid practice in order to figure out what is going on.  I am starting to think the whole reality we are presented with, from news, science, sports, mainstream events etc is totally symbolic.

       Have you heard of Melek Taus, the Peacock god of the Yazidis?
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Yazidi consider Tawûsê Melek an emanation of God and a good, benevolent angel who has redeemed himself from his fall and has become a demiurge who created the cosmos from the Cosmic egg. After he repented, he wept for 7,000 years, his tears filling seven jars, which then quenched the fires of hell. Yazidis believe Tawûsê Melek is not a source of evil or wickedness. They consider him to be the leader of the archangels, not a still-fallen nor a still-disgraced angel, but a forgiven one and an emanation of God himself."
      </p>
      <p>
       This peacock symbolism also parallels that of the phoenix. But I thought the phoenix was associated with Ra. Is Ra Lucifer? Jesus and the Archangel Michael were also often depicted with peacock feathers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was under the impression that Ra was the sun (good), Saturn was karma (natural law) and Venus was Lucifer (autistic).

       Melek taus I'm not that familiar with enough to discuss, but I'll look into it. Amen-ra is Zeus. Venus is Aphrodite, she gets mixed with Lucifer a lot of times. Aphrodite would be ishtar. All the angels , or gods are referred to as stars symbolically in the bible. The ancient people would also mix gods. What is better than one gods favor? Multiple gods favor. I personally can't tell you what to believe. I am telling you what the illuminati believe, but you are definitely on the right track, and I'll look more into Yazidi. I haven't gave it much effort, but I'm sure there is a lot of significance in it.
