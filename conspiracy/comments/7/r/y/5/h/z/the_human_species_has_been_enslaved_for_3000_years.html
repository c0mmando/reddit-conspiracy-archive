Is it fair that a landscaper makes $12/hr while someone doing minimal work in a cubicle makes $25/hr? Is it us vs. our peers or do we trust that the wealthy and the government are really looking out for us?

    <div class="md"><p>It is not about being proven wrong.  I could care less about being right or wrong.  The important thing is to take control of our lives, to regain our freedom.  </p>

<p>What can happen is people can be allowed to install solar panels so they no longer have to pay taxpayer subsidized utility companies.  The utility companies do not need to be for profit, especially if this interferes with our ability to reduce our energy needs from coal and nuclear.  The utility companies hamper our ability to go off grid because they want us to pay them, even though we already pay them through taxpayer subsidies.  </p>

<p>I am not sure about the logic behind the law prohibiting gardens in front yards.  More people should garden, though.   </p>

<p>As for currencies, the Federal Reserve needs to be nationalized because it keeps us in perpetual debt.  I think we need to have multiple currencies available, such as the USD as well as several cryptocurrencies.  That way, we can prevent a small group of greedy people from enslaving us.  Money is slavery.  That is how they control us.  </p>

<p>Fruit bearing trees in the front for that curb appeal. He&#39;ll, even fruit bushes would be allowed as long as it&#39;s presentable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only prohibitive if you allow it to prohibit you. Solar panels are cheap and can allow you to stay in the burbs and be off grid. Produce a surplus, feed back into the grid, and they pay you.</p>

<p>Point Is, it can be done no matter where you are. Can you produce enough for a family of 4 on a half acre? I haven&#39;t tried, only for myself on maybe 150 ft sq, a supplement in the food see a goes a long way regardless, but I know with some research and ingenuity it can be done</p>

<p>Might take a look into what happens if you get caught producing over a certain dollar amount of produce though. Gotta pay both fines and taxes for it. </p>

<p>The system is very much against self sustenance, any way you slice it. It&#39;s not a matter of argument, these are the laws. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t be homeless, you can&#39;t be self sufficient. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on where you are and where you go. Every municipality is different. The larger cities discourage it because you must be productive for the system. Same with the outlying areas of major cities, large neighborhoods, HOA, etc.</p>

<p>Solar panels aren&#39;t THAT expensive, they can be paid off over time. And, again, depends on where you are on how fast you can pay them off. If you&#39;re only putting up 100 dollars every month where you live, you&#39;re already fucked: move on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you live that would make you pay for producing your own food over a certain dollar amount. I&#39;m gonna need a source for that. County clerks office has what you need.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done my research, and I&#39;ve lived that life. I don&#39;t like lazy excuses when there are viable answers to do what you need to do to supplement your income, mitigate expense moreso, in any environment by being nearer to self sufficiency and all you have to do is a little book reading, think, get out a sketch pad, put pen to paper, and then do it.</p>

<p>Hydroponics indoors. Dig a hole, make a pond, aerate and filter, put in fish. 10x10 greenhouse. Another 10x10 plot. Still enough room for a shed and a swing set for most homes.</p>

<p>If you want to accept that you live in a system that says you can&#39;t, you never will. Don&#39;t blame me for not taking no for an answer and telling them I dare you.</p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;ve bought with loans is my house, solar panels on a loan in my area are about $30,000 to cover my costs. Looked into building them myself, as I&#39;m pretty diy, and it&#39;s still over 10,000. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t make excuses for myself, but to continue the initial point; there are laws to make self sufficiency difficult if not impossible, and it takes a lot of money to go off grid and stay in my area. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve done the off grid thing before, non local. It can be a great way of life, but if 90% of the people you love are in the system, for me, it wasn&#39;t worth being off the grid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except everything is stopping you, because most self sustaining methods are illegal. Also youre not exempt from paying taxes. The government has created conditions where everyone needs to rely in it rather than rely on the community. Local businesses such as butchers and bakeries are either being bought by big corporations or end up going bankrupt. Factory farmed meat and gmo fruit/veg is all average people can afford, because organic produce is three times the price. So living off the grid is hardly an option unless youre very rich or migrate to a different country </p>

<p>Alright, what&#39;s your alternative? Everyone contributes, including thankless, difficult, and dangerous tasks, because they feel like it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no simple answer.</p>

<p>Thankless: humanity has to learn to be grateful for things.
Difficult: eh, to a lot of people that&#39;s just a challenge. Also, what might seem difficult to one is what others like to do for breakfast.
Dangerous: a lot of people like to do dangerous things.</p>

<p>Not sure if that answers your question. Discuss.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can complain, but currency is around because there isn&#39;t really a better system. Nothing&#39;s stopping you from going off the grid and self sustaining if you want to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except, as many have pointed out, basically everything. The system is set up to stop you from doing that.</p>

<p>Housing and land prices have risen to stellar levels. Sure, you say, just move to a cheap barren rock and build your life there. Without electricity, without company, without ready access to tools and building materials, far away from your home country.</p>

<p>So what is your unstoppable way of going off-grid that doesn&#39;t require gianormous sacrifices? Because I&#39;d really like to know.</p>
