       It’s a shame that we’re enslaved. We could be doing the most magnificent feats as a race. Alas, this paper in my wallet controls my life. Wake up. We are the only race in this galaxy to use currency. We can all look out for one another. They are trying to divide us. Illumanti confirmed.

       You can complain, but currency is around because there isn't really a better system. Nothing's stopping you from going off the grid and self sustaining if you want to.

       Then you move somewhere else. You can't have the best of both worlds. If someone hates the idea of money that much, they can't expect to live in the middle of an area where everyone else has agreed to base their society on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are places around the world where that's definitely possible to do. It might be hard, but you can't expect something like renouncing currency not to be. There are millions of people that live with no money usage at all in my country.

       We could have instead worked to shorten the workweek with each new technology introduced. Creating more jobs for people to work less. We could reduce them even further with each coming step until we have enough technology to be self sustaining.

       We work more now for a worse standard of living than they did in the 50's.  Back then, you could support a family of four on a single income and still have a nice house and car.  All of this was stolen from us by the bankers.

       I think the whole point of the OP is that money is the shackle and is an arbitrary method of control, mostly through fear. At the base level, it’s an exchange of your labor for goods and services. But, what’s fair?
Is it fair that a landscaper makes $12/hr while someone doing minimal work in a cubicle makes $25/hr? Is it us vs. our peers or do we trust that the wealthy and the government are really looking out for us?
Nothing was stolen from us. We have willingly turned over the power.

       It is not about being proven wrong.  I could care less about being right or wrong.  The important thing is to take control of our lives, to regain our freedom.

      <p>
       What can happen is people can be allowed to install solar panels so they no longer have to pay taxpayer subsidized utility companies.  The utility companies do not need to be for profit, especially if this interferes with our ability to reduce our energy needs from coal and nuclear.  The utility companies hamper our ability to go off grid because they want us to pay them, even though we already pay them through taxpayer subsidies.

       I am not sure about the logic behind the law prohibiting gardens in front yards.  More people should garden, though.

       As for currencies, the Federal Reserve needs to be nationalized because it keeps us in perpetual debt.  I think we need to have multiple currencies available, such as the USD as well as several cryptocurrencies.  That way, we can prevent a small group of greedy people from enslaving us.  Money is slavery.  That is how they control us.

       The thing is, you
       <em>
        can

       though. There are just many reasons why people choose not to, like the ones you listed. If you want to fish without a license or camp in the wilderness, I am sure there are plenty of places you can go for that. I'm sure you wont get into too much trouble for all that down in Africa or maybe deep in the Australian outback.

       What I'm saying is that ability and potential ("I can") is not a binary thing. It's about degrees of barriers and obstacles. I could get into debt and buy a Ferrari. No problem. But do I want to? Heck no. It's just too expensive and not useful enough to do it. But I'm short of a Ferrari, and sometimes I might be unhappy about it. Now let's assume I go and explain that online, and all people are telling me "But you CAN do it!!". ;)

       There are plenty of places in the US where you could grow vegetables in your front yard and fish without a license, and there are good reasons why those aren't allowed in urban or suburban areas. It isn't like you could sustain yourself on 50 square feet of dirt anyway.

       Algae? You don't seem to know much about sq footage or aquaponics. 
Can grow a lot in small spaces, and pretty much anything which doesn't require long dry periods.

       Fruit bearing trees in the front for that curb appeal. He'll, even fruit bushes would be allowed as long as it's presentable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only prohibitive if you allow it to prohibit you. Solar panels are cheap and can allow you to stay in the burbs and be off grid. Produce a surplus, feed back into the grid, and they pay you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point Is, it can be done no matter where you are. Can you produce enough for a family of 4 on a half acre? I haven't tried, only for myself on maybe 150 ft sq, a supplement in the food see a goes a long way regardless, but I know with some research and ingenuity it can be done

       Heads up, solar panels are not as cheap as you might think. Even building your own is several thousand dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I grow food in my back yard, but I've still got space out front.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might take a look into what happens if you get caught producing over a certain dollar amount of produce though. Gotta pay both fines and taxes for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system is very much against self sustenance, any way you slice it. It's not a matter of argument, these are the laws.

       You can't be homeless, you can't be self sufficient.

       It depends on where you are and where you go. Every municipality is different. The larger cities discourage it because you must be productive for the system. Same with the outlying areas of major cities, large neighborhoods, HOA, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solar panels aren't THAT expensive, they can be paid off over time. And, again, depends on where you are on how fast you can pay them off. If you're only putting up 100 dollars every month where you live, you're already fucked: move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know where you live that would make you pay for producing your own food over a certain dollar amount. I'm gonna need a source for that. County clerks office has what you need.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've done my research, and I've lived that life. I don't like lazy excuses when there are viable answers to do what you need to do to supplement your income, mitigate expense moreso, in any environment by being nearer to self sufficiency and all you have to do is a little book reading, think, get out a sketch pad, put pen to paper, and then do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hydroponics indoors. Dig a hole, make a pond, aerate and filter, put in fish. 10x10 greenhouse. Another 10x10 plot. Still enough room for a shed and a swing set for most homes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to accept that you live in a system that says you can't, you never will. Don't blame me for not taking no for an answer and telling them I dare you.

       The only thing I've bought with loans is my house, solar panels on a loan in my area are about $30,000 to cover my costs. Looked into building them myself, as I'm pretty diy, and it's still over 10,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't make excuses for myself, but to continue the initial point; there are laws to make self sufficiency difficult if not impossible, and it takes a lot of money to go off grid and stay in my area.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've done the off grid thing before, non local. It can be a great way of life, but if 90% of the people you love are in the system, for me, it wasn't worth being off the grid.

       I have grown more food than a family of 5 could eat on far less than half an acre.  Filled a pantry with canned goods I grew and still gave away significant amounts to local food pantry and anyone who wanted it.

       I'm a big proponent of self-sufficient living.  If I can't get it, repair it, or do it (whatever "it" may be) then I think long and hard on whether I actually need it.

       Had high hopes for that "Power Wall" by Tesla.  But looking at the cost ($6,200 USD) and the lifespan (10 years), it hasn't convinced me it's worth it. At $620 per year, we use less than that, cost wise, in electricity from the grid.

       Except everything is stopping you, because most self sustaining methods are illegal. Also youre not exempt from paying taxes. The government has created conditions where everyone needs to rely in it rather than rely on the community. Local businesses such as butchers and bakeries are either being bought by big corporations or end up going bankrupt. Factory farmed meat and gmo fruit/veg is all average people can afford, because organic produce is three times the price. So living off the grid is hardly an option unless youre very rich or migrate to a different country

       Vote with your dollar. Buy organic produce. Prices go down when demand goes up. They won't make it if we don't buy it. It IS in our hands and we have a responsibility to do our part if we want to see change. It won't happen overnight, but it won't happen at all if we don't do our part as individuals.

       Learn to cook at the basic level. Organic in dry beans, whole chicken, 2-4 lbs meat vs 1lb, ect. Organic is harder to afford if it's already done for you too (like buying chicken breasts vs the whole chicken). Getting it in bigger or non prepared portions and freezing some after cooking makes it easier to afford. We go without alot to buy organics though, especially in milk!

       Thankless: humanity has to learn to be grateful for things.
Difficult: eh, to a lot of people that's just a challenge. Also, what might seem difficult to one is what others like to do for breakfast.
Dangerous: a lot of people like to do dangerous things.

        You can complain, but currency is around because there isn't really a better system. Nothing's stopping you from going off the grid and self sustaining if you want to.

       Except, as many have pointed out, basically everything. The system is set up to stop you from doing that.

       Housing and land prices have risen to stellar levels. Sure, you say, just move to a cheap barren rock and build your life there. Without electricity, without company, without ready access to tools and building materials, far away from your home country.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is your unstoppable way of going off-grid that doesn't require gianormous sacrifices? Because I'd really like to know.

       The ultimate incentive for anyone: don’t have to go to that 9-5 in that cubicle in New York City. The value of knowledge is much better alternative. You show me how to do that I’ll show you how to do this, etc. Positive energy will rise again, this planet is full of hatred.

       Scarcity was a result of the aftermath of the cataclysm. Greed wasn't caused by money but it was definitely amplified by it. I disagree but, the greenbacks are definitely to blame.

       Vote with your dollar. Buy organic produce. Prices go down when demand goes up. They won't make it if we don't buy it. It IS in our hands and we have a responsibility to do our part if we want to see change. It won't happen overnight, but it won't happen at all if we don't do our part as individuals.

       What I'm saying is that ability and potential ("I can") is not a binary thing. It's about degrees of barriers and obstacles. I could get into debt and buy a Ferrari. No problem. But do I want to? Heck no. It's just too expensive and not useful enough to do it. But I'm short of a Ferrari, and sometimes I might be unhappy about it. Now let's assume I go and explain that online, and all people are telling me "But you CAN do it!!". ;)

       Learn to cook at the basic level. Organic in dry beans, whole chicken, 2-4 lbs meat vs 1lb, ect. Organic is harder to afford if it's already done for you too (like buying chicken breasts vs the whole chicken). Getting it in bigger or non prepared portions and freezing some after cooking makes it easier to afford. We go without alot to buy organics though, especially in milk!
