        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Increasingly I sense that the world is becoming nonsensical, where the idea of taking things for their true meaning has fallen by the wayside. Many elements of Orwell&#39;s 1984 have turned out to be prophetic, and one element in particular is the way language and concepts have become twisted to the point that they are almost useless. In the novel, The Party dictates that &quot;War is peace; freedom is slavery; ignorance is strength&quot;, and history is constantly rewritten so that people don&#39;t see how the current positions of the party often come to contradict their past ones. It may not have become quite as extreme as this in the real world, but I certainly notice plenty of contradictions and nonsensical positions that have become accepted as part of modern society.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hillary Clinton is often considered left-wing, despite the fact she is a neoliberal, globalist hawk, a long, long way away from leftism.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is treated as a paragon of the modern conservative right, or even the far-right/alt-right, despite the fact he was once a democrat who supported legalised abortion, marijuana legalisation being a state issue, and who was once quoted as saying “I like the idea of amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include a ban of discrimination based on sexual orientation. It would be simple”. I&#39;m not saying Trump isn&#39;t right-wing now, he clearly is. But the idea that he is has so swiftly become a contemporary <em>paragon</em> of the right, someone who wholeheartedly represents the ideals of the modern hard-right, is a harder pill to swallow. It feels much more like he is simply doing whatever he can to gain money and power.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea that Trump is &quot;anti-establishment&quot;. I can see that he is outside of the political establishment to some degree, but the Trump family has been an influential part of the elite long before Trump was even alive. If this is what is considered outside of the establishment then it&#39;s depressingly clear that the scope is extremely narrow. Or maybe the &quot;anti-establishment&quot; line is all just an empty piece of manipulation. </p></li>
<li><p>The concept that Brexit was a right-wing movement. Back in the 80s, the EU was widely derided by the left and far-left. The likes of Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn represented the most traditionally left-wing side of the Labour party, and they were not shy to share their grievances with the EU. The politics of the EU has changed little since then, and yet now we&#39;re made to believe that supporting the EU is actually a left-wing thing, and criticising it is something only the right or far-right would do. How an unelected group of neoliberal bankers bullishly ruling Europe is possibly supposed to fit in with leftism is never explained, but nonetheless every left-wing newspaper supports the EU wholeheartedly. On the other hand, many of the areas with the most leave voters are Labour strongholds. This is largely ignored by the MSM.</p></li>
<li><p>Muslims are one of the most powerful forces of conservatism in the world, and yet in the West their most staunch defenders are liberals, and their most fierce attackers are the far-right. Moreover, left-wingers and liberals often state that Islam &quot;is a religion of peace&quot;, as if this is actually the religion&#39;s tagline. In reality it&#39;s a neologism which was invented by George Bush&#39;s speech writer, and the religion&#39;s prophet was someone who, according to Islamic texts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Banu_Qurayza">slaughtered hundreds of Jews and enslaved their wives.</a> </p></li>
<li><p>So-called liberals are perhaps the worst offenders when it comes to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/nine-10-uk-universities-free-speech-restrict-rankings-joseph-rowntree-cardiff-ediburgh-newcastle-a7577381.html">censorship in universities.</a> Free-speech is of course a fundamental tenet of liberalism.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s becoming increasingly common to find self-proclaimed leftists who support globalism and see anti-globalism as a right-wing ideal. Globalism couldn&#39;t possibly fit into leftism less. It means the working man has to complete with the effective slavery that can be found in many third-world countries. It leads to corporations becoming incredibly big and incredibly powerful. It makes tax dodging easier. And yet, many so-called leftists think it fits perfectly into leftism, and looking at the MSM, it&#39;s easy to see how they have been brainwashed into thinking this.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could keep going, but I think I&#39;ll finish there. I suppose my last point is that in a world where terms and concepts become meaningless, where context is often forgotten, it becomes impossible to have meaningful discussions. Without the ability to properly communicate, we are powerless. Perhaps this is all part of a larger plan.</p>

<p>PS: A couple of other classics would of course be Kissinger winning the Nobel Peace Prize, and Blair being made Middle East Peace Envoy, although they are less current. Still, it all set the stage for the world we live in now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really correct. </p>

<p>Liberalism would be free speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, democracy, equality, and civil rights.</p>

<p>Conservativism would be tradition, morality/ethics based on traditional values, social hierarchy, property rights, and usually a positive attitude towards fiscal liberty, and a more authoritarian attitude towards social liberty.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re witnessing streamlining of thought, a natural process being sped along by technology. To some extent it&#39;s necessary to hold a society together. Sadly for us, here in America it&#39;s creating two major tribes and pulling them apart. We have trouble communicating because our cultures, our frames of reference, are becoming incompatible. This used to mostly be a problem of religion. </p>

<p>Take two kids, one from the deep South and one from, say, Portland. The education they receive, the media they consume, their family dynamics, the ideas they hear will all be very different. It&#39;s not surprising we end up with two adults who see the world in very different lights (this conformity is of course not universal.) Cynical, greedy folks are happy to exploit that, sometimes in the laziest ways possible, sometimes more subtly. But they only have power over those who buy into their narratives. </p>

<p>The answer, as far as I can tell, is to break out of the thought patterns that control you. Easier said than done, probably never completely possible, but worth the effort. Read history, travel if you can, learn a language and dig into another culture&#39;s literature. Make art, learn math, go hiking. All will give you a stronger platform to view the world from. Don&#39;t take the easy way out of guided thought and disinterest. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to fix society beyond this personal level. It may just need to splinter, like other states before it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neoliberalism is an interesting one. 
It started from Hayek&#39;s &#39;Road To Serfdom&#39;; which influenced Reaganomics; then the collapse of the Soviet Union, and &#39;victory&#39; for The West in The Cold War; which brought a gradual end to any social-democracy in western-europe.</p>

<p>The collapse of Communism meant, in geopolitical terms, there was no need to have social-democracy, socialism, or indeed a Labour Party in the UK. &#39;Blairism&#39; was just Neoliberalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like he got in trouble for shilling his own paid site and YouTube channel. He tried to post them directly and got no upvotes. So he started to post them all over the sub even in unrelated threads. This caught people’s attention and seems like he was told to stop. He now resorts to this approach. </p>

<p>This is one video he will link you too... note the many promises to blow your mind, the condescension and 0 substance but much shillling for his website:</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xny7p87_tH4">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xny7p87_tH4</a></p>

<p>Posting your own content is fine, posting only your own content, spamming the site with it and trying to profit off of it is I guess less fine.</p>

<p>He is likely John le Bonn and he is trybig to get you the subscribe to his channel and pay him $20+/mo for his subscription only website. Arguing with him is inane because he lives goal posts, requires impossible levels of proof, ignores the other persons points and zeroes in on one tiny part of the argument. In his youthbe video comments he doesn’t argue with knowledgeable posters but feuds with those he thinks will have trouble arguing back. It’s not clear what he actually believes as his videos are opaque (although he does promise to blow your mind with the paid videos) but he has videos making fun of “conspiritards” (people on this sub) and “normies”.</p>

<p>He is a con artist looking to get your money and is not operating in good faith.</p>

<p>In one video he asserts missiles cannot fly in level flight because he doesn’t understand basic physics, is proven wrong in the comments, makes a video pretending to admit wrong and then concludes he should just keep his material behind a paywall. If you argue with him and show him equations and papers on missle flight/control he calls it drawings and theory. Show him videos of missiles in flight and they are doctored. His own theory is based on drawings, misunderstanding if basic physics and conjecture and it seems like the only proof he might accept is if someone strapped him to a missle and fired him from a fighter jet.</p>

I noticed it increasingly over the last 6-8 years, but the last 4 have been on full throttle. Maybe it goes back further, but this is when I started recognizing a lot of these contradictions. </p>

<p>All I can advise is to remain true to yourself. remember that your thoughts and opinions should directly reflect what you think and feel, not what “your side” is screaming it should be. Same goes for all forms of media and entertainment, be mindful of what you consume. </p>

<p>Woke OP, more than most. I recommend people in this sub actually research what NEOliberalism is (have a look at my comment history, my most recent thread has a visual presentation + additional updated info). Then do your own research
if you think I&#39;m lying or wrong. You may come to a similar conclusion, contradictory to what the MSM claims.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/bNz2DHP.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/bNz2DHP.jpg</a></p>

<p>NEOliberalism is an EXTREME right wing economic ideology, NOT left wing. 
Just because Obama/Clinton are pro-LGBT rights and stuff, doesn&#39;t magically convert them from
extreme right wing politician to left wing.....they&#39;re basically just Bush + LGBT rights and stuff like that.
Even Obamacare isn&#39;t even remotely socialist, it&#39;s a Trojan horse for corporate cronyism profiteering. It&#39;s vastly privatized and profit-motivated, rather than altruistic and socialized.</p>

<p>The two major parties are NOT left vs right. Why did Dems and CNN (falsely so called &quot;left leaning&quot;) shit on Bernie all the time???
BECAUSE THEY&#39;RE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR LEFT WING. Corporations are not left wing. Not even centrist (which Bernie was pretty close to, like FDR&#39;s &quot;New Deal&quot;/social democracy). Bernie is not a Stalinist or any of that crap propaganda. Fox lied claiming Bernie&#39;s tax was 90%! The top tax rate was actually 52%
and that&#39;s ONLY FOR HUGE CORPORATIONS/SUPER RICH earning 2-10million or so a year lol. Normal people had much lower rates + better social programs compared to shitty crony capitalist Obamacare.</p>

<p>Some people incorrectly believe left wing means &quot;more government&quot; &quot;SJW crap&quot; &quot;mass immigration&quot; &quot;anti-business&quot; &quot;drug addict&quot; and other nonsense. This is the false narrative the mainstream corporate media and establishment are pushing. The spectrum does not have two sides, it has MANY SHADES.</p>

<p>Libertarian socialism is not authoritarian. Democratic socialism, social democracy, anarchism, etc. are part of
the libertarian socialism quarter area of the spectrum, not authoritarian socialism. Taxes can be used in a better way than feeding crony corporations. Tax is not theft. Why do you think super rich shills push that meme? Because they&#39;re one of higher holders of wealth! It&#39;s obvious and yet so many miss these alarm bells. Government itself isn&#39;t the problem. It can be a great ally of the people if it was run democratically. But corporate/banking/secret society shills have infiltrated it. THEY&#39;RE the problem, not government itself, not taxes itself.</p>

<p>Not saying you have to be left wing to be anti-establishment (I believe there&#39;s an acceptable range that qualifies but not one specific ideology).
My somewhat educated opinion: anti-establishment zone is generally moderate libertarian versions of center left, centrist and slightly right. Nothing more right wing than that. Because you&#39;re likely to enter the NEOliberal shit zone (we&#39;re already in it, hence people are unhappy and wanted an outsider like Bernie or Trump).
Lib vs con is marketing for the two party system (or at least that&#39;s what its become, at best they seem to have lost their meanings).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Brexit seems a bit confusing. I believe the EU is basically NEOliberal: generally center right to EXTREME right. The British Conservative/Tory party is as establishment as you can get and their policies can go even more extreme compared to the EU on average. So I can see why some thought the EU was left wing....in reality I think this is a shitshow and just &quot;lesser evil vs shittier evil&quot; or the good cop/bad cop routine.
Some may argue that the &quot;slightly less extreme&quot; EU is better because it caps us from the maximum extremism of the Tories....I don&#39;t know the answer but my gut feeling is the EU is undemocratic and there should be an alternative, e.g. a law, constitution or something that stops retard parties from fucking the people beyond point X. We can have our own cap without having to do what the corrupt EU tells us. So yeah I don&#39;t trust the EU personally.</p></li>
<li><p>Islam: I believe most muslims are non-extreme of course. But that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t criticize the religion. NO RELIGION is above criticism. However, it&#39;s pretty poor taste for example, to go up to a Christian/Muslim/Buddhist or whatever and say &quot;HAHA your religion sucks because you believe THIS and do THAT!!HAHAH!&quot;
People don&#39;t want to be harassed and many religious people are not comfortable about questioning their religion due to peer pressure and other influences, which is sort of understandable....I guess. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I feel it&#39;s appropriate to criticize a religion if politely invited to a debate but just harassing people is not cool. Don&#39;t most religions have flaws written by humans from thousands/hundreds of years ago?
Anyway, some of issues that some people <strong>perceive</strong> to be muslim, are probably JUST cultural OR a combination or even political! Some cultures may interpret things in a shitty way or maybe the whole religion was messed up from the beginning, I don&#39;t know..I haven&#39;t studied the religions deeply so I can&#39;t make a judgement. But generally I don&#39;t trust religion....maybe spirituality and God, but religion is human organized and infiltrated at best, lies from the beginning at worst. If there was truth, it must have been muddied by now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately that&#39;s an oversimplified debate that&#39;s fairly popular but only leads to dead ends. Corporations partially control the government and have rigged the system in multiple ways including the double poison: extreme deregulation (NEOliberalism) + crony capitalism (state favoritism to certain corps rather than being fair to all businesses of all sizes and types).</p>

<p>Obamacare has an example of both simultaneously: big pharma and insurance companies lobby/bribe gov into giving crony capitalist contracts that favor those companies, give them unfair big business opportunities/advantages, free subsidies (out of the tax payers&#39; money) and deregulation like not being regulated for ethical conduct such as fair drug prices. </p>

<p>I do believe the government can be a force for good (they should only impose the good regulations like worker rights, environmental protections, etc. and no cronyism) but for that to happen, it needs to be void of corruption, extreme authoritarianism and also money in politics is like the first barrier. (Also shit like CIA/secret societies infiltrating the government.) But I think removing money from politics would make the U.S. waaay more of a democratic republic and less of an oligarchy. </p>

<p>&quot;Normies&quot; might automatically want more gov intervention but since they&#39;re unaware of the conspiratorial world we live in, they don&#39;t realize how corrupt the U.S. government is and corporate lobbying makes it near impossible to get a fair election, popular policies and basic level of democracy. Personally I just think democracy and truth is the solution, but that&#39;s easier said than done. People need to wake up about money in politics, corps aren&#39;t people and money isn&#39;t free speech. First step to regain our freedom and security/protection/full rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not disagreeing with me, and it&#39;s not an oversimplification. That&#39;s largely what it means. </p>

<p>Government is largely corruptible because government is made up of people. That doesn&#39;t stop the left thinking government is the solution. Government leaving people alone isn&#39;t a solution either because even the right-wing prefer some form of fire service that shows up to douse their homes when they catch fire.</p>

<p>For the United States to work, there needs to be balance between the two sides. The further we go from this less-government-more-government dichotomy and into ideological and/or socio-culturally-driven arguments, the worse the debate gets.</p>

<p>That&#39;s partly why the left and right are so at odds. The issue has become confused with corporatism, neoliberalism/neoconservatism, genuine socialists, special-interest-groups, and all forms of ingroup virtue signaling that have absolutely nothing to do with the genuine brass tacks of what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>For example, I agree with the left that there needs to be some form of public healthcare. I however disagree with their chosen method of using federal law to force everyone to buy government-mandated medical insurance (big government), because this leaves it inherently open to abuse by lobbyists and pharma companies. I agree with the right on free market principles. I however disagree with the logical conclusion of this - that market forces and international companies should be left alone to pit the local worker in competition with an international essentially slave labor force (less government).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t really disagreeing (sorry should have written my post more clearly). I couldn&#39;t tell what your own actual view was at the time. I was just expanding and I think we agree on most things, friend. Absolutely with ya on the balance thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, please note that I think most socialists (including the socialists with capitalist components) would argue libertarian socialism is the more genuine one, rather than the authoritarian red zone (where it gets bad with extreme authoritarianism towards the top with Lenin and especially Stalin the state capitalist dictators with fascist tenancies -- this may partially support the shoe horse theory maybe.).</p>

<p>You need not be concerned about compulsory nationalized healthcare payment as the private system can be optional for those who can afford it/prefer it. But I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll agree or disagree with this next part....some would consider it more appropriate to make the tax for nationalized healthcare compulsory so that the super rich don&#39;t get an excuse to dodge their duty of taxes. The private route would be optional but you should still pay the taxes that go towards healthcare for the nation. I would say it makes sense because affordable healthcare is really important in terms of maintaining a happy, productive and mentally fit population. It probably won&#39;t even matter that much in the grand scheme of things as there are way more efficient alternatives to the cronyist healthcare we currently have.</p>

<p>But you know, (socialized) (single payer) (universal healthcare) doesn&#39;t require insurance as it cuts out the insurance middle men. It&#39;s just &quot;free at the point of use&quot; and efficiently tax funded compared to cronyist and partially privatized alternatives like Obamacare. Some countries have this more efficient healthcare but I think Britain has its single payer turned to half shit (not as messed up as the U.S. but not as good as socialized single payer). Jeremy Corbyn said that it&#39;s been at least 50% privatized by now. Some people there are blaming immigrants when it&#39;s really the unethical cronyist privatization of a national service.</p>

<p>They currently have a partially privatized abomination version of single payer. So I definitely see your point about lobbyists corrupting gov. The current British gov is the Tory/Conservative party which is super establishment compared to most of the other parties there. They pretend they fund the healthcare well but it just ends up in privatized hands, cronyist style. The solution would be to remove money from politics. It seems both the U.S. and UK have a big corporate lobbyists problem getting in the way of democracy.</p>

<p>Yeah I agree too with the balance of regulations. As far as I understand it, many
people think the term &quot;free market&quot; refers to &quot;perfectly competitive market&quot;. I&#39;m not 100% sure if this is the correct definition (if it is, then I&#39;m down with that). But shills like extreme right libertarians, extreme right Republicans and other NEOliberals try to imply it means &quot;virtually no regulations&quot;. Apparently this is a strawman argument intended to confuse people into thinking &quot;no regulations IS the free market&quot; like a trojan horse to extremist deregulation.</p>

<p>But whatever the actual term is for &quot;perfectly competitive and fair market&quot;, I think we do agree that&#39;s a good idea. (But not extreme deregulation, as some regulations are good and needed against exploitation and corruption).
NEOliberal globalism pushes the corporate jobs outsourcing which lowers worker wages worldwide by getting transnational corporations to exploit people in poorer countries, simultaneously removing jobs from the U.S. while still getting free subsidies from the tax payer. Globalism is cronyism! Well you know what I mean... To add insult to injury, since exploited people in poorer countries eventually flee elsewhere to get more opportunities (in a somewhat less rigged system) this mass immigration effect causes more workers to be squeezed into one country, making workers compete for wages/jobs rather than businesses compete properly with each other. It&#39;s also used as divide and conquer ammunition (&quot;the foreigners are stealing our jobs!&quot; when it&#39;s the transnational corporations who are pulling the strings).</p>

<p>Internationalism was a tenet of leftism throughout the 20th century. That was part of the reason why the USSR was perceived as a menace because they worked to radicalize populations in Western colonies and Western liberal democracies themselves.</p>

<p>The IWW was the foremost labor union in the 1910s-30s. It was extremely radical and dedicated to international solidarity with workers everywhere, because they understood if one country allowed workers to be treated a certain way, other countries would be quick to follow.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re right about how the modern left in the US, even more radical groups uncritically support globalization, having bought into the idea that support for open borders and the free movement of people across borders is somehow good and that free trade on net is positive for development. And the exploitation committed by capitalism and market forces has only increased the less committed they have become to global solidarity. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Hillary Clinton is often considered left-wing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, to be fair, she would be on the left wing of the Republicans.</p>

<p>The fact that American politics has moved so far to the right is what makes Hillary Clinton &quot;left wing&quot;. In reality she is (at best) a centrist, but <em>relative</em> to the American political spectrum, she <em>is</em> left wing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It feels much more like he is simply doing whatever he can to gain money and power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which most true leftists would tell you is what <em>makes</em> him a paragon of the far right. He is <em>what the far right is</em> rather than <em>what the far right claims to be</em>.</p>

<p>True leftists know that right wing ideology is based on the idea that gaining money and power is the ultimate virtue. That&#39;s why they hate the poor and powerless, and see taking advantage of the poor and powerless as not only acceptable, but as a virtue.</p>

<p>The far right is not stupid, however, and they realise that their power comes from convincing the masses that they only want what is best for the people, rather than being solely focused on what is best for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or maybe the &quot;anti-establishment&quot; line is all just an empty piece of manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is exactly what it is, and is exactly what the right wing has always been about... manipulating the masses to vote against their own interests. You can&#39;t fool all of the people all of the time, but you <em>can</em> fool some of the people all of the time... and we call them &quot;middle class Republicans&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept that Brexit was a right-wing movement. Back in the 80s, the EU was widely derided by the left and far-left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True... however, back then the EU was about economics rather than social issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The politics of the EU has changed little since then, and yet now we&#39;re made to believe that supporting the EU is actually a left-wing thing, and criticising it is something only the right or far-right would do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, in so far as criticising &quot;immigration&quot; (a veiled form of racism) is a right wing staple.</p>

<p>The truth is, the EU became a very leftist organisation, creating a system of social protections that - while ignoring national boundaries - protected the people against the excesses of corporations and government.</p>

<p>You can be damned sure it wasn&#39;t the economic policies that led the right wing in the UK to call for Brexit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Muslims are one of the most powerful forces of conservatism in the world, and yet in the West their most staunch defenders are liberals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because in the West, most conservatives identify as Christians, and Christians never really got over their &quot;inquisitorial&quot; nature. They don&#39;t really care if you share their same values - if you have a different god (and happen to have brown skin) then nothing you do can be considered valuable. It is their nature (nurture?) to hate non-Christians, regardless of whether they share common values.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Free-speech is of course a fundamental tenet of liberalism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is something that will blow your mind - liberalism was never a fundamental part of left wing ideology. The truth is, the political spectrum has more dimensions than just left and right. You <em>can</em> be a &quot;left wing liberal&quot; or a &quot;left wing conservative&quot;.</p>

<p>Crazy, right?</p>

<p>You have bought into the propaganda promulgated mostly by the right wing which tried to paint <em>all</em> left wingers as liberals.</p>

<p>Was Stalin &quot;left wing&quot;? Absolutely. Was Stalin &quot;liberal&quot;? Absolutely <em>not</em>. &quot;Left wing&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; are two different concepts, and the only reason you confuse them is because of right wing propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s becoming increasingly common to find self-proclaimed leftists who support globalism and see anti-globalism as a right-wing ideal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps this is because many leftists believe in centralised government rather than decentralised government. A global government that holds <em>all</em> the world to the same rules would not allow slave labour in foreign lands to undermine the labour in the US, for example, because those lands would be compelled to follow the same labour laws as all other lands.</p>

<p>Sweatshops in Asia would only be legal if sweatshops were also legal in the US, under a true globalist regime.</p>

<p>The problem leftists have is that &quot;globalism&quot; is not true globalism. Only <em>some</em> of the laws apply to all... the laws that benefit the corporations. Trademark and Copyright, for example. Minimum wage (and other labour) laws are not and will not be globalised under the current regime. If they were, you can be damned sure every leftist would approve.</p>
