<p>The last straw is yesterday&#39;s news about one Tnuza Jamal Hassan who tried to burn down a Catholic daycare center with 33 children, simply because she didn&#39;t now how to build a bomb:</p>

<p>an Anon first posted about the Minneapolis terrorist hotbed and relation to the Super Bowl on January 2nd: </p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Then there were a series of earlier posts from around 12/19 on voat about puzzle pieces, when put together, spelled out a lot of coincidences:</p>

<p>The minneapolis-somali terrorist connection and &#39;Minneapolis Jihadi Pipeline&#39;, including several terrorists from Minneapolis that have fought and died for ISIS already:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/295c76acbf/65828.png">Part 1</a> - (<a href="https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2289120">https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2289120</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The suspicious 2014 New Years day &#39;explosion&#39; coverup that Judicial Watch filed a FOIA over:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/35b90b4568/66132.png">Part 2</a> - (<a href="https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2290778">https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2290778</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Samatar Crossing connection, dedicated to politician Hussein Samatar, uncle of terrorist Burhan Hassan and possibly Tnuza Jamal Hassan above:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/35b90b4568/66243.png">Part 3</a> - (<a href="https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2291927">https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2291927</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Locations of planned Super Bowl LII events that had previous incidences by said terrorist network:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3f390d88e4/67061.png">Part 4</a> - (<a href="https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2293502">https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2293502</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The abrupt change in stadium security to G4S is the same company providing security during the Pulse Nightclub Shooting:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3f390d88e4/67078.png">Part 5</a> - (<a href="https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2294718">https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2294718</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Who will keep visitors safe? City Council member Abdi Warsame is possibly related to convicted Minneapolis-somali terrorist Abdirizak Warsame (just as Burhan Hassan was related to politician Hussein Samatar), somali police officer Mohammed Noor shot and killed Justine Damond and faces no charges, previous mayor Betsy Hodges sides with somalis over the shooting, new mayor Jacob Frey had Justine Damond&#39;s memorial removed because it was racist, the stadium security company has a history of being at events with terrorist attacks, and the local FBI is actively diversity-hiring somalis:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>George Soros purple revolution and prediction of a Vikings v Patriots super bowl game (this one is way out there and not related to the above, but still part of the series):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3f390d88e4/67996.png">Part 7</a> - (<a href="https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2297724">https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/2297724</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems lately that every time you turn the news on, there is something going on in Minneapolis that some how relates back to terrorism. I mean, how can there be so much information regarding an active terrorist network and coincidence with the Super Bowl to be able to say its all bullshit?</p>

<p>Maybe the government shutdown is related to hinder monitoring of the situation and a potential federal investigation, creating extreme chaos should anything happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m just saying that they&#39;re not some super exclusive global security firm. They&#39;re incompetent. I brought literally nothing to the table. I was working for a competing security firm, spent my days at the dept. store where my then GF worked instead of where I was supposed to be, and got in good with the Securitas guard that worked there. They hired me because he suggested me. </p>

<p>Securitas/G4S literally hired me for <em>not</em> showing up at my actual security job. And then put me in charge of a prestigious private elementary school in one of the richest zip codes in the city. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all a part of the MO. (We&#39;ve had issues with the Middle East since the 80&#39;s/90&#39;s regarding oil, and other natural resources which were highly sought after. 2001 we are told to believe Muslims flew planes into our buildings causing hysteria, Muslims were then accused of having Weapons of Mass Destruction. Of course they had to have a face for the group. <em>In comes Bin-Laden, Hussein</em> family friends with current, and prior White House regimes. The banks-military companies get their wish by making billions off of a made up war, and privatizing the oil reserves. Now that we&#39;ve nearly infiltrated all of their resources/homes we expect them not to come over here, and do the same? Shame on us. We can take from others, but not give back? Lastly, staged events like the ones you stated are all apart of warping the people&#39;s minds to manipulate them into thinking the wrong people are the bad guys, when the assholes are the ones running the world.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it does.  You tried to portray the current issues with Jihadism as part of a 1400-year war, thus implying that sort of violent fundamentalism is inherent to Islam.  In reality, the fundamentalism we&#39;re dealing with now is a relatively recent phenomenon, not inherent to Islam but rather pushed on it from outside, in large part to defeat more progressive strains of the religion.</p>

It&#39;d make sense if you were denying the whole thing, but you acknowledge the decades of western intervention a few minutes ago; I have a hard time thinking someone would admit that happened while also denying it had an impact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really because the news in Jacksonville says they are loaded with much more security than ever, funny how the narrative changes between each station. It&#39;s all hysteria for you people that gobble this shit up. OP just piled a bunch of shit together and said &quot;hey, these look like they are related..Conspiracy!&quot; Believe what you want but until something happens, don&#39;t even put thought into it, because life is so much more than worrying about the inevitable. I just want to guys to wake up and not waste your time with this bs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We could always try to treat new immigrants to our country as new welcome neighbors who hope find their own success with their new and unique contributions to the places we all live instead of making people feel ostracized and shunned as if they are diseased, criminal bad hombres from shithole nations. It&#39;s a thought. Because boys/youn men of any race/creed/religion/nationality want to feel a sense of belonging. If we aren&#39;t going to make them feel like they belong here and this is their home, you better believe there will be people there to manipulate them into thinking otherwise. Sports leagues not jihad.</p>

I don&#39;t know what to say about police though, there have been cops everywhere the past few days, pulling everyone over for anything.  I believe you though, It&#39;s going to be interesting to watch this city devolve into chaos, over the next few weeks.</p>
