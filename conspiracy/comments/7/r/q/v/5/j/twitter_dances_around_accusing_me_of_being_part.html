       Text of an email I just received from Twitter, Sat. Jan 20th:
      </p>
      <p>
       "As part of our recent work to understand Russian-linked activities on Twitter during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we identified and suspended a number of accounts that were potentially connected to a propaganda effort by a Russian government-linked organization known as the Internet Research Agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistent with our commitment to transparency, we are emailing you because we have reason to believe that you either followed one of these accounts or retweeted or liked content from these accounts during the election period. This is purely for your own information purposes, and is not related to a security concern for your account.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are sharing this information so that you can learn more about these accounts and the nature of the Russian propaganda effort. You can see examples of content from these suspended accounts on our blog if you're interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       People look to Twitter for useful, timely, and appropriate information. We are taking active steps to stop malicious accounts and Tweets from spreading, and we are determined to keep ahead of the tactics of bad actors. For example, in recent months we have developed new techniques to identify accounts manipulating our platform, have improved our process for challenging suspicious accounts, and have introduced new measures designed to identify and take action on coordinated malicious activity. In 2018, we are building on these improvements. Our blog also contains more information about these efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       People come to Twitter to see what's happening in the world. We are committed to making it the best place to do that and to being transparent with the people who use and trust our platform.

       I'm not dismissing it because it's called Sputnik, I'm dismissing it because it's propaganda. Just because it's propaganda doesn't mean anyone who refutes it is making an "ad hominem" fallacy...

       WaPo is owned by Jeff Bezos, also of Amazon fame, who has massive government contracts with the US federal government, including NSA. National Security Administration. US Department of Defence. Uncle Sam. The US government has a long history of getting WaPo to do its bidding. WaPo is an arm of the US guvmint as much as Pravda or Sputnik or RT are of the Russian government. So what? What the fuck do you think Voice of America is?

       Seymour Hersh, one of the best living journalists, had to go outside the USA to publish this story. Tells you all you need to know about the bought and owned big media in the USA. A very effective censorship and thought control apparatus.

       Hahahhahaha okay wait? So if we don’t like Sputnik, it’s an ad hominem fallacy but if you don’t like nyt’s that’s called what (let me guess it’s different because you’re special for some reason?)
      </p>
      <p>
       So now let me borrow one of your own comments and send it right back at you......
      </p>
      <p>
       “You're dismissing a source because it's called
       <strong>
        NYT
       </strong>
       . This epitomizes ad hominem. Whiner.”
      </p>
      <p>
       You know you were so quick to throw out the ad hominem accusations to defend Sputnik news, I was actually going to look for a snopes article just to see if you would attack the source, but I really didn’t think you would take the bait so easily and do exactly what you’re accusing others of..... but good to know that you’re the exception to the rule and clearly no one else can have an equally informed opinion of Sputnik news that you apparently have about NYT.....

       So you can dismiss any information that comes from a  source you personally don’t like, but no one is allowed to dismiss information from sources they personally don’t like?

       I don't think they even want to show this, to be honest.  The only reason they are is because of public pressure.

       Kinda the same way they "find" 1000 bots occasionally.  They have millions of bit accounts that they don't want to do anything about, because it would show how much of a sham their ad revenue is

       It is propaganda from Russia though. Doesn’t matter if real people start retweeting it. Russia started many of the stories. Haven’t they even admitted to doing so?

       It’s credible enough for Fox to print it. Also, Facebook has said the same thing. And aside from social media, many “alt news” media outlets have been proven to be hosted out of Ukraine and run by the same network.

       So they say 1,000 out of 650,000+ are Russian propaganda, without proof. Then they suspend, suppress or shadowban posts from all of the other accounts and send out this alarming letter  And all of these are probably related to the 'release the memo' trend. Doesn't make sense to me at face value.

       And so often they love to say “both sides do it”, but both sides most certainly do not. A complete deafness to logic and reason and even common sense seems to be exclusive to the right.

      <p>
       You’d think you could “prove” something and that would be that, but lo and behold, wtf is that source you linked? Not a far right media outlet? Then how can you expect them to be fair and unbiased towards the right?! It’s almost as bad as Trump being investigated by a team which doesn’t consist solely of people who voted for him! The nerve of these libs...

       Lol dude Russia has been planting stories on twitter and on random domains they’ve setup. Do you dispute this?

       Totally agree about muh uranium one. It’s pretty fucked. Good thing she lost, eh?

       Just like Russia wanted though, that’s the only thing you seem to be forgetting. Just like Russia wanted.

       Which hey, maybe I wanted it to. That doesn’t change the fact that Russia wanted Trump to win and helped him do so (with or without his knowledge)

       What makes you think that’s what I was saying? Like why is this to you about Hillary losing and not trump winning? And why “only”?

      <p>
       To be clear though, no I don’t think it’s the only reason she lost. I don’t even really think it’s the main reason. However, the race was pretty close, so it’s certainly possible that things would have turned out different had Russia not played a part in the election.

       You aren’t supposed to prove shit, because I didn’t ask you to prove anything. This is clearly a hunch, as I said. I just want to know why you think this is the case. I suspect I’d have a hard time proving the opposite, since this isn’t exactly the kind of data made freely available.

       I'll try to put it to you gently... you've been led to believe that the US sold Uranium to Russia, which it didn't. You have the fundamentals wrong, because that's what the liars told you. The rest of the lie you've heard only gets more and more nonsensical. The timeline doesn't work, the wrong people are in power when decisions are made, no one seems to profit in the nefarious scheme... its a nonsense accusation once you try to verify

       What part of my argument was unclear to you?  Twitter uncovered evidence of Russian bots spamming propaganda on their social network and alerted the accounts of people who interacted with these bots.  It appears that some of these people are having trouble accepting the reality that they were taken advantage of and I'm trying to help them through the healing process.

       Why are you so defensive of Russia?  I thought you guys were all about nationalism and "America first"... Kind of odd...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway it's pretty obvious that the Cold War never ended, it just became more discrete.  From a geopolitical perspective it is Putin's duty to do anything he can to level the playing field between his country and the world's leading superpower.  Using his influence to undermine our electoral process and elect a controversial candidate that will further polarize the American public against each other is completely within Russian interests.

       10 years ago if somebody offered me 1:1000 odds that in 2018 conservatives would be the ones who advocate that Russia is our friend, and liberals would be the ones accusing Russia to be major modern threat, I wouldn't have a penny to my name, and would have had every limb in my body broken by the bookie after I couldn't make good on the remaining 1:999 odds I owed him.

       Not "defensive of Russia" so much as realist. You do realize that we have no major existential beefs with Russians, in general, and that they do have thermonuclear weapons, and a second strike capability? Why not get along with them? They could rub us out in minutes.

       I'm just asking you a question, don't know how that is defending Russia. So, in your opinion, the cold war never ended and putin has a vendetta against America? And the method by which putin is destroying America is through Twitter and social media?

       The geopolitical interests of Russia and the West are still adversarial. Russia wants to weaken us, our economy, our force-projection, our alliances, our democracy, and our legal system. They want to weaken NATO, for example, because it poses a strategic counter-threat to Russian aggression in Europe. This would be bad for America and Americans, but it would be great for Russia. That's why it was so fucking crazy when Trump came along and started bad-mouthing NATO, and all his supporters went along with it. He's so clearly a puppet for Russia, and I can't grasp how any real American could be okay with this.

       the true left is being heavily targetted by this letter, which is hardly surprising. we've been blacklisted for a century. though why anyone would think the true left would ever have voted for clinton is anyone's guess, after all we've been calling out bernie as a fraud since 1992.
      </p>
      <p>
       liking and/or retweeting anything by jill stein seems to be at least one of the "red flags." thus, anyone on the true left agreeing with someone who was on the exact same page as they were since...1994.

       if twitter won't identify the accounts and content in question, they are full of shit. period. abigail adams can drop to the floor screaming about goody brown, and a whole legal system can decide that's enough to condemn to death, but it doesn't make it so. the right to know your accusers and have access to all of their evidence against you is the cornerstone of our ethical system, official and unofficial.

       there is nothing anyone could possibly say about hillary clinton that is any worse than what has been already been said about her for over the last 40 years. ffs, people have been talking about her having murdered steve foster since i was in college. there was even an mkultra survivor who wrote a book back then saying clinton stank, had greasy hair, a dirty piss smelling snatch, and went down her. seriously. so whatever anyone said about her in 2016 had a really high hurdle to jump in order to come anywhere close to what has already been said about her.

       that someone who half the country has hated for my entire adult life lost in a close election to another person who half the country hated is not even interesting, let alone, mysterious. when two unpopular candidates in america square off, the republican almost always wins, because republicans are more reliable voters and they almost always vote straight ticket (dems do as well for that matter). however, dems vote with their feet when they don't like either candidate, they stay home, which is what happened, just as it always has since 1968.
      </p>
      <p>
       clinton's popularity is as low as it's ever been. the number of people saying the are dems has not risen above 30% in 2 years. that isn't russia's fault. people hate trump and the repubs even more, though only just.

       Are you serious?  The topic he posted about was literally about Twitter addressing the issue of Russian propaganda and it's effect on their userbase.  You banned people for having an opinion about the topic that was originally presented?  Is it because it's an opinion that you don't agree with?  This is a clear abuse of mod power, and I expect you'll ban me as well for pointing this out (if you haven't already).

       What is wrong with the assertion that OP was fooled by Russian propaganda? The entirety of his post is the contents of an email he received from Twitter expressing as much. It is perfectly fine if you personally do not believe that Russian Twitter bots are influencing and have influenced Twitter dialogue (OP seems to agree, and I personally disagree), but banning people for supporting the analysis of Twitter over counter-arguments of corruption seems abusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary, you may disagree that Russia propaganda is real or influenced Twitter in the way it did, but barring a new "you may not challenge OP" or "Russia propaganda is fake news" rule I'm not sure what in this thread merits a ban wave.

Been here nearly 9 years with consistently (mostly) high effort comments and I care deeply about this community.

       I think its just propaganda. They are subtly trying to tell right-wing people that they were manipulated by Russians, and when left-wing people hear about these emails, their biases that have already been fully primed by the MSM are just further confirmed.

       Thanks for posting OP. It's interesting to see the wording twitter use around this. I can't actually believe how many people have come to this tread to just act like a bunch of childish hillary bots though - makes me really sad that so many people are so closed minded and just openly offensive instead of having a good old fashioned, mature conversation :(

       The way Twitter writes this is just slightly more subtle than asking "When did you stop beating your wife?"

       "... we are emailing you because we have reason to believe that you either followed one of these accounts or retweeted or liked content from these accounts during the election period. This is purely for your own information purposes, and is not related to a security concern for your account."
      </p>
      <p>
       I must have been exposed to too much information, the information disclosed by Wikileaks, which happens to be factual, for my own good.
      </p>

       This is how I interpret their smokescreen of bullshit. Feigned concern for my welfare.

       Look, if "critical thinkers", what the general audience here in r/conspiracy deems itself, can't even read and understand a VERY simple text, like Twitter's alleged email, then please stop referring to yourselves as rebels, activists, truthers, critical thinkers and so forth.

       Some of these people in charge are just nuts! They ignore what the real issues are and they're trying to promote the idea that there's another "Red" scare we should be focusing on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me tell you a story about something that happened to a friend of mine. He's very involved in fund raising for his church and works with a number of older, retired men in his church to put on these huge fund raising dinners for things like their private school. One of these men decided to go to Italy with his wife. A once in a lifetime trip, because they are getting older and being Catholic, wanted to visit the Vatican, etc., while they could still get around. He's in his 80's. My friend told him he would call him one night there--while it was daylight here. So he did--at 3 am Italian time. The older fellow and his wife had been having some physical problems while there. I believe his wife had fallen and broken her wrist and he wasn't feeling well, himself. So they talked for a few minutes about their trip and their troubles, and hung up. When the older gentlemen got home, he got a call from Department of Homeland Security, wanting to know who he had spoken to at 3 am while in Italy and what he had discussed! Nobody knew about the phone call yet. He hadn't mentioned it to anyone. So he told them if was none of their "f***ing business." I had no idea they would do something like that. But it wasn't a hoax, because he received a call from them that showed up on his phone and was shocked to hear their questions when he called them back.

       So they say 1,000 out of 650,000+ are Russian propaganda, without proof. Then they suspend, suppress or shadowban posts from all of the other accounts and send out this alarming letter  And all of these are probably related to the 'release the memo' trend. Doesn't make sense to me at face value.

       Are you serious?  The topic he posted about was literally about Twitter addressing the issue of Russian propaganda and it's effect on their userbase.  You banned people for having an opinion about the topic that was originally presented?  Is it because it's an opinion that you don't agree with?  This is a clear abuse of mod power, and I expect you'll ban me as well for pointing this out (if you haven't already).

       What is wrong with the assertion that OP was fooled by Russian propaganda? The entirety of his post is the contents of an email he received from Twitter expressing as much. It is perfectly fine if you personally do not believe that Russian Twitter bots are influencing and have influenced Twitter dialogue (OP seems to agree, and I personally disagree), but banning people for supporting the analysis of Twitter over counter-arguments of corruption seems abusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary, you may disagree that Russia propaganda is real or influenced Twitter in the way it did, but barring a new "you may not challenge OP" or "Russia propaganda is fake news" rule I'm not sure what in this thread merits a ban wave.

       THANK YOU. It is good to know that there is still a voice of reason on the mod team. I am as real as it comes on this forum. Been here nearly 9 years with consistently (mostly) high effort comments and I care deeply about this community. You are caught in the crux of an information war and I want you to know that the real users that are still here appreciate you standing up to this bizarre attack.

       Yes it is. You can't just sit there and say liar when anyone with a middle school level of reading comprehension can see this is saying you've interacted with Russian propaganda. It's not saying you are russian propaganda.

       I'm going to guess with your complete lack of english comprehension you're a russian
