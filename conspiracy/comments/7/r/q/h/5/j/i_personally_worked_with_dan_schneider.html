       Throwaway account.
      </p>
      <p>
       I frequently follow this subreddit, and see Dan Schneider come up a lot so I wanted to post about it.
A little about me so you have some reason to take my word (for what ever it's worth), even as a stranger: I'm an self proclaimed "conspiracy theorist", I've followed this subreddit for quite a while and love keeping up with trying to figure out the real grime that goes on behind the curtains in this world.
I've worked in Hollywood all my life, and can say with confidence that it's filled with SHIT people and harmful brainwashing propaganda. I've never considered myself "Hollywood" at all. So I've always kind of been an outsider, even while being inside it. It's been an interesting journey working in this business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to the subject of Schneider. I don't know him on a personal level, I haven't seen or spoken to him in years and I only interacted with him through work; so I can't speak with complete confidence, but all I can do is give my opinion based on my observations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'll rant all that comes to mind -- 
He was very nice, a good word to use would be jolly (aside from the occasional serious times that are common when filming and things aren't going right). All the kids on the show seemed to genuinely like him. The dynamic was almost like he was their goofy uncle. This could account for the pictures of them on his lap, or seemingly compromising positions. It looks creepy out of context, but I have to say when I would see those circumstances in person, being familiar with their personalities and dynamics, it didn't seem odd at all. He would goof off a lot with us. And some of the kids seemed to have a very sweet deeper relationship with him (like a father figure).
He had an adult/dark sense of humor in person, so seeing it in episodes wasn't weird. To me it just seemed to make it fun for parents and people watching old enough to understand. He's an adult constantly writing comedy for kids, so I could see it being entertaining to put some things you would also find funny within the lines. I didn't think so deeply into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jamie Lyn Spears seemed to quickly be over the show. She didn't need the money and like most kids (especially kids that have it all for the most part) she got bored. She was brighter than you would think as well, we would have conversations that would surprise me because I assumed she was a complete ditz at first. Even if Dan was ill-intentioned, I really couldn't imagine a situation where she would ever be sexual in any way with him, she (nor her family) had any reason to allow such things. She was very in control on that set, and would do as she pleased. Towards the end she would send most her time in her trailer with her boyfriend who was always with her on set. With her personality type, mixed with how comfortable she was around him, it didn't seem at all like she was hiding some dark secret. From my understanding, the psychology of a child who gets exposed to sexual assault would seem somewhat apparent when they are around the perpetrator. She definitely seemed comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Victoria Justice was very mature for her age. She was one of those amazing kid actors that seemed like a tiny adult. We talked a lot together, and when we would all hang with Dan she was completely comfortable around him (her mother as well). Her and her mother were very sweet, and I always told them she should have her own show after Zoey. So that was an easy next step to happen for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've worked with a lot of weirdos and creeps, some of which  I can easily sense the odd dynamics they have with other people they're working with. I didn't get that from him.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to his personal life, I know nothing about him. He could have weird fetishes, or even like kids, and I would have zero idea. But from my dealings, I couldn't imagine a scenario of him being able to act on those feelings in a major way with the kids I was working with at the time. I would hate to see an innocent man thrown under the bus if no evidence came out. If real evidence were to come out, then damn I was fooled and that's a heartbreaking shame!

       It would probably depend on the kind of traction of whatever narrative is being pushed. Accusations of Dan Schneider being a pedophile don't seem prevalent enough to warrant the involvement of a PR firm. I could be wrong, though, in the instance that he is trying to cover all his bases.

       Because we are all big enough to make up our own minds? This is relevant to a hot conspiracy theory. Many of us have our minds made up that Schneider is guilty. I don't mind considering the alternative. Of course this post could be total BS but i don't mind considering multiple angles. That said, this post lacks substance but could give insight into how predators can pull the wool and make fools.

       These guys in Hollywood with all this money and power are the most manipulative sociopaths there are. That's how they get these kids parents to trust them. Of course he wouldn't make it obvious that he's a creep in front of everyone.

       I agree with you. I'm just explaining my observations when it comes to this particular person, and the interaction I saw from the kids as well. I'm decent at observing the psychology of people, especially when they are kids so it can be easier to pick up on signs. But again these are very surface level observations I'm sharing, so take them as you will.

      <p>
       Did you guys know that "An Open Secret" was supposed to be about Dan Schneider originally? Don't believe me?
