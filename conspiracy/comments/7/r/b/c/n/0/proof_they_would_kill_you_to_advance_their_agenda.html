<p>This here is a conspiracy that would have directly hurt, maimed, or killed U.S. citizens if it had not be rejected by J.F.K. If someone calls you crazy for thinking the government could have been behind the attacks on 9/11 show them this document so that they will see that it&#39;s absolutely possible our own government would consider harming or killing its own citizens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that no matter what I say or how I say it or present it the normies will always reject the truth. I don&#39;t even get into conspiracy theories. I show them verifieable evidence of the Deep State just like this and they still reject it.</p>

<p>Even if they cave and agree with me (they don&#39;t, they just want the conversation to end) they say things like well what can we do? Then when I talk about solutions they say things like life is short and they just want to enjoy it. To be fair I can&#39;t really fault them for that, but it proves TPTB right that they&#39;re just easily manipulated and controlled sheep to be sent to the slaughter.</p>

<p>All of the signs are there and if they haven&#39;t noticed it by now then no one will be able to convince them. I&#39;m convinced that even if God descended from Heaven and went on CNN to tell the public that there is a network of rich and powerful people that have been controlling them since the dawn of man they still wouldn&#39;t believe it.</p>
