<p>You&#39;ll see that it&#39;s a T_D crosspost with about 4000(!) upvotes. It&#39;s basically misinformation and propaganda that is heavily brigaded by T_D and it&#39;s Discord server into this sub and also gains a lot of upvotes from a bunch of people here that instantly upvote anything with a title that&#39;s anti-Democrat or pro-Trump.</p>

<p>Also notice that the mods seem to be in on it, since it did not trigger &quot;Rule 11: Misleading, fabricated or sensationalist headlines are subject to removal&quot;.</p>

<p>Someone tell me how &quot;It&#39;s going to be a Blood Bath for former Obama Administration officials.&quot; is not sensationalist.</p>

Basically as soon as the 2016 election cycle started up, they started doing some really good stuff.  My guess is that they&#39;re trying to help do away with the absurd amounts of voter apathy among this nation&#39;s youth (no matter what side of the field you fall on, you can&#39;t deny that voter apathy is, and has been a major problem in the US for a long time).

<p>The investigation is based on a fake dossier, if you wanna jump down that rabbit hole, start with fusion gps, who funded the dossier.

<p>It isn&#39;t though, the investigation had started before the dossier had come to light.  The only reason the dossier is of interest to the FBI is because it corroborates events that they had already heard of.  That being said, the interview only seems to back up their claims; not sure why you&#39;re convinced otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I’m gonna post an alt right site because no alt left would post this shit. And it’s <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/01/11/the-doj-and-fbi-worked-with-fusion-gps-on-operation-trump/">fully sourced</a> so you can follow up if you want to.</p>

<p>In a nutshell...</p>

<p>Prior to March, 2016: Private contractor for FBI (Fusion GPS) conducting <em>illegal</em> electronic surveillance of Trump campaign via FBI access to raw FISA data using 702 About Queries.</p>

<p>March 9, 2016: Fusion GPS caught with illegal searches and raw FISA info they should not have had, given them by the FBI. Mike Rogers (NSA).</p>

<p>March 29, 2016: Paul Manafort joins the Trump campaign, AFTER the illegal 702 About Queries were conducted by Fusion. Manafort was not the reason for any surveillance conducted on Trump or his campaign.</p>

<p>April 18, 2016: FBI discovers they have been caught, terminates Fusion GPS&#39;s access to FISA data.</p>

<p>April 19, 2016: Wife of Fusion GPS founder (Mary Jacoby) goes to White House.</p>

<p>April 2016: Fusion GPS hired by Clinton campaign for opposition research on Trump, via Clinton campaign and DNC lawfirm Perkins Coie.</p>

<p>April 2016: Fusion GPS hires Christopher Steele to write opposition research for Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>April 2016: After Jacoby goes to the White House, Fusion GPS hires Nellie Ohr (Russian Expert) to work on Russian &quot;insurance policy&quot; disguised as opposition research.</p>

<p>May 23, 2016: Nellie Ohr applies for HAM radio license to avoid NSA data collection in any other communication format, being familiar with (and in communication with those who were also familiar with) the data collection possibilities.</p>

<p>June 8, 2016: Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya meets with Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.</p>

<p>June 9, 2016: Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya meets with Donald Trump Jr, austensibly for opposition research. She instead talks about the Magnitsky Act.</p>

<p>June 10,2016: Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya again meets with Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.</p>

<p>~June, continuing to December, 2016: Christopher Steele writes &quot;Russian Dossier&quot; alleging various &quot;unverified,&quot; unsourced accusations, including Trump hired Russian hookers in Moscow to pee in bed Obama slept in.</p>

<p>July, 2016 John Brennan (CIA Director) instigates multi-agency operation of the Trump &quot;Russian Collusion&quot; investigation, keeping President Obama informed at every step.</p>

<p>May to October, 2016: NSA conducting review of 702 About Queries of FISA data. Review requested by Admiral Mike Rogers due to 702 About Query abuse. Review conducted by compliance auditor.</p>

<p>August 15, 2016: Conspiracy discussion of &quot;insurance policy&quot; in event Trump is elected, in office of Andrew McCabe (DD FBI) with Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, as verified by texts from Strzok.</p>

<p>October, 2016: FBI pays Christopher Steele for &quot;Russian Dossier&quot;</p>

<p>October, 2016: <em>FBI uses Steele &quot;Russian Dossier&quot; for FISA application *</em>in an attempt to legitimize past historical About Queries on Trump campaign.*</p>

<p>October 26, 2016: Admiral Rogers informs FISC of illegal searches of FISA data. FISC agrees, enforced his recommendation of ending ALL 702(17) About Queries.</p>

<p>October, 2016 After Admiral Rogers goes to the FISC, James Clapper (Obama DNI) and Ashton Carter (Obama Defense Secretary) recommend to President Obama that Admiral Mike Rogers be fired from the NSA.</p>

<p>Early November, 2016, post election: Bruce Ohr (Associate Deputy Attorney General) meets with Glenn Simpson (Founder of Fusion GPS).</p>

<p>November 17, 2016: Admiral Mike Rogers travels to Trump Tower, informs Trump of surveillance.</p>

<p>November 18, 2016: Trump transition team moves all operations out of Trump Tower and into New Jersey.</p>

<p>November 19, 2016: Public pressure is applied to Admiral Rogers, with news articles leaked stating James Clapper (Obama DNI) and Ashton Carter (Obama Defense Secretary) recommend to President Obama that Admiral Mike Rogers be fired from the NSA.</p>

<p>May, 2017: FISC confirms NSA Mike Rogers, stops all FISA 702 About Queries, 702 data permanently purged, no longer available.</p>

<p>Like I said, I’ve been down this particular rabbit hole and there’s so much you don’t know.</p>

<p>So I’m gonna post an alt right site because no alt left would post this shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1) Alt left is not a thing.  Sorry to burst your bubble</p>

<p>2) Yeah sorry, not giving Nazis traffic, and make no mistake about it &quot;White Nationalism&quot; or whatever the alt right wants to call it now, is just National Socialism by a different name.  Why not try something... I don&#39;t know... not off in Nazi fantasy land?  Now, when I had to source something for you, I very specifically went for something that couldn&#39;t be construed as being too far left, or too far right.  However, you couldn&#39;t do the same.  You outright said &quot;I’m gonna post an alt right site because no alt left would post this shit.&quot;  Barring the fact that &quot;alt left&quot; isn&#39;t a thing, why couldn&#39;t you go for something that&#39;s neither?  Could it be because only alt-right blogs would post it?  Why would only alt-right blogs post it?  Maybe because it&#39;s a steaming turd that doesn&#39;t actually coherently link together.  Now, I didn&#39;t read it, I&#39;ll admit, but the last time I tried to follow a conspiracy theory pushed by the alt right, I was told that hillary clinton was helping to hide a pedophile ring being run in the basement of a pizzeria....  nevermind the fact that the pizzeria in question doesn&#39;t have a basement, they&#39;re running a pedophile ring in the basement.  So, please forgive me if I have some trepidation here; but I simply cannot trust alt-right sources.  If you have another, non-alt-right source, I&#39;ll gladly check it; but please, if I can provide something that isn&#39;t super skewed towards one side of the spectrum, you can do the same.</p>

<p>The exact opposite is equally true. </p>

<p>We’re not in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> buddy. Its clear to me you can’t refute the content of what I posted and would rather attack the source. </p>

<p>why couldn&#39;t you go for something that&#39;s neither</p>

<p>Teen vogue is neither, they obviously lean left. And the top of their site says “we fact check it so you don’t have to”.</p>

<p>Sorry dude, I’m a conspiracy nut. Fact checking is what I do. </p>

<p>Oh boy...here comes another redpill</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ALEFANTIS: Well, we make everything from scratch. Other restaurants, even good restaurants, will, like, not roast their own peppers. You can just buy the roasted peppers in a can. Or you can buy garlic oil. Some products you can get, and they’re consistent and they’re easy. But I didn’t even know that existed actually until they said that. I was like, “What do you mean? There’s another way? You can just buy these things?” Because a lot of restaurants will open a can and put it on. Like our sauce — we harvest a whole crop of organic tomatoes — 10 tons of tomatoes every year. Can them all, <strong>store them in the basement</strong>, have like a harvest party when it gets loaded in.</p>

<p>IIRC Manafort was before the elections, but I have not followed in a while. It&#39;s an honest question, does dirt prior to Trump campaign affect Trump in the end? The guy can talk his way out of many scenarios, he&#39;ll need to be caught red-handed doing something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone colludes prior to the campaign and is then invited to the campaign as a result, then it suggests a high chance that the campaign will collude.</p>

<p>If two people submit a guilty plea that they did collude as part of the campaign then that is damning evidence.</p>

<p>If Trump and the corrupt republicans want to argue that there was no collusion, then let&#39;s have them make those claims under oath. There&#39;s a reason that they always &#39;forget&#39;, claim executive privelege or claim client/lawyer privelege when under oath and that is because there are real consequences to the lies they tell.</p>

I don’t know which is my favorite link, the one from sputniknews .

 IMHO they are paid to run interference between liberals and progressives to split the vote between dems and 3rd party candidates so that conservative republicans will be elected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is pushing Democrat/Russia collusion. That&#39;s your weird fever dream projection. We point out there&#39;s no evidence of any collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, and no evidence that Russia tampered in any meaningful way in the election. I stand by that. The reason it&#39;s important for people to understand that is the Russiagate was concocted (newsflash: this part&#39;s in <em>Shattered</em>) to distract from Hillary and the entire party leadership&#39;s disastrous campaign, and the fact that Obama&#39;s presidency was so failed they lost almost 1,000 seats under Obama and became a weak, regional rump party, whose primary governing committee was run into the ground and sold to Hillary Clinton secretly for cash on the barrel head. Russiagate gives the media and the surveillance state the excuse to censor and silence the left. And it provides tremendous cover for all the work the corporate Democrats are doing to HELP Trump and the Republicans pass their very worst bills and appoint their very worst judges and bureaucrats. So blowing away the toxic smoke of Russiagate is something any decent person should want. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m current a moderator there, so please feel to direct people to my comment history. I&#39;ve been running the AMAs. The last one was for a Democratic Congressional candidate who ran Bernie&#39;s 2016 Iowa operation. The one before that was for a young Democratic Socialist insurgent who&#39;s running to replace Ted Cruz. We&#39;ve also hosted an AMA with Jim Thompson, who&#39;d have won his special election in Kansas if the Democratic Party had been willing to give him $20K for a mailer -- but no, it was more important to the party&#39;s leadership to dump <strong>$30 million</strong> on Jon Ossoff&#39;s losing neoliberal effort in Georgia. We also hosted Lisa Ring, a kick-ass progressive  running to take a seat away from a Republican the establishment Democrats didn&#39;t even bother to run a challenger to in 2016.</p>

<p>Guess what all those candidates we helped have in common? <strong><em>They all back Medicare for All, free public college, and a higher minimum wage.</em></strong></p>

<p>So, please, carry on explaining how we&#39;re conservative Republicans.</p>

<p>FWIW, you&#39;re examples are hysterical. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to get you the sympathy you think they will. </p>

<p>Nah, I&#39;ve seen it enough to realize it whenever certain comments get mass voted to the top that it&#39;s a ploy to destabilize the subreddit. Yall tried the mod shakeup, yall tried to make everyone destroy any source except the &#39;chosen&#39;, yall make sure certain topics don&#39;t see the light of day.</p>

<p>It may not be you, but the piggybacking off another user and bolstering him even though he doesn&#39;t kowtow the original meaning.</p>

<p>Now belittle, attack, drop anyone who points it out. Help ensure the partisan battleground, muddy the water. That&#39;s usually the next step.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve learned about this little by little as the information has been reported so I wouldn&#39;t be able to show you exactly where I first saw it. This article does a good job of explaining everything though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Justice Department&#39;s inspector general is planning to release findings from its review into how the FBI handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton&#39;s use of a private email server by next spring.</p>

<p>In an appearance before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, Michael Horowitz said that the investigation was not yet complete, but that his team had already conducted significant work in the probe.</p>

<p>“We have interviewed dozens of people. We are not at the 100 level yet, but we’re in the dozens range. We’ve reviewed about 1.2 million records in the course of the investigation,” Horowitz said.</p>

<p>&quot;We are aiming to release the report in late winter, early spring. So hopefully in that March-April time period,&quot; he added. &quot;Obviously, I can&#39;t commit to that, because, as we&#39;ve seen, events can arise, issues can arise that requires us to do additional interviews or get additional records.&quot;</p>

<p>The Justice Department&#39;s Office of the Inspector General took up the investigation into the FBI&#39;s decision-making during the 2016 presidential election earlier this year amid pressure from lawmakers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, I know, I know.  It seems like some weird Twilight Zone shit, but they&#39;ve been doing some -SOLID- journalism for the past year to year and a half.  Basically as soon as the 2016 election cycle started up, they started doing some really good stuff.  My guess is that they&#39;re trying to help do away with the absurd amounts of voter apathy among this nation&#39;s youth (no matter what side of the field you fall on, you can&#39;t deny that voter apathy is, and has been a major problem in the US for a long time).  Also, I went with Teen Vogue because I figured it wouldn&#39;t be disregarded for being too far left or right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is pushing Democrat/Russia collusion. That&#39;s your weird fever dream projection. We point out there&#39;s no evidence of any collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, and no evidence that Russia tampered in any meaningful way in the election. I stand by that. The reason it&#39;s important for people to understand that is the Russiagate was concocted (newsflash: this part&#39;s in <em>Shattered</em>) to distract from Hillary and the entire party leadership&#39;s disastrous campaign, and the fact that Obama&#39;s presidency was so failed they lost almost 1,000 seats under Obama and became a weak, regional rump party, whose primary governing committee was run into the ground and sold to Hillary Clinton secretly for cash on the barrel head. Russiagate gives the media and the surveillance state the excuse to censor and silence the left. And it provides tremendous cover for all the work the corporate Democrats are doing to HELP Trump and the Republicans pass their very worst bills and appoint their very worst judges and bureaucrats. So blowing away the toxic smoke of Russiagate is something any decent person should want. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m current a moderator there, so please feel to direct people to my comment history. I&#39;ve been running the AMAs. The last one was for a Democratic Congressional candidate who ran Bernie&#39;s 2016 Iowa operation. The one before that was for a young Democratic Socialist insurgent who&#39;s running to replace Ted Cruz. We&#39;ve also hosted an AMA with Jim Thompson, who&#39;d have won his special election in Kansas if the Democratic Party had been willing to give him $20K for a mailer -- but no, it was more important to the party&#39;s leadership to dump <strong>$30 million</strong> on Jon Ossoff&#39;s losing neoliberal effort in Georgia. We also hosted Lisa Ring, a kick-ass progressive  running to take a seat away from a Republican the establishment Democrats didn&#39;t even bother to run a challenger to in 2016.</p>

<p>Guess what all those candidates we helped have in common? <strong><em>They all back Medicare for All, free public college, and a higher minimum wage.</em></strong></p>

<p>So, please, carry on explaining how we&#39;re conservative Republicans.</p>
