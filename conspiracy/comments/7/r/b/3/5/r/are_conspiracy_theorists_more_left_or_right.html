       You only notice a bias if you identify with part of it. I've seen left leaning people complain of a right bias here just as often as I've seen comments like yours.

       I'm neither. I loathe the idea that personal opinions and beliefs get stuck in a box and labeled "right wing" or "left wing"
      </p>

       But in the spirit of answering your polite question, my beliefs fall all over the spectrum of the labels given them.

       Here? Traditionally we were mostly left. The shills continue to try to characterize us as all ultra right. And tbf we have had an influx of actual right leaning people.

       I think it is a fairly straight mix now.

       That's true.  Many years before that,  the first few years of the sub's existence, it was more classical liberal, or perhaps right, though.

       I really considered it classically liberal up until like 6 months before the election. And now, it is really hard to tell. Imho, 2/3 of the users here are sock puppets/trolls/shills/malicious users of some sort. So, any impression you get from the material you see is skewed.

       I have to agree with your assessment.  Too many shitheads from both sides since the election.  One side will organize a strike one day, the other gets pissed off and organizes their own for the next.  Always seems to go back and forth, day to day, in a retaliatory manner.

       The left right paradigm is a feature of our voting system.  And even though it is archaic and kinda dumb, we've shown some pretty amazing progress in our 240ish years.

       There are many functional democracies in Europe that have representatives in national government from as many as 13 different parties.  Something like this is much more realistic as far as finding a candidate that represents your beliefs.  Except of course for the people who have adopted the ideologies of the right and left because they viewed it as their only option.

       I am in favor of changing the voting system to another model.  I also realize to change this system I have to use this system.  This system mandates two parties so I am certainly going to pick a side and use that to fight for what I want.  You have to pick a side to make the change you want.

       We're not going to burn it all down.  Accelerationsim is silly.  We work slowly to make change.

       The system does not mandate two parties though. Our first president gave a strong an serious warning about the two party system and regardless it moved to that almost immediately and has been there to this day.

       It is instilled from a young age that voting for a third party is a waste of a vote.  To be a democrat or a republican is a part of growing up, that should not be the case.  Despite the fact the last election had two of the most hated candidates of all time third parties still got less that 5% of the vote.  By your logic at this pace we should have a contending third party by when?

       IMO you still view the two parties as different when really they are not.  They only disagree on the topical issues for the most part and even so that's just publicly.  Generally speaking significant change never occurs its a ship on course with the illusion of control for the general population.

       Then plow your own roads. Don’t use public schools. Get rid of your own garbage. Set up your own water system. Don’t go to the zoo. Stop using landfills. Don’t go the library. Don’t go to national parks. Don’t call the police or fire department when you’re in need. Don’t use the street lights when you’re out for a walk. Good luck!

       Conspiracy Theorists for the most part want to see a fair, transparent and just world. Some of them are unable to model reality and so they will align themselves with political ideology. True conspiracy theorists question everything and decide for themselves the best model and way to actualize a better world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your "normal" conspiracy theorist, without any negative connotations, jumped on the bandwagon. More and more conspiracy theorists lack critical thought and are only seeking for someone else to create a model of reality for them in which they can then choose to accept or deny. This is no different from the mass media.

       Why does it matter though? Most of the shit keeping humanity down is the finger that points to the "other" while we still bleed the same color, and continue to pay the opportunists that make fortunes from hedging bets against both "sides". I can't calm down. Get off the party line. Stop collecting cards and start making your own decisions. Stupid question, I'm sorry, but damn questions like these come from "useful idiots" not free thinking individuals. Cmon already.

       There was a time(I hesitate to call it a golden age)when most conspiracy posters saw past the left right paradigm and recognized that both parties have the same capacity to be corrupt and participate in conspiracies. Two wings of the same bird. The politicians are like Wrestling stars, enemies in the ring,, friends behind closed doors.unfortunately the legalized propaganda being spewed from DC has been very effective at polarizing most of the country. Taking away the many shades of grey and replacing them with only black and white

       How can I lean left or right? My body would be contorted in a very odd manner if I were to align myself to all that I hold true. Can't I renounce these dichotomy.

       It is as if to say there is no over lap from one to the other.

      <p>
       Or can I say that you can't categorize my beliefs, and reduce them down to something so simple as to say I am left leaning or right leaning.

      <p>
       What does that even mean. You are leaning to left. Does that mean if someone kicks whatever you are leaning on over that you will fall. Or be forced to stand up straight.

       Left and right is a false paradigm. You're either authoritarian or not. Establishment or not. There's a spectrum of course but I've found that people either believe the government is mostly good or they believe it's mostly bad. The former usually leftists, the latter, usually "right wing". Just my thoughts...

       I would say all over the place, really. No matter where your beliefs lie, you have strong opinions for something and against something. We tend to conclude conspiracy on many things we don’t agree with, whether we express them externally or not.

       Traditionally in the U.S. the original conspiracy theorists were conservative and they spent their time accusing any and all persons advocating for individual and  labor rights,  of being Bolshevick, socialist, commie, Marxists conspiring against the rights of the wealthiest to hold all wealth and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for now, my own personal view sees the least credible conspiracies as being promoted by conservatives only while the real conspiracies;
      </p>
      <p>
       the elections,
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11,

      <p>
       Iraq War,
      </p>
      <p>
       the economic bubble/crash cycles,
      </p>
      <p>
       and most importantly the erosion of individual rights, worker pay and protections and the destruction of the environment and our food supply include both conservatives and liberals.

       maybe so, but since there are philosophies/ideologies which deny the possibility of objective truth it still matters what kind of worldview a person has (and it might matter even more that they can be honest with others and themselves about it)

       I don't feel I'm really either but if I were someone who believed in the system looking at myself I'd probably call myself more left. But I think we all come from many sides. We also often want the same thing. We just have different opinions on how to get it or what's going on in the world but I think we all generally agree on here that shits fucked up left or right

       I tend to lean left socially, right on national defense and gun rights. I think the entire purpose of the government is exactly what the Constitution says. Provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare of the people. I love my guns and think more people should have one. They're a vital tool for the people and they allow you to hunt your own food. A human should be as self sufficient as possible. But where there are gaps that's what society is for. Not everyone is a doctor so we have people that are take care of people that maybe stock their grocery store shelves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But politics doesn't matter when we as a country are being lied to by people claiming to be left or right but really are neither

       I have my own opinions on different political matters. I am conservative in some ways and liberal in others. There is no party, big or small, that encompasses where I stand so none of it is a part of my identity. That makes it really easy to see what’s actually going on. I feel for those who have made their party affiliation part of their identity. It prevents them from seeing the corruption within their own party.

       Both major parties are nonsense and are playing the American people in many ways.

       Opinion: Leftward-leaning people who look into conspiracy theories tend to veer rightward (but might not cross 'the centre line'); rightward-leaning people who look into conspiracy theories don't move that much further right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two reasons for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) It is an article of faith among the intelligentsia of the left that conspiracies do not happen, and that such theories are the products of flawed intellects. (I'm not going to back that up, but I promise that you will find it is true of your own accord.) If a left-leaning person starts to look into conspiracies, then they will soon come to reject this article of faith and before long they will start to jettison other left-wing shibboleths and no-nos.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The right wing puts a far greater importance on individuality over collectivism, and ascribes far greater significance to incentive-driven behaviour. These concepts are capable of absorbing conspiracy notions without any great intellectual discomfort. (That's not to say that right-wing people are credulous about conspiracies per se.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Caveat: "left wing" and "right wing" are a diptichal frame for describing political belief, not a real measure of two sets of values. The "left-versus-right" setup dates from the time of the French Revolution, and the values it represented are now just as outdated, but they serve as a useful way of comprehending
       <em>
        party
       </em>
       politics, if not the politics of voters themselves.

       The scale is wacko tin foil conspiracy types vs realistic practical conspiracy types.   For example,   working from proven conspiracies vs going for the sensational stuff that is promoted by cult-like figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left right divide is a charade that is largely cultivated.   I mean the issues upon which polarities are accentuated for the explicit purpose of distracting and dividing people while they get poisoned and ripped off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah,  there was an older left right divide,  which was about the rich vs the poor,  but that's gone at least in the US,  the poor are just as likely to vote in a rich bastard,   and the rich are just as likely to give money to Obama or Hillary.    Since the fall of communism in the Soviet Union and the rise of a new wealthier China,   the poor have not been represented by any left political parties anywhere I know of,   except maybe for a while in Venezuela or Ecuador.    And what happened in Iceland when the failed banks were
       <strong>
        NOT
       </strong>
       bailed out.    Now
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       was interesting,  but it wasn't about poor or left,  it was about realistic,   practical people who were interested in a PROVEN CONSPIRACY and thus capable of effective and beneficial action.
      </p>
      <p>
       The poor were not served all that well by the leftist movements of the past.    The ideology of class warfare or handouts only backfired on them.    Maybe they should take a lesson from Iceland.    All we need is for the game not to be stacked against us and for the corrupt, and the corrupt are really good at ideology.    Follow the money,  don't listen to those crooks behind the curtain who are rigging the game in their favor in the name of left and right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a place for crazy conspiracies like flat earth.    When the stakes are high,  that place is really huge:   trolls,  schills,  and disinfo.    Ego freaks and megalomaniacs of the Alex Jones variety who love big media and dream of being at the top of it.    We don't need more media channels,   we need to follow the key people who are actually in a place where they know what they are talking about.   Keep track of your own list of real experts,   hopefully practical people who are less ideological and more focused on getting the facts.   We all need mentors like that.

       Why does it matter though? Most of the shit keeping humanity down is the finger that points to the "other" while we still bleed the same color, and continue to pay the opportunists that make fortunes from hedging bets against both "sides". I can't calm down. Get off the party line. Stop collecting cards and start making your own decisions. Stupid question, I'm sorry, but damn questions like these come from "useful idiots" not free thinking individuals. Cmon already.

       The left right paradigm is a feature of our voting system.  And even though it is archaic and kinda dumb, we've shown some pretty amazing progress in our 240ish years.
