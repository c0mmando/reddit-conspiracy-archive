       Maybe he's a clone? Like in the timeless classic movie Multiplicity. Each time they clone him he's a little bit different because he's a clone of a clone. Soon we will get the one with planks of wood nailed to his boots to pretend he's skiing and licks pizza.

       I don't know the source of those two particular images. That was just the first image I found online that had 2 pictures from different times together. But you can look up "Stephen Hawking 1970s" and "Stephen hawking 2000s" so you can see the difference and verify it yourself. There's enough pictures of him...(them?).

       Except it's extremely likely he doesn't have ALS, as mentioned elsewhere - he was misdiagnosed. So yes, he would be alive, and yes, those photos match up pretty well. It's a lot more likely than a magical clone.

       I clicked on this thread thinking it was going to be kooky shit and then started reading more on the other corners of the Internet. What the hell? He should be dead 5 times over. He is 76 and was diagnosed when he was 21.
      </p>
      <p>
       Medical Daily quotes the International Business Times as saying:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He carries the torch “as one of the longest, if not the longest, surviving patients with ALS in history,”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's pretty amazing in itself but what are the odds that a world figure who is also regarded as one of the most brilliant scientists living today
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       all of known history (
       <em>
        another quote from a website I already closed the tab on - it was like a top 100 list
       </em>
       ) is probably the longest living survivor of ALS?
      </p>
      <p>
       He should go pick out some PowerBall numbers for me.

       Not sure. I've always assumed that if it was misdiagnosed he hasn't properly acknowledged it or been informed about it. If he doesn't choose to say anything and his doctors don't either, then in the public eye nothing changes.

       Yeah, I suppose. But it just feels like something would've slipped out by now, especially since he is such an outlier; not to mention being globally recognized. You would think if he lives 1200%+ longer then the average ALS diagnosis, it would be documented.

       At this point, what does it really matter? He's lived for decades in constant decline with no hope of recovery, why does it matter if he knows exactly whether it's ALS or some other neurodegenerative disease? He seems like a "bigger picture" kind of guy anyway.

       Besides that, I don’t think the people whose views they want to change really look to him for guidance. Should get some NASCAR drivers or WWE actors to endorse their candidate or policy. Those folks love NASCAR and WWE.

       Stop abusing Ockham's Razor. In this case, if one applies it, it's simpler that there is a high profile personality (who speaks through a computer no less) being simulated (weekend at bernies), -than the chance of a statistical outlier that outlives 99.9% of people with the same condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, this isn't proclaiming Hawking is actually a half-dead or cloned body being operated by an AI or wifi control [though some people cling to such a yarn], however, it feasibly easier to mimic or create a fraud of such a person than it would be to beat the odds of such a disease, that is if you believe in the science behind ALS (this is not contesting that either).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ockham's Razor applied to modern day, given the ability to fake, hoax or create indistinguishable realities with technology, sucks, since it's feasibly and practically easier to hoax nearly anything than it is to overcome extreme obstacles. Not to say everything is fake, it's just incorrectly applied. It works best with zero bias.

       No, this is the correct usage of it. There are a larger number of assumptions and logical "leaps" required in order to propose that he is being faked, versus him having a slow progressing form of the disease and being wealthy enough to afford top quality care.

       It's not the correct usage. The definition of the Razor is
       <em>
        "two things being equal"
       </em>
       and for it to be equal one would need a lot of personal, detailed information of Hawking.

      <p>
       If he were taking experimental treatments, then yes, it's explainable. Given the
       <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12883-014-0197-9/MediaObjects/12883_2014_197_MOESM1_ESM.gif">

       The cui bono portion is
       <em>
        opinion

Maybe someone benefits greatly, since hundreds of millions are spent on marketing authority and expertise, it may benefit a group profoundly having an authority on physics [black holes specifically] which, to question it, would be seen as unsavoury or cause emotional conflicting. Black holes are theory based on indirect data/observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are seen as 'black holes' could easily be a phenomena that would be better described with other math or theoretical constructs. In fact the true phenomena could be known but too profound to elucidate, as doing so would require physics to return to drawing board status. (ala Copenhagen era).

       You do not have any real tangible evidence for yours, so that makes the two theories equally likely in the abscense of evidence (or atleast evidence you accept).  Which means we can apply the razor.

       Something "not making sense", and something being unlikely are two different things. It is within the realm of possibility, but the likelihood of such a person concurrently having a slow acting form of the diease and being famous is small (i.e unlikely).

       Again, as stated earlier this could easily be achived by the aformentioned organisation sponsoring studies  and other scientists that agree with their narrative (Hawking isnt the only authority in this field). Again cui bono,

       You brought the opinions in, when a contradictory opinion of equal weight is applied you then backtrack. If you notice the argument presented tosses all opinions. You wouldn't like that however because you then have no platform to speak on. This is why

       It isnt a statistical certainty, for you to argue that it is a  statistical certainty you'd have to test hawking to prove he doesnt have the disease or find empiricle evidence that he is dead.
       <strong>
        i.e you'd have to prove it was certain that he is dead, not argue the liklihood of his death.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Untill then, it remains unlikely but not impossible (which is what a statistical certainty would imply).

       Strawman argument. Your reasoning is the same as "tin foil hats." As much as you can reason and use endless rhetorical to prove your point, one can do the opposite with equal weight [even using empirical precedent to support it].

        Stop abusing Ockham's Razor. In this case, if one applies it, it's simpler that there is a high profile personality - who exerts political influence (who speaks through a computer no less) being simulated (weekend at bernies), -than the chance of a statistical outlier that outlives 99.9% of people with the same condition.

       no, the rare form of ALS is incredibly more likely than the ridiculous theory that he is being simulated. by orders of magnitude. it's not even close. Hawking's political influence isn't even measurable. The motive just isn't there when the same resources it would take + risk of being discovered could achieve far more results by other means, no matter what imaginary motive you insert.

       Everything posted here is out of bias. The question to ask first is,
       <em>
        "is it possible to simulate a person who has no motor function, speaks through a computer, and has limited interaction with others?"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is it's incredibly easy to do so, given resources. Thusly, it's about as possible for him to overcome a deadly condition as it is to simulate him doing so.

       It doesn't argue for either being the true one, it's simply a logical argument true the meaning of the razor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also to set precedent (which is more of a legal argument), simply look at the history of hoaxes and false histories. Also note that epistemological framework allows multiple parties to be right about conflicting narratives.

       You are ignoring two things
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        It is a group of diseases that cause atrophy of motor function but the neural location of onset, implicated genes, and familial nature differ among the different subtypes. Hawking's case is obviously not the hum-drum sporadic type that is most commonly diagnosed in late adult life.
       </li>
       <li>
        The average age of diagnosis for ALS is 55 years old. Hawking was diagnosed at 21 years old.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Early-onset ALS correlates with a much better survival time. The 10-year survival rate is 10%. The 20-year survival rate is 5%, which is low, but its not as if people never survive a long time. Remember the average age of diagnosis is 55 years old so most are older when they get the disease and won't be living 20+ years anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <strong>
        more likely
       </strong>
       answer to his 40+ year survival is that he was diagnosed so early, allowing for a better prognosis AND he does not have a rapidly progressing form of ALS. Most patients are not diagnosed so early, so Hawking was already an anomaly from the start.

What is unusual is not only the length of time, but that the disease seems to have burnt out. He appears to be relatively stable. … This kind of stabilization is extremely rare.”

        So what makes Hawking different from the rest? Just luck? Or has the transcendent nature of his intellect somehow stalled what seemed an imminent fate? No one’s quite sure. Even Hawking himself, who can expound at length on the mechanics that govern the universe, is circumspect when it comes to an accomplishment that rivals his academic triumphs. “Maybe my variety [of ALS] is due to bad absorption of vitamins,” he said.

       Close, actually. Very, very long detailed explanation, but I'll give you the short version. Many alien races have access to a universal consciousness. It's first nature to them, it's how they rapidly advance technologically, and it's how they communicate. All of the mysteries of the universe are there. Humans are horrible at accessing it. Except some. We often call them "idiot savants" because they are often noncommunicative (autistic) but can place music innately, or do complex math never having learned it. They access it via the universal consciousness. They can literally access how to play masterful piano, for instance. Many geniuses have been on this spectrum. Hawking is one. It's also from this universal consciousness that our bodies learn how to heal themselves. That's what healing
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       . An interesting example is antibiotics. Antibiotics just don't kill germs by chance, they
       <em>
        know

       how to kill germs. Often they know better than humans. When we take antibiotics, the antibiotics share that wisdom with us so we fight infection. Hawking has not progressed because he has been able to access some degree of universal knowledge of how to fight his disease, precisely because he is on that spectrum and can access that universal consciousness better than many.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the main reason aliens visit is because they are fascinated with why humans are not present in the universal consciousness.  That's why they study us.

       I don't, really. I am making a video about my 40 years of reluctant contact with aliens and what I've learned. I'd love to write it as a book, but I'm not a good writer.  I'm also not interested in being a spokesman for others with similar experiences.  And most certainly of all, I'm not interested in being some kind of researcher or whatnot, because an overwhelming majority of information on such topics is wrong or just flat out fake.

       I hadn't considered the idea that savants are accessing aspects higher consciousness (whether they realise it or not), so that's very interesting! But I had certainly applied that concept to psychics and clairvoyants in my understanding.

       This is actually quite close to what I have come to learn. Granted, language has a high loss factor so explanations often fall short. The only thing I am unsure about is whether yogis, etc.,  can really do any better than "normal" people at accessing the universal consciousness without things like drugs.  That opinion may change, however, because for decades, I didn't think certain drugs were involved at all, I just thought they "mesed up" your perception. I have changed that opinion recently.

       Yeah, it's difficult to describe. We humans simply haven't yet invented the words to describe these concepts so we gotta reply on metaphors and similes. Words don't convey enough meaning alone.
       <br/>
       That's quite interesting though that that's one of the things you're unsure about, because for me the idea of yogis accessing higher consciousness was one of the first things I'd seriously considered in regards to the topic. But I went down this rabbit hole starting at Buddhism and learning about DMT/ayahuasca, and then aliens and the physics to go along with it came next. Whereas I hadn't even considered the idea of autistic people/savants/geniuses naturally accessing higher consciousness until I read your comment today! Funny how the paths we take interweave cross over the way they do.

       I took a lot of philosophy in college, and one of the ways we demonstrated a language falling far short in describing
       <em>
        experiences
       </em>
       is trying to describe the color red to someone without using a comparison like "It's the same color as a stop sign."  You could give the scientific definition that red is electromagnetic radiation with wavelength of 680 nanometers, but that really doesn't convey it to almost anyone.  So, you need to give them a comparison to something they've experienced.  So, how do you describe something they've never experienced?

       Wow... That's a very good way of putting it! Things can generally only be likened to until experienced. Only at that point can one fully understand the concept. So this applies to not only these "out there" concepts, but literally everything. Only that most things people talk about are commonly experienced in this world today.

       This is one interesting aspect of the univsal consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally, if I communicate to you, I form a message, I encode that message in a high-loss language (English, in this case), I send that message via some medium (written or spoken), you sense that message (hear it or read it), and you interpret it to get meaning. The interpretation always has some degree of subjectivity to it.  I'm taking a thought from my consciousness and placing some semblance of that thought in your consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       When beings are in tune, so to speak, with the universal consciousness, they bypass all of that. They directly communicate experience.  There's no language, and even if
       <em>
        you've
       </em>
       never had the experience before, it's perfectly understandable as if you had.  THIS is how some autistic people can play music never having learned, or how they know complex math, never having learned. They play from experience that someone else had.
      </p>
      <p>
       And can you imagine the implications for learning if all that was second nature to you? Humans spend decades learning and then experimenting, and really advanced concepts of technology are reserved for the brightest few.  Those that access the universal consciousness bypass all of that.  I can pick up on your work where you left off as if I had left off there.

       OP, Hawking

        died and was replaced

       wih a double [pdf]. It is pretty self-evident when you compare the pictures, and when you read about that one fateful night.

       But also, realize such a handicapped / caricatural man (speaking through a computer) is a tremendous asset and marketing tool (in this day and age when victims are heroes). He is used in every possible setting to spread doom porn, to advance the transhumanist agenda, and generally to advocate for the central planners’ goals.

       Honest question: when have Hawking's beliefs or pronouncements ever been used to justify (or help enact) a "transhumanist" policy, or advance a nefarious goals?
      </p>
      <p>
       By all metrics I can measure, most of his pronouncements/ideas end up as "human interest" stories in the middle of the newspaper, and are almost wholly ignored by anyone in positions of power (businessmen, politicians, etc). All that occurs is a one-day news cycle of "Oh, Stephen Hawking says we better colonize Mars soon, since Earth will likely become uninhabitable!" and then everyone goes about their business.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen any of his ideas, beliefs, or pronouncements ever linked to any sort of consequential action or policy. And he doesn't hold much sway over the populous (or their behavior); most people just know him as "the guy who's a really smart super-genius," and that's it. And it's been that way for 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: I don't see what they'd have to gain by replacing him with a double.

       The well-known lecture
       <em>
        Life in the Universe
       </em>
       is one among many examples (and perhaps one of the best known). See
       <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/life-in-the-universe.html">
        here
       </a>
       for the whole thing. It is worthwhile reading it in full and realizing the amount of fallacies, inconsistencies and nihilist (and indeed morbidly materialistic) ideas that are put forth herein.
      </p>
      <p>
       (If you find this lecture reasonable, it is my opinion you are a victim of propaganda, you adhere to the false and dominant paradigm of our time; and I’d suggest you join C_S_T to have this view challenged, it is not my purpose in this comment chain to do so).
      </p>
      <p>
       This lecture reflects “his” thinking very well. I’ve been following these “philosophical” pronoucements for some time, and they always revolve around these same ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying fake-Hawking is a senior advisor to policymakers; rather, it is against the
       <em>
        general public
       </em>
       that he is being used. It seems there are few settings where this persona isn’t glorified, or these ideas not presented and praised. Heck, fake-Hawking even a recurring guest star on the highly popular show
       <em>
        The Big Bang Theory
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The central planners had a very good reason to replace him; he would soon die anyway, and the genius of his real self combined with his caricatural disease meant he could be leveraged as a potent propaganda weapon. And that’s exactly what they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real Stephen Hawking is rolling in his grave. The cynicism of those who have posthumously exploited his genius and his disease apparently has no bounds.

        Big Bang Theory
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       His ideas are above most people's heads, and they certainly have had no real, tangible effect on the populous's thinking. Less people pay attention to him than they do Neil Degrasse Tyson or Bill Nye; nevermind the fact that a disabled man who talks through a text-to-speech robot isn't exactly a charismatic vessel for "their" message.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see what "they" have to gain from that.

       I've come to the conclusion myself aboit a year ago that Hawkins died and he has been replaced with someone who is controlled by the elites. Think about it.. perfect cover to push any science / atheist agenda even alien per say, why did I start questioning? Well it was when I came across pictures of Hawkins at little saint james - Jeffrey epstiens island..

       weirdly enough, i was literally looking into this earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       people say he has a rarer slower progressing type of als, or that it's not actually als but something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       people say he died and was replaced. people say he's an alien. people say he's faking.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm largely undecided on the matter. one thing which does intrigue me tho is a theory that went round that says he isn't actually saying any of the stuff he "says" and anyone could just program his aac to say anything.

       British doctors use "motor neurone disease" as an umbrella term and it is not directly synonymous with ALS.  He said himself he likely has
       <strong>
        a
       </strong>
       motor neurone disease and not Motor Neurone Disease, if you see what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was very likely misdiagnosed.  Diagnostic tests in those days weren't up to much, it's not that easy to accurately diagnose even now, and there is actually a very similar and actually manageable condition called Multifocal Motor Neuropathy with Conductive Block (MMNCB).  Today there is a differentiating test - in 1963 that test didn't exist.

       Jason Becker was diagnosed with it in the early 90s and he’s still alive. In his documentary he attributes his longevity to nutrients, supplements and a strict diet fruits, veg, etc. I recommend that documentary for everyone in this sub. It’ll bring you to tears.

        So what makes Hawking different from the rest? Just luck? Or has the transcendent nature of his intellect somehow stalled what seemed an imminent fate? No one’s quite sure. Even Hawking himself, who can expound at length on the mechanics that govern the universe, is circumspect when it comes to an accomplishment that rivals his academic triumphs. “Maybe my variety [of ALS] is due to bad absorption of vitamins,” he said.

       Apparently, most ALS patients die soon after their diagnosis, but this is only an average and accounts for about half the people diagnosed. The other half can live much longer. The most common way to die from the disease is having your diaphragm fail, so that you can't breathe, or your swallowing muscles fail, so that you can't eat or drink. If neither of those happens, you could live for a rather long time, not to mention there are different types of ALS.

       From an article in
       <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-als/">
        Scientific American
       </a>
       from 2012:
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <em>
        Most patients with ALS—also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease—are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you keep an reading that article they interview a neurologist who is the medical director of ALS at the University of Pennsylvania and he breaks down how Stephen Hawking has a very rare form of ALS similar to Juvenile-onset ALS but not exactly like it because he was diagnosed with it at 21.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the neurologist they interviewed, only "less than a few percent" of the people that are diagnosed with ALS get the kind of ALS that Hawking has, so it's a rare form of a rare disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't anyone who has ALS, I'm just kind of a space nerd and Hawking fan.

       I watched my father die to ALS. All muscular function deteriorated at a similar rate, this included movement, breathing and swallowing. The most common cause of death for people with ALS is deterioration in breathing or swallowing (choking).
      </p>
      <p>
       Having witnessed the disease first hand, as primary carer, I find it very odd that, after suffering full body paralysis, the two parts of the body  that Hawkins needs to survive work perfectly fine. All other motor function is gone, but he can breathe with no support? My father still had limited movement up until his death and then it was the breathing that finished him off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The common explanation of 'he has a rare, slow progressing form of the disease' does not wash with me. If it was slow progressing he would also see a slow deterioration in breathing and swallowing, having had the disease so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't researched his particular case that much so take what I say with a pinch of salt but I find it very weird.

       The real Stephen Hawking has been dead since the 80s and he is now played by an actor. He's a popular figure and weak minded people like to agree with him since they have empathy for his condition. So when the establishment has some bullshit lies they want to pass as real science they say it's from Stephen Hawking and people are more likely to believe it since he is widely accepted as one of the biggest geniuses in the world even though, in reality, it's just a retarded old man in a wheel chair who bears a resemblance to the real Stephen Hawking who died a long time ago.

       A friend and I kind of spoke about it hypothetically one day, who would be a better poster-child for 'science' than a really stupid guy who can't defend himself? You can make him say whatever you want him to, it's not like he's going to get up and run. It would be hilarious to be behind the curtain and convince everyone that a retard was one of the smartest persons in the world.

       The only reason he is living is because he is on a respirator. ALS affects the brain’s ability to initiate and control voluntary movements. Your diaphragm is a muscle that controls your breathing and without that muscle working you die from lack of oxygen. One way around it is to be on a respirator. My father passed from ALS within 6 months of diagnosis. He could have been on a respirator and lived until a normal age but there would be no point due to lack of quality of life

       I've been researching ALS a lot lately; there are numerous mainstream, well-regarded, well-accredited neurologists/ALS experts who muse that Hawkins either has a rare form of the disease that never affected his vital organs, or has a
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       , even rarer (ALS is already extremely rare) motor neuron disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Motor neuron diseases are difficult to definitively diagnose, and also easy to misdiagnose. Even neurologists at the top of their field who specialize in ALS can sometimes struggle with a diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, more than likely, there is nothing untoward going on here.

       Last year, my mother was feeling muscle tightness but put it down to tiredness. Then her muscles began twitching; two weeks later she was diagnosed with ALS. My family doctor said ALS is a progressive disease that crushes nerve cells in the spinal cord and  affects more than 6,000 people in the US a year. He also said it leads to paralysis and eventually death. I was so worried about my mother's health.  My father came across a forum where so many people are writing about (Best Health Herbal Centre). They sell herbal remedies for different kinds of  deadly diseases, so me and my family decided to give it a try. We contacted Dr linda (Best Health Herbal Centre) immediately and purchased herbal remedy for ALS. My mother used the herbal remedy as instructed and It totally reversed her ALS within 6 weeks of usage, all thanks to Best health Herbal Centre for saving my mother's life, God bless.

       Stop abusing Ockham's Razor. In this case, if one applies it, it's simpler that there is a high profile personality (who speaks through a computer no less) being simulated (weekend at bernies), -than the chance of a statistical outlier that outlives 99.9% of people with the same condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, this isn't proclaiming Hawking is actually a half-dead or cloned body being operated by an AI or wifi control [though some people cling to such a yarn], however, it feasibly easier to mimic or create a fraud of such a person than it would be to beat the odds of such a disease, that is if you believe in the science behind ALS (this is not contesting that either).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ockham's Razor applied to modern day, given the ability to fake, hoax or create indistinguishable realities with technology, sucks, since it's feasibly and practically easier to hoax nearly anything than it is to overcome extreme obstacles. Not to say everything is fake, it's just incorrectly applied. It works best with zero bias.

What is unusual is not only the length of time, but that the disease seems to have burnt out. He appears to be relatively stable. … This kind of stabilization is extremely rare.”

        So what makes Hawking different from the rest? Just luck? Or has the transcendent nature of his intellect somehow stalled what seemed an imminent fate? No one’s quite sure. Even Hawking himself, who can expound at length on the mechanics that govern the universe, is circumspect when it comes to an accomplishment that rivals his academic triumphs. “Maybe my variety [of ALS] is due to bad absorption of vitamins,” he said.
