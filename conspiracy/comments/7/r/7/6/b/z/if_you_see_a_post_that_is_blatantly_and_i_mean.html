       You're asking op to explicitly name the users he's accusing of being shills. Wouldn't that be a rule 10 violation? I know, I know, it's enforced at a mod's discretion, but even so, it still seems strange to me that a stickied comment by a moderator is asking op to break a rule.

       No, we remove direct shill accusations.

       OP has covered himself by saying "odds are it's shill", acknowledging that neither he or anyone else can be sure a specific poster is a shill.

      <p>
       OP can message the mods directly with links if he's concerned about Rule 10. Either way, he needs to present some actual evidence of blatant Rule 1 violations which the mods are not removing.

       Typical attack of account age. People are still going to read the post. I'll post some examples on this thread and update them throughout the day.

       It's a pretty big clue when the opposition has created an entire sub to highlight the homophobic and racist spam shill posts/comments here...Great way to paint us as a bunch of dumb hillbillies.

       You have no history in this sub, and regular users are bound to question what your motives are. You haven't bothered to respond (or cannot) to my request for examples of "blatant racism", so I am removing your post as a Rule 10.

       but a lot of the threads have gone from the list, as they deleted their account shortly after I called them out for posting racist agitprop.  You can see a cached page of some of their other threads
       <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:lU8WFzifg_sJ:https://www.reddit.com/u/Its_okay_to_be_white%3Futm_source%3Damp%26utm_medium%3Dpost_header">

       to paint a slightly broader picture of the kind of stuff they posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the threads are not necessarily racist when viewed individually, looking at the overall theme of what they posted it is clear they had racial prejudices and were attempting to spread them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts like this were a lot more common in the run up to the election, and I have noticed a significant decrease in posts like this over the last year or so.  Whether that's because there's less need for people (either sincere 'activists', for lack of a better term, or bots/paid trolls) to push people towards anti-sjw/far right views,  or stricter moderation, is not for me to say.  I do think the submission statement rule will help further curb this type of stuff.

       I hate to tell you this, but there are actual bigots in a lot of different circles. The one guy at my job who likes to talk about conspiracy subjects is an admitted racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should just be recognized that it's not the SOURCE of bigotry. But there are also those who are holocaust deniers, believe in "gay agenda" conspiracies, believe in biological racial inequality, etc who are drawn to places like this (for, in THEIR perspective, legitimate reasons)

       While by no means are the majority of conspiracy theorists bigots, there are a lot of bigots who are conspiracy theorists. It's not hard to see why. It's easy to twist a theory that says a group of powerful people control the world into a theory that a group of powerful
       <em>
        Jews
       </em>
       control the world.

       Not everybody believes that the Jews run the world. Infact, most of us don't. It's a goofy paranoid theory with infused anti semetism.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Southern Poverty Law Center hasn’t counted the members of the so-called “alt-right.” A press representative tells The Daily Beast that they’re not aware of any nationwide surveys designed to count them.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, they estimate that the KKK counts between 5,000 and 8,000 members nationwide. Back in the 1920’s, when cities across the south were erecting monuments to Confederate generals, the Klan had 4 million members.
 As Roger L. Simon points out, this would be an impressive decrease even if the population of the U.S. hadn’t swelled since the 1920’s. Back then, the Klan constituted about 4 percent of the entire U.S. population. Now, the KKK is near its nadir. That would make them less than 0.003 percent of the population, even on the higher end of the SPLC’s estimate. “It’s a small group of real bad people,”

       So . . . your first article has nothing to do with the SPLC. In the second article, nearly every single fact is wrong. In the third article, they're not "stashing" cash overseas--they have it their alongside the vast majority of charities to get additional tax protection for the fund. Ditto for the fourth article.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy, IMO, is that certain segments of the right (usually the far right) have made SPLC out to be something entirely different than what it is. Only a tiny sliver of the SPLC is devoted to hate groups at this point. The mast majority of their resources go to fighting for the civil rights of minorities in the south, whether that's through litigating in federal court to force prisons (including juvenile prisons) to bring their standards up to a Constitutional level, ensuring that immigrants receive due process, or suing school districts that blatantly discriminate against minority groups.

       Correct, and that would get [removed] most likely under rule 1. I'm just saying, those things are truly subjective. The problem is, in today's world of PC/SJW, everything is racist, sexists, etc etc. It's gotten to the point were if everything is, nothing truly is. All the words get diluted. For example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I think homosexuals and transgendered people have a mental disorder, who should be helped psychologically, and dissuaded from following their dillusions.

       Like OP said, the blatant "Jew haters" are usually the trolls/shills. I question the holocaust and "official" history of WWII, but get called "anti-Semitic" for it (which is false), which would bring us to my original comment.

       We left the stone age a while ago man. Homosexuality is not a mental disease any more than heterosexuality. It is a preference, nothing more, nothing less. I am not sure why you think the obvious and usually effective treatment for gender dysphoria, sex change, is bad. So your comment is factually incorrect and seems to be geared to offend rational people, so when they call you out, you can whine about PC culture and SJWs censoring you, which suggests it isn't motivated by a dislike of gays and transgendered people, and is instead motivated by the arrogant and idiotic mindset that people either agree with you or are violating your freedom of speech. Of course, transphobes and homophobes are usually arrogant morons, so you definitely might be both of them.

       Real story checking in: grew up w a big crew of neighborhood kids there were like 30-40 of us. 1 kid would just never date or have anything to do w girls and always the finest ones wanted him cause he was a handsome guy. Eventually over a drunken bender he admits he's gay and that it was because he was abused by an uncle his whole childhood so it was wired into him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He absolutely hated being gay, saw it as a curse and tried all sorts of things to make it go away so he can be normal. To him, being gay is a disorder that is justified in the minds of those who have it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now my take? We all grew up using faggot or gay as a term for stupid, and being homophobic, but this kid was like my brother who I would take a bullet for. That day changed everything for me. While Indo except people for their choices and wiring, I feel bad that some don't want to be gay and see it as a massive joke, a curse. Later I found out that the trans communities have some of the highest suicide rates

       I'd wager to say its a combo. As an Ex-gym rat (I still go but much less because of work) I used to see all the bigger roided dudes in the gym, and then see myself as never big enough. This creates this cycle of more protein, supplements, more gym time, more checking yourself out in the mirror and comparing to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trans go through that too. They see the images on TV of beautiful ancestresses, models, whatever the media considers the the epitome of beauty and they try to live up to that. Some of the trans who start early successfully transition and no one can tell, but those who do it later, who are really tall and have strong masculine features have a harder time, and then on top of that, that hormones they take fuck them up big time.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I know all this, my gay childhood friend who came out and cried in my shoulder about his curse, I told him to go to a support group and went with him there. Many of the trans talk about the hormones they take also make them suicidal and many also regret transitioning and wish they can go back to being men again, or vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, the crazy thing is, the support group I took him too, some of the trans there were talking mad shit about my buddy (about his view that it was a curse) and they were hating on him for that. Its such a mindfuck to hear it there, because it was supposed to be a support group where you can open up about things and the others there did not view this as a curse like he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really eye opening stuff. I have mad empathy for folks who end up going through this all, however I think much of it is the estrogen mimicry in the plastic containers, the water supply, food supply, soy in everything, glyphosate in a lot of stuff, these chems are changing the chemistry of babies in the womb, and I think that's what's causing all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be interesting to see if there is less trans/gay in a community that is off the grid like amish or somewhere jungle-like non-industrial

       I've known many gay people, and a fair share of transgender people. Gay is natural. Occurs in the animal kingdom. Tansgenderism gets into mutilation and transgender hormone therapy. I personally find it offensive when a woman pretends that they are a man. They aren't and will never truly understand the experience. That does not mean I will not respect them in every other way possible.

       So it's okay for a man to pretend they're a woman, but offensive if a woman pretends to be a man? I don't follow your logic....

       Can you scientifically prove what is and what is not a mental disease? I mean it's not like they measure neuron firing rates or something to come up with these classifications. The homosexual advocacy groups bullied the APA into changing it just like the pedophiles today are trying to get the APA to do the same with their disgusting evil.

       Yup. Psychology is mostly quack science. I say that as someone with a degree in it. What becomes a "disorder" in the DSM has more to do with politics and money than science.

       According to the online dictionary, a mental disease is
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        any disease of the mind; the psychological state of someone who has emotional or behavioral problems serious enough to require psychiatric intervention

       Gay people do not have emotional or behavioral problems, so homosexuality is not a mental disease.

       They were wrong before. It happens. Scientists, good scientists, used to think we were created by god, because their religion told them so. Similarly psychologists believed being gay was a sin, so they believed they should cure it. Now, faith doesn't play a role in science, and we know that we evolved like every other organism and being gay isn't a mental disorder.

       Israel deep state uses propaganda to try and convince people that criticism of Zionism = Jew hate.

       If you hate Jews, then you're an ignorant dick. But if you're simply critical of Zionism, then don't let that be misrepresented as Jew hate.

       What, are you not allow to look at WW2 from any other perspective than the allies?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting that if that documentary we're about Stalin who killed 20 million people or Mao Zedong or Khmer Rouge from there perspective who in total killed about 70 million people or over 10 times more people than the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust you wouldn't bat an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that Hitler's name is on different level of evil than those guys? Why is it that we can't even attempt to understand their viewpoint to see it from both sides because everyone knows "the history of war is written by the victors"?

       I don't think Hitler was a good guy, but I might upvote something like that if it can present an interesting argument. Hitler did a lot more than attempt genocide and invade countries across Europe. He also brought Germany out of economic turmoil brought on by the fall out from the first world war, and he fought against the same kind of international banker bullshit we're still fighting against today. It's good to look at other perspectives and consider the nuances of other people's experiences. Like, did you ever notice that American propaganda has painted Hitler as evil incarnate over the kinds of atrocities the US government is also guilty of, genocide, racist interment camps, invading sovereign nations? We literally killed hundreds of thousands Japanese civilians with just two bombs, and we're supposed to be the "good guys"? The reality is there are no "good guys" with regards to WW2, and I think considering the "pro-Nazi" argument can elucidate that fact.

       Hitler's war machine was fueled by Western interests anyway. Got plenty of vehicles from Ford, and his planes required a certain fuel additive to fly that he was supplied with by the King of Switzerland IIRC (I'm sure somebody can correct me). The West basically funded his war machine top to bottom.

       Switzerland NEVER had a king in its 700 years existens. It was part of the HRE (so it had a emporer but was governed by their own republic government) till the HRE stopped existing in 1806. 
It was shortly part of Savoyen (which had a king and was part of the HRE) but that was in the 15th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Switzerland wasnt at all supportive of nazi germany. It did bunker some of the nazi gold but overall they where massivly affraid of being invaded.

       Cam you give me an example of what you mean? And an actual source? Sure Ford supported Hitler while Hitler wasnt the leader of germany (even though the actual amount of help he got from Ford is highly doubtable)

       What you mean is propably romania which though had a facist government and was an allie of germany. Its oilfields was the main source of fuel for the german army.

       Pretty brough claims here. Honestly both your examples are easy to discredit or lack any source by your side. And even if they where both true "some vehicles" and "fuel for planes" can hardly be called "funded his war machine top to bottom."

       Love to hear the balanced view as well Afrobean.  Something we all need to learn is our government (no government) was really the good guy.  There was so much dirt and evil to go around that led to millions upon millions preventable deaths.  Pride and arrogance and our side as well as Japan's Russia' etc.  But FDR, having the most power had the ability to put a stop and limit bloodshed.  He chose otherwise.  Read "Perpetual War For Perpetual Peace"

       That’s not exactly what the doc showed.  But it did show Hitler from a different angle.  However that doesn’t make it racist, and that had historic value.  Hitler was an one of the most important people of the modern age, understanding the man’s own POV has value in understanding more about how he became such.  Looking at him only as a monster or a boogeyman is how one is blindsided when something similar happens.

       The documentary didn't "show Hitler was the good guy." It showed a side of WWII that's been systematically hidden from us. It's perfect for this sub.

       I'd agree with this idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are racists and bigots out there in the world, and some of them probably come here. The difference is that most bigots aren't cartoonish villains who want to do genocide, they don't blame minorities for all of their problems. Most bigots just think their own traits are intrinsically better somehow. I say this as someone with friends and family who are self-avowed racists and who use racial slurs casually. They just think they're better, they're not trying to hurt or keep them down. Even while generalizing racial minorities and using slurs, even while being self aware enough to say "yes I'm racist", they still express hated for the KKK and Nazis.

       Well first of all there is no maybe about it the state of Israel is perhaps the most influential country on the geopolitical landscape and any criticism of it is automatically labeled as anti-semitic by many people

       Second of all this post is ironic because NO ONE is saying that "ALL JEWS RULE THE WORLD" except people like you claiming that this sub preaches it. Saying that "Jews run the world" or "The amount of Jewish people in positions of great power is concerning" is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       the same as saying "ALL Jews are bad people" so stop acting like it.

       Did you? The guy initially said that "Jews run the world" and he responded that they do. Notice how he said "Jews" and not "ALL Jews" huge difference there you are ignoring showing your bias. I don't agree necessarily but it's clear that you are the one that didn't read it fully.

       Why mention a that they’re Jewish? If a handful of Jainist monks had the vast majority of power and control over the world, I’m pretty sure people would mention the fact that they were Jainist monks. In fact, people would probably wonder whether their belief system has anything to do with it.

       The Rockefellers weren't Jewish so why are you including them in this example of powerful families who rule the world? It seems a simple trick to mix a little bit of truth with a little bit of lies to muddy things up.

       John Rockefeller was a devout Christian an would read the Bible daily. He constantly went to prayer meetings and even led his own Bible study with his wife.

       I’m sure it’s mosly negative, but what can you expect when discussing a group that covertly controls government, finance and the media (ie propaganda) for selfish ends?

       Part of the problem, I think, is that there are plenty (the vast majority, really) of uninvolv d and innocent Jewish people.

       Try telling most people a lot of the Nazi's didnt do anything that was any worse than what American's were doing and watch their head blow up with outrage. People here don't know about the American run internment camps for German citizens that existed well after the war.

       I've certainly seen people say negative things but I think you see that in every subreddit. I could walk over to

       I think what you see more of in the rational discussions is people asking questions like
       <strong>
        why do Jews seem to have such an outsized level of control over everything when their
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews">
         total worldwide population is estimated at 17.5 million

       Not to mention that any free speech forum with no or minimum moderation is quickly filled with posts about Jews.

       /pol/ and voat are good modern day examples but it's been happening since the creation of the internet, and before that since the creation of the printing press, and before that all the way back to B.C. Egypt, and before that all the way back to just a few years after the creation of the Jews through Abraham.

       It's only when someone in control steps in and says "hey we've been told that's been forbidden of us" and takes action do you have a place that doesn't speak of such things.

       "All Jews are not evil. Nearly all Jews do not support or even know what's happening any more than we should think all Christians know and support what the Papacy is really up to. It's that whenever men do evil things - especially on a grand scale - it is almost always a Jew or is easily traced to a Jew in charge. This is by design."

       Thinking someone "runs the world" or has a lot of influence doesn't imply racial hatred.  I think the Vatican has a lot of power and is evil but I am not "racist" against Catholics in general.

       Dismissing everything as shilling and psy-ops is a cop out when real issues are present.  Yesterday I found

        This
       </a>
       on new with a lot of vigorous support in the comments.  So many conspiracies thematically include groups of insidious outsiders who want to destroy our way of life or threaten our well being and these types of fables and insinuations have been used against groups of 'undesirables' since time immemorial.  Now those prejudices and scare stories get woven into conspiracy theories and somehow gain an air of legitimacy here, hardly a day goes by without someone accusing HRC of being a literal witch who eats children.  Racism and misogyny aren't a new phenomenon in conspiracies and dismissing those tenancies as agit-prop is ignoring a sickness inside of the community.

       SOME jews are pretty shitty people.

       I think that can be said about all religions/races.

       The problem is when you use terms like "the jews", "the christians" etc.

       Because they are not a homogenous group working towards a common goal. They are just people and some of them are fucked up.

       The only race who doesn't collectively work toward their group interests is white people, and that's why they're being methodically replaced in all of their own countries.

       In fact Jews have been noted for how much more ethnocentric and collective they are than anyone else by people all over the world throughout all of history.

       Conspiracy communities attract many different kinds of people, and some of those people happen to be racist, sexist, xenophobic assholes.  I think you do a disservice to the rest of the community when you suggest it's a plot of undermine credibility.  It isn't.  It's that a small group of people attracted to conspiracies about Jews controlling the world, white genocide, and destruction of Western culture swarm posts that support their world view.   I certainly don't support censoring even racist, sexist, xenophobic assholes, but we should call it out when we see it.  It's better to be honest and critical then to pretend that a conspiracy community wouldn't be home to file ideologies and hatred.

       WTF are you talking about? Teachtaire is clearly pointing to a real-world phenomena, not something you just made up in your head. He never said every conspiracy theorist is a nut-job racist, just that he has met real people in his life who believe in wild conspiracy theories about the world and are also racist. And if you dare to be a conspiracy theorist that isn't conservative, you get labeled a cuck SJW. I have had dozens of ppl on this sub call me that before because socially I lean left. Rejecting the manufactured left-right paradigm doesn't mean that we all have the same opinion about everything. If anything my criticism of the left-right paradigm is that is is too simplistic and doesn't take into consideration the real myriad and complexity of public opinion. It doesn't mean that having differing opinions and politics is not real ... Until ppl critical of the government wake up and realize that it is very easy to fall into racist propaganda, then theres no real hope of creating a better community here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I wonder what your agenda is. Is it to deny the very real reality that racist white supremacists prey on conspiracy theorists distrusting of the government, but lack the ability to distinguish propaganda and reality?

       Its disingenuous to assume that any post here that is overtly racist, obscene and antagonistic is done just by bots or shills to make the community look bad. These are real movements with real people, and they pray on the naive who blindly hate the system and are easily manipulated to believe it is one race or group of people that is to blame. Where better place to recruit those people than here and T_D? Anyone who grew up during or researched

       will 100% understand that this is an actual threat with real people. White Supremacists flocked to the punk scene because the messages in the music and the whole nature of being punk was anti-establishment. Fuck the system, fuck the government. There was a huge white-supremacist punk scene back then, and it still exists today. But the white-supremacists wouldn't stay in their own small nazi-punk scene with their nazi punk bands and had to branch out. A bunch of punk bands (Bad Brains, Circle Jerk, Black Flag, Minor Threat, Dead Kennedys, etc) said no more and starting kicking the shit out of these guys, getting them to leave their shows. Remind you of anything going on now? The

      <p>
       Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Take a history lesson folks and learn from those who have already been there. The Dead Kennedys singer, Jello Birafa BTW is still out there condemning the system and condemning fascist racists.

       dumbass. If you knew anything about Jews you would know their entire belief system is centered around Jew supremacy, world domination and the enslavement of non-Jews. Okay, if you're okay with Jews you might as well be okay with the KKK and all the other nasty hate organization. Trust me. Nobody hates you more than the Jews. You are a dog to them. If you don't believe me you need to learn what their scriptures say. Stop writing your ignorant bullshit on the internet. Just go back to watching Morning Joe but stop spreading their shit you loser brainwashed CNN watching idiot.

       Nobody can pretend to know about the Holocaust until you know about the extensive history of Jewish revolution and the forms it took from Zealotry of the 1 Century, to Communism and Zionism in the 19th and 20th.  Also do not neglect to notice the racial overtones of their festivals. If the Holocaust never made sense to you, that's because you're missing half the recipe. Communism and Finance. Two sides of the same coin. The German people are excellent and venerable as evidenced by Germany's conduct from the end of WW2 until now. The Zio-Communists are rapists and brigands, ne'er-do-wells, drug-dealers, racial inciters, as can be evidenced by the conduct of Israel since WW2. Isn't that the Jews left Europe en masse in direct proportion to the failure of Communism in itself suspicious?

       We left the stone age a while ago man. Homosexuality is not a mental disease any more than heterosexuality. It is a preference, nothing more, nothing less. I am not sure why you think the obvious and usually effective treatment for gender dysphoria, sex change, is bad. So your comment is factually incorrect and seems to be geared to offend rational people, so when they call you out, you can whine about PC culture and SJWs censoring you, which suggests it isn't motivated by a dislike of gays and transgendered people, and is instead motivated by the arrogant and idiotic mindset that people either agree with you or are violating your freedom of speech. Of course, transphobes and homophobes are usually arrogant morons, so you definitely might be both of them.

       So . . . your first article has nothing to do with the SPLC. In the second article, nearly every single fact is wrong. In the third article, they're not "stashing" cash overseas--they have it their alongside the vast majority of charities to get additional tax protection for the fund. Ditto for the fourth article.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy, IMO, is that certain segments of the right (usually the far right) have made SPLC out to be something entirely different than what it is. Only a tiny sliver of the SPLC is devoted to hate groups at this point. The mast majority of their resources go to fighting for the civil rights of minorities in the south, whether that's through litigating in federal court to force prisons (including juvenile prisons) to bring their standards up to a Constitutional level, ensuring that immigrants receive due process, or suing school districts that blatantly discriminate against minority groups.
