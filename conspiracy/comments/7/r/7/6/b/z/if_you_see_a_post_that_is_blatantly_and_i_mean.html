<p>OP can message the mods directly with links if he&#39;s concerned about Rule 10. Either way, he needs to present some actual evidence of blatant Rule 1 violations which the mods are not removing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there was this guy a while ago <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/conspiracy+%22Its_okay_to_be_white%22&amp;amp;filter=0">https://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/conspiracy+&quot;Its_okay_to_be_white&quot;&amp;amp;filter=0</a> but a lot of the threads have gone from the list, as they deleted their account shortly after I called them out for posting racist agitprop.  You can see a cached page of some of their other threads <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:lU8WFzifg_sJ:https://www.reddit.com/u/Its_okay_to_be_white%3Futm_source%3Damp%26utm_medium%3Dpost_header">here</a> to paint a slightly broader picture of the kind of stuff they posted.</p>

<p>While the threads are not necessarily racist when viewed individually, looking at the overall theme of what they posted it is clear they had racial prejudices and were attempting to spread them.</p>

<p>Posts like this were a lot more common in the run up to the election, and I have noticed a significant decrease in posts like this over the last year or so.  Whether that&#39;s because there&#39;s less need for people (either sincere &#39;activists&#39;, for lack of a better term, or bots/paid trolls) to push people towards anti-sjw/far right views,  or stricter moderation, is not for me to say.  I do think the submission statement rule will help further curb this type of stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center hasn’t counted the members of the so-called “alt-right.” A press representative tells The Daily Beast that they’re not aware of any nationwide surveys designed to count them.</p>

<p>However, they estimate that the KKK counts between 5,000 and 8,000 members nationwide. Back in the 1920’s, when cities across the south were erecting monuments to Confederate generals, the Klan had 4 million members.
 As Roger L. Simon points out, this would be an impressive decrease even if the population of the U.S. hadn’t swelled since the 1920’s. Back then, the Klan constituted about 4 percent of the entire U.S. population. Now, the KKK is near its nadir. That would make them less than 0.003 percent of the population, even on the higher end of the SPLC’s estimate. “It’s a small group of real bad people,”</p>

In the third article, they&#39;re not &quot;stashing&quot; cash overseas--they have it their alongside the vast majority of charities to get additional tax protection for the fund. Ditto for the fourth article.  </p>

<p>The real conspiracy, IMO, is that certain segments of the right (usually the far right) have made SPLC out to be something entirely different than what it is. Only a tiny sliver of the SPLC is devoted to hate groups at this point. The mast majority of their resources go to fighting for the civil rights of minorities in the south, whether that&#39;s through litigating in federal court to force prisons (including juvenile prisons) to bring their standards up to a Constitutional level, ensuring that immigrants receive due process, or suing school districts that blatantly discriminate against minority groups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Real story checking in: grew up w a big crew of neighborhood kids there were like 30-40 of us. 1 kid would just never date or have anything to do w girls and always the finest ones wanted him cause he was a handsome guy. Eventually over a drunken bender he admits he&#39;s gay and that it was because he was abused by an uncle his whole childhood so it was wired into him.</p>

<p>He absolutely hated being gay, saw it as a curse and tried all sorts of things to make it go away so he can be normal. To him, being gay is a disorder that is justified in the minds of those who have it. </p>

<p>Now my take? We all grew up using faggot or gay as a term for stupid, and being homophobic, but this kid was like my brother who I would take a bullet for. That day changed everything for me. While Indo except people for their choices and wiring, I feel bad that some don&#39;t want to be gay and see it as a massive joke, a curse. Later I found out that the trans communities have some of the highest suicide rates</p>

<p>I&#39;d wager to say its a combo. As an Ex-gym rat (I still go but much less because of work) I used to see all the bigger roided dudes in the gym, and then see myself as never big enough. This creates this cycle of more protein, supplements, more gym time, more checking yourself out in the mirror and comparing to others.</p>

<p>Trans go through that too. They see the images on TV of beautiful ancestresses, models, whatever the media considers the the epitome of beauty and they try to live up to that. Some of the trans who start early successfully transition and no one can tell, but those who do it later, who are really tall and have strong masculine features have a harder time, and then on top of that, that hormones they take fuck them up big time.</p>

<p>How do I know all this, my gay childhood friend who came out and cried in my shoulder about his curse, I told him to go to a support group and went with him there. Many of the trans talk about the hormones they take also make them suicidal and many also regret transitioning and wish they can go back to being men again, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the crazy thing is, the support group I took him too, some of the trans there were talking mad shit about my buddy (about his view that it was a curse) and they were hating on him for that. Its such a mindfuck to hear it there, because it was supposed to be a support group where you can open up about things and the others there did not view this as a curse like he did.</p>

<p>Really eye opening stuff. I have mad empathy for folks who end up going through this all, however I think much of it is the estrogen mimicry in the plastic containers, the water supply, food supply, soy in everything, glyphosate in a lot of stuff, these chems are changing the chemistry of babies in the womb, and I think that&#39;s what&#39;s causing all of this.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see if there is less trans/gay in a community that is off the grid like amish or somewhere jungle-like non-industrial</p>

Similarly psychologists believed being gay was a sin, so they believed they should cure it.

Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
<strong>Revelation 2:9</strong>
I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
<strong>Revelation 3:9</strong>
Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
<strong>Romans 2:28-29</strong>
For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
<strong>John 8:43-45</strong> [jesus speaking to jews]
43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.
44 <strong>Ye are of your father the devil</strong>, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</p>

<p>Why is it that Hitler&#39;s name is on different level of evil than those guys? Why is it that we can&#39;t even attempt to understand their viewpoint to see it from both sides because everyone knows &quot;the history of war is written by the victors&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Hitler was a good guy, but I might upvote something like that if it can present an interesting argument. Hitler did a lot more than attempt genocide and invade countries across Europe. He also brought Germany out of economic turmoil brought on by the fall out from the first world war, and he fought against the same kind of international banker bullshit we&#39;re still fighting against today. It&#39;s good to look at other perspectives and consider the nuances of other people&#39;s experiences. Like, did you ever notice that American propaganda has painted Hitler as evil incarnate over the kinds of atrocities the US government is also guilty of, genocide, racist interment camps, invading sovereign nations? We literally killed hundreds of thousands Japanese civilians with just two bombs, and we&#39;re supposed to be the &quot;good guys&quot;? The reality is there are no &quot;good guys&quot; with regards to WW2, and I think considering the &quot;pro-Nazi&quot; argument can elucidate that fact.</p>

<p>Also Switzerland wasnt at all supportive of nazi germany. It did bunker some of the nazi gold but overall they where massivly affraid of being invaded. </p>

<p>Cam you give me an example of what you mean? And an actual source? Sure Ford supported Hitler while Hitler wasnt the leader of germany (even though the actual amount of help he got from Ford is highly doubtable)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What you mean is propably romania which though had a facist government and was an allie of germany. Its oilfields was the main source of fuel for the german army.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Pretty brough claims here. Honestly both your examples are easy to discredit or lack any source by your side. And even if they where both true &quot;some vehicles&quot; and &quot;fuel for planes&quot; can hardly be called &quot;funded his war machine top to bottom.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d agree with this idea.</p>

<p>But there are racists and bigots out there in the world, and some of them probably come here. The difference is that most bigots aren&#39;t cartoonish villains who want to do genocide, they don&#39;t blame minorities for all of their problems. Most bigots just think their own traits are intrinsically better somehow. I say this as someone with friends and family who are self-avowed racists and who use racial slurs casually. They just think they&#39;re better, they&#39;re not trying to hurt or keep them down. Even while generalizing racial minorities and using slurs, even while being self aware enough to say &quot;yes I&#39;m racist&quot;, they still express hated for the KKK and Nazis. </p>

<p>I think what you see more of in the rational discussions is people asking questions like <strong>why do Jews seem to have such an outsized level of control over everything when their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews">total worldwide population is estimated at 17.5 million</a> making them just 0.23% of the people occupying the planet?</strong></p>

<p>/pol/ and voat are good modern day examples but it&#39;s been happening since the creation of the internet, and before that since the creation of the printing press, and before that all the way back to B.C. Egypt, and before that all the way back to just a few years after the creation of the Jews through Abraham. </p>

<p>It&#39;s only when someone in control steps in and says &quot;hey we&#39;ve been told that&#39;s been forbidden of us&quot; and takes action do you have a place that doesn&#39;t speak of such things. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Then you have this quote from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;All Jews are not evil. Nearly all Jews do not support or even know what&#39;s happening any more than we should think all Christians know and support what the Papacy is really up to. It&#39;s that whenever men do evil things - especially on a grand scale - it is almost always a Jew or is easily traced to a Jew in charge. This is by design.&quot;</p>

Yesterday I found <a href="http://russia-insider.com/en/its-time-drop-jew-taboo/ri22186">This</a> on new with a lot of vigorous support in the comments.  So many conspiracies thematically include groups of insidious outsiders who want to destroy our way of life or threaten our well being and these types of fables and insinuations have been used against groups of &#39;undesirables&#39; since time immemorial.  Now those prejudices and scare stories get woven into conspiracy theories and somehow gain an air of legitimacy here, hardly a day goes by without someone accusing HRC of being a literal witch who eats children.  Racism and misogyny aren&#39;t a new phenomenon in conspiracies and dismissing those tenancies as agit-prop is ignoring a sickness inside of the community.</p>

I think you do a disservice to the rest of the community when you suggest it&#39;s a plot of undermine credibility.  It isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s that a small group of people attracted to conspiracies about Jews controlling the world, white genocide, and destruction of Western culture swarm posts that support their world view.   I certainly don&#39;t support censoring even racist, sexist, xenophobic assholes, but we should call it out when we see it.

    <div class="md"><p>WTF are you talking about? Teachtaire is clearly pointing to a real-world phenomena, not something you just made up in your head. He never said every conspiracy theorist is a nut-job racist, just that he has met real people in his life who believe in wild conspiracy theories about the world and are also racist. And if you dare to be a conspiracy theorist that isn&#39;t conservative, you get labeled a cuck SJW. I have had dozens of ppl on this sub call me that before because socially I lean left. Rejecting the manufactured left-right paradigm doesn&#39;t mean that we all have the same opinion about everything. If anything my criticism of the left-right paradigm is that is is too simplistic and doesn&#39;t take into consideration the real myriad and complexity of public opinion. It doesn&#39;t mean that having differing opinions and politics is not real ... Until ppl critical of the government wake up and realize that it is very easy to fall into racist propaganda, then theres no real hope of creating a better community here. </p>

<p>Now I wonder what your agenda is. Is it to deny the very real reality that racist white supremacists prey on conspiracy theorists distrusting of the government, but lack the ability to distinguish propaganda and reality? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are also real accounts here who make posts like this to <a href="http://gawker.com/reddit-is-so-racist-white-supremacists-are-using-it-to-1691162974">recruit new like-minded individuals</a>.  Nazism, Fascism, Racism, White Supremacy, Xenophobia, etc is nothing new and it has been plaguing our country for decades upon decades, centuries upon centuries. Are all of you too young to remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_History_X">American History X</a>? The movie was loosely based on a true story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Meeink">Frank Meeink</a>.  If you haven&#39;t watched this movie, do it. It will open your eyes to the various forms of recruitment and indoctrination strategies that these white supremacists take. </p>

<p>Its disingenuous to assume that any post here that is overtly racist, obscene and antagonistic is done just by bots or shills to make the community look bad. These are real movements with real people, and they pray on the naive who blindly hate the system and are easily manipulated to believe it is one race or group of people that is to blame. Where better place to recruit those people than here and T_D? Anyone who grew up during or researched <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/punks-and-nazis-oral-history">the punk scene from the 70s and 80s</a> will 100% understand that this is an actual threat with real people. White Supremacists flocked to the punk scene because the messages in the music and the whole nature of being punk was anti-establishment. Fuck the system, fuck the government. There was a huge white-supremacist punk scene back then, and it still exists today. But the white-supremacists wouldn&#39;t stay in their own small nazi-punk scene with their nazi punk bands and had to branch out. A bunch of punk bands (Bad Brains, Circle Jerk, Black Flag, Minor Threat, Dead Kennedys, etc) said no more and starting kicking the shit out of these guys, getting them to leave their shows. Remind you of anything going on now? The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MkRuV0aCcI">Dead Kennedys</a> even wrote a song about it. </p>

<p>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Take a history lesson folks and learn from those who have already been there. The Dead Kennedys singer, Jello Birafa BTW is still out there condemning the system and condemning fascist racists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody can pretend to know about the Holocaust until you know about the extensive history of Jewish revolution and the forms it took from Zealotry of the 1 Century, to Communism and Zionism in the 19th and 20th.  Also do not neglect to notice the racial overtones of their festivals. If the Holocaust never made sense to you, that&#39;s because you&#39;re missing half the recipe. Communism and Finance. Two sides of the same coin. The German people are excellent and venerable as evidenced by Germany&#39;s conduct from the end of WW2 until now. The Zio-Communists are rapists and brigands, ne&#39;er-do-wells, drug-dealers, racial inciters, as can be evidenced by the conduct of Israel since WW2. Isn&#39;t that the Jews left Europe en masse in direct proportion to the failure of Communism in itself suspicious? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So . . . your first article has nothing to do with the SPLC. In the second article, nearly every single fact is wrong. In the third article, they&#39;re not &quot;stashing&quot; cash overseas--they have it their alongside the vast majority of charities to get additional tax protection for the fund. Ditto for the fourth article.  </p>

<p>The real conspiracy, IMO, is that certain segments of the right (usually the far right) have made SPLC out to be something entirely different than what it is. Only a tiny sliver of the SPLC is devoted to hate groups at this point. The mast majority of their resources go to fighting for the civil rights of minorities in the south, whether that&#39;s through litigating in federal court to force prisons (including juvenile prisons) to bring their standards up to a Constitutional level, ensuring that immigrants receive due process, or suing school districts that blatantly discriminate against minority groups. </p>
