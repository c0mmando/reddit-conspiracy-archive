<p>After a few of these experiences I became aware that there is more to this life on a metaphysical level than what is scientifically accepted or proven. This lead me to be open to the idea that there could be more than what meets the eye in other facets of life as well. </p>

<p>I am curious if others have had similar experiences. Thanks üôèüèº </p>

<p>But anyway, my buddy was gone for a bit and I went searching for him. I found him on the front porch with a pair of safety glasses. He said the old man up stairs gave them to him and suggested he be careful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, and I never reached out to them in the first place (although I did reach out to other spirits - different occasion - different experience). <em>They did to me</em>, for whatever reason. I&#39;ve written about these events/experiences (on here and in another sub), if you care to read, I&#39;ll dig up the links. Let me know. </p>

<p>They gave me something (or maybe took something away - IDK?), for a reason. I still see shadow figures, and people... in my soul, I know are physical manifestations of spirits, but I generally block them out. </p>

<p>These beings are very finicky, and can help or curse, literally at a drop of a dime. I have no ambition or intention to make a contract with them, and there is always a contract made, which has to be paid in the Astral realm.</p>

It was a comment to a post in <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a> like ~1-1.5 years ago. If any of you niggas have that saved, it would truly help a nigga out right now :). I&#39;ll keep looking, and probably just PM them to you (if I can find them - maybe OP deleted their post?). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll share with and don&#39;t give a shit if I get downvoted haha</p>

<p>Past few years I&#39;ve personally studied the metaphysical aspects of life. I&#39;ve read many books, came across many websites and watched a lot of videos. I questioned a lot that went on deep down within me. I knew there was always more but reading, hearing &amp; seeing everything with my physical eyes didn&#39;t seem to answer a lot of questions.
One part of my life I fell down the &quot;Mandela effect&quot; hole. There was so much more questions that came up knowing for a fact that I knew i wasn&#39;t going insane for not remembering a certain Mandela effect. I learned to give up &amp; just let go...accepted what was presented.
There&#39;s other holes I fell down but same outcome. For me, I always had the answer once I started looking &amp; listening within. No information out there had what I kept looking for. I mean researching pointed me in the right direction, but it wasn&#39;t gonna take me where I needed to go. 
This sub has helped me see behind the curtain many times. There&#39;s always that feeling of &quot;that don&#39;t seem right&quot; when I hear a news story. But regardless, I don&#39;t let myself fall down another hole. Will worrying help me in any way? Not at all. The only changes that make a bigger impact on the outside is the positive changes within my own world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i say yes! My mother took a family photo of me my sis and my cousin out in the kitchen of their house and was photobombed by a huge black figure in the doorway to the hallway that me and and my sisters rooms were in. I mean this thing took up the entire door frame and was huminoid and not translucent it was so freaky and if you zoomed in on where the face would be i guess you could just make out like two eyes and a fucked up smile </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll bite. I posted this a while back when some sub was talking about people with green eyes being aliens. I mentioned I had a strange experience with 3 friends in the late 90s. We joke it was an alien abduction but we don&#39;t really tell anyone this story because it just sounds crazy. I was in my teens when this happened. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really hard to explain without drawing how my bed was to show how my body was contorted, but I&#39;ll give you the gist of it. When I was in high school in the late 90s, me and my friend T, now deceased, went to a party and left my brother and our other friend J at our house playing video games. I had a curfew so me and T came back to my house around 11pm and my bro and J were in our downstairs den playing video games. Me and T went up to my room to watch tv and sleep and I was on my wrought iron daybed and he was on the floor. The daybed was pushed up against the wall on two sides in a corner of the room. At some point in the night I woke up and was somehow pinned between the metal bars of the bed and the wall and my limbs were all contorted and wrapped around the bars all weird. I had to push the bed away from the wall where I was squeezed and wiggle out of it and fall to the floor and crawl out from under the bed. My friend was sleeping peacefully on the floor and I got back in bed and went to sleep, not even moving my bed back against the wall. </p>

<p>The next morning my mom wakes us up for breakfast and my brother and J were being really quiet and acting weird while we were eating. I don&#39;t remember how the conversation started, but my brother said &quot;I woke up at some point and my bed was soaking wet, like it had been thrown in the pool.&quot; My mom makes pee jokes and J says &quot;I woke up under the pool deck. I had to pry the lattice off to get out&quot;. Then I tell my story. T said he slept fine and nothing weird happened. We go down to my brothers room and I push down on the mattress and sure enough that fucker was soaking wet like it had been dipped in the pool and the lattice was torn off where J said it happened. </p>

<p>I ended up marrying J and T died after over a decade of heavy drug use, so we still mention it sometimes like &quot;did that really fucking happen?&quot; and we have joked about alien abductions but we have never said that our experience was definitely aliens. We are pretty agnostic about shit and healthy skeptics. </p>

<p>The only other weird thing that happened was I developed this red bump on my arm that looked like a bug bite. It was there for a few months and finally came to a head one day. When it did I happened to be in guitar class with my friend P and I showed him and he was like &quot;pop it!&quot; so I did because I like gross shit. I start squeezing and we are staring at it and suddenly this white, bone like cylinder came out of the hole. We were like &quot;what the fuck is that?! No way!&quot; and were freaking out because of how long it was. It was probably half an inch long and was white and hard and almost perfectly cylindrical. I assumed it was a calcium deposit or something I had gotten stuck in my arm from falling down. I wish I had kept it but I didn&#39;t want to be the girl showing my friends what had come out of my wound, because I totally would have. I don&#39;t know if the two are related and I didn&#39;t even remember the arm thing years later until P was like &quot;remember when that weird piece of bone came out of your arm in guitar class?!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll admit, I have my own story too, but I dont mention it to anyone because it seems so crazy. But anyway, this happened to me when I was 12. Our family live in an apartment complex in southern California. Outside of my window was a tree, a bit of a distance away, I would say about 20 or 30 feet. Anyway, my bed would face the tree and it was soothing to hear the wind blow and see the tree move as I dozed off to sleep with the window open. Well in this particular night, I believe it was around the summer time in June, and there wasnt any wind. I then see an oval type object fly behind the tree in a horizontal fashion from left to right. I tried to make as much sense of it as my 12 year old mind could. So my first thought was, &quot;oh, it must be a balloon and the wind was just blowing it sideways.&quot; But the tree was not moving at all. So I tried to fall asleep again. The next time I open my eyes, I see the exact same object, but fly in the reverse way, from right to left! I wake up the next morning to find my window closed. I thought that was strange and just figured that my mom had come in and closed that window. But then I remember the strange dream that I had. I dreamt that I was in a drugged state, being walked through a hallway by two individuals on both sides as if I was being escorted. Im brought to a dark room with what appeared to be a console or computer at the center of the room. The room didnt have normal flat walls like were used to, but rather, it was very cylindrical. Anyway, I then hear and see (what I believe in my mind) a jumbled mess of noises. being startled I look around and see that these figures have a sort of coat over them and have human type bodies. They have a hat thing on, and that also obscures what I believe is their face. I then hear more noises and I look at the being in the center of the room at the console. Then I hear the words, &quot;reprobi&quot; and &quot;fregit&quot;. I then reply with, &quot;what?&quot;. the creature goes back to the console and says,&quot;hello&quot;. I respond, &quot;Hi&quot;, obviously shaken and completely scared. I then say, &quot;who are you? what do you want?&quot;. The being then says to me, &quot;I need about tree fiddy!&quot;.  Wellllll it was about that time I began to get suspicious and I realized it was a large creature from the mesozoic era. So I said to him, &quot;Dammit Loch Ness monster, you quit bugging me about tree fiddy! I work for my money!&quot; My it was scary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We joked they flubbed the teleportation. Another reason we never discussed it with many people was our little town was semi-famous for UFO sightings. They mentioned us on the first episode of X-Files, MUFON had conventions here, books were written, and some soldiers even went AWOL and drove here for some weird reason and made national news. This was all before we moved here. Then the guy who wrote the UFO book and made videos moved and they found a model UFO in his attic and it was declared a hoax, so there was no way we were going to be the new kids at school talking about being abducted by aliens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I seemed to be emitting strong electro magnetic energies, or I might&#39;ve been attracting them. It was like I was activated in a sense, and it lasted a little more than a week. One instance where I could observe its effect once on an external object. Resting earpieces/heaphones suddenly moving as if something brushed through them and I could feel it as well, then my PC crashed afterwards when I put my hand over it. Also I used a free EMF app to try to masure it. Probably far from the most reliable tool vs an actual EMF device, so I coudn&#39;t be certain but it did seem to respond with the sensations I had, though I think there was some confirmation bias every now and then. One instance where I was in the bathroom and the magnetism made it awkward and icky to breathe and it seemed the tin/metal roof even started cracking slightly the longer it lasted. I started to see small &quot;orbs&quot;, or rather photon-like type balls of light orbiting me. </p>

<p>I also had electric sensations and frizzles beneath my scalp, and it felt like the neurons in my brain would just light up like a christmas tree times.</p>

<p>It was almost as if something was communicating with me as well, but in retrospect it might&#39;ve been my own subconscious, talking back to me. It would respond immediately if I asked a question, but everything that came back was up to my interpretation, so it&#39;s hard to tell. Had to think very intuitively in order to try to make sense of it and there was no way of me knowing whether I translated it correctly or if it even was supposed to mean anything.</p>

<p>I had bodily vibrations, in one instance it was quite strong, it felt like I had a pulsating device inside my gut and it was pounding quite fast. Weird sensations in both pectoral muscles, first right then left, then it subdued and never occured again.</p>

<p>Everything subsided after roughly two weeks but I still have the electric sensations in my scalp, and sometimes I can feel my hairs moving around when it happens.</p>

<p>More likely it&#39;s just some quirk of anatomy. I have heamachromatosis (too much iron) so it could be caused by that or just a highly coincidental type of confirmation bias. That said I find these scans of brains on psychedelics interesting:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes definitely, I have had a few. The most prominent one being when I was young I lived in a Victorian home and had many experiences as did my siblings and mother, we eventually moved out because it was so bad it was causing havoc in our lives. The house has since been sold 5 times and the entrance to the attic was dry walled over (I looked at pictures on Zillow). When I did some further research I found that the father of the house back in 1917 had suffocated his 6 year old daughter in the attic and then hung himself. This was in Chicago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was the house on the south side? I grew up in an old house in that area and we had our share of weird experiences, but a friends home was way worse. If my memory serves a someone killed a family in the attic sometime in the early 20th century. My buddy and I were 10 or so. He had a younger sister, probably 7 or 8 who would frequently wake up locked in the attic with no means of getting in or pulling the ladder and hatch up behind her. We would always here movement and coughing up there even when no one was home. We have since moved out of state but have spoke a few times since then. His father sealed the attic off and the weird activity has mostly stopped. May or may not be related. That era of Chicago was incredibly brutal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of weird things. </p>

<p>Most of them came from high school when I dated girl who Has a family I now believe to be a part of some weird group or coven. </p>

<p>I was always sick as a child. Near death in and out of the hospital. Until I was about 10 then outside of a cold nothing   </p>

<p>I would sleepwalk from time to time. Wake up in my parents car. Corner of my room. Hear voices whenever I‚Äôm in nature. Have a weird relationship with all animals. </p>

<p>Anyways while dating this girl in high school her family was always doing seances and trying to get me involved (which I suspected was always because of my rather conservative upbringing and maybe I can channel Idk). I had no interest. Never did. Well one night they had one at the House we lived in. I wasn‚Äôt there but I came back after to sleep. Well the next morning I wake up on the couch and my girlfriend and her mother are just staring at me. They proceed to tell me that at some point I woke up, got myself a drink, sat at the kitchen table in the dark, and proceeded to speak in lain for a good 10 minutes.  This happened three more times. They filmed it. It was the strangest thing. And they seemed so giddy about it. It‚Äôs what started my interest in the hidden aspect of all things. And how I discovered their dark family secrets and got the fuck out of dodge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone here experience alien like interactions with psychedelics?</p>

<p>Saw a ufo above and behind me at the peak of the trip.  To me, they did not feel friendly.  I felt like they were scouting the area and flexing some muscle at the same time, cause I was like oh fuck.  I kept composure though, and about-faced my way out of there!  The following couple hours were extremely intense.  The best way to describe it would be like a rated R version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk1krRTyiAs">this movie</a>.  Almost like having agent smiths after you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once when I was on 3.5g&#39;s of awesome mushrooms I saw what I believe to be a ufo...
I&#39;d just gotten home (had to drive home tripping because my friends parents came home early, was under aged at the time...) and was walking to my room, which was a finished shed I my mom&#39;s backyard. As I stepped out the back door i  looked up, and saw a weird pulsating light, that was white/greenish was was sort of growing and retracting as the light changed colors. It was hovering maybe a few hundred feet above my house, and was completely motionless... now me, knowing I was tripping, stood there for a minute just trying to figure out what was going on... I finally decided that yuuuup, this sure looks like a ufo, or something! So I ran back inside and sheepishly asked my sister to come look at a &quot;weird plane&quot; I was seeing.</p>

<p>Now we live near a small local airport, and had lived there for at least 17 years at this point, so we know what the small plates and jets in the area looked like, and the flight paths they took...</p>

<p>Anyway back to the story... so my sister and I walk back into the backyard and onto the deck we had, to get a better view. At this point the ufo is still hovering motionless and pulsating and  changing from white to green in a sort of weird natural pattern, I can&#39;t describe it... then I got out my cell phone (some Nokia slider phone, pre smart phone days) and start to record the ufo. As soon as I point the camera at it the object shoots off to the west and I loose sight of it in seconds, I can&#39;t even begin to estimate how insanely fast it was travelling, since it was gone, I stopped filming.</p>

<p>My sister and I both look at each other, clearly both perplexed. As we are standing there for maybe 5 or 10 seconds processing the events the orb shoots back from the western horizon to hover over our house again! Still pulsating and   changing from white to green... then it suddenly shoots south and disappears over the horizon again. Gone for a few seconds, and then it&#39;s back! Hovers for a minute then zoom! It&#39;s gone over the northern horizon! Zoom! It&#39;s back! This happened several times for each of the cardinal directions. </p>

<p>After probably 10 or 15 minutes the ufo shot off to the west and disappeared over the horizon. I spent several hours still watching the skies, but never saw anything like it again.</p>

<p>Checked my phone later and the ufo was on camera, but over exposed and looked like a weird ball of white light. I showed the video to some friends and family who all thought it was very odd... Sadly that phone broke and I lost the recording.</p>

<p>Still I know my sister and I will never forget that event. And if my mm is to be believed it&#39;s not the first alien encounter or interaction my family has had....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting read and description.  There is belief that mushrooms are a probe that go off and signal to the mother ship that it&#39;s picked up activity.  Would make sense if we are to think that this suckers want to expand themselves galactically and interdemensionally. What better way to cover more ground?  In this case, space?

    <div class="md"><p>I was on church trip to Costa Rica in highschool. After a day of doing a lot of good work in the City, we came back to the hotel and went to bed. In the middle of the night our TV kept turning on. I thought it was a roommate messing with us so I was determined to catch him. </p>

<p>Then I got him. He was hunched beside the TV ready to turn it on. I said, &quot;got ya!&quot; When I said that he sat up from his bed (not near the TV) and we both saw the dark shadow figure near the TV evaporate into like a mist. </p>

<p>It definitely was not a shadow. Nothing in the room changed to make it go away orher than us both looking at it.</p>

<p>To this day 15+ years later, I swear I saw a demon of some kind. I think it was because we we&#39;re in a particularly dark area full of witchcraft and we we&#39;re sharing the message of Jesus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing and doing the lords work. I‚Äôve experienced a shadow person as well. Interestingly this shadow person was also near the television across from the bed I was in. I noticed something moving at the periphery of my sight. I sat up in bed to see what was moving and the shadow on the wall just behind the tv was in the shape of a man. I was trying to figure out what was making the shadow when the shadow made a movement as if it noticed that I could see it and then it ran away, along the wall, into the shadows. I had a tough time sleeping after this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had 2 situations. </p>

<p>One at the Alamo I was at the hospital (like 4 bunks) and my right arm started hurting really bad. I closed my eyes and grimaced in pain and saw from the perspective of the person that I was in the hospital ward but it looked different and I was missing my arm. I left lol.</p>

<p>other time was I was sitting on the couch with my wife when I felt a rush of anger and hate like I&#39;ve never felt before. I then felt like i was running through farmland on the other side of the village I lived in and then I attacked a cow. The next day all over the village people were talking about a dead cow (heard it at the general store) </p>

<p>Personally, I have had encounters with aliens, but only on DMT. The involvement of a &quot;drug&quot; makes it no less real, believe me. I think DMT is a technology designed to allow us to access these other realms and encounter these beings. Having that sort of experience is incredibly common, so common that stories of this sort pop up pretty much daily on reddit. I&#39;ve compiled a lot of them, to give people more of an idea of what happens. Check it out sometime:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing this. I think you‚Äôre right about drugs being a sort of technology. It‚Äôs interesting to observe the spiritual realm as a technological realm. When we use a drug we are changing our frequency which changes our perception of the world.  The Same thing happens when we exercise and our bodies naturally release dopamine and they get runners high. </p>

<p>DMT sounds like your changing your frequency to channel 8,000! I am intimidated to try DMT. I‚Äôve done ayahuasca and it was good but for me it was like being on heavy mushrooms with people throwing up around you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it‚Äôs by design that some people are more sensitive than others. In a society it would make sense that some people are better at building things with their hands, some are great thinkers. In a Wolf litter there are alpha males, females, betas, etc.. and that dynamic creates a functioning group. Similarly something like this may happen with humans as a species. We all have different natural talents and strengths. 
Maybe there is a spectrum of people that we don‚Äôt acknowledge in our current society. In many tribal societies there are Shamans who are sensitive to the psychic realm that are able to do healings and predict the future. Imagine if fluoride in our toothpaste and the frequencies emitted from the screens we are looking at right now are hindering those sensitivities. Thanks for the response. I wish you a positive rush of serendipity in your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s wild coincidence - but I kill lights. In fact, I&#39;m bad to have around anything that uses electricity/is mechanical.</p>

<p>This has happened my entire life, in homes I&#39;ve lived in and in public spaces. It&#39;s definitely more pronounced if I&#39;m stressed. </p>

<p>My phone batteries - on multiple phones - never lasted more than 2-3 hours. Light bulbs - even LEDs - break often enough that replacing them throughout the house is a monthly job. I seem to &quot;short out&quot; vehicles and tractors I&#39;m messing with - the problems bubble up if I use the vehicle for too long, and then go away if I leave it alone for a few days. Not just stuff like flooded carbs/etc - but check engine lights, &quot;dead&quot; batteries,&quot; etc. That&#39;s probably more easily explainable than the rest. </p>

<p>I feel like I generate a lot more static than the people I&#39;ve lived with - to the point that one complained that I could make her head ache in the winter. I&#39;ve never had a laptop work for me longer than a year or so - and it was trackable for a while, as I was using company laptops and burning them out. </p>

<p>Getting Netflix was interesting - and, again, probably wild coincidence - but it just flat-out doesn&#39;t work if I&#39;m upset. Any wifi, for that matter - it absolutely bogs down and the signal peters out until I&#39;ve calmed down or left. </p>

<p>Again - probably not real. It&#39;s not aliens or ghosts. But I seem to have way more trouble with electricity than the average guy. About the only &quot;explanation&quot; I&#39;ve ever heard for this is 1. It&#39;s not real, just confirmation bias 2. Unusually high iron in the blood. I used to get nosebleeds, constantly, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m going with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the same issue. Exactly as you describe. It has become a running joke in my family.  We have tested it out because some people have sworn I was ignoring their calls or text messages. So we switched phones and whatever phone is in my hand will inexplicably not work.  More so if I am upset. Watches slow down and stop. WiFi fluctuates. I pay for the fastest speed available.  I have had to return two vehicles for electrical issues both brand new.  Except I never had nosebleeds not high iron. I have heard it has to do with electromagnetism but I am not sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s just been a strange thing that I&#39;ve always carried around. I joke that &quot;machines hate me.&quot; But it&#39;s true - I cannot rely on laptops/phones lasting much more than a year, I kill light bulbs at a break-neck pace, I can build up uncomfortably high levels of static that don&#39;t discharge normally, etc. </p>

<p>The WiFi is the thing that I notice the most, though - I can SEE the show/webpage/etc slowing as the bars tick down from normal to nil when I&#39;m upset. </p>

<p>OOH I forgot - I wipe credit cards, too. That&#39;s another thing that gets changed out at least 3 times a year. No wear-and-tear - they just plain stop working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. That is funny, I think I tend to be anti technology  simply because it is so unreliable for me. It has cost problems with work emails that I never respond to because I don‚Äôt receive them or phone calls I don‚Äôt receive. It took years before I figured it out now I use back ups like pen and paper lol. . Watches don‚Äôt seem related to electrical issues in cars but there you have it it‚Äôs all connected. Credit cards I have not noticed but I do order new ones every few months since I tend to misplace or forget them at restaurants. Was it worse before the chip or better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, no clue - I never really thought of that. Credit cards just don&#39;t work for me for more than six months. With no apparent damage, they just stop registering and I have to punch in the numbers for a while. </p>

<p>Now that I think about it - there have been some other, low-key &quot;energy&quot; things I never really considered. I&#39;m always hot - like, giving off heat. It takes an awful lot to make me feel cold. And I can swear - as can people I&#39;ve lived with - that I can smell ozone when I&#39;m particularly upset. Like that smell that comes off a model train set.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I smoked DMT and then my soul left my body (but this was still a first person view experience) and I was hurtling down a road that goes from Wales to Oxford and was literally the other side of the fields we were sat on. However, I could hear the road from where we were, but I can&#39;t remember thinking &quot;oh that&#39;s the a40!!!&quot;, I just knew it was the a40. I then managed to end up on some desolate planet with mad fuckin mountains in the back, an ashy atmosphere, very desolate. Kinda what you think of Mars being like I guess. There was this extraterrestrial being like 10-15meters in front of me holding a freaking tree in a glass orb, and the orb was connected to a gas mask they wore. This being was tall, like at least 9ft. Behind them was a single pylon like Ariel thing that was like 15-18ft tall. It felt like I was on the front cover of megadeths &quot;peace sells but who&#39;s buying?&quot;. Weird shit. I definitely believe in something more than what we know as time and being or whatever, but I don&#39;t think we will ever access it unless we use tech for the good of man and to only spread love and positive energies idk</p>

<p>I had just gotten out of school when I was maybe like 5 (somewhere in that age, not over 7). I was lying on my mother‚Äôs bed with a shitty headache, her bed was in the father corner of the room, and across the room maybe 6 feet from the bed was the doorway. I‚Äôm watching a movie and randomly look over at the doorway and watch about a 6 foot shadow figure walk pass the doorway, and into the wall.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm talking full on shadow body, I could see the arms and hands, the head that turned towards me. I thought nothing of it and continued my movie, maybe 5 minutes later I look over again, and watch as the figure comes back, this time it stops in the doorway and turns toward me, stands there for maybe 30 seconds staring at me, and I‚Äôm staring back, turns away and walks away. I freak out and run out of the room and down the stairs to my mother. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of my encounters were years ago, it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve experienced anything as realistic as I used to. I‚Äôll talk about my one bad experience but if you want to read the good stuff just let me know.</p>

<p>I dreamt one night that a friends house had been broken into by an evil presence, I can vaguely remember how the entire dream went but I remember exactly how his woman looked. I get shivers down my spine even now as I write this. How she looked, her clothes, hair, skin etc resembled what a bad spirit may look like. Fast forward about 3 weeks, the aforementioned friend told me of this shit going down at her place  recently and I unhesitatingly decide to head over. The second I step foot in the house I can tell almost immediately it‚Äôs not good, the feel of ice cold air hit me and the fear just kicked in, I left immediately and told her she needed to seek help from someone professional. Within the next week a lot happens, she gets ‚Äòchoked‚Äô in her sleep, her daughters room gets trashed, doors slamming shut, glasses breaking etc. Everything was so bad she couldn‚Äôt stay in her own bedroom anymore and she slept on the couch. When I eventually came back again, I walk up about 5 stairs before stopping because of how cold it was and how aggressive the banging, coming from the bedroom, grew with each step I took. Anyway she gets this girl in, she cleanses the house for her and rids the house of any evil present within it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I had a Jesus moment that changed my life. I was tripping balls on a edible marijuana thinking I was going to die because I felt myself slipping into another consciousness. I had never had a ‚Äútrip‚Äù before so I didn‚Äôt know what was happening. So I started having a panic attack, super high and alone in my apartment. The voice in the back of my mind observed the situation I was in and reminded me of a YouTube video. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hnZb5wi_jsU">I realized what I was experiencing after remembering recalling this video</a> </p>

<p>I realized I was not going to die but I just like this cop I felt like I was. I regained control of my breath and laid back down on my bed. Even though I knew I was going to be ok but I was still nervous about slipping into the different consciousness that I had felt earlier. So I laid there and told myself that even if I did die I will go with God. (I have always thought  there is a God but I was never practicing a particular religion and at this moment in my life I wasn‚Äôt super keen on the idea or practicing any faith.. ) </p>

<p>When I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with God‚Äù a sensation that I would describe as helicopter blades starting to rotate was around me somehow... I repeated ‚Äúgo with God‚Äù.. and more blades whipping and it became an uncontrollable mantra in my mind ‚Äúgo with god, go with god, go with god...‚Äù  and the helicopter took off and I was on my trip. I saw patterns in my life that I needed to fix. I felt super relaxed and just in a state of bliss floating through this strange place. At one point I said to myself ‚ÄúJesus Christ‚Äù. In the context of being amazed by what I was experiencing. When I said this these giant red mountains appeared around me. They had an overwhelming sense of ancientness. The mountains began to turn to sand and the sand floated through the air and shot down into my heart. </p>

<p>The feeling was overwhelming love. The way I describe it is that it‚Äôs every good feeling anyone who has ever felt rushing into my heart all at once while knowing it is eternal. </p>

<p>At that moment I knew I could never doubt God and that Jesus Christ answered my call to him. </p>

<p>Three days later I was getting ready for work. I went and looked out the window of my apartment and the morning light seemed so beautiful to me that it made me cry. I had to sit down and I had a great sense of joy and i knew my life would never be the same. </p>

<p>.... </p>

<p>The devil also came and paid me a visit about a month later. It involved some close friends experiencing things with me. To make a long story short the devil lost control of me when i became Christian and was trying to use my best friend  to get back at me. My friends were also total non believers and it scared the shit out of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright well I&#39;ve had a few strange experiences in my day but here&#39;s an interesting one. </p>

<p>I used to work in a car manufacturing plant and I had befriended this older dude who told me he was a medium. So we&#39;d shoot the shit and talk about all sorts of stuff and he was just an all around good dude. </p>

<p>Anyway I&#39;m working beside him one day packing parts and he says &quot;did you feel it?&quot; In this excited tone. 
&quot;No what?&quot;
&quot;The spirit&quot;
I shake my head no and he says &quot;one sec&quot; and goes back to work all the while closing his eyes. After a moment he says &quot;there&quot; and points a few feet away. </p>

<p>I walk over there and the second I step into the area he was pointing at I just feel this rush goes through my entire body. It only lasted a moment but it was intense to say the least and quite reassuring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The second part of this story took place April 25th, 2015. A few months after my God experience. My best friend Fred and his girlfriend Corina were visiting me from California. I was living in Portland, Oregon. Coincidentally our other good friend Justin was visiting Portland because his grandmother was ill. That night Dustin showed up to my apartment and he really wanted to do magic mushrooms. The last time they were visiting me, like 4 months before this encounter, we did some and had a blast. I had a little leftover but really not a lot to split between three guys (Corina did not partake).  We split it up between the three and sat around my living room chatting. </p>

<p>The conversation started going towards the topic of serendipity. While we were chatting, Fred became visibly nervous and uneasy. Fred then said that we should change the subject. I remember Justin continued talking about it a little more.. when my dog jumped up and growled looking towards my wall. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it but Corina told me that she saw a shadow run across the wall. Remember she was sober and so was my dog... I lived on the third floor apartment with no street lights coming into my apartment and it just doesn‚Äôt make sense for a random shadow to run across a wall. I realize that something strange is happening and I want to get out of the apartment before shit gets too weird. Fred mentions he has to use the bathroom and I tell him he can go it‚Äôs right down the hall. He nervously goes down the hall into the bathroom. </p>

<p>At this point as far as being high on mushrooms is concerned I am not having any strong visuals and I‚Äôm not feeling high.. just a little concerned about that shadow and my friends well being. </p>

<p>Fred pops out of the bathroom in a flurry. He‚Äôs saying my name, ‚ÄúPaul Paul Paul Paul Paul. This is about you! This is all about you! I have to tell you this.‚Äù</p>

<p>Corina began crying when she saw Fred. She later said that his eyes were not his own. </p>

<p>I could see his energy was different. At one point I touched him to try to calm him down and he just felt powerful.. </p>

<p>I said what is it? What is all about me? </p>

<p>Fred said that the man in the hat told him that he was laughing at me because I am tormenting myself by having three masks and three crosses up in my apartment. This hit me like a ton of bricks.  </p>

<p>(When I was 13 years old I had a terrifying experience with a man in the hat laughing at me with the creepiest demonic laughter you can imagine. I couldn‚Äôt sleep in a room alone for years and it is the most terrifying thing that ever happened to me)</p>

<p>Hearing that sucked so bad. I couldn‚Äôt write it off as sleep paralysis anymore. </p>

<p>My friend Justin and I looked at each other in disbelief. Fred pulled me over to the wall where a shadow was being created. At that time he was wearing a fedora hat and was creating a shadow of a hat man on the wall. He pointed at it and said, ‚ÄúPaul, this is the truth. This is the Truth Paul.‚Äù  This was really disturbing because I knew at that moment Fred was not Fred. He was trying to show me that the shadow of a hat man was the truth. </p>

<p>Fred later recounted his story to me about what happened in the bathroom. He was standing peeing, wearing the fedora when he noticed his own shadow. He received a strong sense of power. He heard a voice tell him he could be powerful and even more powerful than the voice he was hearing. The voice started making ideas about taking advantage of friends and using others for benefit. It said it was protecting me from evil spirits and that I needed to stop using drugs because it was getting tired and couldn‚Äôt protect me if I kept doing them. The feeling was so powerful that Fred gave into it. He liked it. That‚Äôs when the other voice came in. This voice said that the other voice was a liar. The mood switched and the devil became angry and started bringing up all of Fred‚Äôs personal fears and shortcomings... the voice of truth came back and corrected all of it again. Then that voice even told Fred that what he was experiencing had nothing to do with him. It was about me... I had some energy that made me attractive to it and to tell me what was happening. That‚Äôs when Fred stormed out of the bathroom to warn me. </p>

<p>My apartment did in-fact have three tiki/Fijian type masks and three crosses up on the walls. I put these up in my apartment without thinking of their significance. I thought it was mostly decoration. I took the masks off the walls after Fred shared this info and we decided to leave the apartment. </p>

<p>We went outside and Corina talked with Fred for about 20 minutes to get him back to a more calm state. We started walking. As we were walking around SE Portland Fred took his hat and threw it on the ground. He later explained that while seeing the shadow from the street light he saw himself as the man in the hat and Corinas shadow looked like the virgin marry. The voice said, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to corrupt something so pure. Off goes the hat. </p>

<p>I decided that we were going to go get ice cream. I felt at this time it was a good idea to remind ourselves that even though this was happening we could still enjoy an ice cream. </p>

<p>Somehow we were being really positive at this time. I think the mushrooms helped with that. Justin pointed out a flower to me. It was shaped like a cross. I went back a couple of days later and took a photo of it. I‚Äôll share the photo. We walked and talked and ate ice cream for about an hour. As we walked around the corner of and my apartment building came into view, a man in a brimmed hat and trench coat was walking along side of my apartment building. Fred and i looked at each other and didn‚Äôt say a word but just nodded with big eyes. </p>

<p>Fred and Corina got an UBER to their hotel. Justin and i went up to my apartment and I decided to take the masks to the garbage. I didn‚Äôt even want them in my building or on a street I frequented. We walked a few blocks and I tossed them in a garbage can in front of someone‚Äôs house. We were chatting about something as we did this. I took about ten steps when I got the chills. The chills were really intense and were all over my body and they lasted for about a full minute. At this point I looked at my buddy Justin and I said, dude this is too much, and I started to cry. He gave me a hug. </p>

<p>We went to my place and Fred called and told us what happened in the bathroom. It was an intense night. I‚Äôll never forget it. </p>

<p>Side notes:
Earlier that day Fred, Corina and I went into one store. A hat store on SE Hawthorne. In the store I was really attracted to a long leather jacket. I asked the clerk if it was a duster. She said yes and pulled a hat from behind the duster and said.. it comes with a hat too. </p>

<p>A little later we were waking around and I was mentioning how often people will tell me ‚Äúnice dog‚Äù from their car as they‚Äôre driving. About 10 seconds after I said this, a guy yelled out his window to my friend, ‚Äúnice hat‚Äù. I told them, look! See how this stuff always happens to me! </p>

<p>I had my coming to Jesus moment and it happened through a marijuana edible. This evil thing was still trying to keep some control of me and desperately tried to use my best friend to do so. In this desperation it exposed itself and I learned the truth and it wasn‚Äôt a shadow in the wall. </p>

<p>Since that night I have had dreams where I see this hatman but I have no fear. It‚Äôs like I see it when it comes lurking around. Observing it without fear keeps it at bay. Still creepy... </p>

<p>I reluctantly watched the film, The Nightmare. It dives into a few stories involving shadow entities if you want to get more information on the subject. </p>

<p>My story is not over but I made big changes in my life that coincide with these events and I must say I am eternally grateful that they happened. God bless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had many, many strange experiences, and have spent a lot of time talking to others about theirs.</p>

<p>The house I grew up in was strange.  Once me, my mom and my sister all heard one of us call their name (I hear my sister, my mom heard me, my sister heard my mom), we all came together &quot;What did you want?&quot;  No one called anyone.</p>

<p>One night during a really bad storm there were footsteps pacing back and forth and back and forth all night long in our attic...except this attic wasn&#39;t tall enough to walk in, nor was there a floor to walk on.</p>

<p>There was this really strange girl that started at our high school (the deformed girl in that vampire series that was on Netflix reminds me of her)...everyone said she was a devil worshiper, but I don&#39;t think she was.  Anyway I had a dream she was levitating outside my window looking in...I woke up with cuts in between my toes...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived and worked in other haunted places, or I have a great imagination or am just really sensitive to other worlds.</p>

<p>As I got older and started to do bodywork and energy work I could see stuff on client&#39;s bodies, I have a voice that talks to me at times, but its really hard to hear, its like a tinny sounding radio that&#39;s hard to tune into, and if I start to concentrate on it, I can&#39;t hear it anymore.</p>

<p>Creepy things happen in the house I live in now...I&#39;ve been working on keeping it quiet, so I don&#39;t like to talk about the things that have happened, but recently I visited a supposedly haunted cemetery.  When I got home that afternoon, my mellow dog kept on barking at the door (I have a cross near the front door, so maybe it was keeping whatever it was from crossing into my home)...I did a cleansing prayer and when I went to sleep I was having intense dreams...that the house was clear, but someone was at the front door banging to get in...</p>

<p>Weird shit happens...</p>

<p>I was at a bar once and ordered a foo foo drink in a stemmed glass, when the bartender went to set it down, the bottom of the glass (solid glass) bent and the glass started to bend as the bartender set it down...we all saw it.  The bartender brushed it off and changed the subject.  </p>
