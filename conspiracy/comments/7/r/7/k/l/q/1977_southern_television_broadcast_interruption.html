       On November 26, 1977, the Southern Television broadcast was hijacked for 6 minutes. I bring this up because the contents of the message are very thought provoking and disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have never seen or heard of this before I suggest doing some research by yourself first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the full transcript:
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. For many years you have seen us as lights in the skies. We speak to you now in peace and wisdom as we have done to your brothers and sisters all over this, your planet Earth. We come to warn you of the destiny of your race and your world so that you may communicate to your fellow beings the course you must take to avoid the disaster which threatens your world, and the beings on our worlds around you. This is in order that you may share in the great awakening, as the planet passes into the New Age of Aquarius. The New Age can be a time of great peace and evolution for your race, but only if your rulers are made aware of the evil forces that can overshadow their judgments. Be still now and listen, for your chance may not come again. All your weapons of evil must be removed. The time for conflict is now past and the race of which you are a part may proceed to the higher stages of its evolution if you show yourselves worthy to do this. You have but a short time to learn to live together in peace and goodwill. Small groups all over the planet are learning this, and exist to pass on the light of the dawning New Age to you all. You are free to accept or reject their teachings, but only those who learn to live in peace will pass to the higher realms of spiritual evolution. Hear now the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. Be aware also that there are many false prophets and guides operating in your world. They will suck your energy from you – the energy you call money and will put it to evil ends and give you worthless dross in return. Your inner divine self will protect you from this. You must learn to be sensitive to the voice within that can tell you what is truth, and what is confusion, chaos and untruth. Learn to listen to the voice of truth which is within you and you will lead yourselves onto the path of evolution. This is our message to our dear friends. We have watched you growing for many years as you too have watched our lights in your skies. You know now that we are here, and that there are more beings on and around your Earth than your scientists admit. We are deeply concerned about you and your path towards the light and will do all we can to help you. Have no fear, seek only to know yourselves, and live in harmony with the ways of your planet Earth. We of the Ashtar Galactic Command thank you for your attention. We are now leaving the plane of your existence. May you be blessed by the supreme love and truth of the cosmos."
      </p>
      <p>
       When I read this message I do not know how to feel or what to think cause its such a mindfuck if its true.  And even if its not true then what motives are there for creating such a detailed and benevolent hoax besides promoting love and harmony between our world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New Age of Aquarius comes in 2049 so if were all still alive i guess we will find out then.

       then again its not inconceivable, actually the most probable that a human did this to make it seem like it was from aliens. i also find it curious that if it were aliens, somewhere in bum fudge no where broadcasting station is all the aliens took over to broadcast such an important message

       yeah thats a very good point and i had the same thoughts when i first saw this but i found out that when they tried to trace where it came from it was impossible and i just found it strange how when mainstream media outlets began publishing the story they left out a majority of the transcript and only left the parts that made it seem inconceivable

       I can't speak towards its Truth or not. Either way, it's a good message, even if it was a hoax. To live in peace and harmony with one another. That said, if it was a hoax it fits in pretty well with the New Age movement which grew out of the 60's and 70's and which still exists today. If a person wanted to spread a message of love and hope by hijacking a TV station, claiming you were aliens isn't the worst idea out there.

       The Age of Aquarius isn't a new idea invented by a popular song in the 60s.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_age">
        Astrological ages
       </a>
       have a history going back at least several thousand years.  The concept is based upon the Earth's precession cycles which causes different Zodiac symbols to dominate the night sky at different periods of Earth's history. The fact that these concepts are thousands of years old is amazing since the Earth's precession cycle takes over 25,000 years. It had to take some ingenuity to devise a method to measure and calculate this cycle with a fair amount of precision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently we're in the Age of Pisces(The Fish) which some astrologers feel links strongly the the symbolism associated with Jesus. The previous astrological age was the age of Taurus (The Bull) which again, those same people feel to be related to the types of animal sacrifice dominating religions in the Middle East before the rise of Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the vein of a proper r/conspiracy post, some astrologers believe that the Age of Aquarius will be associated with turmoil regarding global drinking water supplies as we continue to pollute our environments and fresh water aquifers become depleted. Personally, I believe these theroes are imposed ad hoc upon the existing astrology paradigms. But it's neat to think about.

       This is an old hoax, keep in mind that this happened a short time after  the original Star Wars came out (which was all the rage back then, actually sci-fi in general was, thanks to Star Wars). The names used are super generic sci-fi names (Vrillon, Ashtar, c'mon). If this was truly from some interdimensional being, they could easily hijack ALL of the broadcasts around the world simultaneously. But I do agree with the general message the person made, of we need to stop being dicks to each other.

       Now I get whether or not one believe this. It might seem like science fiction sure. But the thoughts ideas and concepts are more than “sci if”. A little dismissive.

       Great points. I tend to take Graham Hancock's approach to all this that the UFO phenomena and ET contact is inter dimensional in nature. I think its likely positive and negative entities are interested in our evolution as a species and the government was heavily involved in the dissemination of these so called "sci-fi" ideas back then. CIA and Hollywood were certainly complicit actors in spreading the Alien threat narrative.

       This sort of thing is not difficult to do for an IT-savvy hoaxer ('not difficult' being a relative term, here).
      </p>
      <p>
       You put your transmitter in a van, drive up close to one of the TV relay masts serving your area, then beam your signal straight into the mast's receivers at a goodly number of Watts so that it (a) drowns out the official signal and (b) gets rebroadcast over the mast's coverage area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The telling thing about the 'Ashtar' broadcast is that it only happened in one of Britain's local ITV regions. This was Southern TV ltd, which served Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. This strikes me as an unlikely choice of audience for a message of such cosmic significance, but a very likely venue for a signal hijacker's van to be able to park up beside a relay station for ten minutes without being noticed (because these areas of Britain aren't densely-populated and all the relay masts are in rural areas).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was quite a technical feat, given the video technology of the 1970s, which might lead one to speculate that this was no amateur, which in turn might suggest it was some kind of experiment with an intelligence service-related purpose.

       Same thing happened in 1987 in Chicago. Different message but the same kind of overpower take over.
