        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I am 17 and honestly believe there is no hope for my generation. I have been lightly researching and reading conspiracy (hate the term) theories since I was 14/15 (Pro tip: don&#39;t do this, it wears you down) and I have now come to terms with the reality that this world is fucked. </p>

<p>If you think generations X and Y are majorly brainwashed or, if I could say, not aware of what is actually happening in our world, then generation Z and onwards will be the worst of the lot. They have lured my generation in from an extremely early age with the technology, in which kids now as young as 2 or 3 years old are glued to the screen of an iPad or something along those lines. Technology, in my opinion, has allowed for control of the masses, something which will only get stronger as with the introduction of AI into our daily lives.</p>

<p>Yes, there are other young people like me, who are conscious of what&#39;s going on and are actively trying to make a change, but we are the minority in a brainwashed majority. I only fear what the future holds but I guess I just have to make peace with whatever happens and continue to <em>try</em> and live life normally and with happiness.</p>

<p>Me personally, I have come to terms with all of this. I am religious and trying to grow in spirituality and will just try to enjoy the most simplest of things in my life however long it will be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LSD is a crap shoot with effects. Even with correct setting, the fact that dose is unpredictable makes the entire experience unpredictable.

<p>Everyone is different, some people are more lucid and in control on mushrooms, some people break through on 3.5g. It&#39;s the same with LSD, some people can go to the movies on 400ug.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t know what is &quot;better&quot; for you until you try a multitude of psychedelics. Don&#39;t discount LSD simply because someone can handle shrooms better. (yes i prefer LSD, there&#39;s that ego for you) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s your own personal experience. </p>

<p>I find the opposite to be true with tryptamines. LSD is much more inviting to me. Mushrooms, and other tryptamines such as DMT, have given me extremely objective and reality-crushing experiences. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t trade those difficult experiences for the world, but trpytamines are the least predictable and controllable psychedelics to me. I have to surrender fully to what may very well be a harsh and alien experience. I can at least function in public on a strongly visual dose of LSD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>shit, i sincerely hope you were eating some RC stims instead of MDMA or other empathogens almost daily for an entire school year.</p>

<p>that&#39;s the type of MDMA use that could literally ruin you as a person. even rolling two days in a row this past weekend has severely impacted my daily outlook. it&#39;ll pass, of course, but MDMA is one of the worst drugs you could use daily. i&#39;d rather take meth for a school year tbh</p>

<p>that being said, LSD and MDMA taken together produce my favorite drug experience. i&#39;m not bashing ecstasy, it&#39;s half of one of my favorite drugs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shrooms and LSD make your brain communicate with parts of itself that it normally doesn&#39;t. It is not something one should take lightly. Start slow, and with good company. </p>

<p>Timothy Leary was right when he said Set and Setting are essential. If you choose to trip, do so with friends and in a good setting. Preferably one where you have the option of being both indoors and outdoors. You want to make sure that you have dealt with any personal issues that are at the forefront of your mind before the trip. If you have buried anything, or refused to confront personal issues or trauma, the LSD/shrooms <em>will</em> make you confront it. This is both a benefit and a potential danger. </p>

<p>Make sure you are as comfortable with yourself and your mind as you can be before you go into it. You also want to go in with positive thoughts and good vibes- this is why having good, trusted friends to trip with and a safe, peaceful location is essential. Don&#39;t overdo it either, one tab is more than enough for your first time. And you&#39;ll probably want to do less than 1/8th g of Shrooms if it is your first time tripping as well. </p>

<p>All that said, it can be an incredibly fun experience. Try and spend a few minutes of your trip alone as well, this will help you focus on your mind and what is really &quot;going on&quot; up there. You&#39;ll have some interesting conversations with yourself, I promise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks heaps for this. Ironically, it sounds like doing shrooms after a confession at church would be perfect as you would have already confronted personal issues. Although the church would look down on it, it is merely an organisation which cannot 100% accurately represent God on earth and the church also is very influenced by government, sadly. I&#39;ll look to do shrooms in the future. Thanks again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must be the change you seek to believe. We are all the change we&#39;ve been waiting for. No one is going to do it for us. The world may be bleak but the Truth is that we still have the power to change it all. Pessimistic nihilism is what TPTB want you to buy into, it makes you easier to control. Spread the word. Love your neighbor, care for your fellow man. </p>

<p>Put emphasis on the human connections in your life- those are what are most important. Learn how you are situated within your community and your world and work outwards from there. No snowflake thinks they are responsible for the avalanche...the same applies for the good things in life too. Change starts on the personal and interpersonal level. Together we can do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I base it on &#39;85-&#39;05 because it makes sense. Boomers were &#39;45-65, X&#39;rs were 65-85, and Millennials were 85-05. A generation is 20 years. There is overlap for those born at the tail ends but if we are going by technical definitions then 85-05 is a proper time period. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t a defined date but that one is kinda goody is you ask me. A generation is said to be 20 years. Boomers began in &#39;45. This means X&#39;ers begin in &#39;65. And Millennials in &#39;85. No need to play around with the numbers just so they can cut it off at 2000 imo. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but think your perspective would be different if you lived the pre-internet era.  Sure, you guys have your tech-facilitated ideological bubbles, but we had our TV-facilitated mass bubble without google or wikipedia to help us when we&#39;re being gas-lighted.</p>

That way of living has been phased out unfortunately but I can only dream about what living in earlier times would&#39;ve been like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you have to realize is, that in every generation there is the minority of people who seek truth, knowledge, information, and insight. We are and have always been in the minority, <a href="http://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/TheCave02.jpg">hence Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave.</a></p>

<p>Best advice I can give (from a 30+ year old)... keep researching, keep searching for truth, go down as many rabbit holes as you can, find a passion for history,  try an find like minded people, continue growing spiritually, and always know... this is just a ride. Everything happens for a reason, and there are no coincidences, hence why you posted this here tonight :).</p>

<p>We are in the Great Awakening/Unveiling, and you are already 10+ steps in front of many people your age, my age, and older. Wear that proudly, and continue on your path. You seem to have a good head on your shoulder.</p>

<p>Some people I suggest looking into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jordan Maxwell</li>
<li>Bill Cooper</li>
<li>Mark Passio</li>
<li>Graham Hancock</li>
<li>Alan Watts ( a bit different than the others, but, if you check him out, you&#39;ll understand why I mentioned him)</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck, and welcome to the club!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much. Your own research and sharing of knowledge on this sub which I have been reading for the past year is basically what inspired me to take my own path down the rabbit hole. I totally believe that we are in the great awakening and hopefully in my lifetime there will be a major indication of it, globally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re very much welcome, and thanks truly for the kind words :) ! Remember to always be the change you wish to see in the world, and that you cannot help others, if you haven&#39;t figured out/helped yourself.  </p>

<p>Once you take steps to become the change you wish to see, others will gravitate towards you, and the ball will start rolling whether in the subconsciousness or conscious minds of others. Put out &quot;light&quot; energy, and you will receive light energy, and doors will open, especially when you least expect them to. </p>

<p>I am of the belief, that if I can truly affect one person for the better, than that truly means more than somewhat &quot;positively&quot; affecting 1,000 people. We are all connected into the Universal Conscious mind, but... we are all also individuals, with both an Astral and physical purpose. </p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to tell people to just be aware of what&#39;s going on around you and love life with open eyes. It&#39;s not just technology. People are being put on auto pilot and taken care of in a merchandised bubble almost like a cradle. Everything you need and use is not only extremely easy to access but it&#39;s thrown at you. We are cattle. Live life with eyes open. Don&#39;t allow yourself to live on auto pilot. It&#39;s most noticeable while driving how easily you are put into a hypnotic trance of auto pilot. It&#39;s everywhere though. Stay awake. Waiting in line at the grocery store?  STAY AWAKE. Don&#39;t be in such a hurry without any consideration for what&#39;s around you. It&#39;s easy to take for granted the world outside your bubble and more people would do well to remember that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don think our generation is doomed.</p>

<p>Remember these things have been going on forever in cycles. Look at Ancient Rome...the things they did...this actually is not the worst time in history, and people have been running things behind the scenes from the beginning, we just now have access to spreading info lol never before.</p>

<p>Remember though, you say your religious? Then you are lucky because you DO have hope if you actually believe the things you believe and practice them.</p>

<p>God said NEVER fear...it&#39;s fear which ways you down, and controls you and takes joy from life. It&#39;s key to how bac people control others.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lie that bad will win, it&#39;s temporary...and God said it would be like this for a time. So faith is part of that.</p>

<p>I mean he literally laid out a plan for what happens. It&#39;s called the Bible and revaluations.</p>

<p>Lastly, He also said that battle it NOT in flesh and blood..and he said that for a reason. Because victory and peace are not in those things but flesh and blood are beat how? Spiritually. That is what THEY fear most, and where the power is.</p>

<p>So if anything let th eknowledge of what you learn NOT discourage you but motivatie you to help others and go to God instead of feeling like you can change anything, you alone, can&#39;t no matter what is revealed. But at the same time time He said expose the works of darkness, just don&#39;t let that consume you.,,instead let it push you closer to where the power is.</p>

Here I am now at 42, very, very glad to say that I take the alternate view on pretty much everything. Don&#39;t worry so much what other people think kid. Your journey is your own, though you&#39;ll add others along the way as you go. It&#39;s easy to get overwhelmed and start thinking that the world will end because of the terrible things that you now see.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m only a few years older than you, gonna be 21 this October, and I feel you. Just remember that what we see on the day-to-day is only a fraction of the real picture - i.e our generation is not as bad as you think. 
What makes our generation pretty darn insane imo is that it has people like us! - people who are open-minded and will continue to question the narrative, seek higher truths, and encourage others to do the same.
As I say to my friends IRL, we&#39;ve got to work through the system to break it. (Progress in life to a point where you can now make big, impactful changes)
Our time is approaching friend, just keep working hard :)</p>

<p>I am optimistic about our generation. We are the most accepting of other people&#39;s race, religion and opinions. In the western world at least if I am correct millenials are the least religious.</p>

<p>I think that the next generation will handle technology better than us. While they will have their problems like every other generation I am optimistic.</p>
