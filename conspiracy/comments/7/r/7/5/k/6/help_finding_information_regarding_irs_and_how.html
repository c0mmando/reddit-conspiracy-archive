    <div class="md"><p>I stop assuming the role of tax payer in 2005. It&#39;s not dumb to stand up for what is right. What&#39;s dumb is paying a racket protection money. You are enabling the very thing that&#39;s keeping you enslaved. Do what is right and accept the consequences of that. Other wise you are just harming yourself and others by being an order follower. You are the worst kind since by your inaction you actually create the enslavement for yourself and the rest of man kind.

    <div class="md"><p>We need to look at taxes on principal. We stop assuming the role of tax payer because the government has no power to collect taxes from anyone that does want to assume that role. This is why it&#39;s specified in the law that taxes are voluntary. Of corse this doesn&#39;t mean that the criminal system of government won&#39;t come after you, but at least you need to know and understand how to defend yourself from the IRS.  <a href="https://github.com/scottrlarson/greatwork/blob/master/articles/article-irs-taxation.md">How I protect myself from the IRS</a>. We live in a self-governing country. The government was created by the people of the people for the people. We never put into place the personal income tax system, there for its entirely illegal. Now the court system is completely corrupt and if you don&#39;t know what you are getting into you can get railroaded, but you have to learn how to protect yourself if you want to remain a responsible individual.</p>

<p>I saw the video the op is talking about she did go to political prison for challenging the status quo. It does not mean she was wrong though. The problem with most people that challenge the legal system is that they don&#39;t know how to protect there rights, and they don&#39;t know what role they go in as when you appear in court.</p>

<p>Lucky her. When was that, a few days after the original Woodstock?  &quot;Laws,&quot; and more  importantly how they are actually interpreted, have been morphing awfully fast since 9/11.  While you make good points, you don&#39;t seem to realize that by today&#39;s standards, going to political prison for not paying taxes is like a vacation compared to what the people who really hit nerve are gonna go through when the system catch&#39;s up with them. Not paying taxes is noble enough and the penalties may very well only amount to not much more than a rite of passage for the neo-hippie crowd, heck, maybe you even suffer a threat or two and serve a little &quot;hard&quot; time, but please understand, if you go too far down that road, there&#39;s a black-site, hell-hole waiting to give you a re-education as to what this whole New World Order program is really all about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct,  it MAY collect taxes from anyone who consents to the role of a tax payer. But it has no authority to require it from anyone that doesn&#39;t consent to that role. Hence the voluntary nature of it. You are expected to comply as a individual tax payer. That is a role that you can voluntarily assume if you choose to. Government was setup by the people, we can create it, and we can demolish it at any time we choose. Now people in the tax system can try to compel you to assume a role you don&#39;t want to assume with threats against your freedom but that is not covered under Common Law. In Common Law Man makes the rules. So long as you do not cause harm you can live you life how ever you wish, that includes not assuming roles that the government expects you to assume.</p>

<p>The main point you don&#39;t include in you argument is the roles we play. As a man you can assume or not assume any role you wish, that is our natural as fluid and dynamic Mankind. This is the stuff a Civil government won&#39;t tell you because it wants to remain in control of interpretations of law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. Its precedent set down by what the people (Not Government) determine what is right and what is wrong common to the customs of a society in which that law exists.  Forcing people that do not consent to theft of property to abide by tax law is not common the customs of a society. Its common to a government who wants to obtain money from a people outside the rule of law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is incorrect. There might be a form of common law that is used in judicial decisions but that still sounds part of Civil law.</p>

<p>The common law I talk of is and is used in the real world is derived from Natural Law.  Civil law was created to take what&#39;s real and put it into representation of what is real. </p>

<p>What you learn in law school may be the dominate understanding of law, but that doesn&#39;t make it right or correct. There are other positions outside of that school of thought that one can stand. If you want to stay in a realm that deprives you of your rights you have that choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do understand that dictionary terms are changed drastically from edition to edition right? By the very same people that wish to rule over you. Go back to the history of Common law and you will find that you are being deceived by people who wish to codify common law. The people who wish to rule over you will twist law to their ends in what ever fashion the chose. This is why it&#39;s important not to trust Civil systems with rights and freedoms. They will always interpret our creations in such a way as to give the state more power, as you are doing. So you are either a shill for the state or you are allowing yourself to be misinformed by the state as to allow the state to take away your individual power and value so you can have a position in that system. I quoted a treatise on common law for you just in case you are none of the above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Common law jurisprudence is not unique to the English tradition, but existed in virtually every society that had not yet developed codified laws or legislative bodies. In ancient Athens, for example, case law was determined by common custom, and laws could be changed only by a judicial commission, as there was no legislature as we know it. Unwritten legal customs could not be changed by the popular assembly, as that would have been considered a usurpation. Indeed, Aristotle observed in the Politic that unwritten law was considered more sovereign than written law:</p>

<p>But laws resting on unwritten custom are even more sovereign, and concerned with issues of still more sovereign importance, than written laws; and this suggests that, even if the rule of a man be safer than the rule of written law, it need not therefore be safer than the rule of unwritten law. (Bk III, xvi, 9.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t read that treatise, have you? It describes the difference between legal systems in the English tradition and those in the Continental system. Are you in France or Spain? Because I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re in the US, based on your comments. A treatise on the history of the Continental legal system is not relevant to the laws of the United States, which is a common law system in the English tradition. Under that system, as explained in the dictionary definition that has so troubled you, the common law is the law courts make through precedential decisions. Not the law of &quot;stuff I make up and some other stuff I read on a bullshit artist&#39;s blog.&quot;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to take my word for it. Get an education! The classes are <em>free.</em> So are real law books, in your local library.</p>

<p>Know how to tell the difference between real knowledge and bullshit? Real knowledge is written down in books. You have to do a <em>little</em> work to get it. Bullshit is easy, and takes no work at all--the internet will hand-feed it to you.</p>

<p>When you refuse to read or study, and just recite internet baloney like a magic spell to ward off criticism, which are you choosing? Real knowledge, or bullshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it sounds like you didn&#39;t read it yourself. European Common law was based in Rome before the Rise of the emperors. The emperors wanted a way to make decisions without interference from the systems that were in place in the common and started using Civil law to handle disputes to gain power over individuals so they so they could make determinations on law in all cases, which is what we have now in the United States. Roman civil and common law was directly imported to into Briton. We have a version of English common law and Roman Civil law. Both of those system of law are based in Rome. They are the are the same systems of law and government that pretty much the whole world operates under. </p>

<p>You can make bullshit claims until your blue in the face, I&#39;m going to keep rebutting them. I have plenty of time on my hands so keep them coming. It&#39;s only going to show how much of a scam all systems of government and law we operate under are.</p>

<p>Sorry to break it to you, but the system of law and government you have been schooled under is a sham.</p>

You&#39;re reciting history lessons, inaccurately, because the stuff you read online contradicts the dictionary and real-life legal practice.

<p>Why not? Is it because I suggested it, so you feel like it would be conceding something? Is it because you just don&#39;t care enough to spend the time? </p>

<p>Honestly, I think it&#39;s because you already know that the stuff you&#39;re spouting won&#39;t show up in books or classes, because it&#39;s malarkey. If you stay ignorant, you can ignore that--but once you <em>test</em> your beliefs, you&#39;ll have to deal with it. Yes? No?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maxims are like proverbs. They&#39;re easy to read and understand, but they aren&#39;t the law. And when they conflict with the law, whether a statute or the common law, they&#39;re ignored--they&#39;re just proverbs expressing general trends. In other words, that&#39;s not a book of law, it&#39;s a book of proverbs about law. </p>

<p>Understanding the principles behind law is indeed a good idea. In fact, that&#39;s the vast majority of what law students do--relatively little time is spent studying what the law <em>is,</em> compared to how it got to be that way. </p>

<p>But you aren&#39;t doing that. You don&#39;t actually know the principles; you freaked out when you read a definition of &quot;common law,&quot; because it wasn&#39;t what you thought it was. If you can&#39;t handle basic legal vocabulary, reading a list of proverbs won&#39;t help you.</p>

<p>How about a book about actual American law? Not sayings about the law, a book that actually discusses real, current law. &quot;Law 101: Everything You Need to Know About American Law&quot; has a good reputation; I haven&#39;t read it myself, but I&#39;ll read it at the same time you do if you like and we can compare notes.</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. That has nothing to do with &quot;common law.&quot; The common law is the body of law built through the precedential decisions of tribunals. It&#39;s not &quot;taking control of the court and forcing the wrongdoer to come out from behind his role,&quot; which is gibberish.</p>

<p>Oh? What judges have you talked to? What books by judges have you read? Or did you just make this up?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also cases are really never won when you bring in common law,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. Every single day, people win cases in court brought under the common law. For example, in New York breach of contract claims are heard under common law. Every single time someone sues for breach of contract under New York law, the parties argue under the common law and the court decides the case according to the common law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>from my experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I think you&#39;re lying here. I don&#39;t think you have any experience.</p>

<p>For example, earlier you said that your gibberish &quot;works in court.&quot; But when I asked for details--what courts? what claims?--suddenly it&#39;s, &quot;I don&#39;t go into court to win or lose.&quot; </p>

<p>That&#39;s the language of someone who&#39;s never actually won a case, but doesn&#39;t want to let that inconvenient fact keep them from spouting gibberish about law.</p>

<p>That is literally a nonsensical statement. Based on your other comment, you don&#39;t know what &quot;Civil Law&quot; is, and read the term in a treatise about the development of Continental legal systems. No, I&#39;m in the United States, where common law is used every single day to win cases in real life courts. I&#39;ve done it.</p>

<p>Saying that the point of &quot;remaining in common law is to not have to go to court&quot; is like saying that the point of having a killer three-point shot is to win the game without ever touching a basketball--it&#39;s gibberish. Court is where you use common law. Judges apply it to resolve legal disputes.</p>

He won what&#39;s called the <em>Cheek</em> defense (after the Supreme Court case that established it), essentially by convincing the jury that he didn&#39;t know he had to pay his taxes. Winning on <em>Cheek</em> is hard and rare, and only covers the criminal liability. It means you don&#39;t go to jail, but the IRS still levies the back taxes, interest, and I think civil penalties against you. And <em>Cheek</em> only works once, so you have to pay all that, which is ruinous for most people.</p>

<p>Why not take a class or read a book? How reliable is the junk you&#39;ve absorbed from the internet, if paper books and law schools are so threatening to your worldview?</p>
