       Do you think the U.S. government is  putting fluoride in everyone's water?
      </p>
      <p>
       The decision to add flouride is made by the private or public water company providing water to a community or State, not by the U.S. Government.

       No I specifically stated that the U.S. Government is not mandating fluoride in the water.  I stated that decision is made by either the private company  or the public owned organization who is supplying the water to a community.

       The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Prozac is fluoxetine hydrochloride, a chemical compound containing fluoride.

       Yeah, a chemical compound containing fluoride. There is a massive difference between an element and a chemical with an element in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The classic example is sodium chloride. Sodium is a volatile metal that reacts explosively with water. Chlorine is a toxic gas that will kill you in a breath. Put them together and you get table salt.

       TLDR: A bunch of the studies they analyzed were looking at iodine and fluoride together, and the fluoride levels in question were
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       above what is legal in the US.

       One could still argue the legal limit of fluoride in the US is still too much and causes more harm than good. And it is a neurotoxin. Why you claimed it wasn't.

       It's a neurotoxin in extremely high doses. That's not really the same. Water will also kill you in very high doses along with pretty much everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fluoride level in water is also significantly below the legal limit unless you live in an area with natural runoff.

       dose makes the poison. i think the valid argument is that it’s nearly fucking useless and only came to be present because of industrial waste and was made into a new profit stream by industrial companies, but it’s not toxic at low doses.

       Totally depends on the concentration levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       People take salt tablets as replacements for electrolytes after hard, sweat drenching workouts or activities all the time and they're fine.  These are large doses of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       But 5 cups of table salt in a glass of water and yeah, you're not going to be able to ingest it all because it's not all going to be in solution but what is in solution will likely make you sick.
      </p>

       That's true but when they study steady changes in IQ over time they use the same or equivalent tests (that is, if people tend to get the same score on test A as they do on test B, they're functionally equivalent substitutes).

       Arguably the gap has been closing as the job market has shifted away from manufacturing and menial labor toward more problem-solving stuff...but I agree. IQ tests measure your ability to take IQ tests, that's about it. There's also a big cultural factor too. Certain cultures or subcultures value different kinds of intelligence differently and that affects how they raise and educate their children.

       No, it's just better education that's more focused on logical problem solving.

       Try watching TV from the 50's. Pure propaganda and people swallowed it hook line and sinker. Compared to the 50's the MSM today is seditious.

       Secondly, we still have a draft today, it's just a
       <em>
        poverty draft

       . The military sucks up poor young men and women who have no other life prospects. It offers employment, healthcare, and a dignified status.

       Well, perhaps it's good for teeth but still bad for your brain. Just because it's bad for your brain doesn't mean it doesn't help your teeth---not that I'm saying it's a good thing. I'd rather use something safer or not at all. I wouldn't compromise. Trying to keep all the information in mind. I've never researched whether fluoride is good for teeth though but it's what is said. Same with it being bad for you, haven't researched that either, but it's possible they could have done it for teeth but realized later it hurts in other ways. What's fucked up about that is knowing it's bad and not stopping.

       Actually, getting too much fluoride is a way bigger problem in the US than not getting enough. Look up dental fluorosis. Many inner cities and black folks are getting 10x the safe levels.

       I'm not arguing with that, just saying I've actually come across research that shows places and people who have foregone the fluoridated water have shown much worse teeth problems which, at least to me, proves that fluoridated water

       I don't doubt that both can be true. And like many conspiracy theories, there's a lot of gray area in between the extremes. Like vaccines: they can be both safe and dangerous depending on the quantity and they can even be misused for nefarious purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of like schrodinger's cat–– everything is simultaneously dangerous and safe until you open a particular box containing the specific criteria of a given scenario.

       It is in fact "government cares about our teeth". It's very cheap to do and saves money on tooth care. Tooth problems are one of the bigger health issues that first world countries still have to deal will, partially because of our increased access to foods that are bad for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's probably becoming less and less useful as tooth paste gets better and more widely used, however.

       Yeah, but those are heavily regulated and taxed beyond belief and thus make money off them. I'm pretty sure water fluoridation actually saves the government money in the long term too.

       The fluorosis that fluoridated water contributes to is normally minor or cosmetic only. It is not the only contributing factor to it, and the serious cases are normally caused by the toothpaste or high levels of fluoride in water caused by natural fluoridation. I'm pretty a hefty chunk of fluorosis cases are caused by kids swallowing toothpaste too.

       I just mentioned it because some people who break out with perioral dermatitis (small bumps on chin, around mouth) don't make the connection that toothpaste might be causing it. When my dermatologist told me it was probably from toothpaste, I thought he was crazy.

       It's a waste product that people have managed to figure out how to sell to us as something that is beneficial instead of a long term way to abuse people and their bodies.

       This has real world ramifications for everyone who buys into the idea that they can put a waste product into the water and which somehow turns into tears from heaven.

       It allows a couple of benefits, it keeps the people where they are.

        Then, they also found a way to take a waste product they are mandated to capture instead of allowing it into the air because it can cause real damage to people who breath it in.  See Denora Pa.  It also relates to the search to produce the atom bomb, but that might be another chat.

       No not aliens, just corrupted individuals that can be bought. First question any of them ask when presented with something new..."What can this do to help ME". Do not be so naive, its childish to think any of these people have any ones best interest in their thoughts except their own. They are NOT like everyone else. Most people are decent hard working and honest. They are the exact opposite.

       Many of them do come from wealthier backgrounds because that makes it easier to get a good education. Many of them come from a family heavily involved with politics for the same reason that anyone else tends to go into similar career paths as their parents.

       Of course you can. It might be harder than if you started out wealthy, but plenty of people do it. I just gave an example elsewhere here. Doug Jones. Dad worked at a steel plant, mom stayed at home. Grew up in a town of a few thousand. Now he's a senator.

      <p>
       Hell, look at the richest guy in the world right now. His mom had him when she was 17, he never knew his real dad, and his stepdad was a Cuban immigrant who came from Cuba alone when he was 15. Now Jeff worth 100 billion fucking dollars.

       Fluoride or fluorindes is a concoction of many different waste chemicals.  One of them is the Fluorine ion.  F on the periodic table of the elements.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll quote from the book by Christopher Bryson, the Fluoride Deception.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The terms fluorine and fluoride should not be confused in a book about chemical toxicity.  Fluorine is an element, one of the planets building blocks, en especially tiny atom that sits at the summit of the periodic table.  It's lordly location denotes an unmatched chemical potency that is a consequence of its size and structure.  The nine positively charged protons at the atoms core get little protection from a skimpy miniskirt of electrons.  As a result, fluorine atoms are unbalanced and dangerous predators, snatching electrons from other elements to relive their core tension.  (A ravenous hunger for electrons explains why fluorine cuts through steel like butter, burns asbestos, and reacts violently with most organic material.
Mercifully, mother nature keeps fluorine under lock and key.  Because of its extreme reactivity, fluorine is usually bound with other elements.  THe compounds are known as salts, or fluorides, the same stuff they put into toothpaste.  Yet the chemical potency of fluorides is also dramatic.  Armed with a captured electron, the toxicity of the negatively charged fluorine ion now comes, in part, from its tiny size.  (Ionic means having captured of surrendered an electron.)  Like a midget submarine i the harbor full of battleships, fluoride ions can get close to big molecules - like proteins or DNA - where their negative charge packs a wollop that can wreak havoc, forming powerful bonds with hydrogen, and interfering with the normal fabric of biologic materials.
       </p>

       Should I keep reading, or are you telling me, fluorine and fluorides are totally different?

       It's not, as you explain in your paragraph there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, do you have any evidence that fluoride in small amounts is dangerous? It's unhealthy is extreme quantities, but so is everything.

       tl;dr Fluoride is extremely useful as it prevents dental caries, though putting it in water at it's current concentration may be a bit of an overkill in modern society due to how widespread proper dental care has become (which already involves Fluoride). Recent efforts have gone in to finding the "sweet spot" for water fluoridation concentration, where it's still helps to prevent caries (specifically for those of lower income) while avoiding unwanted side effects. This is why you've seen the concentration drop over the years.

       Okay so first off, flouride used in our water supply is a synthetic chemical variant of flouride and is thus not natural, as opposed to regular naturally occurring flouride.

       So while natural flouride may be good for the teeth, I doubt this chemical by product is good for the teeth.

       Even better. Just for you my friend, I'm going to make a post about this tonight clarifying the differences. Here's another good explanation
      </p>
      <p>
       "Does the type of fluoride matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       The first and most basic thing to know about fluoride is that not all fluoride is created equal. There are many types—both naturally occurring and synthetic—that you will come across while researching water. The most common misconception is that the small amounts of natural fluoride found in water are extremely harmful. This natural version of fluoride is called calcium fluoride and is usually found in soil. With any sort of spring or natural source of water there will always be trace amounts of calcium fluoride. Of course, like anything else consumed in extreme excess, this type of fluoride does have the potential to cause health problems. This is most commonly an issue in rural parts of India where the consumption of groundwater along with elevated levels of calcium fluoride caused an outbreak of skeletal fluorosis, or a calcification of the joints that can cause discomfort and deformity."
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Another one of the most common types of fluoride is sodium fluoride. This is a synthetic, industrial version and has been shown to be far more harmful. Although there is still much speculation surrounding the topic, it is widely believed that the sodium fluoride that is found in consumer products, pesticides, and drinking water contains cancer-causing properties. In its purest form, sodium fluoride is actually capable of eating through concrete. Although sodium fluoride was the first compound to be used within our country’s tap water system in 1945, it has since been changed to a different compound called fluorosilicic acid.
       </em>

       The pineal gland accumulates fluoride at a very high rate, and high fluoride rates eventually lead to the gland completely calcifying. It is more than common in adults these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is much debate and conflicting info about the purpose of the pineal gland. I suggest looking into it.

       Many say the gland is the key to spiritual connection...I’m not really a “spiritual” person so that is tough for me to resonate with.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the very few studies I’ve read regarding pineal classification shows an alarmingly low sense of directional awareness in those with calcified glands. Magnetoreception is the next research step for me on this topic.

       Don’t know much of a damn thing about magnetoreception at the moment other than the Egyptians and other ancient civilizations seemingly had it in abundance. When I read the study about hindered magnetoreception I thought about ley lines and how many ancient sites lined up together.

       Pineal gland - aka- third eye - aka- eye of Horus.  Image search the resemblance. Fluoride calcifies this gland- literally turning it rock hard. Sedate the population, disable free thinking and you're left with a population of mindless people doing what they're told. Hitler used it in his concentration camps for this very reason.

       There's a really simple experiment people can do to figure this out for themselves. Stop drinking tap water and go on spring water or reverse osmosis filtered water for a few months.

      <p>
       If you start thinking more clearly and/or start seeing the "sparks", then you'll know something is up with fluoride. If you don't detect any changes, then no harm, no foul, go back to drinking tap.

       Economics. Fluoride is a hazardous waste as a result of the smelting of aluminum. In any rational world these industrial operators would have to pay to have this waste removed. Not in our world. People pay them to take the fluoride and poison us with it and we want them to.

       Every state/province or district is different. I work for a major water distribution system. We don't add fluoride to our water system.

       Water can become slightly fluoridated by its surrounding. Depending on where your watershed is. But the levels of fluoride in the water I deal with is pretty much non existent.

       One thing that gets overlooked is that back in the 80s there were all these claims about how a local municipality put fluoride in drinking water and they noticed a corresponding drop in childhood cavity levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       What most people fail to realize or even consider is that fluoride is a contact cleaner.  It's not performed by digestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why dentists use fluoride trays instead of prescribing fluoride tablets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why this bias is so present but a great many people resist the idea of removing it from drinking water yet when pressed their arguments are "because of that study where kids teeth got better".

       I'm assuming you meant this for me even though you didn't reply in the right place. Yes fluoride should be administered orally to strengthen teeth; it's called toothpaste, which you should spit out after applying. Drinking/ingesting it has no effect whatsoever on your teeth hence my shampoo analogy.

       They put fluoride in the drinking water because the government loves you so much that they couldn't bear to have you walking about with anything less than shiny white toofers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting the fluoride in the drinking water is the most effective way of making sure your teeth come into contact and are protected by the substance, similar to how drinking sunscreen is the most effective method of protecting one's skin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sodium fluoride is the EXACT SAME chemical compound as calcium fluoride and every chemist knows this to be absolute fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word fluorosis doesn't exist and is a silly conspiracy theory promoted by the greedy dental industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should really just accept that the government just wants you to be healthy which is why they subsidize your organic food, give you free gym memberships, let you write off exercise equipment and provide you free medical care funded by your very low rate of 100% voluntary income tax.

       While I was in high school we had a ex Dentist and public official who was responsible for the studies conducted in schools resulting in fluoride in the majority of New Zealands water. In NZ they used to towns close to each other Hastings and Napier. Napier is more affluent than Hastings. He stated the dental nurses at the school in one town were asked to pick up on all defects in teeth, the other city were told to ignore non immediate issues.

       Totally depends on the concentration levels.

       People take salt tablets as replacements for electrolytes after hard, sweat drenching workouts or activities all the time and they're fine.  These are large doses of salt.

      <p>
       But 5 cups of table salt in a glass of water and yeah, you're not going to be able to ingest it all because it's not all going to be in solution but what is in solution will likely make you sick.

       Even better. Just for you my friend, I'm going to make a post about this tonight clarifying the differences. Here's another good explanation
      </p>
      <p>
       "Does the type of fluoride matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       The first and most basic thing to know about fluoride is that not all fluoride is created equal. There are many types—both naturally occurring and synthetic—that you will come across while researching water. The most common misconception is that the small amounts of natural fluoride found in water are extremely harmful. This natural version of fluoride is called calcium fluoride and is usually found in soil. With any sort of spring or natural source of water there will always be trace amounts of calcium fluoride. Of course, like anything else consumed in extreme excess, this type of fluoride does have the potential to cause health problems. This is most commonly an issue in rural parts of India where the consumption of groundwater along with elevated levels of calcium fluoride caused an outbreak of skeletal fluorosis, or a calcification of the joints that can cause discomfort and deformity."
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Another one of the most common types of fluoride is sodium fluoride. This is a synthetic, industrial version and has been shown to be far more harmful. Although there is still much speculation surrounding the topic, it is widely believed that the sodium fluoride that is found in consumer products, pesticides, and drinking water contains cancer-causing properties. In its purest form, sodium fluoride is actually capable of eating through concrete. Although sodium fluoride was the first compound to be used within our country’s tap water system in 1945, it has since been changed to a different compound called fluorosilicic acid.
