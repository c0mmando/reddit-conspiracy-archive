One of them made a post a few days on fb before he died saying “this flu is going to kill me. I can’t take it anymore” and he was a young guy. Maybe 39 or 40.

<p>Its a social construct. By virus I mean the reaction the body has to rid itself from toxins. </p>

<p>Your body only creates mucus to rid itself from the toxins that we eat. If you don’t injest bad shit into your body, what would your body need to cleanse itself from? Think about it. </p>

<p>Mucus is for coating your stomach against the naturally made acids used to digest your food. It also clears out your lungs from particles that go into it.</p>

<p>I think it’s just being reported more, in a time with 24 hour news channels owned by corporations with agendas, there’s really a limited amount of things they’re willing to talk about. And, fear mongering over the flu is a safe topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are studies that show that the flu vaccine actually makes you more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections. </p>

<p>&quot;Community interactions at mucosal surfaces between viruses, like influenza virus, and respiratory bacterial pathogens are important contributors toward pathogenesis of bacterial disease. What has not been considered is the natural extension of these interactions to live attenuated immunizations, and in particular, live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs). Using a mouse-adapted LAIV against influenza A (H3N2) virus carrying the same mutations as the human FluMist vaccine, we find that LAIV vaccination reverses normal bacterial clearance from the nasopharynx and significantly increases bacterial carriage densities of the clinically important bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 19F and 7F) and Staphylococcus aureus (strains Newman and Wright) within the upper respiratory tract of mice.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not continue to read the article? It states:</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s more, this year&#39;s flu shot may not be up to the task. It is the same formulation that was used during Australia&#39;s most recent flu season -- which typically sets a pattern for what the U.S. will face -- and it was only 10 percent effective there.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s a solid assessment of what the future trend will likely be due to yields from past experience. It&#39;s tough to argue with that past precedent. I&#39;m not a huge fan of CBS News, but they are not the only news group or governmental agency making that claim.</p>

<p>Will the flu shot help? Sure, even if it&#39;s only a 1 in 10 chance, it would still be worth the effort. It&#39;s tough to encourage an apathetic public however when they see the chance for effectiveness as more trouble than it&#39;s potentially worth due to side effects and other potential or perceived issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People die from complications from the flu all the time, even from the virus itself. A lot of it now is fear mongering, we&#39;ve not had a panic since the swine flu &amp; bird flu &quot;threats&quot; from a couple of years ago. </p>

<p>There are a lot of cases, seems to be a big news story here in the U.K at the moment, but it&#39;s been unusually warm so far this winter with the odd cold/minus temperature/snow bout, but the winter weather hasn&#39;t been constant, so more people are out and about and viruses etc aren&#39;t being killed off by the weather like they usually would be this time of year. That&#39;s why it&#39;s spreading so quickly. But as far as figures go, the flu bugs floating around are nasty ones but at work we&#39;ve had less people taking sick days than we usually would have this time of year and speaking to friends about their work places, this seems to be a common thing with the exception of retail workers. </p>

<p>So yeah, I think it&#39;s a load of hype just to make people unnecessarily worry and perhaps to draw focus away from other news stories. Burying bad news, if you prefer. </p>
