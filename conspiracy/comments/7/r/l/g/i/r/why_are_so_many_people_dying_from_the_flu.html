       Seriously, I don’t remember in recent years so many people dying from flu. In addition to that, the flu vaccine is said to only be 10% affective? Flu is always a problem this time of year but this seems excessive. Blatantly excessive

       They aren't.  The Flu is just fear porn.  Viruses don't even exist.  It's just made up nonsense to explain what human's don't understand:

       But if it’s not flu, something is killing people. Just taking people who I’ve known to die into consideration alone is excessive. One of them made a post a few days on fb before he died saying “this flu is going to kill me. I can’t take it anymore” and he was a young guy. Maybe 39 or 40. Several schools from where I grew up were holding memorial services for kids who died in the same week from flu. It makes no sense to me.

       Maybe I’ve not noticed before and this is a typical  “flu season”. It just seems like a red flag

       All the world's a stage man.  Social media is the #1 place where they seed stuff like this.  It's how they pull off all their hoaxes.  Nobody is dying from the Flu.  People get sick all the time with whatever causes "stomach bugs" and think it's the Flu.

       Yep. If we didn't eat the bullshit they feed us, we would never get sick because viruses need mucus in the body to even exist in the body. We need to adapt to a pure alkaline diet.

       You just claimed viruses need mucus to survive. So are they real, or are they not real?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because whether you eat an alkaline diet or not, your body creates mucus so it can cleanse itself.

       Its a social construct. By virus I mean the reaction the body has to rid itself from toxins.

      <p>
       Your body only creates mucus to rid itself from the toxins that we eat. If you don’t injest bad shit into your body, what would your body need to cleanse itself from? Think about it.

       Shortly after WWII ended nearly a quarter of the world’s population died of the flu. People have always died of influenza. People who have a poor diet, who smoke, and are generally unhealthy are more likely to die of the flu. As, well as the extremely young and extremely old.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it’s just being reported more, in a time with 24 hour news channels owned by corporations with agendas, there’s really a limited amount of things they’re willing to talk about. And, fear mongering over the flu is a safe topic.

       There are studies that show that the flu vaccine actually makes you more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Community interactions at mucosal surfaces between viruses, like influenza virus, and respiratory bacterial pathogens are important contributors toward pathogenesis of bacterial disease. What has not been considered is the natural extension of these interactions to live attenuated immunizations, and in particular, live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs). Using a mouse-adapted LAIV against influenza A (H3N2) virus carrying the same mutations as the human FluMist vaccine, we find that LAIV vaccination reverses normal bacterial clearance from the nasopharynx and significantly increases bacterial carriage densities of the clinically important bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 19F and 7F) and Staphylococcus aureus (strains Newman and Wright) within the upper respiratory tract of mice."

       Only applies to the nasal vaccine--which is a live, attenuated virus. Not many people get that. The shot is not live virus so this doesn't hold true. Not defending the flu jab in general though, I don't get it myself for a number of reasons.

       My question would be what mechanism is causing the secondary bacterial infections even with the attenuated virus vaccine considering viruses and bacteria are completely different? I'm also interested in knowing the statistics of whether or not those who have died from the "flu" received the vaccine.

       The CDC says the average is 40-60% effectiveness. The flu shot this year is estimated to be only 10% effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The virus is continually mutating and changing, so trying to come up with an effective vaccine for such a rapidly changing virus is a difficult task to say the least.

       The CDC is reporting 39%, but the overall results are not in, and medical providers and hospitals are saying the same thing as the CBC. They are seeing very little effectiveness with the current vaccine. It's a really dangerous strain as well, and many deaths have occurred, typically in the elderly and children, or those with pneumonia and other weakened immune system conditions.

       Did you not continue to read the article? It states:
      </p>
      <p>
       "What's more, this year's flu shot may not be up to the task. It is the same formulation that was used during Australia's most recent flu season -- which typically sets a pattern for what the U.S. will face -- and it was only 10 percent effective there."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a solid assessment of what the future trend will likely be due to yields from past experience. It's tough to argue with that past precedent. I'm not a huge fan of CBS News, but they are not the only news group or governmental agency making that claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will the flu shot help? Sure, even if it's only a 1 in 10 chance, it would still be worth the effort. It's tough to encourage an apathetic public however when they see the chance for effectiveness as more trouble than it's potentially worth due to side effects and other potential or perceived issues.

       People die from complications from the flu all the time, even from the virus itself. A lot of it now is fear mongering, we've not had a panic since the swine flu &amp; bird flu "threats" from a couple of years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of cases, seems to be a big news story here in the U.K at the moment, but it's been unusually warm so far this winter with the odd cold/minus temperature/snow bout, but the winter weather hasn't been constant, so more people are out and about and viruses etc aren't being killed off by the weather like they usually would be this time of year. That's why it's spreading so quickly. But as far as figures go, the flu bugs floating around are nasty ones but at work we've had less people taking sick days than we usually would have this time of year and speaking to friends about their work places, this seems to be a common thing with the exception of retail workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I think it's a load of hype just to make people unnecessarily worry and perhaps to draw focus away from other news stories. Burying bad news, if you prefer.

       A more virulent strain that they didn't expect, so they flu vaccine is less effective. Nonzero chance it was engineered to be more virulent, that's certainly something they've done in the past.
