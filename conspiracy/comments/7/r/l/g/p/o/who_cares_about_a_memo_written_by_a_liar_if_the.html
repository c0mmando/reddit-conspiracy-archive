       There is an ongoing investigation to find out the details about Trump's wrongdoings. If you're the investigator, you don't leak stuff midinvestigation unless it's a gamechanger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The republicans that read the memo claim it's a gamechanger that will end the investigation on Trump, which is their engame. Yet where is it?

       Yes, this is true but it gets more complicated when things are highly political. There have been plenty of investigations into Hillary which found nothing and the republicans are trying to stop the one investigation into Trump. Being 'proven guilty' isn't so simple.

       Well Hillary testified many times already, Trump's trying to weasle his way out of one testimony at the moment. Hillary cooperated, Trump fired Comey for investigating him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either Hillary has had the entire government in her pocket for years (which Trump's government has made seem impossible), or she's not actually as bad as the right is trying to make her out to be. Either Trump is super guilty, or he's innocent but is acting super guilty in trying to end something he shouldn't be worried about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a fan of Hillary, but if you're trying to compare her being investigated to Trump being investigated, you're comparing apples to oranges.

       Well, as I said,
       <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/08/trump-mueller-interview/">
        his lawyers are looking into legal possibilities for avoiding an interview
       </a>
       . They could be worried he will get caught up in perjury like Flynn, but a) I doubt that Mueller would use that on him, considering how important a fair end result is b) if Trump had nothing to hide, why lie?
      </p>
      <p>
       But my theory is that Mueller is close to catching Trump on something big, be it Russia or him trying to protect Flynn (who appears to be guilty of a lot) and therefor obstructing justice.

       No, obviously, the pro-Trump Republican government would not be expected to gleefully release information damaging to Trump in the same way that they would be expected to release information that supports their fabricated pro-Trump illegitimate-FISA conspiracy (if they
       <em>

       Specifically on the issue of Trump and Russia, he was on Trump's transition team which is fair game in the investigation. He's effectively investigating a team he was a member of.

      <p>
       That's like putting Gronk incharge of investigating Tom Brady.

       Curtis what's in the memo.

       Had anyone else heard that it includes more texts between Strzok and Page?  What if they just blurted out the whole operation? Wouldn't be surprised.

       Otherwise, we know unauthorized searches of raw data was going on, because the FISC put out a report on it, the NSA head Rogers started a review, and FBI shut down third party access.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know now thanks to a recent Ignatius column that the FBI recurved Steele's first report
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       they heard from Australian Alexander Downer. Still, the second time you hear about something could reasonably make you take a second look at the first thing again.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we know the Dossier was used in part to get warrants on Page and Manafort. But the big picture still is fuzzy as far as I can figure it.

       There is an ongoing investigation to find out the details about Trump's wrongdoings. If you're the investigator, you don't leak stuff midinvestigation unless it's a gamechanger.

       No, obviously, the pro-Trump Republican government would not be expected to gleefully release information damaging to Trump in the same way that they would be expected to release information that supports their fabricated pro-Trump illegitimate-FISA conspiracy (if they
