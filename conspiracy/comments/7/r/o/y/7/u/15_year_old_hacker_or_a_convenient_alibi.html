       This story in the Telegraph today caught my eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: sorry..forgot to say, this is a link to story published back in October 2017..it has more information on the timeline than today's story.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is today's story if you want that also:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/19/british-15-year-old-gained-access-intelligence-operations-afghanistan/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now...this is r/conspiracy...so I'm going to just say that when it comes to certain "items of interest" that have convenient timing/timeline coincidences, I like to point them out. Edit: And yes..it's going to contain some unconfirmed speculation on my part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Items of interest:
      </p>
      <p>
       Call for FISA memo to be released.
      </p>
      <p>
       This story in the Telegraph the very next day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last but not least - Trump signs 702 renewal and the day he announced he was running for President - June 16, 2015
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at the timeline of this kids shenanigans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secures unauthorised access to the computer of CIA Director Mr Brennan between June 1 and October 30, 2015 (doesn't claim the attack until October 20th, 2015)
      </p>
      <p>
       Attempts to gain unauthorised access to computer of the Secretary of Homeland Security Mr Johnson between July 4 and October 22, 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       On October 17, 2015, he tried to access the computer of  Avril Haines, the White House deputy national security adviser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between October 18 and Christmas Day 2015 Gamble targeted FBI Special Agent Amy Hess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attempts to gain access to the computer of Deputy Director of FBI Mr Giuliano between October 29 and November 16.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between January 4 and January 12, 2016 he targets Comcast cable TV and broadband account belonging to James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between January 5 and January 18, 2016, attempts access to the computer of Vonna Weir Heaton, the former intelligence executive of the US National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between January 17 and January 20, 2016, Gamble targeted a Comcast account operated Mr Obama's  senior science and technology adviser John Holdren.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally attempts to gain access to the US Department of Justice's network between January 26 and February 4, 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm posting all of this now because I'm very curious to see the timeline of any dates mentioned in the big FISA memo brouhaha...that is..if they ever release the memo...and the actual full report the memo is based on...which I personally believe is the "ONLY" right thing to do now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The working theory on this whole thing is simply this:
      </p>
      <p>
       They had the kid pegged from day one. They needed a useful idiot (no offence kid) to account for certain actions taken by or attempted on... key personnel within key agencies and departments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything out of the ordinary that needed to be accounted for..could be conveniently laid in the lap of a 15 year old autistic hacker named Kane Gamble. (The name alone raises a red flag for me)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways..here are all of the dates of his actions laid out for future reference if and when they release the FISA report/memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also like to say...that if they release the full FISA report...it should be demanded that they also release the memo..so that we can see for ourselves if a "certain narrative" was being attempted with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I always get suspicious when a certain story gets pushed by a large number of media outlets on any given day...especially these types of stories..
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll see if the US outlets push this story hard this weekend.

       Submission statement: I find it hard to believe that a 15 year old had his way with numerous high level intelligence agency personnel.

       I find it much easier to believe they used him as a "patsy in waiting" for possible scenarios involving future scandals.

       That was my first thought lol. Also the patsy in waiting angle seems likely. I wouldn’t think intelligence agencies would announce when someone hacked into their system, especially a teenager, seems like bad PR it must not be that secure if a 15yo could do it. Or that’s what they want you to think, after all the revelations on domestic spying it’s possible that’s manufactured, such as my belief that the incident between Apple &amp; the FBI after San Bernardino was nothing more than PR to make Apple appear as though they give a shit about users privacy &amp; for the feds to appear that they had to jump through hoops to get into the phone, instead of them having the public know they already have the capability and have had them for some time. 
My other thought was if this kid was indeed a computer wiz, wouldn’t these intel agencies want to recruit him to work for them?
