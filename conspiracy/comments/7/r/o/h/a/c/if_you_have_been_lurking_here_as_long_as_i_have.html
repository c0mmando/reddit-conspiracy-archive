       Lots of insignificant conspiracy related events seem to be pummeling us lately. Wether politically motivated or not, we need to consider the possibility that the shills and social engineers might be devising little mini "forum false flags" to distract and confuse the truth movement and all of the various subs that people like us are active us on the web.  They do not want us uniting under any cause, because that's when we are dangerous. Remember Pizzagate ?
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be a good way to keep us from focusing our collective attention on the most important issues that threaten our freedom and civil liberties. Always know their tactics, and be skeptical of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, let your voice and votes be heard so we can discuss the things happening and come to a conclusion, with a larger sample of thoughts. Take control of the tone of discussion here by browsing by "new".
      </p>
      <p>
       We rely on each other for the quality of information we receive and  the consensus our movement comes to. This will help us reach more people and expose the New World Order oligarchs.

       Thank you for this. I don't trust the government. The influx of "Donald Trump is the truth seeker and light bringer" posts reek of psyop/disinfo. They have my mom hooked. I'm starting to get worried about her. At least 8 hours a day she's listening to various right wing "conspiracy" youtubes and I can't get through to her it's ALL bad.

       We need to convince the people who are convinced that trump is the savior, that he is not. That is easy, if they are willing to listen. His actions speak for themselves, like any president's.

       The problem with a lot of people trying to get other people to denounce Trump are actually people that believe in government and believe Clinton would have been the superior choice.  I just want those people to be critical of everybody in government like they are of Trump but they tend to believe Democrats are the saviors much like die-hard Trump supporters think he is the savior.  It's hard to give much credit to someone saying everyone has been duped by Trump when they are being duped by the democrats supposed moral highground.  I think we may have been duped by Trump but no more than we were by Obama and no more than we would have been with Clinton.

       So many people are caught up in the race vs. race shit but don't understand that it's rich vs. poor (not every rich person is the enemy but you know what I'm saying I'm sure). That's why a good portion of real members of this sub need to take action because we don't know if anyone else will. I've tried before but i need to start working at it again. The internet is a good way to spread information but not everybody realizes that this shit is our reality unless they witness it in their real everyday lives.

       Isn’t this the same dichotomy? Are there NO wealthy or political elites in the whole world who are generous, compassionate decent human beings? Why does it have to be us vs them at any level? We are all human beings, shouldn’t it just be all of humankind’s collective battle against its own human nature? The drive of all humankind to evolve and to become better?

       All we can do is fill in the box next to a name and hope they make changes for the better.  Except it seems no matter which box we fill in things remain the same.  It's almost as if we have no power at all.  Bush/Obama same same but different. Looks like Trump may be same same as well just with a lot more confusion surrounding everything he touches.

       Trust me, my family does the same for liberal politics and its just as bad. This is wht OP is talking about though, there is bait on both sides of the aisle so no matter what you stand for they can lure you in! Browsing by new is definitely the best way to see what the actual consensus of our peers are thinking, which can only be helpful whether you agree with their opinions or not. Cheers you guys and don't fret too hard man our elders will snap out of it someday, hopefully!

       No I haven't noticed any difference in this sub compared to the years I've been viewing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have however noticed that the people in this sub have a ongoing habit of believing there's some sort psyop conspiracy going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also from my perspective forums, message boards and social media in general hasn't led to any sort of major cultural or political change in the West. The power structure is well entrenched and the false left-right paradigm, post modern philosophy, cultural marxism, distraction, and division are well suited to protect it.

       Until we leverage new technology we will not achieve anything in revolutionary terms.

       What he meant to do was accuse you of being a shill, most likely. It’s a rule here that is ostensibly enforced but in practice it’s incredibly easy to circumvent by doing anything but actually directly accusing someone of being a shill.

       Yeah I hate this argument.  I create new accounts from time to time and people will immediately dismiss my argument regardless of it's merit by quoting my account age. It's very frustrating.

       Yes the left/right paradigm in politics is a joke. You're right to always remain skeptical at anything and everything and remember the government and the oliogarchs/ruling elites have nothing in common with us and merely use us to make them wealthier. They want to convince us they are helping us so we will vote for them and stay ignorant/uninformed spewing disinformation marketed towards the masses to reinforce the neoliberal status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just ignore and down vote serious Q posts or comments by the disciples and suggest everyone else to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remain vigilant! No one in power is here to help us. They do not have our best interests in mind. Don't let LARPers convince us that there are some behind the scenes good guys fighting for average Americans by pulling us into their warped view of reality capitalizing on false hopes and fantasy tales.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all a distraction from the REAL conspiracies and people who religiously follow Q are putting a misguided trust in our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry folks, no need to organize, seek the truth, fight corruption. Trump and his team are doing it so you can just sit back and watch another episode of whatever shit TV show you watch after work. Since all established news is now fake news. Well Q is "fake news" on the opposite spectrum.
