        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Lots of insignificant conspiracy related events seem to be pummeling us lately. Wether politically motivated or not, we need to consider the possibility that the shills and social engineers might be devising little mini &quot;forum false flags&quot; to distract and confuse the truth movement and all of the various subs that people like us are active us on the web.  They do not want us uniting under any cause, because that&#39;s when we are dangerous. Remember Pizzagate ? </p>

<p>This would be a good way to keep us from focusing our collective attention on the most important issues that threaten our freedom and civil liberties. Always know their tactics, and be skeptical of everything. </p>

<p>Finally, let your voice and votes be heard so we can discuss the things happening and come to a conclusion, with a larger sample of thoughts. Take control of the tone of discussion here by browsing by &quot;new&quot;.</p>

<p>We rely on each other for the quality of information we receive and  the consensus our movement comes to. This will help us reach more people and expose the New World Order oligarchs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to convince the people who are convinced that trump is the savior, that he is not. That is easy, if they are willing to listen. His actions speak for themselves, like any president&#39;s.</p>

<p>Saudi arms deal, Goldman Sachs cabinet, Israel ties, support for militarized police. We&#39;ve seen this so many times.</p>

<p>Once they realize they have been duped by the classic Trojan horse political demagogue ploy, we can reunite.</p>

<p>These are largely good people who just want to find a way to defeat TPTB. It can be done, but not unless we&#39;re united.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with a lot of people trying to get other people to denounce Trump are actually people that believe in government and believe Clinton would have been the superior choice.  I just want those people to be critical of everybody in government like they are of Trump but they tend to believe Democrats are the saviors much like die-hard Trump supporters think he is the savior.  It&#39;s hard to give much credit to someone saying everyone has been duped by Trump when they are being duped by the democrats supposed moral highground.  I think we may have been duped by Trump but no more than we were by Obama and no more than we would have been with Clinton. </p>

This is wht OP is talking about though, there is bait on both sides of the aisle so no matter what you stand for they can lure you in! Browsing by new is definitely the best way to see what the actual consensus of our peers are thinking, which can only be helpful whether you agree with their opinions or not.

<p>I have however noticed that the people in this sub have a ongoing habit of believing there&#39;s some sort psyop conspiracy going on here.</p>

<p>Also from my perspective forums, message boards and social media in general hasn&#39;t led to any sort of major cultural or political change in the West. The power structure is well entrenched and the false left-right paradigm, post modern philosophy, cultural marxism, distraction, and division are well suited to protect it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the left/right paradigm in politics is a joke. You&#39;re right to always remain skeptical at anything and everything and remember the government and the oliogarchs/ruling elites have nothing in common with us and merely use us to make them wealthier. They want to convince us they are helping us so we will vote for them and stay ignorant/uninformed spewing disinformation marketed towards the masses to reinforce the neoliberal status quo. </p>

<p>I just ignore and down vote serious Q posts or comments by the disciples and suggest everyone else to do the same.</p>

<p>Remain vigilant! No one in power is here to help us. They do not have our best interests in mind. Don&#39;t let LARPers convince us that there are some behind the scenes good guys fighting for average Americans by pulling us into their warped view of reality capitalizing on false hopes and fantasy tales. </p>

<p>This is all a distraction from the REAL conspiracies and people who religiously follow Q are putting a misguided trust in our government. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry folks, no need to organize, seek the truth, fight corruption. Trump and his team are doing it so you can just sit back and watch another episode of whatever shit TV show you watch after work. Since all established news is now fake news. Well Q is &quot;fake news&quot; on the opposite spectrum.</p>
