       I've spent a few weeks here now and what I've noticed is that most of the submissions here are just regurgitations of whatever's happening in the news. For example, we're currently getting a lot of submissions regarding the government shutdown even though there's really no conspiracy behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far in the time I've spent here only a few real conspiracies have been posted, most notably this one:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7r324r/asteroids_meteors_and_more_nasa_lies_oh_my/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7r324r/asteroids_meteors_and_more_nasa_lies_oh_my/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from this though, it's pretty much just political stuff. No conspiracies. Others are also starting to bring up how partisan politics is appearing in this sub now too. Ugh. How can we fix this and start discussing real conspiracies here instead of wasting our time clicking on what are basically just news articles in r/conspiracy?

       You should hang around /new more. Far more interesting discussion and nuance in postings, plus it give you the opportunity to upvote content you want to see in the sub, and fight back against the constant shilling.

       I made yesterday. Someone asked for evidence. I went and found a link from both left wing and right wing sites. You would think a comment like that would be respected in this sub, nope. Downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There really is no “fight”, only censorship. Hit -5 karma and 80% of the site will never see your comment. As long as the admins OK this behavior we will have to deal with this bullshit.

       What conspiracies are you into?
      </p>
      <p>
       I tend to take a more ecological perspective on conspiracies. Less that there are shadowy  long term cabals and more that power tends to try and accumulate more power because it fears loss of control and ultimately death.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's the herd, the general population, and there are the predators, people who excel at accumulating power. Predators can form hunting packs or go solo. Most of the herd is concerned with just eating grass and fucking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following the path of power accumulation (currency) tends to be a really good way of figuring out where and who the predators are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoy the speculative fiction more traditionally associated with conspiracy theories, and keep an open mind to the ones that obviously have a lot of coherent thought it into them. Unfortunately most of the extremely speculative seems to paralyze people in impossible mental situations and keep them from making change in their lives. Kind of a terror porn sort of thing.

       Yep I posted several posts in the past few weeks and when I posted there were 4-5 thousand active users on the sub yet one of my posts was stuck at 0 upvotes (50% upvote rate), 2 comments (including submission statement) and only got 125 total views and the other is at 9 upvotes with a (63% upvote rating), 2 comments, and 600 total views.
      </p>
      <p>
       125 and 600 total views on a sub with an average of 3-7 thousand users online at a time is pretty ridiculous and fishy...

       I don't really think it's the mods - this sub loves blaming whoever's in power. It's not mods submitting these articles, it's people coming here to get a rise out of us. If you look at the mods posts they're the ones doing the roundtables and such. Take a look at the sidebar picture - does that look political to you?

       I've been here for 3 years. This political craziness only started before the 2016 election and hasn't stopped since. Maybe yes it is the mods fault for not having better rules concerning what can be posted, but if they did try to change the rules you know full well that everyone would complain that it is "censorship" or "Nazi mods".

      <p>
       By posting the content you want to see and discussing the real conspiracies as you understand them. As others have mentioned, the /new queue is where most of the real discussion takes place. Unfortunately, actors from several sides tend to downvote good material and upvote divisive and partisan news-cycle bullshit, meaning a lot of good material never hits the front page. It's here, but it gets hidden.

       Like what, specifically? My offer stills stands to help you organize and make a case for the black nobility, tri-sovereign states, or pretty much any other topic you want. It probably won't make it very far out of /new on it's own, but I'm confident if it's well-researched and -sourced we can get it stickied.

       But a more general problem is just the nature of this sub existing on an open platform where votes are easily purchased. Even if we eliminated a broad swath of content as off-limits (say US political theater) and banned everyone you think is a shill or a troll (quite a few are), they can

       I'd agree. I think this is just as much a shift in the broader conspiracy "community" if you could call it that than this sub specifically. 5 years ago, the number of people who would self-identify with "conspiracy theorists" who entertained at least one or two fringe topics was maybe about half. Those people are all still here, but now we have a huge influx of people who are only into the more "concrete" political and governmental theories. The fraction of CTs who will entertain fringe topics is probably closer to 5–10%. (Pulling these numbers out of my ass, but I think the trend is real and pronounced.) Most Trump supporters believe Hillary is involved in one or more conspiracies and vice versa for anti-Trumpers. Even ignoring shills for the moment, the fringe people are again a minority.

       The current sidebar sticky on the Pyramids is pretty fringe, by this sub's standards at least. I know you disagree with the Sphinx/Lion connection and likely a few other aspects of that doc, though. I'm not opposed to stickying articles or docs, but I do have a strong preference for stickying OC. I think (without any hard evidence) that it inspires and rewards others here to do their own research and connect their own dots rather than just taking someone else's word for it. I don't personally want (and I don't think you do) people to just take others' word on any of these topics; I want them to learn the skills to research and discern truth themselves.

       You're the one who brought this up. Yes, there are some simple steps that could be taken to make a difference (I agree with you on some, fully disagree on others), but short of banning or severely restricting the amount of overtly political content here, the political will always be more popular than the fringe. It's called fringe for a reason.

       I don't disagree, but we'll always run into the problem of direction vs. reach. These are necessary tradeoffs in any discussion platform.
       <a href="/r/AlternativeHistory">
        /r/AlternativeHistory
       </a>
       has a very specific direction, and you and CapAp keep that direction rather well. As a side effect, the sub doesn't have that broad a reach. Most people just aren't that into it. This sub has a very broad reach, and as the tradeoff, the direction is pushed and pulled by all sides, both from within the mod team, the userbase, and outside influencers. I'm not saying this to be defeatist, but it is the nature of these things.

       Putting a flair like that on a post at or near 0 upvotes won't do much, unfortunately. It's still unlikely to hit the front page, and the flair would draw just as many downvotes from people suspicious of the mod team and those who disagree with the post. If, on the off chance the post would hit /hot, it's likely the discussion would be focused more on the meta of why the mods flaired it.

       Currents events are the conspiracies of our time. And, it's far more interesting to dissect a conspiracy in real-time, rather than perseverate over the past.

       I'll explain a process here:
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two types that employ conspiracy into their life with meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who want an adventure they cant finish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who devote themselves to insanity by trying to find a particular truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who want an emotional escape through mystery, like MOST conspiracy theories, and it's a topic/brand that generates itself by people existing in doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other case, the deep-cases, are generally people with particular sets of adept knowledge who stumble upon discrepancies in their understanding of how reality works, and they endlessly try to expose the truth, to correct some flaw-in-knowing within themselves. These people are the heroes of the conspiracy community, as they invest into it and are devoted to their cause.

       Want to find a punchy and succint conspiracy theory-based meme that's great to send on to other people and more likely to be read and understood?  Well you won't find it here because they were banned.  Proving that certain people are working against the interest of the sub not for it.  If a meme wasn't popular it could just have been downvoted after all. They're gatekeepers so they took that away.  It was influencing to many other people and introducing them to the idea of beink skeptical about tptb.

       They don't talk about it over there because they want silence, they talk about it here to drown out the real conspiracy theorists who ARE bringing up the story. Besides if you look at most people trying to discredit Trump over here post in that shithole on the regular.

       Politics is a shit hole because it pretends to be something it's not. TD is pretty straightforward with who they are, that's why most of the shithole countries are shitholes, because of lies and corruption. Which is exactly r/politics.

       So now you're just going to flat-out lie? Most days we rarely see a single TrumpRussia story... and if we do, it's someone from T_D posting something which supposedly says that

        Hillary

       worked with the Russians.

       The FISA shit is a conspiracy. The Russia hacking is a conspiracy. A lot of this shit is conspiracy that Hillary and her deep state cronies keep perpetuating because they're butthurt about losing. Sucks there's so much politics in it... sucks even more that people are being paid to propagate "Russian bot" bullshit and ultimately sucks the most that dumbasses believe it.

       No, the issue is that a lot of the posts in this sub are just straight up politics. There's no conspiracy at all. The people putting up these links don't even mention any conspiracy in their submission statement, they just summarize whatever they're linking.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a lot of people were posting stuff about the government shut down last night even though there's no conspiracy behind it. It's simply caused by a lack of ability to cooperate between Democrats and Republicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, if you think there's some secret force behind the government shutdown then, by all means, I'd love to know your theories. The problem is exactly that though, in r/conspiracy people are much more concerned with whatever the media is saying and what's on the surface, rather than looking at everything underneath. Not any of these government shutdown people have propounded any conspiracy theory to go along with their posts.

       And if someone questions how a political article is a conspiracy, the downvote brigade comes flying in to suppress the posters question.  Then the OP claims by some far distant relation it is a conspiracy, and an army of accounts comes in to upvote the OP and post back up comments to make it seem like what the OP just said defends the content to be in this subreddit.

       Wrong, mods can and do police content actively in other subreddits.  For example, in r/Toronto, you can't make posts asking for advice or what to do in the city, etc.  The mods lock your post and direct you to another subreddit where those posts are allowed.

       Well when the two party system works together to manufacture the consent of the governed and distract the population it is a conspiracy. But I also appreciate that some posts do not have a conspiracy and I am one of those long time redditors who asks where is the conspiracy.

       Implied conspiracies because it involves the almost entirely corrupt world of politics.  That's why you get so many 'political' posts.  Because of all the older hands here though, you'll be getting fuck all decent content at all now though due to the requirement for a "submission statement".  People who are into reading about conspiracies and a little more, shall we say, 'aware' will never put anything that could be described as a 'statement' next to their links for reasons that are obvious to anybody with their eyes open.  In fact, not too long from now I expect a few unfortunates are going to discover why they never should have done such a thoughtlessly stupid thing themselves.  There's a reason that the shill mods and a handfull of shill accounts who you never see posting anything genuinely conspiracy related (other than a couple of token gesture 'fringe' items that they've gathered will give them some kind of credence in the eyes of the community) were the only ones who wanted to impose this against the will of all the actual proper users who made the sub what it is (u/orangutan for example). All will become clear soon enough I expect.

       Powerful conspiracies involve powerful people. That somehow intersects with politicians.

       Is LBJ killing JFK not a conspiracy because they were both politicians?

       Of course, conspiracies tend to involve politicians 99% of the time, but there's still a difference between just straight up politics and a conspiracy. Anyway, the types of things I'm most interested in generally include secret organizations. Hoping we can discuss those

       r/conspiracy has been over run by contemporary political scandal and semi-conspiracy. IMHO it should be a different subreddit. I am not an advocate of and censorship, but we have different subreddits for reasons. If you enjoy both types of conspiracy you would merely have to visit both subreddits.

       So now you're just going to flat-out lie? Most days we rarely see a single TrumpRussia story... and if we do, it's someone from T_D posting something which supposedly says that
