Woke up Friday and the front page is half full of posts about the memo and the other half people bitching that there&#39;s not enough posts about the memo. That was some of the most inorganic shit ive ever seen, even manaforts indictment didn&#39;t see that level of hype.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t seem so weird if you had stayed up Thurs night and watched the movement actually happen. Thousands of organic users shared Twitter handle lists and encouraged others to post like mad, here and at CBTS_stream, as well as the chans. Dozens of folks that <em>I know</em> are real people were banned from Twitter and by 4 am the narrative script hit the MSM that all these people are Russian bots. A few publications even went so far as calling anyone asking to see the memo a traitor. </p>

<p>Moral of the story: if something seems strange, do some research rather than buying what the MSM told you happened while you were sleeping. </p>

<p>Color me surprised. I figured if we ever saw it, it&#39;d be because someone leaked to Wikileaks. Maybe Congress will make it public themselves? If they really wanted this public though, it&#39;d already be available. This is all theater. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Nunes authored a secret memo that his supporters say will cause all of the senior leadership in the FBI to be charged with treason, but the document is so amazing that nobody can see it. And we are buying this bullshit?  Getting a FISA wiretap requires credible evidence. So is the problem that the judges were corrupt, or that the evidence was faked? Or just that the evidence implicated GOP members?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Several congressmen did see the memo. It&#39;s not secret. It is classifed. But they&#39;re doing things above the board to get it to the public. You know it is possible that they were tapping into those phones and emails long before they got an actual warrant. Then used the warrant to retroactively justify the illegal spying going on earlier in the year. That evidence could be a reason for Nunes to have gotten so flummoxed last March. And could be the reason behind the memo. I highly doubt the GOP is implicated in the supposed scandal, otherwise it would have been the Dems pushing to release the memo and not the GOP. We will get to see the memo. Bullshit or not. Just have to be a little patient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see this same question everywhere. I&#39;m not looking to argue, but if what this memo leads to (and that is where the sauce i from what I&#39;ve seen/read so far) is VERY big.  Like bigger than watergate BIG.  So, we can argue about that as well, but the reason for Trump himself not releasing it, distancing himself is because of course anti-trump folks will have another potential bullet point, case, whatever.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think its bullshit.  I think going from about 5 or so conspiracy memo posts, to zero, then to a couple that are slanted the other way is kinda shitty.</p>

We were told it was self-evidently super incriminating BECAUSE the Dems were blocking its release.

<p>Then we find out the Republicans can release it at any moment and we start hearing these excuses that &quot;well, someone pro-Trump can&#39;t release it because what about the optics?&quot;. These weak excuses about why they can&#39;t release it and the 19 day delay makes it obvious that the initial #releasethememo campaign was clearly bullshit intended to still up media coverage.</p>

<p>you can tell it&#39;s him because he uses similar usernames, goes through people&#39;s post histories trying to expose them, and uses lots of emojis.</p>

<p>he has also admitted to ban evasion multiple times.</p>

<p>If twitter censoring a hashtag manages to move the memo thing from taking up the top 12 posts on friday, to crickets on saturday, there&#39;s something else at play.</p>

<p>Ill present it like this. Would you be equally as pissed if twitter was 
 allegedly shadowbanning a movement such as MeToo, or something equally damning (Maybe about.. oh i dont know.. Corruption in the IT sector?)</p>

<p>Twitter shadowbans things. because &quot;they&quot; dont like the message. Not because its actually fake, not because its violence (eg: terrorist propaganda that has a foothold somehow on twitter and youtube) but because the political opinion talked about is &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>The whole story (twitter shadowbanning) is being buried behind other things. If you buy the idea that Reddit is compromised, and that you will only see the things &quot;they&quot; want you to see. it gets even worse.</p>

<p>Imagine, once again, that the Metoo movement was shadowbanned, because it targeted high playing IT people.</p>

<p>This stuff is really, really scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot with the MeToo that I wouldn&#39;t be pissed about banning. Weinstein and Bill Clinton definitely deserve attention. </p>

<p>Ansari and Frankin? Seemed more like awkward sexual advances that never rose to the level of assault, but people wanted to see heads roll and were eager for outrage.</p>

<p>That said, neither of those were sponsored by state level actors, which is much more dangerous than generic civilian opportunists.</p>
