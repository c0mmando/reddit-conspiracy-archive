        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The left and right wings of our generally unified oligarchy are getting better than ever at splitting us up and convincing us it&#39;s red vs blue instead of us against them. I see more and more people, especially on the far right and left getting giddy to hurt their fucking neighbors, and I gotta tell ya, whether you see our masters as shifty jews or conniving capitalists, whatever they are, they&#39;re happy we&#39;re attacking each other instead of them. </p>

<p>To lefties, just remember not everybody in a red cap is a fascist. More often they&#39;re hardworking people that saw the same blatant corruption in our government you do, but out of desperation they made the mistake of trusting one wing of the machine that then pumped them full of fascist propaganda and got their fear, hatred and suspicion pointed at the poor, people of color and foreigners, anywhere but at the man behind the curtain</p>

<p>To people on the right, please understand that misleading news is significantly worse on your outlets. CNN and the like will bend the truth, word things dishonestly and selectively omit facts. Fox and breitbart will straight up publish clickbait headlines with zero evidence, like &quot;3 million illegals voted&quot; or &quot;Jerry brown legalizes illegals voting&quot; and never correct it. You understand a rich, liberal elite is manipulating our whole society, but what if I told you liberalism doesn&#39;t mean &quot;uhh, the democrats&quot; like you learned in school, it actually just means anyone in support of free markets and corporate governance? And you&#39;ll notice, despite all their drama and infighting, both parties readily agree on selling us out for a surprisingly low price. I know you&#39;ve heard a lot of very nasty things about communists and anarchists, but I cannot recommend enough getting to understand their views. As long as you&#39;re polite about it, there are tons of forums on here where you can talk to real live communists who will respectfully disagree with you and explain their politics in whatever depth you let them get into. And even if you still disagree once you understand their side of the story, at least you&#39;ll be able to talk shit about them way better.</p>

<p>A great conflict is coming. Thanks to automation and several other factors, the need for labor is going to rapidly decline and leave the ruling class of the USA with millions of ordinary people they have no idea how to feed, house or occupy. Rather than having bored, hungry and desperate masses who might question the status quo, I think they&#39;d rather us just kill us off in the most politically convenient way possible. And what better way than siccing us on each other? Just please, don&#39;t fall for it. We&#39;ve come so far as a species, and our wildest fantasies are so close to fruition. We could well get our shit together and go full star trek, conquer the stars as a functional group within a century, but if these fuckers win only the the most corrupt, awful people will survive; they&#39;ll destroy the planet in half that time and then whatever society that escapes this rock will be even more dark, depraved and corrupt than our ruling class is now. Don&#39;t let that happen y&#39;all.</p>

<p>Watch this video here on why the left has descended into a Soros funded cultural marxism/communism and where it all came from:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjaBpVzOohs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjaBpVzOohs</a></p>

<p>Well worth your time.</p>

<p>Other than that, I am an ex leftist who went center/right. I can assure having come from both sides, that what the left has turned into (and its infiltration into education, gov, tech, google/reddit/FB/twitter, and the news outlets) if BY FAR more dangerous than anything coming out of the right these days.</p>

<p>Now sure these are globalists like Soros dividing us, and that&#39;s the fool (and his ilk) that need to be regicided, however, the degeneracy of what has come from the left, is actual, its here to stay and its everywhere.</p>

<p>The Right. on the other hand, and its massive rise in the West, is a simple reaction, a pendulum swing from too much power of the left. The Right is going to get nasty. Its already happening in Europe where there are far right groups forming to do battle with the Muslims. We are going to witness decades, hundreds of years of Civil wars now, and there&#39;s no turning back from it unfortunately </p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem with the cultural Marxist, they are brainwashed to this k anything that doesnt don&#39;t Into the hive mind narrative is: ______fill in the blank. In the case, the narrative is either Russian, redneck, racist, or Nazi.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even fucking know me dude. I grew up in the city around all colors, best friend Dominican, last night hung out w my Mexican friend and his wife, roommate if Phillipino, other best friend El Salvadorian, just got done dating a new, have dated black, Asian, Cuban, etc.</p>

<p>Boy are you fucking wrong big time in your cognitive dissonance. Along w this, I&#39;ve schooled all my friends and family on the P.C. cultural Marxism so they all now know why the left is fucked up and why I am no longer part of literal brainwashed global conspiracy campaign that started w the Frankfurt school.</p>

<p>Hahaha also wrong on the chubby neck beard. Gym daily, shave clean, work, tats, and very well educated both w Street smarts and traditional college. Boy are you in for a surprise these next few years when you realize the ghetto is also stepping away from the demoncraps</p>

<p>Wut? What are you even trying to say there? I&#39;ve read this half a dozen times and I can&#39;t make any sense of it. I guess what they say about Trumpies and reading and writing comprehension is true...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know you, but I know your message is ugly and paranoid. We all just want what&#39;s best for the country and if you took the time to read OP&#39;s message you would understand that.

<p>Okay, you &#39;redpilled&#39; your friends and family. They probably stood their awkwardly while you spouted off some white genocide bulllshit you read on /pol/ and just nodded and pretended to agree with you so you would go away and not cause a scene.</p>

<p>that was your fill in the blank: coward, racist, reading and writing comprehension, this is all from the Saul Alinsky Rules for Radicals(cultural marxists/leftists) book. Great job, you are COMPLETELY proving my point</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know you, but I know your message is ugly and paranoid</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My message is wake the fuck the fuck, read a fucking book, get some fucking knowledge, and then you will no longer be played like a fucking fiddle by the left. Its very blunt, legit, factual, source based, unfortunately the scholars who discuss what the left has turned into, admit that folks like you no longer look at the facts, no longer watch the vids in their totality because A.D.D. no longer read books or do the research, so its actualy a war against idiocracy, against a bunch of played ostriches who are taught to keep their heads in the hive mind sand.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, you&#39;re wrong, this isnnt about Jones or Soros (Though he does fund the left in order to divide us), but this is about a legit global marxist conspiracy with names, organizations, funding, infiltration into colleges, tech, media/news, culture leaving one side of America super fucking brainwashed.</p>

<p>Listen I was on both sides, and as a centrist, I understand that we need to be united, however those on the right, I can sit down, talk to with logic and reason, I can give them documentaries and books on the history of what the left has become, and they will listen, ask, debate, talk, contemplate and consider.</p>

<p>Those on the left have just gone off completely off the deep end and refuse any of this. It is literally as if one side has become fucking zombies dude. How the hell do yout alk to hivemind zombies if they refuse to listen and right away stereotype you as: coward, racist, low reading and writing comprehension? You can&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes I want a big fat prize from the libtards proving to them I&#39;m not a racist. </p>

<p>Hahahaha, naw thats the stupidest assumptions based on stereotyping. I&#39;m part of a philosophical debate club at my local Uni made up of professors, scholars, authors and so on. A typical night after or debates/club meets usually finds us afterwards at local club where we can have intellectual conversations about these topics. Any nearby wanderer who gets sucked in, usually is ill equipped to take on folks well versed in cognitive dissonance and bias lists as found here:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases</a></p>

<p>Using the Socratic Method of constantly asking questions to get to the heart of any matter usually suffices as an initial redpill. I never do shit dickishly like you presume because in the idiocracy, most cant handle books and videos from scholars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, am I supposed to be impressed that you&#39;re not a slob?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you&#39;re supposed to realize how your assumptions keep being proven wrong, how stereotyping is bullshit but at the same time how even though I withheld my stereotypes about you, in the end you still pulled off all the Saul Alinsky tactics for brainwashing cultural marxists</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you take care of yourself, but you still have a neckbeard point of view</p>

<p>&quot;neckbeard&quot; lol....there it is. Smh. </p>

<p>Til studying facts, truth, reading books, is &quot;neckbeard&quot;. Congrats on keying in exactly on Rules for Radicals</p>

<p>Yes this is typical of people who cannot do research and have short western attention span syndrome. Actually I can supply you with about 5 extra videos all of which cover the founders, organizations, history, and links to Germany.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wrong, Marxism has actually evolved under different name, most currently Post Modernism, its founders which came to the U.S. and have entered into various educational institutions liek Yale, Princeton, Berkeley and many others.</p>

<p>As a mater of fact, you can go and read anything by David Horowitz who&#39;s parents were Marxists/Post Modernists, he was raised around these groups of people, and he factually outlines how this has all infiltrated into Western education system, media, tech, and so on. Brilliant books and highly recommended</p>

<p>The difference being is I have lived and have Grandparents from San Fran (inverness area retired), grew up in Chicago, parents from Europe, lived out there for a year and have been out there dozens of times, so my context is different from &quot;Just SoCal&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;...The situation of the majority of men, enlightened by true brotherly enlightenment, at present crushed by the deceit and cunning of usurpers, who are forcing them to ruin their own lives — this situation is terrible and appears hopeless.</p>

<p>Only two issues present themselves, and both are closed. One is to destroy violence by violence, by terrorism, dynamite bombs and daggers as our Nihilists and Anarchists have attempted to do, to destroy this conspiracy of Governments against nations, from without; the other is to come to an agreement with the Government, making concessions to it, participating in it, in order gradually to disentangle the net which is binding the people, and to set them free. Both these issues are closed. Dynamite and the dagger, as experience has already shown, only cause reaction, and destroy the most valuable power, the only one at our command, that of public opinion.</p>

<p>The other issue is closed, because Governments have already learnt how far they may allow the participation of men wishing to reform them. They admit only that which does not infringe, which is non-essential; and they are very sensitive concerning things harmful to them — sensitive because the matter concerns their own existence. They admit men who do not share their views, and who desire reform, not only in order to satisfy the demands of these men, but also in their own interest, in that of the Government. These men are dangerous to the Governments if they remain outside them and revolt against them — opposing to the Governments the only effective instrument the Governments possess — public opinion; they must therefore render these men harmless, attracting them by means of concessions, in order to render them innocuous (like cultivated microbes), and then make them serve the aims of the Governments, i.e., oppress and exploit the masses.</p>

<p>Both these issues being firmly closed and impregnable, what remains to be done?</p>

<p>To use violence is impossible; it would only cause reaction. To join the ranks of the Government is also impossible — one would only become its instrument. One course therefore remains — to fight the Government by means of thought, speech, actions, life, neither yielding to Government nor joining its ranks and thereby increasing its power.</p>

<p>This alone is needed, will certainly be successful.</p>

<p>And this is the will of God, the teaching of Christ. There can be only one permanent revolution — a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.</p>

<p>How is this revolution to take place? Nobody knows how it will take place in humanity, but every man feels it clearly in himself. And yet in our world everybody thinks of changing humanity, and nobody thinks of changing himself.&quot; ~ Lev Tolstoy, On Anarchy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They learned a lot from the French revolution. One of the things I was saying all the way back to the primaries was if trump supporters and Sanders supporters ever United against the ruling elite we would have a true revolution. </p>

<p>Yes, of course the far right won&#39;t be able to because there&#39;s just fundamentally such a difference in too many things that can&#39;t be looked at. But thats such a small minority of the country (unlike what msm is trying to portray). </p>

<p>Let&#39;s unite and topple the elite. We can sit down and figure out how to best both limit the government AND make what is there work for the people as a whole and not the select few, later. We can work out details after we&#39;ve taken back control. </p>

<p>It&#39;s going to take things like a general strike. It&#39;s going to take things like mass boycotting. It&#39;s going to take a strong local community that can support each other during a short period of economic struggle. Because this stuff costs Americans money in the short term. This is the single greatest reason they want you living paycheck to paycheck. If you can&#39;t put a months wages away you can&#39;t keep yourself up. If too many people are in that situation they won&#39;t want to risk losing everything for something that is likely to fail the first few times. </p>

<p>Nah son.</p>

<p>There is no fascist message to donald

<p>Your the ones being brainwashed and it’s not “the rich” in general, it’s a certain group of the elites at a very high level who operate as organized crime.</p>

<p>You’ve correctly identified that they want us to fight.</p>

<p>What you haven’t realized is they do not support trump and are in fact afraid as hell of him.</p>

<p>Racism?</p>

<p>Your full of if. Concern about illegal immigration is not racism.</p>

<p>It’s not.</p>

<p>The real psy op is the idea that the cabal your referring to actually can control you and that the future isn’t bright.</p>

<p>This whole idea that automation is going to cause a massive struggle is total nonsense.</p>

<p>It’s not. The free market will sort that out just fine as it always has.</p>

<p>The economy is purposely crashed in order to buy up assets at a fire sale. They are just trying to convince us that the next crash is inevitable so they can attempt to implement communism/global governance.</p>

<p>It won’t work.</p>

<p>Also your example of outright lies from conservative media is nonsense.</p>

<p>No one knows how many illegal aliens may be voting but your a complete idiot if you don’t think many of them are.</p>

<p>Its extremely easy to get a license as in illegal immigrant and then your registered to vote.</p>

<p>There’s a damn seperate entrance at the rev in most states for immigrants.</p>

<p>They are given massive leeway with documentation. I’ve seen this with my own eyes.</p>

<p>You can buy all the fake documents you need to become a register voter.</p>

<p>You read websites like snopes and self refer to your own outlets to prove conservative media is lieing.</p>

<p>You can’t disprove a claim without evidence and there’s no hard proof that 3 million illegals are not voting. </p>

<p>The claim being made is that there is evidence that indicates around 3 million illegals <strong>may be</strong> voting,</p>

<p>You can debunk something that could be happening by saying there is not yet evidence for it.</p>

<p>The fact is, 90% of the media elites are absurdly against donald trump to a point of complete absurdity.</p>

<p>And you are all so brainwashed out there that you think handing out the olive branch of peace is calling right wingers deluded racists who don’t “know any better”.</p>

<p>If you understood economics you’d understand how this whole system works.</p>

<p>The right wing is fundamentally correct about the economy in its basic principles</p>

<p>The uniparty deep state takes away the wrong regulations and structures tax cuts in the wrong way to discredit the fundamental economic truth that a low tax low but smart regulation environment lifts all boats and will lead to economic growth and stability that continues.</p>

<p>That’s why the right is the punching bag, because the fundamental economic truths are on the right.</p>

<p>So theirs this injection of  racism and wedge issues into the right and a ton of psy ops operating to make the right appear racist.</p>

Otherwise I have no opinion on anything else because I know in the end it doesn&#39;t matter. Capitalist? Socialist? Who cares, in the end they want to start a New World Order which will be like nothing we&#39;ve ever seen before. The news is designed to program the masses, not to inform them.

    <div class="md"><p>Anarchism is the most essential and pure form of Liberalism. There are four major poles, Leftism (Progressive Egalitarianism), Rightism (Traditional Meritocracy), Individualism/Liberalism, and Collectivism/Authoritarianism. </p>

<p>Anarchism is the furthest extreme you can reach at the Liberal, Individualist pole. If you mix some Rightism in there, you get Anarcho-Capitalism, and if you mix some Leftism in there, you get final stage Communism that people say has never been reached, a stateless, voluntarist society. Either way, anyone who sees everyone as an individual, and doesn&#39;t draw ingroup/outgroup distinctions between their own group and other groups, is a Liberal in the end. </p>

<p>The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become. </p>

<p>With respect to the legality of secession in this country, I assume when you refer to the “Jefferson Davis case” and Cynthia Nicoletti’s excellent book on so-called the trial of the century that wasn’t—so called <em>because it never happened</em>.  So we’ll never know how some courts might have ruled in his specific situation 150 years ago.</p>

<p>But we <em>do</em> know that unilateral secession is patently unconstitutional (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v%2E_White"><em>Texas v. White</em></a>) and therefore, yes, treasonous.</p>

So what do you think is more likely, ancient pervert sky dumbledore taking out his trapped-in-the-closet self hatred on hundreds of generations of his animate toys, or speciation is a thing, apes got smarter over millennia, and we&#39;re just particularly smart, sturdy agile animals, and like all animals some of us like sucking dick whether we got one or not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t agree less. You are wrong that they want to kill a bunch of us off, as there will be no way to sustain them all with automation incoming. The automation argument is way overblown. The very reason they are pursuing this type of mass immigration into the West is because they need more people than the native population is providing them through natural birthrates. You can&#39;t sustain the Capitalist concept of infinite growth with a shrinking population. And you can&#39;t sustain our semi-socialistic state programs with a shrinking population either. </p>

<p>You are obviously correct that both the Democrats and the Republicans are Liberals. They both want neoliberal deregulated markets, and corporate control. But the people on the Right who are in support of the Republicans or in support of Conservative Inc. are all lemmings, which I&#39;m sure is clear from your side. The only problem is you are all lemmings as well. You&#39;ve read the situation that they want a mass conflagration, decimating all sides to reduce population. This is very, very far off. They have hijacked the most successful countries that they could, (the West), and gained control of our financial system. Their goal is to bust apart and deconstruct Western, European, American, and White identity until they no longer exist. Their goal is to slowly bring in more and more migrants until they constitute a majority of the population in the Western world, all while making taboo the very concept of a White country, by calling it &quot;White privilege&quot;, or &quot;White supremacy&quot;. By doing this, they will come into full and final control over some of the most developed areas on the planet. </p>

<p>Remember, all they care about is money. And 1 dollar is worth 1 dollar, no matter your race, your nationality, your language, your culture, etc. The money powers have no incentive at all to preserve any culture, any national heritage, any ethnic line. From the Capitalist point of view, these are arbitrary barriers to the free movement of Capital and Resources. If you are a Capitalist and you sell, say, socks, you would have to advertise in a dozen languages to successfully sell in Europe. At every national border, you will have to deal with tariff and inspection, in the absence of free trade. Like I said before, you will need different packing and advertisements for the local language. All of this badly constrains the vision of Globalist Corporatist Capitalism. Their answer to this problem, is mass migration. They believe that by pumping our Western nations full of foreigners, and then encouraging us to mix, and encouraging Whites to drop all racial identity, while encouraging all migrants or minorities to have a strong racial identity, they are clearly trying to subsume the traditional West into their financial system, by way of national, ethnic, and cultural dilution. </p>

<p>You see that they are trying to sow the seeds of conflict. What you can&#39;t see is that they are trying agitate all have-nots, against all haves, rather than equally agitating both sides against each other. This is the classic Marxist technique, which is why I call Marxism &quot;Agitationism&quot;. They want to turn racial minorities against Whites. Now you may say they want to turn Whites against minorities. But it is completely taboo to say anything negative, true or not, about a minority in this society. It is actively taboo. Whereas speaking negatively and generalizing about Whites is not only tolerated, it is actively viewed as virtuous, and a sign that you are &quot;woke&quot;. They want to turn sexual minorities against majorities. You may say that they want straights to turn against LGBT and Trans as well, but speaking ill about either of these groups in any type of public context will have you branded a transphobe, a homophobe, a bigot, probably a sexist, and will have you fired from your job. Whereas if you are an LGBT or Trans activist, you have 100% free reign to say absolutely whatever you want about Straights or Christians. </p>

<p>If what you believed was true, they would have open season, they would tolerate the bitter speech from both sides, and try to reach a fever pitch that would end in massive conflict. But instead, they tolerate and even encourage minorities from all categories becoming tribal and radicalized against their majority counterparts, and silence and shame and ostracize any opposition to this creeping change. </p>

<p>Are you aware of the Cultural Revolution in China? Do you believe that Mao&#39;s government was agitating both sides, and that they wanted everyone to fight? Because the real truth was that they radicalized one side to get rid of the side that they didn&#39;t want around anymore. And it is clear from the stance of the mainstream media, the corporations, the celebrities, nearly every establishment politician on both sides, that the elites in society have sided with the Racial Minorities over the Whites, sided with the Women over the Men, sided with the Atheists and the Muslims over the Christians, sided with the LGBT community over the heterosexual population. And it is because this country is a glass, a glass that was already full when this Globalist Corporatist Capitalist element came into power here. They would like to fill this glass with their essence. But before they can do that, they need to pour out what was already there, they need to create room. What was already there was what they have dubbed &quot;The Patriarchy&quot;, aka Classical Western Civilization. White, Christian societies with socially conservative values and led by traditional families. This is the only element in the West that the Capitalist elites have it out for. This is very clear from all of their propaganda.</p>

<p>The White, native populations of Europe and North America WILL need to resist at some point, or else Globalist Corporatist Capitalism will displace us from all of our lands, overwriting our culture with Consumerism. And once they have finished their project in the West, they will keep spreading &quot;Multiculturalism&quot;, AKA &quot;Corporate Consumerism&quot; around the rest of the world as well, ruining the rest of the beautiful and unique nations in this world, not just the White European ones. If Globalist Corporatist Capitalism was starved of the mass migration which is its lifeblood, for even 20 years, the whole system would collapse. </p>

<p>And it just kills me how badly Leftists have been gaslighted and tricked. They claim they are against Capitalism and the Corporations, but then they shill for every single last issue that the Capitalists and the Corporations need them to shill to survive. Whether it is Open Borders or Mass Migration, or anti-Nationalism, or support for Amnesties, all of these are being presented to you by the mass media as moral imperatives because the mass media is owned by Big Finance, and these are financial imperatives for them. Have you never asked yourself why the establishment politicians from both the Democrats and the Republicans want amnesty and immigration reform? Think of how many taxpayers they can add to the economy with the stroke of a pen. Think of how many consumers of mass produced corporate goods can be brought into the economic zone. </p>

<p>You have some good insights, but you have misread the situation. And you are naive to believe that CNN and MSNBC and the other Leftist media is less compromised than the Right wing mainstream media like Fox News and Breitbart. There&#39;s a very real reason that the real Right, meaning the Alt-Right and everything further Right than it, is despised by both the establishment Leftists and Rightists. And you called it out yourself, both the Left and &quot;Right&quot; are fundamentally Liberals. Whereas as the Real Right is not Liberal. The Real Right has been in exile for decades as taboo, and so the furthest Right thing that remained within the Overton Window become considered to be &quot;Right wing&quot;. But the truth is that the further Right thing that remained was Conservatism, or spoken more plainly, &quot;Status-Quo-ism&quot;. But the true Nature of the Left is Revolutionary/Progressive. The Left brings change. The true Nature of the Right is Reactionary/Traditional. The Right undoes Leftist change and rolls back society to a previous state. The &quot;Conservatives&quot; are Centrists, who, like I said, appear to be Right wing when everything further Right than them is banned as taboo. The establishment even supports Antifa from a moral standpoint. The only group in this entire country who have no institutional power whatsoever, who are in possible threat of being on the wrong side of public vigilantism and overt racism, are Reactionary Whites, especially Reactionary White males. The resistance to the trend is grassroots, and that resistance (the Alt-Right and everything further Right than it) is slandered and derided by polite Corporate society, Left and Right, at every single opportunity, because it is the last movement that isn&#39;t on board with Neoliberalism, Globalism, and Multicultural Consumerism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very simple. When White people mix with non-White people, the baby comes out the race of the non-White parent. You must notice people that are even slightly Black, like Stephen Curry or Lonzo Ball, identify as Black. This is because Whites have recessive genetics. Blacks are aware of this too, many speak of this. Think of a glass of clear water, and then imagine pouring a little bit of ink in. Even though the solution is part clear water, and part ink, the entire appearance of the water will be inky. Water in this case would be recessive to ink, in the way that Whiteness to non-Whiteness. Mixed children end up adopting the group identity of their PoC side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has absolutely nothing to do with any special quality of Whiteness. We just ARE White. We were born this way. Every single &quot;kind&quot; on Earth has a self-preservation instinct. We want to live. We want to survive. We want to pass down territory that we inherited to more of our kind, in the hopes that they will reproduce as well, thus keeping the link alive. Each of the human races is a beautiful and unique sub-species of Homo Sapiens, and each deserve preservation, in the same way we would for animals. </p>

<p>Would you ever ask a Native American what is so special about being their particular kind, that they should need reservations? Why should they want to preserve their biological form for future generations of the world to be able to experience and know, why should they want to preserve some modicum of connection to their ancestral culture? What quality about being Native American is worth preserving, worth resisting the biological and cultural mixture with the rest of the world? Why should Jews care about being Jewish, why does Israel close its borders and resist intermixing? </p>

<p>Every people wants to live, wants to preserve their kind, maintain and pass on a territory. This has been the human way for all time. The problem is, a coalition of all the other races, plus Whites afflicted with an Avatar/Dances with Wolves syndrome, plus Jews, has turned against White/Western civilization, and means to destroy it through colonization, habitat displacement, and dilution. I&#39;m not saying this is necessarily malicious or premeditated. For most of these people, it is a natural instinct to dispossess the threat you perceive in your ecology if possible. </p>

That is like saying of Dobermans and Rottweilers and Pitbulls and German Sherpherds, &quot;hey, they&#39;re all dogs, who cares if we mix them all together&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Why? The &quot;breeds&quot; point is a fact. If you can&#39;t see with your eyes that Black Africans and Scandinavian Whites are two different breeds of human sapiens, also known as two different &quot;races&quot;, then I don&#39;t know what to tell you. But if you believe that if it&#39;s true that there are multiple human races/breeds, then there can be no harmony between them, no sharing of the planet, then that is something to examine in your own psyche. </p>

<p>I know a lot of people with your exact reaction. Also see a lot of people with that reaction online. They basically react that if it were true that there were any real differences, then the only choice left would be conflict, war or something. That I don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>The differences in human types are real. That is a fact. That in no way means that we should do anything bad to anyone, any more than discovering that there were real genetic differences between Rottweilers and Dobermans should cause someone to go postal. It&#39;s not a bad thing, it&#39;s a beautiful thing! I&#39;m a bit of a weeaboo, I enjoy Asian culture, food, and anime is a guilty pleasure of mine. I would be devastated if Japan was under the assault of mass, colonization level immigration, to the point where the character of the nation, and the future of their biological kind were brought into question, just as I am concerned about the same in England right now. </p>

<p>I just personally see no reason to doubt that someone could see the obvious, the biological difference between different sub-species of human beings, and that they would still be able to be friendly, civil, and cooperative with those people. They are still human beings after all.</p>

<p>For me, it&#39;s because I don&#39;t see the point in obsessing over these differences <em>except to create conflict.</em> People should be able to mix as they please. White people aren&#39;t going to be rubbed out any time soon. Same goes for black and brown people. There&#39;s just so MANY of us, goddammit, it&#39;s pointless for you to be so obsessed over these &quot;breeds&quot; as you call them. It&#39;s just a very myopic view, in my opinion. </p>

<p>But knowing that you are English puts it into some context, at least. I&#39;m in the US, race relations are a bit different here. There was legal segregation in my state less than a century ago. So you understand why I find the idea of keeping races separated to be abhorrent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You anti-Whites have no trouble defining White when complaining about White privilege or White supremacy. I can easily define White. A White person is a descendant of the natural peoples of Europe. This includes many sub-races, like the Nordics, the Slavs, the Anglos, the Mediterraneans, etc. In a certain way, we don&#39;t get to choose what we are perceived as. One of the best ways to determine if someone is White, is to show that person to a PoC and ask them whether or not you are White. Maybe one day we will need to shrink it down, but right now, I&#39;m alright with White being anyone and everyone that PoC want to target and harass as being racist, even though they are openly racist versus Whites, as being colonizers, even as they have freshly entered our country and do not mean to leave anytime soon, call us misogynists, even as we have set up the most tolerant societies on Earth, and they want to bring in peoples from countries where women have to be wrapped like mummies and gays are thrown off of buildings. Whoever the PoC see as White and want to silence and oppress and shame, we will accept you as a brother at least in the short term. We can hash out who goes where once we&#39;ve weathered this storm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best explanation i can come up with is somebody who&#39;s white and was born in a white dominated society, or a white person who doesn&#39;t know their heritage making them just the colour white without race really considered.  White is self identifiable all whites are multi cultured so its your choice if you want to be white, a parents ethnicity, or the ethnicity of further generations back of your family.  I personally identified as white until 21 because I never met my real black dad.. I&#39;m white but somehow sometimes people think I&#39;m black or Mexican or italian or Spanish, bloody ridiculous, once I met my real dad and tried to sort of embrace my tribal type culture I&#39;m now instantly europeon-maori which basicly means I went from white to white-bolack, I believe all cultures are great and we should mix less in some countries more in others.  White countries are embracing the mix but sadly also making it PC you can&#39;t argue against it without looking like a racsist... Yet in any other country they can argue against these social ideas and nobody sees anything racsist about it... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal choice based on who you are, I don&#39;t believe its just genetic as very few people who consider themselves white would be accepted as white, as a previous post said there&#39;s supposedly two cultural origins of a true white person ?well we all know that&#39;s not true realistically, but that also depends on your point of view.. As I say its personal preference if your white skinned I believe you can choose your white due to your culture, genes, both, or even neither.  As I said personally I grew up considered myself white cultured cause I grew up in a Europeon run country and my skin was white.. That was it.  When I met my dad as an adult and looked back on my life, friends, the things we did, and said, the trends etc I grew up in more of a black culture and learnt to embrace that in a positive manner also. Now I am white-black or black-white for the anally retentive PC types.</p>

No. Racist doesn&#39;t mean that you hate anybody, it means that you have broken through the corporate/progressive brainwashing and have realized the obvious: Race is real. Race is not a social construct. We are all very advanced primates on a rock orbiting a ball of fire hurtling through space. We have a genetic interest in staying alive.

    <div class="md"><p>You are deeply uninformed on this issue, and your entire perception on it comes from living in your bubble in the West. You think the billion Chinese don&#39;t care about race? You don&#39;t think the ethnonationalist countries of Japan, South Korea and Israel don&#39;t care about race? And even in the West, you don&#39;t think Blacks and Hispanics care about race? Hell, even White progressives are obsessed with race, constantly calling out &quot;White privilege&quot; and &quot;White supremacy&quot;. African Americans are obsessed with race, they perceive everything through a racial lense. They literally have a movement called Black Lives Matter. The Hispanic identity movement is literally called La Raza, which, translated to English, means &quot;The Race&quot;. </p>

<p>If Japan doesn&#39;t care about race, then why don&#39;t they have multiculturalism? Why do they use the power of law to keep their country Asian? If Mexico doesn&#39;t care about race, then why do they have a southern border wall, brutal deportations of illegal immigrants into Mexico, and immigration laws that purposely protect the ethnic balance in the country of supermajority Mestizo? If Israel and the Jews don&#39;t care about race, why are they deporting 40,000 Blacks in the country, right now! Google it! Everyone in the world, all other races and cultures, and even animal species and even plant species, care about providing a stable and sustainable territory for THEIR KIND. It implies no hate to anyone else!</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing that you would be against the European colonization of Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries, right? You realize that the Africans rejected us because of our race, right? We were different than them, we arrived and tried to find a new life on this new land, filled with opportunity, and they fought us and never accepted us, and eventually we had to leave the continent almost completely. Did the Africans not care about race? </p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t live in a bubble. I&#39;m with the majority of the planet that thinks: &quot;If you&#39;re not an asshole, you&#39;re alright.&quot; Anywhere I&#39;ve ever traveled this has been the norm. People are surprisingly accepting, no matter your culture, if you&#39;re a not a dick and are respectful.   </p>

<p>And when the races mix, so what? How is that bad at all? You can&#39;t give out one single explanation that is rooted in fact and not feelings. Sorry you&#39;re such a snowflake and can&#39;t accept that people <em>really don&#39;t give a shit about race</em>.  </p>

<p>If anyone lives in a bubble, it&#39;s you. You live in a bubble thinking your world view is obviously the right one, and that, since everyone of your white supremacist buddies agrees with you, it must be the norm. To anyone not living in your off-the-rails worldview and with a healthy worldview, what I say is obvious as fuck: no one cares about race very much. They care about making their children learn, putting food on the table, and taking care of their community. If you travel and expose yourself to more of the world, it&#39;s so obvious.  </p>

<p><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/anthropology/21a-226-ethnic-and-national-identity-fall-2011/">The data shows</a> we are rapidly approaching a time where the international identity is stronger than national identity. And ethnic identity is already weaker than ethnic identity in most of the developed world. By the time I&#39;m an old fuck, most of the world will have a global internet culture. If you just take a look at all the subcultures that the internet has created, you can see that they do not live within borders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve traveled, far and wide, actually, and I&#39;ve exposed myself to a respectable portion of the world. And what I have learned, is that anyone who isn&#39;t infected by White Liberalism cares very much about their people and their in-group identity. This includes American minorities, and people in countries I&#39;ve been to all over the world. I recently spent some time in Japan, and let me tell, you those, people definitely care about race. </p>

<p>If African Americans &quot;don&#39;t give a shit about race&quot;, why are the always prattling on about it? Why are they always saying Black Lives Matter, and accusing us of White Supremacy if they don&#39;t see race? If Hispanics aren&#39;t interested in race, why do they have groups called La Raza, the Race. Why is Israel deporting 40,000 Blacks right now, and have Arabs there in open air ghettos? Why do White South African farmers live in armed compounds with 24/7 security? I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all because these people couldn&#39;t care less about race. </p>

<p>And no, the argument against race mixing is NOT emotional, it is purely fact based and pragmatic. It is you who are making the emotional appeal. We are saying that we should act in the same pattern as the other human races, and the entire animal kingdom, and relearn to value our existence as a unique and distinct kind, and seek to reproduce more like us. This is the cycle of nature. This is what all living things everywhere seek to achieve as the first and best case scenario. </p>

<p>Sure.  I&#39;m a programmer.  The ways in which software is hacked grows due to incredibly complicated and time consuming tasks by the greatest software hackers.  If one can develop the algorithm to automate this &quot;complicated and time consuming&quot; task, then it no longer is complicated or time consuming.  There is officially a procedural way in which the flaw is exposed and utilized.  </p>

<p>This is the state of the art in &quot;automated hacking.&quot;  I&#39;ve seen no indication whatsoever that an AI has been creative in the sense it added a new method of hacking to it&#39;s repertoire.  If it did, then this really was sourced by the algorithm of the programmer who designed this AI.  The intelligence and creativity is in the programmed code behind the AI that seemingly broke through.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>AI has created it&#39;s own language.
The programmer created a program creative enough to only require the relationship between words for the passing of information between the agents.  In this way, all languages are created but there really is limitless combinations, ways to point a string of characters to a realer entity.  Robots are free to choose whatever they&#39;d like and given a cluster of them one naturally rises to be most useful.</p>

<p>AI has created art indistinguishable from human art.
It has no idea of the symbolic art in which humans are capable of.  If it displayed symbolism in it&#39;s produced work it was only because it copied the human created templates.</p>

<p>AI can compose music as well as a human.
I&#39;m a programmer.  I&#39;m also a musician.  Played trumpet for 7 years.  </p>

<p>Obviously an AI cannot make vocal music like this:

It can&#39;t write the <strong>novel combination of meaningful words</strong> (poetry)
Nor can it <strong>vocalize</strong> them with the wondrous power of human vocal cords</p>

<p>And there isn&#39;t any indication whatsoever an &#39;intelligent&#39; music producing robot can make an <strong>instrumental</strong> like this:<br/>

<p>I&#39;ve heard some robotic compositions.  They essentially copy and sometimes merge basic templates from repetitive songs, or if skilled, rearrange the notes of an orchestral piece while maintaining harmony.  </p>

<p>Basically they piece together musical shards (phrases, chords, passages etc.) of human musical genius.  They haven&#39;t added any genius to the pool of music for instance.  Nothing game changing.  Nothing unique in the sense of an addition to a genre or a positive mutation of one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes, they are in the middle, but they also aren&#39;t White. That&#39;s the point. As for why are White genes recessive? That&#39;s a good question. Why when you mix White paint and Black paint does the paint take on the character of the Black in a more dominant way than the White? It just seems that melanin, the coarse and curly hair, are all &quot;stronger features&quot;, versus our more delicate features, and so they dominate. But that is all my layman&#39;s speculation, I don&#39;t understand the science in a way that I could explain that, unfortunately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just your perspective though, not some fundamental aspect of genetics like dominance or whatever.  You notice the black features because you are white and everyone around you is white.  If you were an African in Africa and saw a mixed person you&#39;d notice the white features because they are different from baseline and probably tell yourself that white features are dominant. Look the, the hair curls are looser, and the skin is lighter, etc. </p>

Let&#39;s put it this way u have a glass full of ink... You add some water and its still black as farrk as soon as a tiny bit of ink is added to water it is tainted(the colour not with a disease) and the child will most likely not identify as white even if the white cultures are dominant in his family line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Race is not an actual classification of people. Would you care to talk at all about what is meant when people say, &quot;Race is a social construct&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who say that race is a social construct are no different than Flat Earthers. The Human Genome Project in 2003 mapped the human genome, finally proving what people have been able to obviously see with their own two eyes, that there are genetic differences between the visually different groups such as Europeans, Africans, and Asians. Given that I&#39;ve gone outside before, and personally met Black people, Asian people, Indian people, and am myself a White person, I have seen proof in the existence of race.</p>

<p>Remember, race is a euphemism for sub-species. When dealing with animals, if two creatures are genetically similar enough to mate and consistently produce viable offspring, we consider them as belong to the same species. And when subgroups of this species become obviously distinct from each other, due to separation and adaptation to environment, we consider them to be different sub-species of the same species. If animals from one subgroup are distinguishable from one in another subgroup at a rate of 80% accuracy, they are sub-species of that larger species. </p>

<p>So here is my question for you. Can you tell a White person from a Black person accurately at least 8 out of 10 times? If so, then Blacks are a different sub-species of Homo Sapiens than Whites are. This difference we colloquially call &quot;Race&quot;. To imply that this genetic reality, caused by evolution and Darwinism, is only a social construct, is like saying &quot;God put the dinosaur bones there to test your faith&quot;, or &quot;the World is flat!&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one drop beliefs exist with White people for a reason. It is due to the absurdly recessive nature of our DNA. One drop of Black for example, does make the person what Canada would call, a &quot;visible minority&quot;. There is a part of the human brain dedicated to determining whether the creature that you are looking at, human or animal, is your kind. It calculates an estimated genetic differential between you. It&#39;s quite clear when looking at an animal that they are not a good reproductive fit, (which is the evolutionary pressure that created this process). When looking at other human sub-species, it is impossible for this part of the brain not to notice, along with the visual part of your brain, that this person is different in some way. Maybe they get treated worse because of it, like they had been by White conservatives, maybe they get babied and pampered and treated unnaturally better because of it, like they are by White progressives. But they <em>will</em> get some kind of special or different treatment, since no matter how much you lie to yourself, you notice that they are different. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Race is only as deep as the skin&quot; is a factually incorrect statement. Race is much, much deeper than that. Different races have different strengths, different weaknesses, unique genetic disorders they can get. Different races have different average levels of intelligence. Some human groups have DNA alleles that work off of an entirely different 2-repeat structure, rather than the 3-repeat structure used by most human groups. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24326626">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24326626</a></p>

<p>Are we all human? Of course. Does that mean we are all interchangeable and exactly the same? Definitely not. It isn&#39;t a cultural choice that the NBA is mostly Black. Blacks are superior to Whites athletically in contests of running and jumping. It&#39;s not like if a Black person were an Albino, that they would lose their predisposition to those physical advantages. Which is what would happen with your theory that race is only as important as skin color. </p>

<p>Do you understand how the different races came into being? We all shared a common ancestor, around 100,000 years ago or more, at some point, we split up, went different directions, and different groups of us found ourselves isolated in wildly different environments. Some found themselves in a harsh, icy world with months of darkness, (Europeans), some found themselves on an equally harsh plateau, with the sun glinting constantly in their eyes, (Asians), and some remained where our life began, in the equatorial Savannahs and Jungles (Africans). The reason that these groups are different today, is because very, very different things were need to thrive. This is how evolution works. </p>

<p>This is possible to observe in the human species without any prejudice and malice. It&#39;s just the truth. It&#39;s just taking what we all understand about evolution, which we apply to animals and understand is obviously true, and breaking away the last vestiges of creationism, this belief that all humans are exactly equal and the same, that race isn&#39;t real, and somehow, human beings weren&#39;t subject to evolution. This outlook will take will probably take decades if not hundreds of years to crack. But eventually people will have to accept the truth, that human beings evolved, just like all other living things on Earth. Especially now that we have access to genetic data, and this is no longer a theory but a fact, people will at some point have to accept it. </p>

<p>But, for example, Galileo&#39;s claims that the Earth revolved around the sun, and not the other way around, weren&#39;t accepted by the public at large for 200 years. This fact was only definitively proved in 2003 when the Human Genome Project successfully discovered how to map the human genome. And since then, they have definitely proved that groups that are visually distinct from each other are also genetically distinct from each, while being genetically similar among themselves. It&#39;s been 15 years since then. So by that metric, we still have 175 years until the world accepts this one. </p>

Minority races countries, their majority isn&#39;t being dilluded like white culture and told to accept everybody bring everybody in you go to an Asian country you&#39;ll never see a full street of white people and think &quot;wtf are we in america.&quot;  Whites slowly lose the majorities identity by slowly making the whites the minority, I&#39;m sure there are some cities and many towns already in white mans lands were whites are minorities already.  We are told all these things to let this keep going until we are fully mixed or we are bad people.. </p>

<p>Here in new Zealand we let Chinese come in and buy anything, an example is a chinese man my father met through real estate who has 100+ properties and many businesses just for one rich Chinese man, yet in china a Chinese can only purchase one property and an outsider cannot buy any property without strict guidelines I&#39;m sure, this one rule pushes them into everybody else&#39;s societies but keeps them very strong proud and the huge majority all minorities will never beat the majority although I&#39;m sure in nz kiwis are already a minority.. Also chinese have strict cultural beliefs and standards to sustain even in other countries, they will often live in tight knit communities, they have many Chinese communities were many don&#39;t socialise with non Chinese, they only employ Chinese and house Chinese with the ridiculous amount of housing and businesses they are buying from us.  It&#39;s also easy for them because they nearlu all get 0 interest loans through dodgy businees, money laundering and many more ways I havnt really looked into.  Very smart culture, we should all learn from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are one of the most educated cultures in the world, we should learn from them.  Just have to throw this in, Politically correct is a ridiculous term that basicly means to me..be fake, don&#39;t be honest about your opinions, don&#39;t joke.  Let&#39;s keep reality behind closed doors huh fellas.  Sounds like how the goverment officials are supposed to act because they keep a high level of standards.  Although we are being manipulated to act this way for no reason.  Be honest about who you are and what you think, tell your mate a joke about their race and laugh together turn this negativity to normal human interaction and social behaviour into positivity... Politically correct attacks people being honest or joking? How is that good they are making reality into a negative thing. We need to make it positive, I tell you a dumb joke about ur race, you say one back, we laugh(positive). Wtf happened to sticks and stones?  Seems like an step backwards from the original saying. Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will absolutely annihilate my weakened Psyche and destroy the world after crumbling all of society&#39;s pc wall&#39;s</p>

<p>Maybe for half working Mexicans in US, but not for refugees and migrants to Europe that have proven to stay on welfare and have kids that follow suit. </p>

<p>That’s economic destruction. </p>

<p>It is believed by conspiracy theorists that an overly large wave of refugees on welfare can crash the Euro economy and that politicians are paid off to make this happen while pushing ideals of multiculturalism and claiming as you did that we need to increase the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy is that we destabilized those countries, as well as places in Central and South America, to provide a migrant flow to our countries, run by elites who desperately need them to prop up our strained financial system. These people have no reason to come to us if their country is fine. Yet the USA needs 1 million LEGAL migrants every year to keep up with their GDP projections. They can&#39;t have a year where we don&#39;t get a million, or else someone&#39;s social security isn&#39;t getting paid. We are lighting fires just on the other side of 3rd world peoples, in the attempt, (and success), to drive them towards our borders. Where we have corrupt politicians like Merkel in Europe or basically the whole Establishment in both parties in US politics, waiting with open arms (and open borders) to let them in.

And I doubt migration can ever destroy a culture, I&#39;m from CA which is like the Mecca of migration, and no matter how disparate the culture, the first generation raised here integrates pretty much without fail. So unless you define those cultures by what the people practicing them look like, I doubt they&#39;ll all blend together anytime soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am also from CA, and I have seen our culture completely fall away and turn into nondescript consumer culture, and ethnically isolated neighborhoods that are clearly one race or another, with even billboards being in Spanish, etc. </p>

<p>Migration is almost always a major factor in what destroys a culture. Here is a list of mass migrations, where the migrants never assimilated into the host territory, eventually collapsing the host:</p>

<p>Quick account of groups never assimilating (not a comprehensive list)</p>

<p>Sea Peoples around Mediterranean (specifically Egypt) 2,000 bc. (little known fact, but the swarm migration of the Sea Peoples is actually what ended Ancient Egypt, and even collapsed Classical Greece)</p>

<p>Germans tribes in Roman Empire </p>

<p>Jews in Europe</p>

<p>Arabs who moved outside of Saudi Arabia to Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Libya</p>

<p>British in Australia</p>

<p>Chinese in Singapore</p>

<p>Germans who moved to Russia and lived there for 200 years (they moved back to Germany in 1917)</p>

<p>Whites in North America (meaning that we never assimilated to the Native Americans and completely destroyed their culture and their way of life, this is one of the perfect examples of what happens to a native host people if they let unfettered mass immigration come into their territory)</p>

<p>Anglo-saxons who moved to England in 6th ad.</p>

<p>Blacks in America (not meaning that they aren&#39;t integrated, but meaning that they still see themselves as Black, and probably always will. They haven&#39;t truly assimilated into the American fabric, they remain distinct. And I believe that there&#39;s no real way around that.)</p>

<p>Lastly, saying that Whiteness is socially constructed means that you are internalized a lot of bogus propaganda. Do you also believe that the category of &quot;East Asian&quot; is a social construct? Do you believe that &quot;Sub-Saharan African&quot; is a social construct? If you do... I&#39;m not sure what to say. But &quot;White European&quot; is no different. This is a biological categorization. Think of the difference between Asiatic Lions and African Lions. Think of the difference between Polar Bears, Grizzly Bears, and Black Bears. These differences are social constructs, they are biological realities. White European people are biologically and genetically different than for example, East Asian people, or Sub-Saharan African people. This is a fact. </p>

<p>The truth is that your biological kind, your species and race, along with your birth sex, are the only things in this WHOLE WORLD, that are NOT social constructs. These are hardwired, biological realities. It is your moral stance on these obvious and probable truths, your feelings of right and wrong about these facts, that are the social construct.</p>

(The first thing he’s going to do is probably kill his parents, friends, etc)</p>

<p>These are the people who say stuff like, “The worst thing you can do to help someone is say the words good job”. They don’t believe in rewards. The button can <em>only</em> represent the belief of punishment. Look what it did for them. They turned out ‘perfectly fine’, because someone <a href="https://i.imgur.com/K008j4l.jpg">rode, and pushed, and whipped them to “success”</a>.</p>

<p>What they fail to realize is you’re not them. They might enjoy masochism, but not everyone does (Hey there narcissists!) The problem is of course, we’re not given a chance to breathe and figure out what this best way for us to get around is. Because before we have a chance to catch our breath – one of those people with the whip is coming at us.</p>

<p>So, it’s immediately into a defensive posture. Leading to circular logic. Look it’s working! We beat people (press the punishment button) and the world doesn’t fall apart. Yeah, well, we never bothered to see what would happen if you stopped pressing the stupid button (or pressed a different button like “reward” instead of punishment).</p>

<p>Anyways, that was a lot of words to say what was summed up with “system failure”. People aren’t the problem. It’s a system that punishes people and then expects joy. We need a different “button” or belief. In other words – I don’t have a problem with you – I have a problem with your methods.</p>

<p>Make love, not war. Solutions not problems. It’s hard being the shepherd though when you’re a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDiRZ2xx9xI">bad mother</a> (and you <em>can</em> punish others). Just because you can doesn’t mean you should though. We all have <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vi9hJw8.jpg">names</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, well said and well thought out. I read a similar comment about moderates from both sides of the &quot;fence&quot; being set against one another. The increasing regularity of otherwise good, decent people being pushed and angered to the point of a violent reaction, not against the true instigators (on both sides) of this hatred, but against each other. </p>

<p>I really need to take some time to consider my own feelings over the last couple of years. To think about how neatly I have fallen into wanting to punish the rise in civil injustice recently, but instead of rallying together against the soiled roots, I just wanted to crush the fruits underfoot. </p>

<p>Thank you, sincerely.</p>

<p>There is very little struggle. It&#39;s much easier to survive as opposed to a few hundred years ago. Depression and suicide rates skyrocketing isn&#39;t a coincidence. We were designed/made/evolved to endure hardship, and there isn&#39;t much of any in America any longer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communists and anarchists have actual reasoned, logical positions and numerous literary works to back then up. The biggest right wing anti establishment movement in the US are the libertarians, who are basically anarcho-capitalists. Anarcho-capitalism is pretty much a bastardization of the original individualist anarchists i.e. Josiah Warren, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, etc., edited to conveniently serve capitalists. </p>

<p>The more I learn about their form of anarchism the more I see how bits and pieces have been left out of modern libertarianism to serve the elites. </p>

<p>From the perspective of &quot;the oligarchs are the enemy&quot; tentatively suggesting you read about these alternative ideologies is about as neutral as you can get. Neutrality doesn&#39;t mean supporting every ideology equally when some of those ideologies support the very oligarchy you&#39;re against. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I didn&#39;t. I explained how OP&#39;s post is still about as &quot;neutral&quot; as can be while positioning himself against the oligarchy. There is no real right wing ideology that stands against capitalism. American libertarianism just serves corporate interests. If you read the essay I linked you might notice the similarities between this Libertarianism and <em>actual</em> libertarian anarchism. You might notice that they differ in areas which benefit the elite. </p>

<p>The anarchist ideology expressed in the essay I linked is essentially what the right wing <em>should be</em> but isn&#39;t because by and large right wing ideology has become inseparable from capitalism (in the United States). </p>

<p>This whole discussion plays into right-left division anyway, when the point is that you should look into these ideas and learn rather than have this exact sort of knee jerk reaction when you perceive a slight against &quot;your side&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the craziest thing ever. It&#39;s like college football but with guns. </p>

<p>My best friend of over 30 years is very Liberal. He, his wife, and his kids marched in the Women&#39;s Right&#39;s parade today in Hicag. They have framed photos of MLK marching through Detroit in their house. They even went so far as to find out their son&#39;s schools policy on Transgender students before he (their son) started kindergarten. He believes that the second amendment should be abolished. And so on. </p>

<p>They are the most liberal people you will ever meet. </p>

<p>Me on the other hand? Not so much. I have guns, a truck, and vote Libertarian. I own a business and am against minimum wage and regulations. I think that PC/SJW culture is going to be the end of us all, don&#39;t bake the cake if you don&#39;t want to, and if you have a penis dangling between your legs use the fucking men&#39;s bathroom, and so on. </p>

<p>I&#39;m the biggest ass-hole redneck you will ever meet. </p>

<hr/>

<p>But we are best friends. For over 30 years. We will do anything for each-other. I could write a novel about all the nice things we and our families have done for each-other over the last few decades. </p>

<p>People can be different and still care about each-other. </p>

<p>So I agree 100%. This division is not &quot;real&quot; in any way. Someone or some entity is actively attempting to separate us based on very simple personal preferences. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Live your life as you see fit, focus your energy where you believe it&#39;s best used and most needed, and everyone should watch <em>The Fox and the Hound</em> one more time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>first of all, cutting 15,000 from your income of 70,000 is a huge chunk and could potentially make the business not worth the time as has been pointed out here. Do workers not have the option to not accept the job? No one is putting a gun to anyone&#39;s head and saying they have to work at this business. If the wage offered isn&#39;t enough, then people won&#39;t work there. If the job takes no skill, no effort, no education, and allows for benefits in scheduling, why should that job be the same price as a more demanding position elsewhere?  </p>

<p>Everyone seems to have this idea here of all businesspeople being greedy robber barons in million dollar estates, but in reality for most it&#39;s just another job. I feel like there&#39;s this attitude here that if an employee struggles it&#39;s a tragedy, but if a business struggles it&#39;s almost like they deserve it. Sometimes it can take years to be profitable, and it&#39;s a huge risk. I&#39;m not arguing in favor of mcdonald&#39;s here, I&#39;m talking about a small business. </p>

<p>In what world would an employee doing basic manual labor be paid the same as the person that took all the financial risk and put in most likely the most time? An economy with any upward mobility can&#39;t thrive in that environment. </p>

<p>1) You have a &quot;very simple&quot; job that you need to have done. In your eyes, this job is not worth very much pay whatsoever, because it&#39;s so basic.</p>

<p>2) You have a worker that you assign to this job. You want to pay him very very little.</p>

<p>3) That worker, however, is still a human being. It doesn&#39;t matter how little value you place on the work they&#39;re doing, they still need to be able to have food, shelter, and preferably some form of fulfillment.</p>

<p>4) Minimum wage, for a full-time worker is almost $10,000 below the poverty line. In most cities, it&#39;s below a living wage. People already have to work multiple jobs to stay afloat - paying less than that will literally work them to death. There are only so many hours available to work in a day.</p>

<p>5) If you&#39;re a business owner, and you have a job so trivial that you can&#39;t be bothered to pay a worker for it, <em>then you&#39;re a bad businessman</em>. Either add more responsibilities to the job so it holds more value in your eyes, or automate it. You can make profit without being the asshole who sees his workers as disposable costs, not as humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Your point is tangential. I wasn&#39;t talking about a brand new fast food restaurant, I was making a comparison between two established ones.</p>

<p>2) I wasn&#39;t yelling at corporations for being evil, I was saying that a large number of them are being stupid and causing self-harm and instability in the name of short term profits.</p>

<p>3) I&#39;ve helped out a number of friends and family members who started businesses. Some of them food-related, some of them not.</p>

<p>Higher wages don&#39;t squash small businesses. Do you know what <em>does</em> stop a new business before it can get off the ground?</p>

<p>Incompetent ownership. An owner who believes that they&#39;re a &quot;businessman&quot; now, and so should be raking in the dough... And so keeps the profits instead of turning around and putting them back into the business.</p>

<p>If you think your business is failing because of the cost of labor, then you have a <em>lot</em> more problems on your hands than the minimum wage.</p>

<p>4) And you&#39;ve conveniently managed to ignore the entire point of my post: it&#39;s not just about your wallet growing fatter, and you can&#39;t simply treat workers like a cost - they&#39;re people. Treat them well, and they will treat you well. (That applies to small businesses, as well. Your workers are going to go well above and beyond for you if they feel respected and part of the team, rather than feeling like their job is just something they show up for so they can pay rent.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why <a href="/u/erietemperance">/u/erietemperance</a> even brings up the minimum wage because there are plenty of ways that businesses from huge corporations to small business already pay workers both less than minimum wage and less than what they even deserve.</p>

<p>Unpaid internships, monthly stipend internships, 1099&#39;ing instead of hiring employees, outsourcing overseas to country with no min. wage and lower cost of living (ie, India and Pakistan for coding and places like Mexico and Phillipines for call centers, etc), paying under the table for illegal immigrants, etc. </p>

<p>Then lets look at wage theft and how much employers already steal free labor from employees
<a href="https://i.redd.it/grnr8kxbl6zz.jpg">https://i.redd.it/grnr8kxbl6zz.jpg</a></p>

<p>So any employer whining about the minimum wage is either dishonest or just a worse businessman than all the others that have plenty of work-arounds to squeeze more blood out of their employees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said pay as little as possible. There&#39;s something called benefit-cost ratio. If a job costs more than it&#39;s benefit, it will cease to exist. At a price as high as double what it is now, you can kiss between 25-50% of jobs goodbye. They just aren&#39;t demanding enough to warrant that pay. It&#39;s not a small business owner&#39;s fault that our government doesn&#39;t provide single payer healthcare. It&#39;s not their fault that people have no financial education of any form, and they aren&#39;t learning skills that have value in the new marketplace. And it&#39;s not their fault that automated workforces are already becoming cheaper than human labor. People laugh at the coal miners and cab drivers that are upset with market innovations, but forget that when jobs like checkout person become obsolete. You will destroy these jobs by raising the minimum wage, flat out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re pulling double from. Just what it would take to get it out of poverty range? If so, that&#39;s fair.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no argument with what you just said. You&#39;re correct, it would cause jobs to either require more skill, or replace them with automation. From my first post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either add more responsibilities to the job so it holds more value in your eyes, or automate it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not necessarily a bad thing. The current trend of &quot;brainless&quot; labor, where workers are paid very little to do one single task over and over, is unsustainable.</p>

<p>It worked just fine during the industrial revolution, when society was moving too fast to care about the labor, and factory jobs couldn&#39;t yet be replaced.</p>

<p>As we&#39;ve moved out of that era, however, the mentality has invaded schools, service jobs, and hell, even politics. <em>But it&#39;s not tenable.</em></p>

<p>What if - just what if - we instituted a universal basic income (or even just basic housing and a minimal allowance), and healthcare. Combine that with a higher minimum wage and progresses in automation.</p>

<p>Obviously that&#39;s not going to happen overnight, but look at the end result:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>those in poverty no longer have to work multiple soul-crushing jobs to stay above water, and can instead focus on learning new skills / bettering themselves. (Not all of them will, but the ones who would could actually have an opportunity to.)</p></li>
<li><p>The jobs that are less would require common sense, productivity, and more skill... But would be consequently rewarding, and would allow even a &quot;basic&quot; job to elevate one&#39;s quality of life.</p></li>
<li><p>For those who can hack it, there would be more openings in the technology corridor. Or they could try and write the next American novel, or hell, try and live-stream their way to fame.</p></li>
<li><p>For the small business owner, taking this philosophy means you have more competent workers who you can put more trust in - they&#39;re less likely to completely screw everything up. You get a more reliable workforce, they&#39;re happier with their lives, and the customers receive better service.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So... I fully acknowledge that things aren&#39;t going to work out that way, and it would take some dramatic changes in our society for it to be possible.</p>

<p>But we both agree on the outcome of such a change, long term. Maybe we disagree on whether that outcome is positive or not; I&#39;m not sure. Personally, I think that it&#39;s a change in society that&#39;s at least worth trying to do what little things you can to help improve the chances of it coming to light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you could at least retract saying half the population is &quot;at minimum borderline narcissistic and lack any empathy&quot; that would be a good start to finding a common point to have an actual discussion. You&#39;re talking about people who for the most part are middle class and just trying to make a living, not Jeff Bezos.</p>

<p>I think long term, automation will be a good thing for humanity; but in the interim, it will cause damage to the middle and working class. We&#39;re talking about raising the minimum wage TODAY, not in the future where every possible good thing that could happen did already. In this paradigm, raising the minimum wage does little to stem the tide and could actually work to increase the disparity between classes in the short term. The only real beneficiary is large corporations, as small businesses will die before they can afford automation or before the tech develops enough to become affordable. </p>

<p>As for the double figure, Federal minimum wage is currently 7.25 (which is admittedly low). Most propositions I&#39;ve seen propose an increase to between 15-20 dollars. That&#39;s more than double the federal minimum wage. I&#39;d much prefer an increase tethered to inflation. When inflation occurs, minimum wage goes up. That&#39;s fair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve probably got a point about the current effects of a wage hike. I will say, though, that I&#39;ve never seen a proposition for a $20 minimum wage. The extreme ones are at $15, and most seem to be about $10.50 or so. (Federal wage; I know there are states that are already there.)</p>

<p>I live in a small city that&#39;s got a lot of poverty, and its associated problems. I can say that the idea of a steady job at $15 an hour sounds practically unbelievable. There&#39;s a reason that Costco here is one of the most desired places to work at.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, there are also a couple communities of highly rich families. I made my money as an independent tutor for their children. While they aren&#39;t Bezos, by any means, we&#39;re still talking two story penthouses and 3 acre waterfront properties. There&#39;s a level of... Ignorance? When it comes to the way most people live. Most of them were really good people, though.</p>

<p>If anything, it was the managers and small business owners from the poorer parts of town that were the worst.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had friends who were, actually, workers at In-N-Out. (It&#39;s why it popped up as my example.) One of them legitimately believes that poor people are in those circumstances purely because of bad decisions and that we shouldn&#39;t offer any assistance. The direct quote was something along the lines of, &quot;If they can&#39;t pull themselves out of it, they should just have a quiet death.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked for absolutely awful managers. There really are people out there, a lot of them, who legitimately care about <em>nobody</em> but themselves. I also saw a shocking amount of psychopathic tendencies in business majors I shared classes with.</p>

<p>Now... Maybe I&#39;m just &quot;lucky&quot;? Maybe I&#39;ve interacted with an inordinate number of people who are like that. Most likely I&#39;m also biased, because I watched my father ruin himself and take advantage of everyone around him, due to drugs. I also have extended family who just really shouldn&#39;t be trying to run a business, but even outside of them, I&#39;ve seen a lot of small business owners who really don&#39;t give a flying fuck about their employees.</p>

<p>So... I&#39;ll retract the, &quot;Half.&quot; I&#39;m fairly adamant that a shocking number of people, however, are so self-absorbed that they would have zero qualms about totally screwing over someone else if it were to their benefit.</p>

<p>In my honest opinion, I&#39;d love to see us get to a point where we don&#39;t equate one&#39;s worth with what they do each week to provide food, but that&#39;s a little pie in the sky. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe at a lower price, a business owner can afford a third to make the work less strenuous and more efficient</p>

<p>You realize that when folks work jobs that don&#39;t pay their bills, taxpayers like you and me (presumably) pay for it in forms of welfare and so forth. </p>

<p>Why should we subsidize a shitty business model? </p>

<p>If your business can&#39;t afford employees then you need to work on some other aspect of the business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are a million reasons why, if it can be afforded, a business owner might hire more than they need</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not.</p>

<p>Just look at the layoffs that <em>multi-billion dollar companies complete every year</em> -- they can absolutely afford those employees but because they do not <strong>need</strong> them they let them go. </p>

<p>There are some instances, family owned businesses etc where one might find a business employing <em>more than they need</em>, but they are more than likely struggling or their balance is suffering because of it; however if we extrapolate that to the market as a whole, it does not happen.</p>

<p>Businesses hire people to fill a need. If that need does not exist, they do not hire people. </p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>What you saw as a dismissive statement was my acknowledgement that <em>some family owned businesses will put people on the payroll just because</em> -- but that has nothing to do with minimum wage, LOL. </p>

<p>As for the situation with your friend, that’s not what I meant. Sometimes a company will hire someone to lessen the workload on other employees, thus increasing efficiency (a perfectly good reason to overhire). Maybe a company hires someone because they believe that with some time in the workplace they may improve and become a more desirable employee under their employ. Like I said, there are many reasons that a business may want to hire an extra pair of hands despite not NEEDING to. It’s not all publicly traded companies laying off employees to increase the bottom line for shareholders.</p>

<p>The idea that bathroom laws are the reason more rape hasn’t been committed is the most obnoxiously childish and retardedly simplistic notion coming out of this whole debate.

    <div class="md"><p>Furthermore there’s another logical inconsistency in this whole argument. </p>

<p>If bathrooms don’t matter so much, then why the hell to transgenders even care about what bathroom they use? Why would we even propose the idea of jeaporizing anyone safety even theoretically to make someone more comfortable with a bathroom if in the first place it’s not supposed to matter.</p>

<p>So a transgender gets uncomfortable using the bathroom of their original sex.</p>

<p>So what if a non transgender person gets uncomfortable with them using their bathroom.</p>

<p>Why does the transgender persons uncomfortableness trump the other persons if the issues supposedly doesn’t matter in the first place and people are just “making a big deal out of nothing”.</p>

<p>The left has lost the ability to understand that equality means everyone has the right to feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>You don’t get to put yourself higher on a hierarchy where you say it’s not allowed that I feel uncomfortable we must legislate my discomfort away because I am higher on a hierarchy of oppression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off it’s already happened in a reportable case where the person got caught in most cases they won’t get caught and it still has not become accepted in society so there’s still plenty of scrutiny. Once that goes away, you will see it become a favorite method for rapists. It’s literally here you go rapists of young girls we just made it simple for you. No more snooping around parks looking creepy throw on a dress and some makeup and you can just go right in the locker room/bathroom and practically get high fives on your way to go look for someone to rape.</p>

<p>“Don’t they know anything about predators? Don’t they know the numbers? That out of every 100 rapes, only two rapists will spend so much as single day in jail while the other 98 walk free and hang out in our midst? Don’t they know that predators are known to intentionally seek out places where many of their preferred targets gather in groups? That perpetrators are addicts so committed to their fantasies they’ll stop at nothing to achieve them?</p>

<p>Do they know that more than 99 percent of single-victim incidents are committed by males? That they are experts in rationalization who minimize their number of victims? Don’t they know that insurance companies highlight locker rooms as a high-risk area for abuse that should be carefully monitored and protected?</p>

<p>Don’t they know that one out of every four little girls will be sexually abused during childhood, and that’s without giving predators free access to them while they shower? Don’t they know that, for women who have experienced sexual trauma, finding the courage to use a locker room at all is a freaking badge of honor? That many of these women view life through a kaleidoscope of shame and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, dissociation, poor body image, eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, difficulty with intimacy, and worse?”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. What? First off a man can take his son into a male bathroom and protect him whereas a woman can take her daughter into a woman’s bathroom and most likely be unable too.</p>

<p>Also, as a man your not gonna want to take your young daughter into a male bathroom and you can’t take her into the female bathroom.</p>

<p>So here’s the safest most viable solution.</p>

<p>Tell transgenders to suck it up and use the bathroom of their original sex.</p>

<p>Oh well. It’s not a big deal, right? Bathrooms. </p>

<p>So use the damn bathroom of your original sex so little fing girls can feel safe.</p>

<p>Oh no I had to step out of my gender role in some totally insignificant and purely symbolic way! Unless all of society acknowledges me as this sex I will be totally devastated!</p>

<p>When did society get more concerned about how perfectly comfortable someone feels they and everyone else must be with their sexuality then <em>the safety of woman and children</em></p>

<p>We are literally putting person  feelings of groups that may be considered marginalized over actual safety. Well I don’t want to be racist so let me walk through this group of 7 Hispanic gangsters rather than crossing the street. See how that goes for you. </p>

<p>Well harvey Weinstein donates to progressive causes and hangs with Hillary clinton so I’m going to ignore the fact that he literally rapes woman routinely and it’s not just a rumor it’s literally like a known fact everyone is 100 percent certain of but it’s okay because hey he’s helping out the cause.</p>

<p>The greater good, right?</p>

<p>Just don’t hurt others in ways they are entitled not to be hurt in.</p>

<p>One of my pet peeves is how the more niche political ideologies have to be so precisely defined in the eyes of most people, yet the mainstream movements can be so many different things.</p>

<p>For example, the Republican party includes deficit hawks and corporate welfare junkies.  It includes pro-life and pro-family-planning groups.  It includes rednecks and free-market economists.  Yet they can all identify as Republican, thinking that words means very different things.</p>

<p>Yet if I say libertarian and disagree on say one point, like maybe I&#39;m more of an environmentalist, then nope, I&#39;m not a libertarian, go find another ideology?  Screw that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will never find a room with more disagreement than a room full of liberals/libertarians(see we can&#39;t even fucking agree on that :P)</p>

<p>an Example from my own country Denmark, where we have 4 Liberal parties - we don&#39;t use the liberal/libertarian distinction here, as the nanny-state is better represented by the Social Democrats.</p>

<p>The original &quot;Left&quot; party, which is a Liberal Farmers party, and forms the bulk of the right-wing coalition government(our current PM is from there).</p>

<p>The Radical Left party, which split from the left party around a 100 years ago, an forms the centre-left liberal bulk, of the usually Social Democratic governments.</p>

<p>The Liberal Alliance, which split from the Radical Left, the Left, and conservative party, and is also in our current government. The closest to a libertarian party we have here in Denmark. Currently in government as well.</p>

<p>And lastly the Alternative, which also split from the radical left, and is some kind of green/socially liberal amalgam - I have a hard time describing them, but they&#39;re definitely somewhere on the wacky leftie spectrum.</p>

<p>So we have 4 parties who claim to some extend that they&#39;re liberal, a far-right, centre-right, centre-left and far-left.</p>

<p>But hey as long as we can agree that top down authoritarian rule is bad, and that capitalism generally gets things done in the most efficient way, even though there is a serious but mitigable downside, we can get a long just fine(ish).</p>

<p>Btw the world you&#39;re looking for is Liberal, don&#39;t cede that word to socialists! It&#39;s always pissed me off that Americans call some of the most illiberal people (the PC nutjobs) Liberal.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like how a lot of the language policing stuff pans out, I think SJW culture is just as skewed as anti-SJW culture. but like this post insists it&#39;s not one or the other. there <em>is</em> a middle ground that takes compromise.</p>

<p>personally I am pro-gun and think all the issues of violence in the US go deeper than gun control advocates think. by the same nature I am pro-trans rights, whatever issue you have with people refusing to go by their birth gender is deeper than you think. realistically people should live their lives how they want as long as it doesn&#39;t infringe on the lives of others, and you&#39;re not likely to be sure of someone&#39;s genitalia when they&#39;re pooping in a bathroom stall, so why care?</p>

Whats going on right now is a walk in the park compared to what our country has endured in the past.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  I consider myself libertarian and am considered crazy from both the left and right.  I believe that you should be able to freely live and do as you please as long as you aren&#39;t infringing on another persons right to do the same.  If you aren&#39;t harming others then you should be left alone.  This means I agree with both gay marriage and the right to bear arms.  I believe that if we all quit thinking we need to make/regulate other people to do what we think they should be doing or force them not to do things we don&#39;t like we would be a much happier and cooperating society. Yet my position is the mocked and delusional position.  Of course we need to do everything we can to force other people to act in a way that pleases us.  I don&#39;t get this mentality.

<p>the difference represented by those numbers is based on 4 questions.

<p>You are literally splitting hairs, according to this study you posted, when talking about how &quot;informed&quot; people are with regard to what news channel they watch.  People that watch NPR are really the only people that had a statistically significant, if you can even call it that out of 1,000 people surveyed, advantage when it came to the questions they subjectively chose to ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it interesting that that&#39;s your perspective.  As someone on the other side politically, I tend to see it the other way around.  I see the violence from antifa, terrorists, and illegals as something much more prevalent than the odd white supremacist.  The reason I personally find antifa, terrorists, and illegals more of a threat is because it seems to me like those groups have a significant backing/defense from people in our own country, whereas I find most people generally agree white supremacists are jackasses. </p>

<p>I also think your generalization of scared armed, young men becoming violent is perhaps a stereotype.  Granted, my experience is anecdotal, but the vast majority of the people I interact with who agree with me politically (Trump supporters mostly but the predominant thing we care about is personal freedom) are pretty diverse in terms of race, gender, and age.  And being scared really has nothing to do with it in my personal opinion.  Being armed is more about preparedness that things COULD hit the fan, rather than fear that they will.  If anything, I see the pushback against Trump and the notion that anyone would be attacking women&#39;s rights or gay rights, etc, as fearmongering. </p>

<p>In the spirit of your post, I guess I just find it interesting how so many people live in the same world and yet come to an entirely different conclusion about it.  I don&#39;t think disagreement is a bad thing; if anything, disagreement is what pushes us forward.</p>

<p>Well how you see it contrasts with the facts. The vast majority of terroristic murders in the USA are committed by white nationalists, and the <a href="https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-report-white-supremacist-murders-more-than-doubled-in-2017">trend is only getting more extreme</a>. Nobody participating in antifascism in the USA has killed anyone yet, which is remarkable considering how much violence has occurred. White nationalists, on the other hand, have killed hundreds of people in both spontaneous and premeditated terrorist actions. Muslims aren&#39;t even a close second, and mexicans aren&#39;t even doing that shit to begin with so I have no idea why you threw &quot;illegals&quot; in there. Those dudes are all catholic, they do crime in fraternal societies for mutual gain of their members, not to spread insane ideologies and scare people.</p>

If we are too tolerant then globalists will walk all over us. We need to protect all cultures and borders so they can prosper, that means not creating failed states in other nations too. We can still have immigration for people that want to assimilate into our culture. I want to believe that multiculturulism still works, but I don&#39;t think that it can work with a democratic system, there will be too many ideologies and it will just end up in chaos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, we have to define the West. The West euphemestically and colloquially means, the White world. Western culture is derived from an amalgamation of the Greco-Roman philosophies of old, of Christendom, and of the Enlightenment. The angle they take today is that the Classics of the Greco-Roman era are &quot;Fascist&quot; and that they uphold &quot;White Supremacy&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/13512960/donald-trump-plato-democracy-tyranny-fascism-2016-elections">https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/13512960/donald-trump-plato-democracy-tyranny-fascism-2016-elections</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/clairlemon/status/901283225628155904?lang=en">https://twitter.com/clairlemon/status/901283225628155904?lang=en</a></p>

<p>In fact, the very thing that they are referring to as The Patriarchy, as White Supremacy, IS the West, and Western culture. The West for a long time was everywhere that White Christendom had spread, (pre-Enlightenment, obviously). You must notice that popular culture, as portrayed by the media, by Hollywood, by the corporations, by celebrities, etc., has no remorse about being anti-White and anti-Christian. Minorities and Progressives resent Whites as the villain of their history, the source of their past suffering, and their current circumstances. When they think of Whites they think of colonialism, imperialism, slavery, and genocide. So given that Western culture and civilization is implicitly White, you have one thing they hate about it. Given that it&#39;s also implicitly either Christian, agnostic, or atheist, that is another thing they hate about it. They resent core Western cultural values, like marriage being between a man and a woman, or the traditional gender roles, and wish to replace them with Progressive, Multicultural values. Please see that Multiculturalism is utterly incompatible with Westernism. The West is a culture. A multiculture necessarily displaces and dilutes the culture that was there before. </p>

<p>You need to understand the core philosophy of Leftism to understand why they resent the West and Western culture. The Left&#39;s base outlook is that of the infinite ingroup. Inclusivity is the highest moral good in the Leftist mind. Anything that is exclusive is considered wrong. In relationship to nations, there are citizens, and there are non-citizens. The nation is by its nature, exclusive, in that some people have access, and some don&#39;t. For this reason, the Left will <em>always</em> hate Nationalism, and will try to break it down through mass immigration. Their instinct is to make everything more inclusive, and to deconstruct <em>anything</em> that is exclusive.</p>

<p>The West <em>is</em> exclusive. Not everyone can be Western. Not everyone can live in the West. This makes the West offensive to them. Their response to the West is Globalism, which they believe is the ultimate and final form of Inclusivity™. To deconstruct the West, so that they make make way in the zero-sum cultural space for Globalism, they will constantly continue to erode Western norms, values, and traditions, in an attempt to &quot;boil the frog&quot;. A frog will let itself be boiled to death, as long as you raise the heat in the pot slowly enough. </p>

<p>Another analogy for this is a Jenga tower. If you don&#39;t know the game Jenga, then google it momentarily, and then come back to this comment. Their action against the West has been persistent, but slow, something they called &quot;the long march through the institutions&quot;. I visualize it like this. Imagine taking one block out of a Jenga tower, and then sneakily pocketing it, and replacing it with one of your own. Imagine the tower is 100 blocks, only 1/100 of the tower has changed, no one notices. Imagine next year you take another block, and replace it with your own again. Still, no one cares, it is only 2/100 different than it was, and now new people are experiencing the tower for the first time, this version of the tower is the only one they even know.</p>

<p>If you keep doing that, 1 block at a time, for 100 years, you will have left an entirely different Jenga tower behind. Not one block of it will be the block that was there 100 years before. And yet no one will know that anything changed. This process is what they call &quot;Progress&quot;. Progressivism is a massive cultural force today, have you ever asked yourself what it is Progressing away from? It is away from Westernism. Whenever anyone proposes ANY rollback of any &quot;Progressive&quot; policy, back to the way it was under Westernism, all the moralizing pundits squawk in their chorus, &quot;we can&#39;t go backwards, history only moves forward&quot;. This is loaded language train your mind, to make it appear that when confronted with a conflict between Westernism and Globalism, that there is only one viable, or even moral choice. When that just isn&#39;t true. They hate everything about Westernism, and they will not rest until they have desconstructed it entirely, replacing it with Globalist Corporatist Multiculturalism. </p>

<p>And it was the Statue of Liberty that was unAmerican. It was placed there by the French, with a Jewish person&#39;s quote on the front. America&#39;s very first immigration law, passed the year after the Constitution, was the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1790, which restricted immigration into the USA to &quot;Free White persons of good moral character&quot;. You can&#39;t just redefine the entire point of people of a country by airdropping some statue in, hundreds of years after it&#39;s founding, and claim that you now have the moral authority to challenge the fundamental beliefs of the Founding Fathers.

<p>Becoming &#39;awoke&#39; involves realizing that Trump is not the bad guy, hes actually fighting against the media and deep state in a very real way. </p>

<p>This is a very confusing process that involves upending all sorts of deep seated beliefs and setting aside previous assumptions and forgiving personal flaws in light of the big picture.</p>

<p>This left and right line is as arbitrary as ever. Its def true that its used to divide, and its confusing because how can the left with so many good social ideas be wrong?</p>

<p>The answer is that the social systems have been hijacked a long time ago. We see this in the CDC and other departments. Good ideas and positive intentions are lost. </p>

<p>The bright side to this is that the young generations were never exposed to that. Socialism is actually quite popular among young people and we&#39;re not afraid of &quot;scary&quot; buzzwords like that. If you look at the votes of just people under 30 in the 2016 primaries, Bernie Sanders, a self-avowed democratic socialist, got more votes than Trump and Clinton COMBINED. That&#39;s what young people think of socialism. </p>

<p>So this post isn&#39;t about False culture war at all.  It&#39;s not about working together to achieve greatness.  It&#39;s about being compassionate to and having empathy for the ignorant bumblefucks on the right that don&#39;t know any better in hopes that they will come around and be as enlightened as you.  Am I understanding you correctly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, I&#39;m not claiming I&#39;ve found enlightenment, but I&#39;ve had a pretty unique and informative journey both in terms of life and my own ideology. Not all right wingers are bad, but yes they are generally deeply misinformed. Once you see through the McCarthyist propaganda still saturating the USA, a lot of this anger and conflict makes a lot more sense. We all want the same things, order, safety, community and prosperity, but when millions of people react in disgust at the very mention of a centuries old school of philosophy dedicated to bringing more of all that to all of us, something is wrong, and it&#39;s not the hippy dippy ideas with an imperfect track record in practice.</p>

<p>Ask a few older eastern Europeans who lived under the USSR, and they&#39;ll tell you. Or my godfather, who escaped the Communists in China to America.</p>

<p>Not only is Communism inherently antithetical to the values entrenched in the Constitution and among the Framer&#39;s other works, but there are millions of people right here in the United States that have lived under or fled from Communism, and hate it with every fibre of their being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why the post suggests researching communism more...</p>

<p>Mao did a shit job at communism. Stalin did too, though there were points in the past (after Stalin) that the USSR was more successful than it is today.</p>

<p>point being if you knew a thing about the spooky scary communism you&#39;d know what it&#39;s end goal is: a stateless and classless society. essentially anarchy, communists just go about it differently. </p>

<p>personally i consider myself a libertarian socialist so I disagree with how communists want things to play out, i still have developed an understanding of what exactly communism is and it&#39;s not necessarily North Korea lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the point is communism doesn’t work like its written, I could write about a society where everyone is rich and happy and there are puppys and kittens but its a flawed concept because it can’t be done, plenty of people have tried communism and its never worked, democracies and capitalism, while it may come with its downsides, works pretty well.</p>

<p>these societies, according to marxism (which I don&#39;t even subscribe to but will still defend because you people are so far off!), require time to be put in place. time which has historically been cut short by (a) American intervention or (b) really bad practice when compared to marxist ideals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chinas low poverty rates are the result of a change in policy allowing agricultural workers to sell food exceeding their government quotas (which also dropped drastically) onto the free market, the commmunist policy was high gains for the state with high quotas, in the 1980s it became low quotas and high gains for workers on the open market, a very capitalist move which halved poverty levels in China overnight</p>

<p>Do you think I don&#39;t know this?</p>

<p>No. If the authority is a legitimate conduit for the people&#39;s power, and the authority practices anarchist decision making, it can be anarchist. Anarchists aren&#39;t against hierarchy, rules and order, they just demand all three have good reasons behind them.</p>

<p>I got it out of some archaic history books in the library of a school I no longer attend, but a good perspective on the events you can easily get ahold of is Orwell&#39;s Homage to Catalonia. I don&#39;t agree with everything Orwell thought and did, but damn if the guy wasn&#39;t the Hunter S. Thompson of extreme politics. If you want to get to know the real history of these issues, start with Orwell&#39;s nonfiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I’m entirely aware of the debate around anarchism but at its core its an anti authority ideology, anywhere true anarchy has been seen its been disastrous for human rights, including all your examples, and anywhere with ‘slightly anarchic’ governance is only made better for the presence of its authority and hierarchy (see Iceland). Theres a reason all your examples are just small communities with low populations, it’s because hierarchy is natural in human nature and the bugger a society gets the more prominent it becomes</p>

<p>And since when do r/conspiracy users display such blind trust in the intelligence agencies of the united states. Of all people? </p>

<p>What about Strzok? What about Bruce Ohr? The FBI agent whos wife was working at Fusion GPS while Steele was doing oppo work there? </p>

<p>What about the fact that the russian lawyer trump jr. met with colluded with Fusion GPS to run as smear campaign agaisnt Bill Browder just a few years after he lobbied congress to pass the magnitsky act? What about the fact that that hillary clinton funded the dossier. </p>

<p>No, you&#39;re asking me for information you could easily obtain yourself. Not that it would do any good to provide you with that information since you&#39;d just shut it down due to opposing narratives. </p>

<p>People on the left have been calling prohibition the white supremacist nonsense since day one. That the democrats just rolled with it is just more evidence they are on the center-right, not the left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; but out of desperation they made the mistake of trusting one wing of the machine that then pumped them full of fascist propaganda and got their fear, hatred and suspicion pointed at the poor, people of color and foreigners, anywhere but at the man behind the curtain&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; I know you&#39;ve heard a lot of very nasty things about communists and anarchists, but I cannot recommend enough getting to understand their views.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps you should have remained neutral instead of clearing picking a side. You lost all respect and attention when you made this miscalculation. I agree with your overall divide and conquer theory, but you clearly have no interest in &quot;healing&quot; you want conservatives to see that your perspective is the superior one.</p>

<p>I have no problems with liberals, in fact many of my close friends voted Hillary and Bernie, but BTFO with this communist sympathy shit, been there done that. Have you ever met and spoken with immigrants from Communist countries? My GF&#39;s parents and grandparents fled communist China, so um no thanks. Their doing very well here(middle class blue collar workers), they own a home in a nice part of LA and both their children graduated Ivy league schools with honors on  full scholarships. And they voted Trump because they&#39;ve already &quot;enjoyed&quot; the benevolence of communism.</p>

<p>Typical Liberal pseudo-intellectual college graduate, next time major in Business or STEM and do some actual critical thinking instead of multiple choice memorization and fooling yourself into thinking you know how to solve the problems with capitalism(which are plenty) </p>

<p>Yuri Bezmenov: How to Brainwash a Nation.
This will tell you all you need to know about the far-left, known as useful idiots.</p>

<p>That said, I do agree with the overall needing to realize most liberals and conservatives are not extremist and we have many values in common. 
But enough with this fascist and communist propaganda, which btw for the record are both left-wing tenants. Don&#39;t believe me? Keep an open mind and do an internet search. 
Large totalitarian, freedom stripping(Hitler gun control,etc) ideologies are not a proponent of conservatism. Fascism is only &quot;right&quot; as it&#39;s slightly to the right of Communism which is as far left as you can go.</p>

<p>Wtf is space communism? And your subsequent points riddled with failed deductive logic.</p>

<p>How about they develop skills in fields that won&#39;t be displaced by automation as easily. Plumbers, electricians, Hvac, etc.. Or how about low iq people who are incapable or unwilling to find jobs that are above low skilled labor stop having children they can&#39;t afford, and we stop importing so many of said peoples&#39;.
Additionally, taxes can be imposed on companies that fully automate and tariffs for those who decide to leave the US to use foreign cheap labor, and the income can be used to fund social welfare programs that train people to be relevant in modern societies. </p>

<p>How about some personal accountability and quit expecting society to take care of you.
For fucks sake, I was homeless for 2 years and suffer from Bi-polar disorder and yet I&#39;ve managed to make a  respectable living for myself in Los Angeles(very expensive) so what&#39;s their excuse?</p>

<p>I agree, and I used the services and got my shit together by first becoming an auto-mechanic, then a plumber and finally going to college and getting into accounting and finance. I also chose not to have children while I was accepting help and unable to be fully self-reliant, and due to mental health reasons(bi-polar) I&#39;ve chosen not to have children(vasectomy) So I&#39;m hardly a hypocrite. </p>

<p>You: &quot;Come on man... If you really did make it through such tough times then why are you so mad at the people with less than you? Where is the empathy, your humanity? You should, of all people, realize that shitty situations happen and sometimes society as a whole can play an important part in getting them back on track.&quot;</p>

<p>I have no qualms helping out those who help themselves and in fact am involved in a community outreach program and county hospital for adults and adolescents with bi-polar and substance abuse, particularly homeless and I/we mainly on life-coaching and work/substance rehab(others)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not mad, I&#39;m saddened and frustrated and sometimes anger is the secondary emotion that manifest.I fully support a safety net, but it&#39;s become a safety hammock and people, whether intentionally or not, are abusing the system and it&#39;s not helping them in the long run. When you become dependent for too long, you lose the confidence and faith that you can ever take care of yourself again in the future.
That said, having been homeless and a drug/alcohol addict I know what does and doesn&#39;t work not only from my own personal experience but from those I met along the way. If your not going to get sober, and your not going to take other measures to start helping yourself, then why should anyone else?</p>

<p>Me: &quot; Or how about low iq people who are incapable or unwilling to find jobs that are above low skilled labor stop having children they can&#39;t afford.&quot;</p>

<p>YOU: So says eugenics proponents, Hitler and u/thetruthhurts2016&quot;</p>

<p>Really? Lol, talk about a fallacy of false equivalence.  I never suggested, or even implied that external forces make these decisions for people in need of help, rather I suggested they take agency and make the responsible decision for themselves.</p>

<p>I would have otherwise continued this exchange; but your last sentence that I just mentioned is evidence that you either lack the maturity, or reasoning skills to continue discourse with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your point, and wages are the driving force in automation in the US at least.  Minimum wage increases are why there are threats of automation, whether we agree with the increase or not.  The trucking industry would be a huge hit I agree, but at the same token why is it (subjectively) less of a concern for Ag?  I would bet due to the large amounts of cheap illegal labor that exists of people, &quot;doing the jobs Americans won&#39;t do.&quot;  I&#39;m for the end of exploiting illegal immigrants, bring on the farm automation.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not invested in this as being a humanitarian disaster.  I don&#39;t think your average US citizen is that far removed, generation-wise, from being illiterate.  All of history is made of better people than I, and it&#39;d be a sham to think that everyone is entitled to live a comfortable lifestyle let alone a better life.  Yeah, may sound defeatist, but unless there is a higher order being ready to hit the reset button, I&#39;ll continue to not get my hopes up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what OP is talking about. Instead of willing to try to understand the other side, or even engage in thoughtful dialogue to maybe even change <em>their</em> minds, the primary response is &quot;better dead than red&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no secret here that there are corporate masters, pulling strings behind the scenes to further their agenda via organizations like the CFR, Davos, Bilderberg, etc., to create a neoliberal corporate globalist one world government. I think we can all agree that we will fight those corporate masters to prevent them from doing that to the very end.</p>

<p>You have to understand that the goal of socialism and communism is to destroy the state, which has killed millions of people throughout history, and has stolen food from the mouths of their most vulnerable, starving citizens only to line the pockets of beaurocrats. </p>

<p>This is the real tragedy, that we have created, live in, and accept a system where it is possible to have simultaneous crises of both obesity and starvation. With the advent of today&#39;s technology, it is possible to feed and house every person on Earth, however there is no real effort to do that because it would be &#39;unprofitable&#39;. Here in America, we are free from most dieases that plague the rest of the world just because of access to clean drinking water, and the ability to cure what few diseases do make it through with a (somewhat) easily attainable course of antibiotics. The rest of the world does not have this ability; indeed, infants die of preventable causes. All because &#39;it costs money&#39;.</p>

<p>Socialists and communists realize that these issues are a symptom of a larger  problem, which is the system itself. There is no &#39;central government&#39; in communism, there would be no ominous &#39;one world government&quot;.</p>

<p>Socialists don&#39;t advocate for gun control, they see it as a neccessity to prevent a tyrannical government. I&#39;ll agree with you that some of the main socialism or communism subs are less than helpful, they are filled with edgy, presumptious teenagers with no real world experience. However subs like <a href="/r/debatecommunism">/r/debatecommunism</a> or <a href="/r/socialism_101">/r/socialism_101</a> exist as well, and are much better learning resources.</p>

<p>The point is, that a neoliberal corporate globalist one world government, is not the same as society which has chosen communism for its ability to provide a better life, for all of its citizens, globally.</p>

<p>We all realize there is a major problem, and change is coming. Which change exactly, will depend on our ability, or inability, to work together to create a better life for all.</p>

<p>Feel free to PM me if you want to discuss in further detail. </p>

<p>&quot;You have to understand that the goal of socialism and communism is to destroy the state, which has killed millions of people throughout history, and has stolen food from the mouths of their most vulnerable, starving citizens only to line the pockets of beaurocrats&quot;</p>

<p>While it may have been their goal, the reality is that what you described is the end result of their actions. Capitalism hasn&#39;t resulted in the deaths of millions. All communism has accomplished is transferring the power from owners to the state.</p>

<p>&quot;There is no &#39;central government&#39; in communism&quot;
Perhaps in theory, but the Soviet Union, China, India, Venezuela , etc say differently.
Your proposing support for anarcho-communism, and I favor anarcho-free market, while their both similar, neither has a living or past example of success for any sustained duration except in small communities(in the hundreds to low thousands)</p>

<p>&quot;The point is, that a neoliberal corporate globalist one world government, is not the same as society which has chosen communism for its ability to provide a better life, for all of its citizens, globally.&quot;</p>

<p>Can you give me one example where the reality of this actually played out successfully? And please explain why immigrants flee from communist &quot;utopias&quot; to America?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes a good politician is one that supports what the people want when enough people support it. As a gay man I&#39;ll be the first to criticize the dems for waiting to support same sex marriage until it was politicall expedient (at least on the national level).

<p>So instead we have to address this at the state level.  Which states are legalizing marijuana?  Mostly blue states.  Which states legalized same sex marriage first?  All blue states.  Which states have higher taxes on the wealthy?  Blue states.  What states are pushing for net neutrality?  Blue states.</p>

<p>Claiming both sides are the same is an age old tactic to create false equivalency and confuse the issues.  I consider myself an independent, but I have staked out my policy positions and the side that more closely aligns with those positions has consistently been the Democrats.</p>

<p>Slavery is illegal within the borders of these countries. By definition that means they&#39;ve outlawed it. I will not argue with you that working conditions of the poor in many countries are atrocious and we are culpable for supporting it (that means you and me both, as we&#39;re both using the technological architecture built by their hands). But that doesn&#39;t allow you to change the definition of things because it makes your argument sound more grand.</p>

<p>That aside, if you view wage labor as slavery, I&#39;m interested to hear a more detailed account of how you in envision an ideal economy would be set up. I&#39;ll put it on the table that I view the blended systems of social democracies such as Sweden and Denmark as strong models. </p>

<p><em>We</em> aren&#39;t culpable, our rulers are. We&#39;re only responsible in that we don&#39;t get rid of those rulers, but that isn&#39;t a simple proposition.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not changing the definition, slavery is still legal in the USA in prison, and unofficially legal within the households of the elite. I&#39;m just pointing out how the sausage gets made on that whole &quot;but i thought we got rid of slavery when obama got elected&quot; junk</p>

<p>European socialism works because their aristocracy is less constantly high as fuck and severely mentally ill than ours, they read enough to understand the parts of classical liberalism that stress that you gotta feed the chickens or you&#39;ll have growing social issues that hit a breaking point, then revolts. Our aristocracy doesn&#39;t get this. The &quot;left&quot; wing occasionally pays the idea some lip service, but I doubt all too many of them understand why. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s too much partying or lack of exercise or what, but our ruling class is blowing obscene amounts of money on deranged shit, and I&#39;m sure we only see the tip of the iceberg. They think we&#39;re a line item that can be slashed with no consequence, because their whole &quot;working&quot; lives the batshit privatized state capitalist government they own has sheltered them from externalities at all costs.</p>

<p>As for an ideal economy, Rojava has a pretty good transitional model going on, but I think ideally it should be up to local democracy. Municipal organization should go down to the neighborhood level, and from there up they should decide amongst themselves what rules to follow and what larger structures to participate in. This would likely result in a varied economic landscape with multiple, coexisting styles of production, where each area is free to find a solution that works for the locals.</p>

<p>Yes, just because I buy things I need to not starve or get fired then starve, doesn&#39;t mean I have any responsibility for the way they were produced. If my options are starve and die and make no impact, or refuse to suppress my base survival instincts in the hope I one day have enough power to help some people, I&#39;m going to pick the option that isn&#39;t suicide because I&#39;m too damn curious about which way the world is gonna go.</p>

<p>And the elite are not shadowy or abstract. They&#39;re people like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos  and most of the political class. They&#39;re identifiable people with home addresses, who publicly act against the working class.</p>

<p>Not equivalent, just not fundamentally different. They&#39;re both coerced, wage labor just heaps on the abstractions to convince the workers that living in a world where they are not guaranteed any share of their natural heritage, this fucking wonderland of a planet we all deserve access to, they must instead must beg for it on their knees from a landed, hereditary aristocracy that is not obligated to do anything productive, and that all of this is fair and voluntary. It isn&#39;t. Try &quot;not participating in the system&quot; on a budget below the poverty line and you&#39;ll see what I mean, you&#39;ll be beaten and arrested before the month is out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To lefties, just remember not everybody in a red cap is a fascist. More often they&#39;re hardworking people that saw the same blatant corruption in our government you do, but out of desperation they made the mistake of trusting one wing of the machine that then pumped them full of fascist propaganda and got their fear, hatred and suspicion pointed at the poor, people of color and foreigners, anywhere but at the man behind the curtain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Donald Trump has shown his colors; the man is a proto fascist if not a fascist outright. To me, this was obvious in the primaries but I can understand if people didn&#39;t see it. But if someone can still support him to this day, that person is either a fascist themselves or incredibly stupid. I don&#39;t begrudge anybody who voted for him because I understand that his dog whistles didn&#39;t land on some people and they voted for him for other reasons. But he&#39;s not dog whistling anymore, he&#39;s shouting into a megaphone from the rooftops. His supporters can give up on him at any time and at that point, it&#39;s the end of the story. Nothing more needs to be said or done. But if someone supports him still and has no inclination to give him up, that person is a fucking fascist and that person is my enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say it&#39;s a decent post had it not basically been &quot;to the left, forgive the right, to the right, you are all wrong&quot;. That just simply isn&#39;t how you unite people. Your basic casting of blame shows you are still in that left vs right mindset. You still view one side as the bad guy.  When you ditch that in favor of seeing just how insane both sides actually are then you get to a decent point for something like this. </p>

<p>When Obama was president, I watched the right take soundbites and warp them to fit their hate of the guy. What do I see now that Trump is president, a shit ton of the same. To be clear, Trump is a worthless pile of shit, and so was Obama. But the way people blatantly give their side the benefit of the doubt while shitting on the other side and not acknowleging it means they will <strong>never</strong> get past this point. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong here, there is plenty of shit that is blatantly wrong on the right. This isn&#39;t to defend them, but moreso to make people on the left understand that when they pull the same shit they just finished defending against for 8 years, it&#39;s insane. Confirmation bias has become the king and we are all subject to it until we pull ourselves out. It doesn&#39;t matter how much you scream about false equivalence when you lack the perspective to actually look at the situation without the huge amount of bias that you hold on to.</p>

<p>But I draw the line at hugging it out with communists. Never has the road to hell been paved with more good intentions than in the case of globalist-funded groups like ANTIFA. These are kids who think they’re doing something good but really they’re just unwittingly carrying out the plan to weaken our nation’s strength from the inside. And they don’t converse. They regurgitate slogans and lob shit at anyone to the right of Marx. </p>

<p>I love the vibe, though. Liberals: I am a conservative Libertarian and I want us to get along. I do not want to take your rights away. In fact, the opposite - I want to reduce the size and power of our corrupt government and give us all the ability to think, live, and act as we please and undisturbed.

Bro antifa is not enough of a damn organization to be funded by anyone except the people organizing local meetups and marches. there is just no evidence to that claim. I agree they aren&#39;t very good at conversing but for the most part they literally only march against actual white supremacists like Ricky boy Spencer, so if you&#39;re not out there in your Klan hat Antifa really isn&#39;t an issue. also, antifa is anti-fascism. it&#39;s not communist or anarchist or libertarian, any ideology can be antifa. theoretically you could be antifa, assuming you&#39;re not down with fascist ideas! (and no, antifa people don&#39;t necessarily think Trump is a fascist either, just that he empowers them in ways they were previously unempowered)</p>

<p>I am a left-wing libertarian, and I want us to get along. I also get along with commies, and right wing libertarians. Both those groups share some ideals with me. Neither group is actively trying to undermine our country or whatever. people make sense of things in different ways. I&#39;m sure there are communists out there who would sit down with you and I and have a fruitful conversation. the only people who want to undermine anything are the ones at the top, yes indeed the globalists, the neoliberals, the neocons, whatever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sorry, man, but the people behind ANTIFA are bad folks who aren’t seeking unity or healing. Communists have killed far more people than Nazis over the years but they don’t get painted in the same light. Why do you think that is? It’s because communism is an absolutely ineffective, impossible system that never works because of human nature. It does, however, work wonderfully if the design is to disempower a country and create a population completely in the thrall of Big Government. We have limited government in this country. What makes you think a system where we give more power to a government is going to be better and not worse? This defies logic. </p>

<p>Look, I can tell you’re not one of them. But those people want to weaken our country so our people are so watered down and subjugated that they can do as they please. It’s not the folks being recruited. They just want to level the playing field for the rest of us. Those are just nice people who unfortunately think they can paint in broad strokes and find the easy enemy. <em>It’s not that simple. There’s more going on.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, you&#39;re totally right that you can&#39;t paint in broad strokes. that&#39;s why you can&#39;t just say &quot;antifa are bad folks.&quot; again, antifa is not some big organization, it&#39;s an ideology that intersects with other ideologies.</p>

<p>antifa isn&#39;t communist necessarily. there are anarchists who consider themselves antifa. anarchists and communists bicker constantly, they just agree in that they don&#39;t like plain ol&#39; racism. (side note; that doesn&#39;t even mean they are, say, pro-immigration to the point a lot of the right thinks leftists are (as in letting everyone in unchecked). it means they want to work against the systematic oppression non white people face in the US.)</p>

<p>also, the &quot;commies killed 100 trillion people&quot; hyperbole is a pretty well-researched area of propaganda. the only mass-scale deaths from communism (which most communists would argue has never existed, at least not for long enough before the CIA shut it down) are the famine under Stalin&#39;s regime, but those official numbers still total less than the Holocaust&#39;s.</p>

<p>again, you&#39;re right in that it&#39;s <em>not that simple</em> and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t go around blubbering that every Trump voter is a fascist or an idiot! but our systems need change, they need revolution, and these changes need to come for the good of the majority. I doubt your idea of Communism is what antifa/leftists have in mind and I am totally willing to discuss it further with you or anyone else who can bother to hear me out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you’re exactly the problem. I fucking hate Nazis so don’t even try it. ANTIFA has indeed been around for years, hence its designation as a terrorist group in this country and Europe, where Soros has backed their plays for the past couple decades.

<p>Also why the idea of antifa being &quot;terrorists&quot; is ridiculous as well, besides the obvious fact that there is no terrorism taking place under their name unless it&#39;s false flag. </p>

<p>The U.S. Government says differently, for what that’s worth. Interesting that you use the term “false flag” when you think conspiracies are nonsense. </p>

In all this government shutdown business what is <em>really</em> happening?
All I&#39;ve seen is a load of people getting emotionally involved online to the point of depression.
My sister told me recently that for the past year she has considered killing herself, because she&#39;s being taught that we&#39;re in a really bad place in America right now when everything is virtually the same. 
This has gone far enough guys. We need to band together and bitch at the people who can actually change how the system works.</p>

I&#39;ve been in the very poor category my whole life, yes I make enough to live and survive but I refuse to exploit anyone else for capital and it leaves me with little choices. It&#39;s funny with all this race-dividing crap because people still act like poor communities are all African-americans when in reality there are many other ethnicity who live there.
Anyway since MLK, Jr day just passed I&#39;d like you lovely people to listen to this very important part of his Montgomery address on [How the races were kept from unifying in post civil war America] (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/mipdo/rare-mlk-jr-on-how-the-races">https://soundcloud.com/mipdo/rare-mlk-jr-on-how-the-races</a>. Take our your dictionaries too. </p>

<p>He talks about the social engineers, the Bourbon barons in the south, the stratagem that they implored. This has always been a class issue. </p>

<p>Also here is a great article about the money behind this whole &quot;white privilege&quot; rhetoric: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mipdo/rare-mlk-jr-on-how-the-races">Why and How Big Money Promote &quot;White Privledge Rheotric</a></p>

<p>Totally agree about the red and blue paradigm, keep it together brothers and sisters: love, peace, unity and respect &lt;3</p>

I would answer &quot;finally someone got it&quot;. It appears very clearly to me that elites are dividing us to exterminate us. Indeed, robots and AI will take away 60% of jobs, including most of engineering, doctors, lawyers, etc.
Don&#39;t be a fool, absolutely no one is protected. This is a good achievement, but not in the current context.
The conflict in place are:
Islam against Europe and moderately against America
USA against Europe (conservatism vs liberalism - the roles are reversing)
Europe against Turkey and Russia
Left vs Right
Non whites vs Whites
Japan against China
China against USA and India
Africa vs Arabs
Gays vs Hetero
Men vs Women
Arabs vs Blacks, blacks vs whites, arabs vs whites
AltLite vs Alright
Communism, socialism, liberalism, etc. 
State vs Individual</p>

<p>Jews remain victims in all scenario, of course. </p>

<p>As you see, they set up a scene that will explode, and as you explain it very well, the solution is to come together. But for this, at least we must control our women, because they will always stop men from doing what is needed. 
Individualism will not be a solution, as it never was. I know that most will think this sounds like socialism, but it doesn&#39;t. We ought to survive as a group, not as individuals, this is a primary rule of nature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot lately.  I find it interesting that immediately in the wake of the financial crisis Occupy movements sprung up everywhere and were in the news for months, yet here we are a decade later with the same fuckery going on and everybody seems to want nothing more than to put it out of their minds.</p>

<p>But division is absolutely freaking everywhere now.  Instead of division by social class (the very super rich vs., well, everybody else) every possible way you can divide people is being amplified <em>except</em> social class.  Every possible permutation of race, gender, religion, and identity seem like they have been amplified.</p>

<p>By turning us against each other the %.1 have taken the heat off themselves.  The super rich have decided to cash out what they perceive as their equity in the middle class, and they get away with funneling all of our wealth upward while we bicker and fight amongst ourselves.</p>

<p>No, just the aristocracy part. It doesn&#39;t sit right with me that we have a hereditary, mentally ill, parasitic class of people who blow all their money (which they do not work for) on drugs and pedophilia while I and almost everyone I know are struggling just to get by. And all the shit the governments owned by the former group do in developing countries is severely fucked up, you must admit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I noticed that too. I rewrote what OP said and plan to share it like a shameless bastard, without the pro commie stuff. I lean left, but communism is bad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The left and right wings of our generally unified oligarchy are getting better than ever at splitting us up and convincing us it&#39;s &quot;red vs blue&quot; instead of &quot;us vs them.&quot; I see more and more people, especially on the far right and left getting giddy to hurt their fucking neighbors, and I gotta tell ya, whether you see our masters as shifty jews or conniving capitalists, whatever they are they&#39;re happier with us attacking each other instead of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To the people on the left, just remember not everybody in a red cap is a fascist. More often they&#39;re hardworking people that saw the same blatant corruption in our government you do, but out of desperation they made the mistake of trusting one wing of the machine that then pumped them full of fascist propaganda and got their fear, hatred and suspicion pointed at the poor, people of color and foreigners, anywhere but at the man behind the curtain.</p>

<p>To people on the right, please understand that not all people who support LGBQT rights are out to destroy the family unit, and a lot of self proclaimed communists are &quot;useful idiots&quot; who probably mean well, but are being used by fascists to achieve an end goal that will discard them shortly after they&#39;ve outlived their usefulness. You understand a rich, &quot;progressive&quot; elite is manipulating our whole society, but what if I told you that doesn&#39;t automatically mean &quot;The Democrats&quot; like you learned in school? And you&#39;ll notice, despite all their drama and infighting, both parties in Washington readily agree on selling us out as whole for a surprisingly low price.</p>

<p>I know both sides have heard a lot of very nasty things about Democrats and Conservatives but I cannot recommend enough getting to understand their views. As long as you&#39;re polite about it, there are tons of forums online where you can talk to folks from either side who will respectfully disagree with you and explain their politics in whatever depth you let them get into. And even if you still disagree once you understand their side of the story, at least you&#39;ll be able to talk shit about them way better.</p>

<p>A great conflict is coming. Thanks to automation and several other factors the need for labor is going to rapidly decline and leave the ruling class of the USA with millions of ordinary people they have no idea how to feed, house or otherwise occupy themselves. Rather than having bored, hungry and desperate masses who might question the status quo, I think they&#39;d rather us just kill us off in the most politically convenient way possible. And what better way than siccing us on each other? Just don&#39;t fall for it. We&#39;ve come so far as a species and our wildest fantasies are so close to fruition. We could well get our shit together and go full Star Trek and conquer the stars as a functional group within a century. But if these fuckers win only the the most corrupt, awful people will survive; they&#39;ll destroy the planet in half that time and then whatever society that escapes this rock will be even more dark, depraved and corrupt than our ruling class is now. Don&#39;t let that happen y&#39;all. Think for yourself, try to learn everything you can about the &quot;other&quot; and realize that you probably want the same things when all the propaganda is removed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am genuinely enthusiastic to see how many people think along these lines. The only point I disagree with is that &#39;a great conflict is coming&#39;. I&#39;ve been alive almost fifty years and was part of the underground for many of those years. I believed in the eighties we were days away from a nuclear apocalypse. In the nineties I watched the rise of the black bloc globally and thought the culture war was sure to begin. Daily you can find dozens of reasons to worry (or hope) that change will come swiftly but I now doubt that will ever be true. I do believe that the power to change belongs to the majority. Dialog like this thread should encourage everyone to be kinder and more understanding of each other. In other words, don&#39;t take their bait. If we start there, change will happen everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Under Mexican law, illegal immigration is punishable up to two years in prison. Immigrants who re-enter after being deported can face 10 years in prison.

<p>Their laws are even tougher than the conservative state of Arizona, so yes it is in fact worse for illegals to cross into Mexico</p>

<p>for what it&#39;s worth, that&#39;s what the far right wants as well. i think the two sides just disagree about how to get there.</p>

<p>On the Left, you&#39;ve got Star Trek, and on the Right, you&#39;ve got Warhammer 40k.</p>

<p>The Trekkies think that people are basically good, that Space Communism is possible where people take only what they need (very little relative to what their machines produce), and that people will voluntarily work together under a Galactic Federation that is fundamentally non-violent and non-confrontational.</p>

<p>The Space Marines think that people are basically evil, that Space Fascism is the only way to survive in a world where people can summon planet-destroying horrors, that there are not enough resources for everyone to get what they want, and that the Imperium can only be preserved through violence.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, both sides have forgotten what it means to be free.</p>

<p>Most Trump voters are members of the working class. They are passionate about issues that affect the working class, and they generally believe that the system is rigged against them. They&#39;re right to think this. Many of them want to take back their power from the elites. Some of them have been incensed to the point of being willing to take that power by force. </p>

<p>On the other hand, most socialists are members of the working class. They are passionate about issues that affect the working class, and they generally believe that the system is rigged against them. They&#39;re right to think this. Many of them want to take back their power from the elites. Some of them have been incensed to the point of being willing to take that power by force. </p>

<p>Get what I&#39;m saying?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a libertarian socialist. I used to hang out in r/the_donald until I was banned for supporting the kind of universal healthcare that Trump praised while campaigning in 2016. The typical users there are ABSOLUTELY potential allies to socialists in their goal of furthering workers rights, and many of them are totally down with progressive ideas like universal healthcare too. It&#39;s really kind of interesting, but if you can advocate for socialism without using the word &quot;socialism&quot;, many Trump fans will think what you&#39;re saying is great. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I was upvoted in r/the_donald for saying things like &quot;the workers need to seize their power back from the elites who rig the system against us all.&quot; </p>

<p>ps side note: I&#39;m also permanently banned from r/socialism for saying things like &quot;Trump voters are members of the proletariat too&quot; and &quot;the real enemy is the top 1% who use propaganda for class warfare to turn us against our fellow proles.&quot; Because there was many people directly advocating for literal domestic terrorism against these poor, working class people with no political power. I was also massively upvoted and gilded for those comments, but just like the r/the_donald mods who censored me, they banned regardless. </p>

<p>I&#39;d really advise you to read the wikipedia pages for those. In fact, here</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Etymology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Etymology</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism</a></p>

<p>You have been deeply mislead about both of these terms by the liberal media (which funny enough FOX news is an example of). &quot;Libertarian&quot; refers to anarchists (state-hating communists like yours truly) every where and when in the world excepting the USA for the last half century. So what changed fifty years ago? A free market fascist named Murray Rothbard &quot;captured&quot; the term for republicans who like weed and think only the poor should pay for public goods who funded this propaganda.</p>

<p>Liberalism is republicanism is the ideology of the framers of the US. Y&#39;know, secularism, free markets, junk like that. Only in that same last half century has the fascist wing of the american right been attempting to distance their liberal, libertine asses from classical liberals and social democrats (both breeds of liberal who almost always favor the free market over democratic power) by conflating the terms &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;socialist&quot; which mean entirely different things.</p>

<p>Socialism is actually just literal democracy, as in you can&#39;t buy votes like in liberal &quot;democracy&quot;. Yeah, the USSR dropped the ball and made all us lefties look bad, but they were never even socialist, let alone communist, for the simple fact that their central power structure was never democratic. For examples of successful socialism, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation">EZLN&#39;s turf</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Federation_of_Northern_Syria">The FDBS</a></p>

<p>No, I&#39;m using the definitions the entire world uses outside of the USA&#39;s bullshit media and it&#39;s brainwashed followers. Those definitions are meant to obfuscate, that you believe that there are socialists in the US government is proof you have been mislead.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They aren&#39;t terribly different, they&#39;re both schools of liberalism. WHat you don&#39;t seem to understand is that we live in a fundamentally liberal system, &quot;conservatives&quot; are just trying to conserve their social power from the cruder old transitory phases of liberalism. But most of them aren&#39;t advocating fascism or monarchy, so they&#39;re still liberals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We ate also talking about socialism in the US. The definition of a political ideology can differ place to place.</p>

<p>Yes, but you can&#39;t just call everyone to the left of you a socialist and expect to be taken seriously by anyone who knows what that word means.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s it, globalization is the real issue and by attacking THEM LIBERALS You are furthering their agenda.</p>

<p>What? Not only is globalization not inherently bad, liberalism is the bad part of internationalism and by attacking liberalism we can pave the way for constructive, mutually beneficial global cooperation that will be necessary to survive the ecological consequences liberalism has wrought on us.</p>

<p>The fact that .001% of people control half the world&#39;s wealth is the greatest conspiracy in the history of mankind, and we need to focus on correcting that. It&#39;s still too early for pitchforks, so we need to at least attempt to vote in representatives who are for term limits, making corporations and the wealthy pay what they owe to society, and a universal basic income.</p>

The basic point he&#39;s making out is that its inconsistent everybody expects &quot;whites&quot; to support a full mixed race worldwide yet laws and culture in most other countries do not support this idea and I guarantee you all other cultures wish to protect their culture as much if not more than white people.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  I consider myself libertarian and am considered crazy from both the left and right.  I believe that you should be able to freely live and do as you please as long as you aren&#39;t infringing on another persons right to do the same.  If you aren&#39;t harming others then you should be left alone.  This means I agree with both gay marriage and the right to bear arms.  I believe that if we all quit thinking we need to make/regulate other people to do what we think they should be doing or force them not to do things we don&#39;t like we would be a much happier and cooperating society. Yet my position is the mocked and delusional position.  Of course we need to do everything we can to force other people to act in a way that pleases us.  I don&#39;t get this mentality.

Communists have killed far more people than Nazis over the years but they don’t get painted in the same light. Why do you think that is? It’s because communism is an absolutely ineffective, impossible system that never works because of human nature. It does, however, work wonderfully if the design is to disempower a country and create a population completely in the thrall of Big Government. We have limited government in this country. What makes you think a system where we give more power to a government is going to be better and not worse? This defies logic. </p>

<p>Look, I can tell you’re not one of them. But those people want to weaken our country so our people are so watered down and subjugated that they can do as they please.

<p>Lol at this website.</p>

<p>Nice try. </p>

<p>Wow you are a being of pure enlightenment you actually don’t want to kill right wingers you just think they are morons.</p>

<p>What’s happening is that people’s only spectrum is that right wingers are either stupid or they want to kill them.</p>

<p>Nah son.</p>

<p>There is no fascist message to donald
Trump.</p>

<p>Quit your bs.</p>

<p>Your the ones being brainwashed and it’s not “the rich” in general, it’s a certain group of the elites at a very high level who operate as organized crime.</p>

<p>You’ve correctly identified that they want us to fight.</p>

<p>What you haven’t realized is they do not support trump and are in fact afraid as hell of him.</p>

<p>Racism?</p>

<p>Your full of if. Concern about illegal immigration is not racism.</p>

<p>It’s not.</p>

<p>The real psy op is the idea that the cabal your referring to actually can control you and that the future isn’t bright.</p>

<p>This whole idea that automation is going to cause a massive struggle is total nonsense.</p>

<p>It’s not. The free market will sort that out just fine as it always has.</p>

<p>The economy is purposely crashed in order to buy up assets at a fire sale. They are just trying to convince us that the next crash is inevitable so they can attempt to implement communism/global governance.</p>

<p>It won’t work.</p>

<p>Also your example of outright lies from conservative media is nonsense.</p>

<p>No one knows how many illegal aliens may be voting but your a complete idiot if you don’t think many of them are.</p>

<p>Its extremely easy to get a license as in illegal immigrant and then your registered to vote.</p>

<p>There’s a damn seperate entrance at the rev in most states for immigrants.</p>

<p>They are given massive leeway with documentation. I’ve seen this with my own eyes.</p>

<p>You can buy all the fake documents you need to become a register voter.</p>

<p>You read websites like snopes and self refer to your own outlets to prove conservative media is lieing.</p>

<p>You can’t disprove a claim without evidence and there’s no hard proof that 3 million illegals are not voting. </p>

<p>The claim being made is that there is evidence that indicates around 3 million illegals <strong>may be</strong> voting,</p>

<p>You can debunk something that could be happening by saying there is not yet evidence for it.</p>

<p>The fact is, 90% of the media elites are absurdly against donald trump to a point of complete absurdity.</p>

<p>And you are all so brainwashed out there that you think handing out the olive branch of peace is calling right wingers deluded racists who don’t “know any better”.</p>

<p>If you understood economics you’d understand how this whole system works.</p>

<p>The right wing is fundamentally correct about the economy in its basic principles</p>

<p>The uniparty deep state takes away the wrong regulations and structures tax cuts in the wrong way to discredit the fundamental economic truth that a low tax low but smart regulation environment lifts all boats and will lead to economic growth and stability that continues.</p>

<p>That’s why the right is the punching bag, because the fundamental economic truths are on the right.</p>

<p>So theirs this injection of  racism and wedge issues into the right and a ton of psy ops operating to make the right appear racist.</p>

<p>One of my pet peeves is how the more niche political ideologies have to be so precisely defined in the eyes of most people, yet the mainstream movements can be so many different things.</p>

<p>For example, the Republican party includes deficit hawks and corporate welfare junkies.  It includes pro-life and pro-family-planning groups.  It includes rednecks and free-market economists.  Yet they can all identify as Republican, thinking that words means very different things.</p>

<p>Yet if I say libertarian and disagree on say one point, like maybe I&#39;m more of an environmentalist, then nope, I&#39;m not a libertarian, go find another ideology?  Screw that.</p>

Don’t they know that insurance companies highlight locker rooms as a high-risk area for abuse that should be carefully monitored and protected?</p>

<p>Don’t they know that one out of every four little girls will be sexually abused during childhood, and that’s without giving predators free access to them while they shower? Don’t they know that, for women who have experienced sexual trauma, finding the courage to use a locker room at all is a freaking badge of honor? That many of these women view life through a kaleidoscope of shame and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, dissociation, poor body image, eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, difficulty with intimacy, and worse?”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why <a href="/u/erietemperance">/u/erietemperance</a> even brings up the minimum wage because there are plenty of ways that businesses from huge corporations to small business already pay workers both less than minimum wage and less than what they even deserve.</p>

<p>Unpaid internships, monthly stipend internships, 1099&#39;ing instead of hiring employees, outsourcing overseas to country with no min. wage and lower cost of living (ie, India and Pakistan for coding and places like Mexico and Phillipines for call centers, etc), paying under the table for illegal immigrants, etc. </p>

<p>Then lets look at wage theft and how much employers already steal free labor from employees
<a href="https://i.redd.it/grnr8kxbl6zz.jpg">https://i.redd.it/grnr8kxbl6zz.jpg</a></p>

<p>So any employer whining about the minimum wage is either dishonest or just a worse businessman than all the others that have plenty of work-arounds to squeeze more blood out of their employees.</p>

At a price as high as double what it is now, you can kiss between 25-50% of jobs goodbye. They just aren&#39;t demanding enough to warrant that pay. It&#39;s not a small business owner&#39;s fault that our government doesn&#39;t provide single payer healthcare. It&#39;s not their fault that people have no financial education of any form, and they aren&#39;t learning skills that have value in the new marketplace. And it&#39;s not their fault that automated workforces are already becoming cheaper than human labor. People laugh at the coal miners and cab drivers that are upset with market innovations, but forget that when jobs like checkout person become obsolete. You will destroy these jobs by raising the minimum wage, flat out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, you&#39;re totally right that you can&#39;t paint in broad strokes. that&#39;s why you can&#39;t just say &quot;antifa are bad folks.&quot; again, antifa is not some big organization, it&#39;s an ideology that intersects with other ideologies.</p>

<p>antifa isn&#39;t communist necessarily. there are anarchists who consider themselves antifa. anarchists and communists bicker constantly, they just agree in that they don&#39;t like plain ol&#39; racism. (side note; that doesn&#39;t even mean they are, say, pro-immigration to the point a lot of the right thinks leftists are (as in letting everyone in unchecked). it means they want to work against the systematic oppression non white people face in the US.)</p>

<p>also, the &quot;commies killed 100 trillion people&quot; hyperbole is a pretty well-researched area of propaganda. the only mass-scale deaths from communism (which most communists would argue has never existed, at least not for long enough before the CIA shut it down) are the famine under Stalin&#39;s regime, but those official numbers still total less than the Holocaust&#39;s.</p>

<p>again, you&#39;re right in that it&#39;s <em>not that simple</em> and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t go around blubbering that every Trump voter is a fascist or an idiot! but our systems need change, they need revolution, and these changes need to come for the good of the majority. I doubt your idea of Communism is what antifa/leftists have in mind and I am totally willing to discuss it further with you or anyone else who can bother to hear me out.</p>

<p>And the elite are not shadowy or abstract. They&#39;re people like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos  and most of the political class. They&#39;re identifiable people with home addresses, who publicly act against the working class.</p>

<p>If wage labor in a modern, western nation is equivalent to historical slavery in this ideological stance of yours, I simply have no words left.</p>

<p>Not equivalent, just not fundamentally different. They&#39;re both coerced, wage labor just heaps on the abstractions to convince the workers that living in a world where they are not guaranteed any share of their natural heritage, this fucking wonderland of a planet we all deserve access to, they must instead must beg for it on their knees from a landed, hereditary aristocracy that is not obligated to do anything productive, and that all of this is fair and voluntary. It isn&#39;t. Try &quot;not participating in the system&quot; on a budget below the poverty line and you&#39;ll see what I mean, you&#39;ll be beaten and arrested before the month is out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So just for the record you don&#39;t see anything wrong with this statement &quot;whether you see our masters as shifty jews or conniving capitalists, whatever they are, they&#39;re happy we&#39;re attacking each other instead of them.&quot; ?</p>

<p>From my standpoint it clearly breaks several of the sub&#39;s rules. </p>
