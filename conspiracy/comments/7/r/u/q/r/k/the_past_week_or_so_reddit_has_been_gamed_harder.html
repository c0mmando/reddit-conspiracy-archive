<p>I don&#39;t really know where else on Reddit to post this. I hope it&#39;s okay here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on Reddit frequently the past week or so and have noticed threads from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> shoot up to the #1 slot on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, then disappear from the front page after 30 minutes or so.</p>

<p>The site has been shilly for a solid 4-5 years but I have never seen this kind of behavior before. It&#39;s mostly anti-trump stuff from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. I couldn&#39;t care less for the guy, for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incredible spin, mate.  That has bullshit on the face of it.  CTR, ShareBlue, etc have been harassing Trump supporters from the beginning, and one of the very few popular outlets they have to go to (Reddit) has them forced into a select couple subreddits where they can voice their opinion without a mass flood of downvotes.  Not to mention that the most popular Trump supporter subreddit (T_D) has been discredited and attacked by other communities site-wide, even bearing the brunt of reddit&#39;s new &quot;algorithm changes&quot; which have effectively taken their posts off of r/all.  </p>

<p>The extreme leftist groups such as CTR have been trying to control the conversation for a while.  Just look at twitter for examples.  Banning right wing conversation groups under the excuse of &quot;hate speech.&quot;  That shit happens here, and you are being disingenuous by stating otherwise.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  It is explicit conversation control.  It was painfully obvious by how hard and fast r/politics flipped from Bernie to Hillary, and anybody who was bitter about the screwjob got shunned and bullied.  The people who work for these shill companies are the lowest form of human.  Anyone eager enough to fuck up their own country and sell out their fellow neighbors for a quick buck deserves a trip to hell.  </p>
