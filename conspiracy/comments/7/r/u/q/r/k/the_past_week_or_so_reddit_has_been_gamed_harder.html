       You know how people have been complaining about
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       being flooded with politics? Well so has
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really know where else on Reddit to post this. I hope it's okay here.

      <p>
       I've been on Reddit frequently the past week or so and have noticed threads from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       shoot up to the #1 slot on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , then disappear from the front page after 30 minutes or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The site has been shilly for a solid 4-5 years but I have never seen this kind of behavior before. It's mostly anti-trump stuff from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . I couldn't care less for the guy, for what it's worth.

       Someone the other day posted a list of like 40 subs dedicated to "resisting" and other people started adding to it with ones the op had missed.  Contrasting that with TD, one sub and a handful of little TD spin offs with a few thousand subscribers each.  It's pretty obvious who is gaming the site the most.

       Pretty smart strategy by Cambridge Analytica. Get all of your supporters in one place, ban anyone who disagrees to turn it into a giant circlejerk where everyone upvotes everyone else so the admins can't tell what's real and what's bots.

       Incredible spin, mate.  That has bullshit on the face of it.  CTR, ShareBlue, etc have been harassing Trump supporters from the beginning, and one of the very few popular outlets they have to go to (Reddit) has them forced into a select couple subreddits where they can voice their opinion without a mass flood of downvotes.  Not to mention that the most popular Trump supporter subreddit (T_D) has been discredited and attacked by other communities site-wide, even bearing the brunt of reddit's new "algorithm changes" which have effectively taken their posts off of r/all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The extreme leftist groups such as CTR have been trying to control the conversation for a while.  Just look at twitter for examples.  Banning right wing conversation groups under the excuse of "hate speech."  That shit happens here, and you are being disingenuous by stating otherwise.

       The biggest problen for me personally is that if you don't agree with the trump hate crowd they frame you as right wing. There is a huge blob of folks like me that have no political home now.

       Yes.  It is explicit conversation control.  It was painfully obvious by how hard and fast r/politics flipped from Bernie to Hillary, and anybody who was bitter about the screwjob got shunned and bullied.  The people who work for these shill companies are the lowest form of human.  Anyone eager enough to fuck up their own country and sell out their fellow neighbors for a quick buck deserves a trip to hell.

       As far as i am concerned they are subhuman. Anyone who takes money to warp people's minds, and this goes  for both sides, is a traitor to the human race, and deserve to scrub sewers the rest of their lives. Because, they will obviously do anything for money.

       If you ever click on the accounts that comment on Trending News Articles on Facebook you will find that probably 95% of them aren't real people. It's all Anti-Trump/Anti-Conservative/Anti-White/ Etc. hate. I guarentee that 90% of the people that Voted for Hillary have moved on with their lives and hardley ever think about Trump. The media is attacking every social media platform trying to stir up hate.

       Ya there isn’t. There’s no “collusion” I’m sure everyone that says there is is not a real person. No one cares that much. The muller investigation had a press conference in November and it was totally sad.

       What the hell are you talking about? Brigaded with anti-Trump stuff? Yesterday the top 10+ posts were all identical posts about the same unreleased memo from Nunes, a republican congressman who has a history of manipulating facts to attack the dems.
