        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is all pure conjecture and speculation, so please make sure you have some salt handy, and an open mind to peruse the evidence and points of contention I will bring forth. </p>

<p>I am not <strong>at all</strong> saying any of this will happen, nor am I predicting anything. I am merely compiling a bunch of things in one spot for all to see. What you make of this information is up to you. </p>

<p>We are all well aware of the Michigan meteor last night, if you aren’t, here ya go; <a href="https://gfycat.com/TallEnviousHermitcrab">Michigan Meteor</a>. </p>

<p>Let’s take into account this comment on 4chan, which was made roughly 30 hours before the meteor showed itself <a href="http://imgur.com/aSveqcm">4chan comment says “keep your eyes open in Eastern Michigan”</a>. </p>

<p>And then we have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7qz9cf/the_two_false_missile_warning_test_werent_false/">this post from a throwaway account last night</a></p>

<p>If you have been under a rock, here is what he is referring to with false missile alerts; <a href="https://i.redd.it/r06hu24gqv901.jpg">Hawaii</a>, and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5274289/Japanese-TV-issues-false-North-Korea-missile-alarm.html">Japan</a>. </p>

<p>Now let’s turn our attention for a moment to military shenanigans. We all know about the missing $21Trillion from the DoD, yes? Well if not, here ya go; <a href="http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/top-news/830-million-missing-helicopters-21-trillion-mysterious-items-first-ever-dod-audit-begins/">Metric fuckton of money missing from DoD</a>, <a href="https://missingmoney.solari.com">and another link for posterity</a>. </p>

<p>For those who can’t wrap their head around it; $21 TRILLION IS A LOT OF FUCKING MONEY. Where did it go? What is it being used for? Space defense? Where does Space-X and Zuma fit in? </p>

<p>Another interesting tidbit is that the Army has made it a goal to add 80,000 new troops in short order <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2017/11/27/sma-army-looking-to-recruit-80000-new-soldiers-in-2018/">source</a>, added to which the EU is in the process of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-defence/eu-signs-defense-pact-in-decades-long-quest-idUSKBN1DD0PX">forming itself a military as well</a>. </p>

<p>Now let’s focus on something else; and that is NASA’s failure to detect an asteroid which passed <em>only</em> 75,000 miles away from earth. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5159871/Bus-sized-asteroid-skimmed-past-Earth.html">Asteroid nearly sodomizes us in November</a>. Personally, I don’t at all buy that they didn’t know about this. It is my opinion they kept it a secret because they had no idea if it would hit or miss. Here is a case of another very large asteroid which came closer to earth than anyone would like, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4377440/Massive-1-km-wide-asteroid-set-fly-Earth-April-19.html">This one would have made us dinosaurs</a></p>

<p>How do ya’ll feel about predictive programming, because if you buy into it <a href="https://youtu.be/Qn311NN69VI">then this commercial</a> is quite interesting. There is also a show currently running named <a href="http://m.imdb.com/title/tt6170874/?ref=m_nv_sr_1">Salvation</a>, which is about (surprise surprise) an asteroid barreling towards earth. And to go further back, I’m sure everyone remembers the movies Armageddon and Deep Impact, as well as The Day After Tomorrow. </p>

<p>Let’s circle back to some more meteor sightings and weird shit going on, shall we? </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/UVN6ENAfh6w">This video appears to show an unidentified object destroying a meteor in Russia</a>. This is from 2013, however if you believe a weapon was used to destroy that meteor, then it highlights the fact that weaponry exists to destroy interplanetary objects entering our atmosphere. </p>

<p>Then we have all the <a href="https://youtu.be/L22j1vWSAaI">mysterious booms around the globe</a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/pr6Av0z1WKQ">Another video</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ancient-code.com/mystery-booms-heard-in-64-locations-around-the-world-create-confusion-among-scientists/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ancient-code%2Ffeednow+%28Ancient+Code%29">Booms create confusion amongst scientists</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://mobile.wnd.com/2017/11/boom-mystery-blasts-rattling-the-globe/">Article on the booms</a> </p>

<p>I’m not sure how I personally feel about all of this. There is a lot to suggest things are not as they seem and that (obviously) we are lied to on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Asteroids are usually accompanied by large meteor showers. There could be something heading this way that they have known about for years but aren’t telling us. </p>

<p>Remember Jade Helm? What about the field of FEMA coffins in Georgia? Or the multiple FEMA camps that have popped up? Could all of that be in preparation for an E.L.E that we are being left in the dark about? </p>

<p>And what about Q? Personally I believe he is a legit insider, but I’ve also had reservations about his purpose, and what if his purpose is to distract the conspiracy minds so that we won’t notice what’s coming? I do find it quite interesting that he reminds us all to pray. </p>

<p>Who knows? God knows things are becoming increasingly topsy turvy in this world. I for one, would not be surprised if something of this magnitude is in the near future for us. </p>

<p>Now again, I am not predicting anything here. I just find all of this to be pretty interesting, and I felt the need to share. </p>

<p>As always; love, light, and peace to all of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember back in 2003 or so I woke up one morning to the radio4 today program (uk) and the news caster said a huge meteor was heading toward us expected for around 2019. She said it was serious. That really woke me up. I never heard anything about it again. No other news programs talked about it - it felt like a total D-notice had been applied, which in the UK means the info is pulled for national security etc...I&#39;ve always felt something very odd about the whole thing.

I know this particular riot happened too as I lived just down the road and heard it and saw the aftermath with all the police cars. I think broadcasting news of the riot was shut down to stop &#39;copycat&#39; riots springing up. It&#39;s likely other broadcasts are pulled for similar reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have entered the &quot;new age&quot; which is considered by some to be a time of spiritual awakening and amplified cognitive energy.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read up on this in forever, wish I could provide more interesting sources. In my mind, the bottom line is that the human brain operates on the same EMF frequency released by the planet. When the sun&#39;s energy is amplified, the earth&#39;s energy is amplified, and our energy is amplified. </p>

<p>Increased EMF energy is used as therapy and has extensive scientific documentation. It is also known that living in space leaves astronauts with serious neurological disorders. I believe the two are connected, and it&#39;s because our brains feed off the earth&#39;s energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>ahem</em> as far as facts go, yes, we are literally, physically entering the Age of Aquarius. But just as the year 2018 or the Year of the Dog means absolutely nothing to most except for a label humans created for a point in time and space - so is the zodiological  effect of astronomical ages unless you personally choose to make it viable in your own life.

    <div class="md"><p>The zodiac system was also made up and chosen. Before humans there was nothing to mark the passing of time or what was to come on an astronomical scale. The age of Aquarius astrologically marks our current location in the solar system. So so years. Except for the Zodiac came far before our current date system. Humans made both things up, and now they exist. I am not saying the age of Aquarius beckons in spiritual enlightenment. I am saying that it physically means we are where we are in space and time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it really is a fact. It has to do with where the sun rises every spring equinox (I think). For the past 2000 (approx.) years the sun has risen in the constellation of Pisces each March equinox. But it is slowly moving to the constellation of Aquarius, where it will stay for another 2,000 years.</p>

<p>This is a proven thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting thoughts, I definitely see some connections.  Last night when I heard about Michigan it reminded me of a series of posts a couple of months ago. There is a site, and I apologize I don&#39;t recall the name, that tracks meteors.  Someone posted a screenshot from this site and wrote extensively about it showing something very strange.  On an otherwise quiet day the post was swarmed by people saying nothing happened out of the ordinary, move along now. </p>

<p>Between meteor activity, that flying cigar thing from outside our solar system, and the fighter pilot UFO video it seems like a lot of odd things all at once.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about any of this to make even a guess but it seems strange this post pops up, causes a furor, a cigar shaped object comes into the solar system, the Pentagon shows video of an object they can&#39;t account for, a secret payload is launched then reported a total loss, people report strange lights in Alabama, Hawaii issues a mistaken EMS signal, then Japan does the same,  then a meteor causes a 2.4 magnitude earthquake near Detroit.    </p>

<p>It was too many coincidences.  These could all be unrelated but your post made me wonder if there is more to this than I thought. It was a great post. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely surprised by that.  If they reported it a success, people would keep demanding to know what was in it.  They&#39;re trying to stop people from questioning.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would think the increasing threat from China, Russia, and NK pose a more significant threat to the US in terms of air defense. I mean, the introduction of hypersonic delivery vehicles only complicates matters. Although, if you can defend against a hypersonic man made delivery system, the ability to hit a space based incoming object is easier. One item of note, the ballistic missile defense systems primarily use kinetic energy to destroy a target, whereas a large asteroid/meteor would probably need more than kinetic from a relatively small vehicle to disrupt its impact.</p>

It&#39;s how I got to go to srt school (it was still going on until around 2009). The reasoning was because they wanted to grow the mp branch by about 60k.

<p>Nasa has discovered 10 potentially hazardous asteroids
On top of the 10 “potentially hazardous” objects, Nasa says that they have identified 97 other space rocks and seen an unexplained spike in comet activity.
&quot;There are Millions of Asteroids in the solar system, usually found in the Asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, however those in that pass the Earth are called Near-Earth objects</p>

<p>The findings come shortly after a group of Czech scientists warned fragments of asteroids which could wipe out entire countries are hidden in the Taurids meteor shower.</p>

<p>The startling finding means that experts may not be able to spot the massive space rock hidden in the annual Taurids meteor shower until it is too late.</p>

And it&#39;s not like no one was taking about North Korea when isis was all the rage, so it&#39;s understandable they&#39;d start to being up meteors while north Korea is all the rage.<br/>
I see it as a fluid process between the steps, to appear organic. </p>

<p>At most 32 m in size and at closest 117,000 km. That&#39;s like trying to spot a lump of charcoal the size of a quarter in Washington DC from Baltimore. And that&#39;s when it was at its <em>closest</em>.</p>

I highly recommend you use Tineye and reverse image search the alien pictures yourself. One of the things that convinced me most was the guy who posted coords, and afterwards posted a picture of a UFO he saw fling above his house. Later that night I also saw my first UFO encounter that matched his, three lights shining above in the sky. </p>

<p>Lmao. That was a good laugh. Fake as shit tho. If you scroll down far enough some explain why they think it is. Reading that was enough for me, but I also did photo analysis and ofc they wouldn&#39;t show up in reverse image search cuz they ran it through a photo editor. My fav is the moon pic, it looks like an original Ms paint spray can lmfao.</p>

<p>He is either John le bonn trying to grow his fan base (almost all the videos he references are made by him and require paid membership for $20 every 4 weeks).</p>

<p>Or he is paid to direct traffic to the site or a groupie. None of John le Bond list make sense and rarely offer other than promises to blow your mind, condescension to both “notmies” and “consiritards” and promises that all this wisdom can be had for a mere $5/weeks... fir the price of just one Australian cup of coffee (well some fancy latte), you can listen John le bonn blow your mind with his genius blogs and you can even watch him slay doubters on online round tables...</p>

<p>So far as far as I can tell he has espoused:</p>

<ul>
<li>doesn’t believe it atoms</li>
<li>flat earth theories (claims he is not a flat earther but Lai doesn’t believe in a round rotating earth orbiting the sun so who knows a hat he believes)</li>
<li>doesn&#39;t believe dinosaurs exist</li>
<li>does not believe missile most can fly, based on another John Le Bon video that misapplies (or actually just gets it wrong) basic Newtonian physics, flight controls, and principles of flight</li>
<li>does not believe nuclear weapons are real</li>
<li>cigarettes are not linked to cancer</li>
<li>no one died on 9/11

<p>It has no actual criticism outside the &quot;doesn&#39;t this sound improbable!&quot;</p>

<p>People first measured the size of an atom by looking at an oil slick.</p>

<p>People first discovered the quantization of electrical charge by misting oil between two plates with and electric charge on them.</p>

<p>People discovered wave/particle duality by shining light at a couple slits.</p>

<p>People first measured the size of the planet thousands of years ago with basic trigonometry.</p>

<p>These are clever things, which apparently to some incredibly un-clever people proves science is wrong because... Something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I could give it a go. What sorts budget do I have? </p>

<p>You&#39;d just need to measure the force between a big dense sphere and a small dense sphere really close together, and take the ratio of that force and their mass and use it to get the mass of the Earth.</p>

<p>Do I need to figure out the distance to the moon, or do I need to figure that out? I&#39;d need a second observer hundreds of miles away or more (but a well known/measured distance)  make a simultaneous moon observation to figure out the distance to it (parallax angle with background stars) , </p>

<p>Knowing it&#39;s period (or do I need to keep my own moon observations over time?) and distance, we know the acceleration required to keep it in orbit there. From our Force from mass observations, we can solve for what mass would give a force that would accelerate that mass at the needed acceleration.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even calculus, it&#39;s basic Newtonian motion and trigonometry. You could totally do it in a shed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignore him, he goes around this site linking to non informative John le Bon blog posts like thus all day. </p>

<p>His brand of skepticism boils down to the fact that he lacks  understanding of basic science principles and theories, down to basic newtonian physics up to atomic/ quantum physics therefore its not real. </p>

<p>He he misunderstands basic planetary science by trying to reduce it to an early experiment. He main argument since he does not actually understand it is that some guy did it long ago in a shed... which misses that most science was done in a shed or attic at the time and that these experiments have been replicated and built on with more advanced and standardized approaches.</p>

<p>He is either John le bonn trying to grow his fan base (almost all the videos he references are made by him and require paid membership for $20 every 4 weeks).</p>

<p>Or he is paid to direct traffic to the site or a groupie. </p>

<p>None of John le Bond posts make any sense and rarely offer any substance other than promises to blow your mind, condescension to both “notmies” and “consiritards” and promises that all this wisdom can be had for a mere $5/weeks... that’s right, for the price of just one Australian cup of coffee (well some fancy latte), you can listen John le bonn blow your mind with his genius blogs and you can even watch him slay doubters on online round tables...</p>

<p>So far as far as I can tell he has espoused:</p>

<ul>
<li>doesn’t believe it atoms</li>
<li>flat earth theories (claims he is not a flat earther but Lai doesn’t believe in a round rotating earth orbiting the sun so who knows a hat he believes)</li>
<li>doesn&#39;t believe dinosaurs exist</li>
<li>does not believe missile most can fly, based on another John Le Bon video that misapplies (or actually just gets it wrong) basic Newtonian physics, flight controls, and principles of flight</li>
<li>does not believe nuclear weapons are real</li>
<li>cigarettes are not linked to cancer</li>
<li>no one died on 9/11</li>
<li>ancient Greeks didn’t exist </li>
</ul>

<p>etc...</p>

His gravitational calculations were able to consistently produce answers based on both expected masses as well as orbits, and they match.  If you were to perform the same calculations, you would get the same results.  If you were able to come up with an explanation that matched all of the necessary criteria, then go right ahead and disprove him, and Newton did this long before Cavendish.</p>

<p>Let me give a free tip for any and all would be conspiracy theorists and consumers: less is more. You added a VW commercial which was released very recently. Zero relevance to anything scientific but the timing is interesting, so you’re not really bolstering the factual portions of your theory but you’re not taking away from them too much either. Then you go on to mention Armageddon which we all know was a documentary based on real life events, not an impossibly fake depiction full of gaping plot holes with as much scientific relevance as a baking soda volcano. </p>

<p>You included some pictures of the meteor crashing into earth as some sort of meteor ray when they are obviously pictures of a meteor hitting earth’s surface. If you guys can point out a laser weapon with a mushroom cloud coming out of it, I’d love to see it. </p>

<p>You included a link to a British rag with less relevance to factual reporting than the Daily Mail as an edit. An edit! You actually grabbed that turd after your original thought process and threw it in there. Really?</p>

<p>Instead of grabbing every worthless bit of info that pertains to your story, stick with the facts and let others add to it. Discredit anything that looks like shit immediately. Instead of enjoying a perfectly cooked steak dinner, you guys are dumping ketchup all over everything and taking bites while also looking at some overcooked tendies at the next table. </p>

<p>Buddy, I’m concerned if you live on your own and impressed you’ve survived this long if you do. Kudos. </p>

<p>The common sense is that a laser does not have a mushroom cloud coming out of it. It also doesn’t support the facts that thousands of people witnessed the meteor and that it hit the ground causing a 2.0mag impact. It’s also common sense that the movie Armageddon was rife with factual and scientific inaccuracies and should not have been included in the post. Here is some additional information on that if it’s too difficult to wrap your head around:

(There’s too many to post. If you’re not satisfied, just google more). </p>

<p>It’s also important to note that large impacts don’t simply cause mass extinction as the trajectory and location of impact have more influence than just the size. There’s still a debate on exactly how the mass extinctions played out, but we won’t be able to prevent them by sending the best goddamn oil drilling crew on the planet into space to blow it up. </p>

<p>Yeah, you get the award for dumbest comment of the day. Tell me again, what foreign leader did Trump not do well when they met? </p>

<p>Again solidifying my point you don&#39;t need to be a Trump supporter to agree. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Almost as retarded as your previous sentence. Followed with no proof to support the argument. You hate him so much you can no longer be an objectionable observer. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He just called Africa a fucking shithole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting on the &#39;ol <em>&quot;more righteous than thou&quot;</em> hat, again? You are deflecting none the less. Also, Africa is a shithole. Detroit. Shithole.  LA? Cesspool. Now what? Africa is a shithole. Go move  to Africa  where they sell black slaves in Libya. Where 90+% of the women in Somalia have female genital mutilation done to them(I&#39;m sure they agreed to it, too.) Or where South Africans farmers are murdered...because they are white. Which country is the shining star of Africa you imbecile? Should we continue with Boko Haram or how about the child armies? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your theory is interesting but I had a few comments. Not bashing just adding to the discussion.</p>

<p>Regarding Q and his/her post saying something would happen in eastern michigin I will admit is impressive. I had previously been unimpressed by his predictions because they were pretty vague. How ever the only quarral with the prediction and this is VERY minor is that they predicted  the wrong day. They predicted it would happen on monday but it happend on a tuesday. Again very minor thing just interesting.</p>

<p>Assuming they are hiding this from us (I am not entirely convinced thats the case) This is extreme optimism but they could be hiding it to avoid mass panic? If the government came out and said &quot;oh yeah guys btw bunch of meteors heading this way they might hit us&quot; it could cause problems. I don&#39;t think these meteors would be sent by us because theres no real reason to. It could be aliens but I don&#39;t believe that the type of aliens with advanced technology exists.</p>

<p>Also complete sidenote for OP. What do you think of all the religious stuff attached to conspiracys?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I’m 99% sure the reason it would be hidden would be to keep mass panic from happening. No doubt in my mind there. </p>

<p>As for the religious stuff; I am of the opinion that it doesn’t matter what you, or I believe. What matters is that TPTB are Satanic/Saturn Occultists, and they believe in it, and researching/knowing what they believe and how to fight that darkness can only help us. IMO; there is absolutely dark and light energy/entities. And they play a role in what happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually don&#39;t participate in this things. But I lived in At most of my life, in tucuman, near Amaicha and Atacama desert.<br/>
I used to go there and nearby valleys (3000/5000 meters high and deserts) a lot with friends, there are even observatories , one I think of nada, there do to how good the sky is.  </p>

<p>Ok, we used to see very weird shit, but really weird, many bright things falling, half size the moon, and even objects flying that would change directions in absurd ways that a satellite couldn&#39;t. At a point we thought maybe militar from other places was practicing shit around there since it was the only viable explanation for us.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>um...this sent chills down my spine. I&#39;ve never heard such a similar account to mine before.</p>

<p>In Summer &#39;95 I was stargazing and saw what looked to be a standard satellite (it looks like a slow moving star for those that dont know what I mean. The main identifiers that it is no stranger than a sat is that it doesnt change velocity at all, in either magnitude or direction) . But then it made a turn, and began to head back in the direction it had come in. When it reached a point about 30 degrees above the horizon, it started being....erratic.</p>

<p>Then it kinda stretched from a point of light to a line. And then it blinked out and was gone.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it was during the meteor shower but it was in August.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The michigan meteor fell east to west so those are unlikely to be related. Also for Janury 13–19 the estimated meteors to be scene every hour is 4, so definitely an outlier but I wouldn’t say what you saw was anything crazy.

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t answer all your questions but the increased awareness of them is almost certainly down to the spread of dashcams. Previously unless you had a CCTV camera pointed in the exact right direction or someone with the incredibly lucky timing to catch one on video, a meteor would be nothing more than a small bottom of the page article about a bright flash in the sky.</p>

<p>Now we have cameras in millions of cars running at all hours of the day, using wide angle lenses and with a good view of the sky, so you get the kinds of eye-catching videos that get shared by every news station and website around. I can&#39;t be certain but there probably isn&#39;t any change in the number of meteors, just the number that are reported.</p>

<p>A gigantic cosmic impact, when large fragments of a disintegrating comet hit the North American ice cap approximately 12,800 years ago, is identified in my forthcoming book “Magicians of the Gods” as the smoking gun that sparked off a global cataclysm of flood and fire in which an advanced civilization of the last Ice Age, hitherto only remembered in ‘myths’, was wiped out. The scientific case for a comet impact 12,800 years ago has now been further reinforced by a landmark paper in the “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences” (PNAS) the official journal of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Details of the new paper here: <a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-07-cataclysmic-event-age.html">http://phys.org/news/2015-07-cataclysmic-event-age.html</a> and an abstract here: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/07/21/1507146112">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/07/21/1507146112</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, he says we go through areas of the taurid meteor shower branch that are extremely dangerous cyclically and that they predict we may be headed through that area again within the next 20 years. </p>

[and I put the emphasis on the last word of your text I copied] the earth goes around the sun, which goes around the center of the milky way, which goes around the center of it&#39;s super cluster, this means we will never revisit the same spot in space. so the phenomena of us moving into a dangerous area might happen to from time to time, but not cyclically I.E after the same period of time. if so, than we don&#39;t have a way to predict when earth is going to enter such an area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hancock believes the Gobekli stones not only describe an ancient cosmic collision, but predict another.
He thinks that what hit Earth in 10,950BC was actually a massive piece of debris in the Taurid meteor stream, a belt containing millions of space rocks.
Hidden within that belt, according to astrophysicists, is an unexploded bomb of a planetoid, a superheated rock like an orbiting hand grenade.
Sealed inside its thin crust is a boiling mass of tar, building up pressure until it detonates. Thousands of white-hot boulders, a mile or more across, will be set spinning through the meteor stream . . . but we cannot say for certain when that will occur.
Many of these asteroids could be three times the size of the one that hit our planet 65 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs.
If one of those strikes, it could quite literally bring about the end of the world. And we are due to cross the Taurid meteor stream in 13 years, around 2030.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the main arguments of guys like Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson is that a giant meteor flash melted the ice caps around 14,000 years ago and thus flooded and destroyed most of the world/civilization. This is becoming more and more accepted even in mainstream circles with lots of evidence backing it up. They also make some very convincing arguments that these events are cyclical and that the few people who did survive the last impact have given us many clues at places like Gobekli Tepe (on the pillars) that it is coming again and we better pay attention. I am not going to go into all their calculations and evidence, but long story short... we are currently firmly in the period of time that another major impact is expected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hooboy.  You are very sensitive.  Your first link, to which I responded, was to an article on 2003 UB313, which, as I said, has a mass estimated to be .27% of Earth&#39;s mass.  Now you post another link to a hypothetical planet and want to pump up your bruised ego by accusing somebody who didn&#39;t get excited about 2003 UB313, your &quot;Niburu&quot; or whatever.  Okay, so perhaps there is  a planet out in the Kuiper belt.  And..?<br/>
The wiki on Nibiru is revealing:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Nibiru cataclysm is a supposed disastrous encounter between the Earth and a large planetary object (either a collision or a near-miss) which certain groups believe will take place in the early 21st century. Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as Planet X or Nibiru. The idea that a planet-sized object will collide with or closely pass by Earth in the near future is not supported by any scientific evidence and has been rejected by astronomers and planetary scientists as pseudoscience and an Internet hoax.[2][3]</em></p>

<p><strong>The idea was first put forward in 1995 by Nancy Lieder,[4][5] founder of the website ZetaTalk. Lieder describes herself as a contactee with the ability to receive messages from extraterrestrials from the Zeta Reticuli star system through an implant in her brain.</strong> 
She states that she was chosen to warn mankind that the object would sweep through the inner Solar System in May 2003 (though that date was later postponed) causing Earth to undergo a physical pole shift that would destroy most of humanity.[6] The prediction has subsequently spread beyond Lieder&#39;s website and has been embraced by numerous Internet doomsday groups, most of which linked the event to the 2012 phenomenon. Since 2012, the Nibiru cataclysm has frequently reappeared in the popular media, usually linked to newsmaking astronomical objects such as Comet ISON or Planet Nine. Although the name &quot;Nibiru&quot; is derived from the works of the ancient astronaut writer Zecharia Sitchin and his interpretations of Babylonian and Sumerian mythology, he denied any connection between his work and various claims of a coming apocalypse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you&#39;re an obvious troll feigning impartiality while employing passive aggressive character attacks (in typical misinformation fashion) and just looking to muddy the conversation here on subjects you don&#39;t even have an understanding of.  This is not some obscure information, it&#39;s been known for years that there are gravitation signatures indicating there is something large orbiting our solarsystem.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re quoting misinformation from a platform that&#39;s known to be manipulated and skewed because, yet again, you have no clue what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>The idea of the niburu cataclysm does not come from Nancy Lieder (whoever the fuck that is), it comes from the annals of creation in the sumerian tablets as translated by sitchin describing the creation of our earth and destruction of Tiamat, the supposed cause of the asteroid belt. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re one of those people (which you apparently are) who subscribe to the religion of mindless &quot;skepticism&quot; (read; playing dumb and/or expert to advance an agenda), then you could argue that Sitchin&#39;s translations are off base, and many people do, but to advance an idea that Niburu (referred to as Marduk in the annals) is the product of some conspiracy theorist in the 90s is an asinine game for dummies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Currently.  The annals describe Marduk has following a pronounced elliptical orbit, passing very close to the Sun at it&#39;s perigeal point of orbit.  If this were the case, Nasa would have no way to discern this, as the only data we can ascertain is it&#39;s current position in it&#39;s orbit based on gravitational signatures.</p>

<p>Seriously, go fucking read.  This is a pointless conversation because you&#39;re trying to discredit something you don&#39;t have knowledge of.  Go read about it and if you still think it&#39;s not credible, then at least we could have an intelligent conversation about it instead of this bullshit attempt at smearing the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concept of &quot;Niburu,&quot; as you put it, is nonsense.  The whole idea of &quot;Nibiru&quot; is that there is going to be a cataclysm when a mysterious planet approaches Earth in the near future.  That is a fiction that was started by a woman with no scientific credentials. </p>

<p>You tried to move the goalposts by linking to Eris, which is has a paltry .27% of Earth&#39;s mass.</p>

<p>When I mentioned that, you moved the goalposts again by bringing up a proposed Kuiper Belt planet.  Now, assuming that &quot;Planet X&quot; is real, what does that have to do with an impending cataclysm?  Sorry, but while Planet X may exist, it is not your &quot;Niburu.&quot;  There is no impending doom.  There is speculation that there is a massive body in the Kuiper belt that could be a planet, and it is no cause for alarm.</p>

<p>So, &quot;Nibiru&quot; is nonsense.  Could there be another planet 100au from Earth?  Possibly.  Now, I ask:  why should anybody be alarmed by that possibility?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t move any goal posts, I mistakenly thought that article was about &quot;PlanetX&quot;, the large planet affecting our gravity.</p>

<p>&quot;Niburu&quot; is literally just the babylonian name attributed to the planet described by the Sumerians, and so far you&#39;ve introduced that </p>

<p>A) I&#39;m advocating for being alarmed (...what?)</p>

<p>B) that I&#39;m postulating that there will be some cataclysm associated with Niburu.</p>

<p>Both of which have literally no foundation except poor reading comprehension.  The planet most certainly exists, what isn&#39;t sure is if it&#39;s the same.planet the Sumerians describe that has a pronounced elliptical orbit.</p>

Take Hancock + Carlson&#39;s theories, nibiru/planet X theories, then all the info from that documentary, and putting them all together it paints a pretty interesting picture.<br/>
I rarely consider that anyone is absolutely right in their theories, but I do think when someone&#39;s put so much work into it then they&#39;re definitely at least onto something based in reality. Everyone has their own puzzle pieces. It&#39;s then the individuals job to put them all together in some logical fashion that seems to best describe the bigger picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think all flood &quot;myths&quot; are connected. They exist in countless cultures. Christianity stole most it&#39;s ideas from older sources. Another interesting fact is the pillars at Gobekli Tepe (which is at least 11,000 years old and could be even older) depict many different types of animals, and quite a few of them are not native to the area or thought to be even be known about at that time by the builders. When you add that to the other information at Gobekli Tepe about potential cosmic impacts, floods, etc... you get a good basis for the Noah&#39;s Ark story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry... I didn&#39;t mean to say &quot;meteor&quot;... more like large scale cosmic impact. There is evidence that the main area was in Canada... but there are impact sites all over the world that line up from the same bombardment. Graham and Randall have walked back the crust displacement theory (discussed in Fingerprints of the Gods) and focused solely on large scale impact. This is being confirmed by more and more people all the time.</p>

<p>a giant meteor flash melted the ice caps around 14,000 years ago and thus flooded and destroyed most of the world/civilization.</p>

<p>You mean an asteroid caused Earth crust displacement, rotating the Earth around on its core.  The North Pole was on N America and Antarctica was near the equator.  The Earth rotated so that the N Pole came south and melted all the ice while Antarctica shifted to the south pole, flooded, and froze.</p>

<p>It was night and I was laying in bed and it was almost like someone put a tiny sun outside my bedroom window for a split second; it was too bright to be a flashlight or car headlights. Sky was clear and it was completely silent.</p>

<p>It was super weird. No one else in my family was awake at the time and I never heard anyone else mention it.</p>

<p>The only thing I could think of is that it was a meteorite but I feel like I would&#39;ve heard <em>something</em> considering just how incredibly bright the light was and having my windows open. Only thing that would kinda make sense though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked at NASA for four years; work with them now.  NASA scientists can&#39;t keep a secret of that size.  But there are plenty of people who assume they do it routinely.  (Of course, this <em>is</em> <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and of course if they <em>were</em> keeping secrets like this, I&#39;d have been brainwashed to say something like the above -- but if you met me personally you&#39;d know I&#39;m just a regular guy...)</p>

<p>That said, the meteors-causing-missile-alerts theory is pretty interesting, and much more plausible than the idea that NASA knew about (and deliberately hid) the Michigan meteor.  After all, we&#39;ve already had solar storms causing alerts, earthquakes causing alerts, and meteor ground-strikes causing alerts.    On the other hand, meteoric trajectories are quite different from normal ICBM trajectories (much higher speed).  You&#39;d have to get a really unlucky glancing-angle meteorite (unlucky in the sense that it would have to skim the atmosphere at just the right angle at just the right place, to be picked up by a military radar <em>after</em> atmospheric entry had begun but <em>before</em> the altitude got too low) to trigger a match to an expected ICBM trajectory.  Re-entering space junk is another source of false positives, which is one reason NORAD publishes all those two-line elements sets (or used to).  Items close to re-entry are known and tracked to avoid confusing them with new bogies once their orbital elements start to change noticeably.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i have worse things to worry about, much closer to home, such as health problems that impact me on a daily basis, however this wasnt a health thread, this is a thread about covered up asteroid strikes. But again i agree. We all will die, id just rather it not be on tuesday. Also my original question wasnt about the odds or destruction this newly found astroid can dish out, it was about how the uncertainty scale works. And how much a 0-1 on the scale differs from the 7 this one is showing. Considering the torino scale has it all laid out, this one sorta doesnt. Just seems strange to me, out of all of the asteroids they have tracked, a 7 seems pretty high, especially if they say its going to be 1 million miles away, so does that mean its a 70% chance it will be much closer than that? If so, doesnt sound too appealing. Also if i fixed your car, and told you it has a 70% chance of not working, would you feel good about it?</p>

<p>Now imagine if the most respected space agency on the planet comes out and says &quot;yeah, there is a pretty big asteroid out there and we just saw it coming now and if it hits we are going to be blown back into the stone age.&quot;</p>

<p>The video of the Russian meteor, the light marks look a lot like flare reflected of smudges from wiping the glass. The footage has very obvious sensor dust so the area doesn&#39;t seem clean, smudgy glass is very likely, and the flare motion seems more in keeping with tracking across dirty glass than a fast moving object, it breaks up a few seconds later in the video, you&#39;d expect it to be pretty much instantaneous with the forces involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The asteroid that barely missed us is because of the time travelers from the Netflix Documentary &quot;TRAVELERS&quot;, they saved present us, but it didnt fix the future!</p>

<p>Honestly though, i saw the episode where they shoot a laser to deflect an asteroid like 2 months before i read about the real one! (in the show they have to wait 6 months to see if their shennanigans worked).</p>

<p>Maybe you should add this in your list of &quot;coincidences&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... Not sure about destroying incoming meteroids within our atmosphere, but as far as I know, there&#39;s no way to stop or redirect meteors heading toward Earth. There are theories of ways of stopping, slowing, or redirecting them but they are very costly to implement.</p>

<p>As for those old movies, pretty sure that was just a Hollywood phase. End of humanity via a huge meteroid sold tickets back then. Maybe there&#39;s something going on, maybe not. You can almost guarantee we aren&#39;t getting all the info we should be getting, but that&#39;s government agencies for you. </p>

<p>(that&#39;s just my 2 cents on what I feel I can accurately answer)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you would have to shift an asteroid waaaaaaay out from us because it would only be a small shift if we could even get a rocket on it or nuke it.</p>

<p>About the only thing you could do is to intercept it if it&#39;s close with a missile or other kinetic weapon and hope to break it up into small enough pieces that they would then burn up or at least lose mass so impacts would be less. It&#39;s like a shotgun shell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, cost is an issue currently. So is time, materials, and the extent of what our current technology can do. If we needed NASA to redirect a meteor, they would need knowledge of the threat, plenty of time to neutralize it, millions of dollars in funding, plenty of materials, and perhaps technology that isn&#39;t quite there yet.</p>

<p>One solution to an incoming meteor is to launch something that will attach to the meteor from behind and slow it down over time, kinda like an anchor (I forget a lot of details but this a real thing). It&#39;s not a quick solution though. It would require knowing there&#39;s a threat way out there, but incoming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes agreed. But surely cost should not be a factor and the whole world should contribute money and resources to save the planet in the event of this happening. Perhaps maybe spend a lot less on guns and bombs. After all who needs money if you are dead and nobody to leave it to</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That commercial. I haven&#39;t seen it but plenty like it. It makes you wonder whether it&#39;s just entertainment value or whether it was done because it&#39;s what we&#39;re all talking about lately. It also makes you wonder if it was done on purpose as some sort of desensitizing tool.</p>

<p>One thing I will say about just that part of your post is that if all of us are here reading this, we probably all mostly believe that our government and big corporations lie to us. And if that&#39;s true, this stuff counts. And that gives credit to some theory and discredit to others. </p>

<p>I just believe commercials to be in essence a lie no matter what sort of story telling they use. Advertising has always done this: fabricate a story to convince us to buy into something. The story they use never has to be true. That&#39;s a real conspiracy and it doesn&#39;t even have to be that far out there. That&#39;s just fact. </p>

<p>What sells will be used. What&#39;s most effective will be used. Sad but true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last summer I saw a ufo. It was a greyish white vehicle that was trailing behind a large passenger jet, about 5000/10000 ft in the air. It was about half the size of the plane and followed behind it about 200 meters, it was relatively close. The plane was turning to land at Toronto Pearson and the ufo followed exactly behind it. Then as the plane straightened out the ufo flew away. It was a perfectly clear summer day. I watched it fly for about 30 seconds. It was the most bizarre thing because after it was gone, I stood there thinking. No one will ever really believe me. Anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the ideas are interesting, and pretty scary.
but, I think putting all this stock in anons/throwaways takes away from it. 
anon posted on Sunday: keep your eyes on E. Michigan <em>tomorrow</em>, which would have been Monday. meteor happened Tuesday night, I saw it. seems like anon is either bullshitting, or referencing something else. I imagine anyone with super secret intel on an incoming meteor would have a more accurate prediction within a two-day time frame.
adding Q to the discussion feels irrelevant and makes me even more skeptical. </p>

<p>and the throwaway seems like an obvious LARP? main reason being, why imply intel when you could just pose it as a theory? people will put the same stock into it either way, and a theory can be debated while a claim like that boils down to whether or not it&#39;s Fake or True</p>

<p>still, do I find all this interesting? yes, and scary like I said. the mysterious booms, false missile alerts, spacex, hell, what about AATIP? That seems pretty relevant to this imo. I guess I&#39;m just wary of these anonymous posters claiming high level knowledge. if I had classified info, I&#39;d much sooner throw it out there as the theory of an innocent civilian than qualifying it with &quot;btw I&#39;m CIA&quot; as if that&#39;s still a safe option. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So regarding the meteors, someone said the MI one was gonna happen before it dropped, and now more are expected? Also, does that mean the false missile detections in Hawaii and japan were actually meteorites falling and detected as foreign objects?</p>

<p>And yea, 21 Trillion is a shit ton of money. I dunno why more isn&#39;t being said about it... they claim its black ops shit right? Does the gov&#39;t/people buy that? Whenever I mention this missing money, no one I talk to seems to even know about it. Its just trump/Russia all the time. </p>

<p>I think Q may be legit, tho I am also being cautious. Not sure what other motive he may have.... one thing that I don&#39;t buy is the &quot;trump is our savior&quot; stuff, he is doing good stuff witht hat executive order but plenty of his other decisions don&#39;t seem like its for our benefit. </p>

<p>I do think something bigger is going on... I can feel it in the air. I am kinda worried about this lunar eclipse, the triple moon with blue, blood, and lunar eclipse at the end of the month. And regarding Korea.... I feel like there is some bigger symbolism going on there, if indeed NK is a puppet regime just for show.... something bout red/blue shift or a polar shift, like when both sides start actually fighting each other its a signal for something bigger that will happen to earth, I dunno lol. I don&#39;t take NK seriously at all, and not sure why it should even be our problem when they got Russia china japan closer to them. The Olympics being held there was a stupid decision, they shoulda thought about that.... reminds me of the Atlanta bombing (which I also thought about when that blackout at the airport happened). I hope nothing major will happen tho, and the &quot;good side&quot; will be able to accomplish their goals... but it still seems like general public is clueless to most of this stuff. </p>

<p>&quot;This is all pure conjecture and speculation, so please make sure you have some salt handy, and an open mind to peruse the evidence and points of contention I will bring forth.</p>

<p>I am not at all saying any of this will happen, nor am I predicting anything. I am merely compiling a bunch of things in one spot for all to see. What you make of this information is up to you.</p>

<p>We are all well aware of the Michigan meteor last night, if you aren’t, here ya go; Michigan Meteor.  </p>

<p>Let’s take into account this comment on 4chan, which was made roughly 30 hours before the meteor showed itself 4chan comment says “keep your eyes open in Eastern Michigan”. </p>

<p>Link to comment and timestamp - ( <a href="https://imgur.com/aSveqcm">https://imgur.com/aSveqcm</a> )</p>

<p>And then we have this post from a throwaway account last night </p>

<p>If you have been under a rock, here is what he is referring to with false missile alerts; Hawaii, and Japan. </p>

<p>Hawaii Link - ( <a href="https://i.redd.it/r06hu24gqv901.jpg">https://i.redd.it/r06hu24gqv901.jpg</a> )</p>

<p>Now let’s turn our attention for a moment to military shenanigans. We all know about the missing $21Trillion from the DoD, yes? Well if not, here ya go; Metric fuckton of money missing from DoD, and another link for posterity. - ( <a href="https://missingmoney.solari.com/">https://missingmoney.solari.com/</a> )</p>

<p>For those who can’t wrap their head around it; $21 TRILLION IS A LOT OF FUCKING MONEY. Where did it go? What is it being used for? Space defense? Where does Space-X and Zuma fit in? </p>

<p>Another interesting tidbit is that the Army has made it a goal to add 80,000 new troops in short order link to source</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>, added to which the EU is in the process of forming itself a military as well. </p>

<p>Now let’s focus on something else; and that is NASA’s failure to detect an asteroid which passed only 75,000 miles away from earth. Asteroid nearly sodomizes us in November.</p>

<p>Link to Nov Asteroid - ( <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5159871/Bus-sized-asteroid-skimmed-past-Earth.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5159871/Bus-sized-asteroid-skimmed-past-Earth.html</a> )</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t at all buy that they didn’t know about this. It is my opinion they kept it a secret because they had no idea if it would hit or miss. Here is a case of another very large asteroid which came closer to earth than anyone would like, This one would have made us dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Link - ( <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4377440/Massive-1-km-wide-asteroid-set-fly-Earth-April-19.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4377440/Massive-1-km-wide-asteroid-set-fly-Earth-April-19.html</a> )</p>

<p>How do ya’ll feel about predictive programming, because if you buy into it then this commercial is quite interesting. </p>

<p>Link to commercial - ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn311NN69VI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn311NN69VI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a> )</p>

<p>There is also a show currently running named Salvation, </p>

<p>Link to shows imdb - ( <a href="http://m.imdb.com/title/tt6170874/?ref=m_nv_sr_1">http://m.imdb.com/title/tt6170874/?ref=m_nv_sr_1</a> )</p>

<p>which is about (surprise surprise) an asteroid barreling towards earth. And to go further back, I’m sure everyone remembers the movies Armageddon and Deep Impact, as well as The Day After Tomorrow.</p>

<p>Let’s circle back to some more meteor sightings and weird shit going on, shall we? </p>

<p>This video appears to show an unidentified object destroying a meteor in Russia. This is from 2013, however if you believe a weapon was used to destroy that meteor, then it highlights the fact that weaponry exists to destroy interplanetary objects entering our atmosphere. </p>

<p>Link to apparent object intercepting a meteor in Russia - ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVN6ENAfh6w&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVN6ENAfh6w&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a> )</p>

<p>Then we have all the mysterious booms around the globe. Another video. </p>

<p>Link to video #1 - ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L22j1vWSAaI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L22j1vWSAaI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a> )</p>

<p>Booms create confusion among scientists</p>

<p>link - ( <a href="https://www.ancient-code.com/mystery-booms-heard-in-64-locations-around-the-world-create-confusion-among-scientists/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ancient-code%2Ffeednow+%28Ancient+Code%29">https://www.ancient-code.com/mystery-booms-heard-in-64-locations-around-the-world-create-confusion-among-scientists/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ancient-code%2Ffeednow+%28Ancient+Code%29</a> )</p>

<p>Another Article on the booms </p>

<p>link - ( <a href="http://mobile.wnd.com/2017/11/boom-mystery-blasts-rattling-the-globe/">http://mobile.wnd.com/2017/11/boom-mystery-blasts-rattling-the-globe/</a>  ) </p>

<p>’m not sure how I personally feel about all of this. There is a lot to suggest things are not as they seem and that (obviously) we are lied to on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Asteroids are usually accompanied by large meteor showers. There could be something heading this way that they have known about for years but aren’t telling us.</p>

<p>Remember Jade Helm? What about the field of FEMA coffins in Georgia? Or the multiple FEMA camps that have popped up? Could all of that be in preparation for an E.L.E that we are being left in the dark about?</p>

<p>And what about Q? Personally I believe he is a legit insider, but I’ve also had reservations about his purpose, and what if his purpose is to distract the conspiracy minds so that we won’t notice what’s coming? I do find it quite interesting that he reminds us all to pray.</p>

<p>Who knows? God knows things are becoming increasingly topsy turvy in this world. I for one, would not be surprised if something of this magnitude is in the near future for us.</p>

<p>Edit 1 - NASA tracking asteroid set to skin earth. Exact path “uncertain”.
Link to that article - ( <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/905492/Nasa-asteroid-2018-AJ-big-as-a-HOUSE-to-skim-Earth-within-DAYS">https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/905492/Nasa-asteroid-2018-AJ-big-as-a-HOUSE-to-skim-Earth-within-DAYS</a> )</p>

<p>Now again, I am not predicting anything here. I just find all of this to be pretty interesting, and I felt the need to share.</p>

<p>As always; love, light, and peace to all of you.

<p><strong>This guy is literally telling the sub a bald-faced lie about one of the quotes he cites -- the lie is immediately obvious as soon as you click the link.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let’s take into account this comment on 4chan, which was made roughly 30 hours before the meteor showed itself** 4chan comment says “keep your eyes open in Eastern Michigan”.**</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/aSveqcm.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/aSveqcm.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Click the fucking link this time.</strong>  Note the 4chan poster says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Watch the news in eastern michigan tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See how that is a completely different statement than what OP claimed?</p>

<p>You know why the OP lied about this?  Because &#39;watch the news&#39; doesn&#39;t sound as prophetic as &#39;keep your eyes open&#39; when we are talking about a fucking meteor streaking across the sky.  On the other hand, most significant events are reported on the news so its a safer bet when you are posting on 4chan misleading dumbasses.  Then just lie about it later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Greetings everyone.  I would like to announce a very big deal.  An anonymous person said:</p>

<p>Hey guys make sure you watch the news, or you might miss the bright flash of light which will occur outside in the sky, or you might miss the massive shockwave that shook houses and caused an earthquake that registered 2.0 on the richter scale.</p>

<p>Wait, that sounds retarded.  Actually he said... keep your eyes open.  Yeah.  Do not close your eyes all day.  Or you might miss one particular event which can be seen in the sky.  Keep your eyes open or you might not hear the bone rattling shock wave which will be felt all over the state.  Yeah.  That&#39;s <em>pretty much</em> what he said.  Freaky, huh?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After lying directly to your fucking face, this poster then parades out another anonymous person who makes an empty claim.  Whoa! I&#39;m getting chills!  Ready to have your mind blown?  The army is signing on more soldiers, the EU wants an army, and there was a commercial with a meteor in it.  And, perhaps most chillingly, other loud sounds were heard at other points in time.  I would like to contribute some additional new findings to this poster&#39;s growing body of research.  Did you guys know Bruce Willis once BLEW UP a meteor?  What is going on!</p>

<p>Honestly, if you up-voted this, I don&#39;t even know what to say to you.  What are you doing here?</p>

<p>What I think WOULD be interesting is if that 4chan post was somebody who knew about the botched Chinese space station launch that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/space-station-falling-earth-here-s-where-it-could-land-ncna838481">ended up stuck in a decaying orbit.</a></p>

<p>Sure looks like Michigan is within that cross-section of latitude. And if a Chinese space launch burnt up over US soil, it might be a few days of tense negotiation and secrecy about recovery of anything that may have survived.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Space is 3 dimensional,  so nasa and other space agencies have a very hard time seeing objects in space, usually only seeing them just before or after they pass us by. Add in the fact that sometimes asteroids are coming from the direction of the sun so we can&#39;t see them at all, so it&#39;s extra difficult. </p>

<p>Earth is constantly getting bombarded with space rocks, and it is only in these last couple hundred years with the huge expansion of our industrial age that we are beginning to notice these interactions. </p>

<p>The only conspiracy that I see here is how calm everyone is about this threat, because it is very real and very dangerous . We could begin to see Tunguska like events happening in populated areas in our life time and I hope our eyes are on the ball. We need space defense before we do go the way of the dinosaurs. </p>

<p>Into the pockets of every military officer and government employee who were able to grab some.  Don&#39;t forget we are talking about a military that fly literally thousand <strong>pallets</strong> of cash around to dole out as they wish, with no accounting or accountability.  They dole out countless billions every month to contractors, arms companies, suppliers, and other people of all kinds who are happy to give a huge kickbacks and provide high paying no-show jobs to these guys once they are out of the military.</p>

<p>Just one isolated example:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post OP. I have had a similar feeling about all of these space shenanigans lately but it&#39;s good to see somebody compile all of the evidence together.</p>

<p>If you link in the NK nuke tests (which i believe is research and development for a special type of missile/rocket/satellite. Which, if you look into what the South Koreans say about the North Koreans you can easily understand why Russia/USA went to NK for R+D) and the visits to Antarctica (were they doing calculations on how to mitigate the damage/flooding from a meteor strike on the poles) then even more of this adds up.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure; either this is all just a crazy coincidence, put together by pure chance and guess work OR something fucky is going down. </p>

<p>I hope it&#39;s just a coincidence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s actually pretty hard to spot objects with a telescope.  There’s so much sky out there and a telescope has to focus on an extremely small portion of that sky.  Plus the objects were looking for are usually very far away and very very bright.  Asteroids are usually not reflective at all so they are quite hard to spot with telescopes.</p>

<p>Spotting the asteroid in advance is like finding a dark needle in a haystack when you don’t even know you’re looking for a needle.</p>

<p>It’s not like they have these little kiddie telescopes and just swing them around spotting every flying piece of debris.</p>

It is planetary mining with a twist using big explosions and trajectory. There probably could be casualties or we could be completely fine. I know they probably have gotten some material they have wanted from other planets as well such as Venus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve started thinking recently that asteroids could hold the key to unlocking the Fermi paradox.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost dumb luck that life has been allowed to evolve and develop to the point we&#39;re at without a giant meteor wiping us out like it did the dinosaurs. Id theorize that many other planets aren&#39;t so lucky. </p>

<p>I know our moon protects us gravitationally but it can&#39;t protect us from everything. </p>

<p>What if the Fermi&#39;s Great Filter isn&#39;t a point of destruction but rather the point where we develop to a point where we can detect and stop asteroids. In that mindset, the dinosaurs didn&#39;t pass the Great Filter and in accordance with his paradox, neither do many others. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t say &quot;keep your eyes open&quot; he said to watch the news. People say this a lot on /b/ and /pol/ in hopes of creating a hype. Not claiming it&#39;s fake, but it&#39;s quite a generalised thing to say. He just happened to pick he right spot? I don&#39;t know. Could just be coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Conspiracy&quot; is sort of a sillyl concept, cooked up by the CIA to cover up the obvious bizarreries of the JFK assassination THEORY jammed down the public throat. 
People make plans. Lots of groups make lots of plans. Right now those groups are going after each other because they don&#39;t wanna plan together any more. Their grandkids should pay, not ours.
God help us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s even worse about the cia trickery is that conspiracy is an actual crime. By them turning it into a joke it makes the public down play the criminality and predatory nature of their behaviorist.  Their “psy op” endangers the public and enable their criminality.  Legal definition of conspiracy: A conspiracy may exist when two or more parties use legal means to accomplish an illegal result, or to use illegal means to achieve something that in itself is lawful. The burden of proof is on the defendant to prove he was not involved even for acts that are done without defendants knowledge or consent. <a href="http://federalevidence.com/node/1630">http://federalevidence.com/node/1630</a> So this means that alleged conspirators that are violating the constitution to defraud and mislead the public are criminally liable. We are not paranoid even by legal standard. Conspiracies are one of the most difficult things to defend against. The government conspirators who have mislead and defraiuded the public know that too. Which is why they work so hard to play this out in the court of public opinion and avoid facing trial. Legally the conspirators are criminally liable simply by working together whether they had any knowledge of the end result or if it happened after the fact of their involvement. We are not paranoid they are just avoiding answering to their crimes.. when you consider shilling as conspiracy to commmit fraud by misleading the public, it gets really serious. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A really good read and certainly some food for thought. I like your style of putting the available evidence out there, and letting us all have a think / discussion about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit pedantic but in the interests of truth I feel I should offer a small correction.</p>

<p>&quot;Asteroids are usually accompanied by large meteor showers. There could be something heading this way that they have known about for years but aren’t telling us.&quot;</p>

<p>Asteroids and meteor showers are from different sources. Meteor showers happen because of comets, not asteroids. The shooting stars you see are icy meteors in the main. (that still include some rocky / metallic material, hence different colours)</p>

<p>Big ole rocky/metallic &#39;roids mainly come from the asteroid belt, the kuiper belt, or the Oort cloud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great video. Here is the txt for those of you that don’t watch a video. 
When I was a corporate manager of Fairchild Industries in 1974 through &#39;77, I met the late Dr. Wernher von Braun (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_...">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_...</a>) in early &#39;74.  At that time, von Braun was dying of cancer, but he assured me that he would live a few more years in order to tell me about the game that was being played, that game being the effort to weaponize space, to control the earth from space and space itself. </p>

<p>The strategy that Wernher von Braun taught me was that first the Russians are going to be considered to be the enemy.  And, in fact, when I met him in &#39;74, they were the enemy, the identified enemy.  We were told that they had killer satellites.  We were told that they were coming to get us and control us, the dirty Commies, that whole story.  First the Russians were going to be the enemy against whom we were going to build space based weapons. </p>

<p>Then terrorists would be identified and that was soon to follow.  We heard a lot about terrorism. </p>

<p>Then we were going to identify third world country crazies.  We now call them nations of concern.  But he said that would be the third enemy against whom we would be needing to build space based weapons. </p>

<p>And the next enemy was asteroids.  Now at this point, he kind of chuckled the first time he said it.  Asteroids . . . against asteroids we&#39;re going to build space based weapons . . . so it was funny then.</p>

<p>And the funniest one of all was against what he called aliens, extraterrestrials.  That would be the final card.  And over and over and over, during the four years that I knew him, and was giving his speeches for him, he would bring up that last card.  &quot;And remember, Carol, the last card is the alien card.  We&#39;re going to have to build space based weapons against aliens, and all of it is a lie.&quot; </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t mention a timeline, but he said that it was going to be speeding up faster than anybody could possibly imagine.  That the effort to put weapons in space was not only based on a lie, but would accelerate past the point of people even understanding it until it was already up there and too late.</p>

<p>But this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let’s take into account this comment on 4chan, which was made roughly 30 hours before the meteor showed itself <a href="http://imgur.com/aSveqcm">4chan comment says “keep your eyes open in Eastern Michigan”</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t fit with the rest.</p>

<p>Are we suggesting that this anon knew  exactly where a meteor was going to appear, 30 hours in advance? It seems that if this guy actually knew something, then the meteor is a cover story for something else. Or, it&#39;s coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read this on one of the Youtube videos discussing these things earlier today and it was an interesting statement:</p>

<p>&quot;As unbelievably tin foil futuristic as this may sound... could a satellite produce a pinpointed sonic boom over an area? I mean, I know you wouldn&#39;t know as none of us would but, at the same time, while I think there is no doubt a satellite could be tuned to deliver sonic output the question is could a satellite deliver such a pinpointed scenario. I mean if you really consider it what prevents a foreign actor from putting a satellite into orbit, which will make it&#39;s rounds with the natural movement of the earth, and  while looking like your normal everyday satellite actually be able to deliver an attack on a very defenseless area below with no way to shoot down or stop it? </p>

<p>I know, I know, this is futuristic shit but is it really? Mankind is pretty adept with putting things into orbit at this point so I don&#39;t think a small tweak or change would be out of the realm of plausible while everyone searches around the ground and skies for the source when the source is actually in orbit.﻿&quot;</p>

<p>the poster went on:</p>

<p>&quot;Might also explain objects that were previously not reported by NASA suddenly appearing and dropping out of the sky, burning up before impact (much like the Michigan event yesterday), and crashing into the earth with no earmarks of an actual impact event. That would of course mean that we have the means to shoot them down but if you want to get even more tinfoil, a few things you can take/believe if you will/won&#39;t:</p>

<p>1) I served in an intelligence related field while in the USAF and while I had/have no direct knowledge or study on satellites I do have knowledge of EMP cone dispersal arrays which America is vastly superior to in terms of their EMP tech but are, in a sense, the first stage if you will of such devices which create the needed wave through sonic output to disrupt communications. </p>

<p>2) That said, North Korea, last year, made several public threats about two things:
a) EMP 
b) Nuke but there is a caveat here I think is important. Their initial threat did not come of a nuke attached to an intercontinental missile but, rather, a nuclear warhead attached to a parachute in atmosphere and dropped to make landfall. </p>

<p>3) Why does that matter? Well it may not but if we are brainstorming, let&#39;s consider the only legitimate manner America could be attacked. People can say or bullshit themselves all they wish but America cannot be defeated in a head on manner. You won&#39;t break the coasts, you won&#39;t damage the infrastructure enough by small attacks unless they are continuous in numerous key areas/facets of society, and our computer security is miles beyond what most seem to believe as the CIA and OSI are Kings when it comes to feigning openings and back tracing every damn thing by letting someone have a peek. </p>

<p>My point? So how do you attack it then? What are your only options? Hit it where it may not be able to counter you. How do you do that, where is that? Space, looking downwards. But how do you achieve that without them noticing? Global communication and reception satellites which every country has. It wouldn&#39;t be hard to add something to that satellite which you know, for 100%, is going to travel over the US and will be at you very control. Who would know? How would they prove it? Are they going to fly up there, grab it and then tell the world? Can&#39;t, we can&#39;t get up there. </p>

<p>Sounds reasonable to me.﻿&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We beg you, dear ones, to give energy and focus toward the solution of something that is taking place right now. For on your planet currently, there are scientists working on energy transmission through the ground (and the air). Now this is a valid science and will indeed work. It is not new and has been done before - almost one hundred years ago. But oh, you have such power now in your current machines, and we ask you to slow down! For you do not yet understand the resonance factors of the crust and the mantle of Earth. When one resonates, so will another. Therefore, unless you slow down with these experiments and push less energy into the ground, you may actually cause the earthquakes that you fear the most! We tell you that there is tremendous damage potential in these experiments, and although we are not asking you to stop them, we advise you to go slowly and be careful of your home.
DoD/Air Force/CIA/Pentagon whatever fucking with our magnetic field using a Tesla Coil/Free Energy device is at least as plausible of an explanation for the &quot;loud booms&quot; as I have come across, hahaha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, this is a very interesting write up.</p>

<p>To be honest, this is one of those things that, assuming true, is completely understandable.</p>

<p>It makes total sense that if something of the magnitude of complete global destruction was heading directly towards us, that they would not tell the public about it.</p>

<p>I am willing to believe that the Hawaii thing could have just as easily been a fuckup, knowing how poorly designed some of those systems are.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to believe this, and part of me wants to believe that there&#39;s no way something like this could be kept quiet, but another part believes that it&#39;s completely plausible that it&#39;s kept quiet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you&#39;re an obvious troll feigning impartiality while employing passive aggressive character attacks (in typical misinformation fashion) and just looking to muddy the conversation here on subjects you don&#39;t even have an understanding of.  This is not some obscure information, it&#39;s been known for years that there are gravitation signatures indicating there is something large orbiting our solarsystem.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re quoting misinformation from a platform that&#39;s known to be manipulated and skewed because, yet again, you have no clue what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>The idea of the niburu cataclysm does not come from Nancy Lieder (whoever the fuck that is), it comes from the annals of creation in the sumerian tablets as translated by sitchin describing the creation of our earth and destruction of Tiamat, the supposed cause of the asteroid belt. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re one of those people (which you apparently are) who subscribe to the religion of mindless &quot;skepticism&quot; (read; playing dumb and/or expert to advance an agenda), then you could argue that Sitchin&#39;s translations are off base, and many people do, but to advance an idea that Niburu (referred to as Marduk in the annals) is the product of some conspiracy theorist in the 90s is an asinine game for dummies.</p>

<p>...and yes I used way too many parenthesis in that post, fuck off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes agreed. But surely cost should not be a factor and the whole world should contribute money and resources to save the planet in the event of this happening. Perhaps maybe spend a lot less on guns and bombs. After all who needs money if you are dead and nobody to leave it to</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, &quot;Nibiru&quot; is a doomsday scenario that was supposed to wreak havoc on Earth in 2012, or, since that didn&#39;t happen, in the very near future.  The proposed Planet X is 100au away, meaning that it poses no danger.</p>
