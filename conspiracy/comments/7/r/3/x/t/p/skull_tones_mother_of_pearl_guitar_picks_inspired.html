       I've been a long time reader of this subreddit and became interested in all topics after 9/11 occurred, and most specifically in 2006 or so after I watched Zeitgeist The Movie. I was in New York when 9/11 went down, though luckily I was upstate with my band at the time and not in the city. I remember our tour manager waking me up (we were staying at his house in Red Hook, NY, which is about 5.5 hours from NYC) early and yelling at me to turn on the news. I got up fast and immediately saw the second tower being hit by the second plane. I had no idea what was going on at the time, but once the towers fell, I knew something wasn't right. I was in absolute shock and horror, just like everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to 2006. I saw the Zeitgeist movie and thought, "holy shit". This woke me up and made me realize that though I don't have the answers, I know my initial thoughts that fateful day were spot on. This really got me interested in finding the truth to, well, everything. 9/11, Kennedy, Ancient Egypt and human origins, mars, time travel, space exploration, secret societies, you name it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to 2015. I started my own online company and decided to make my own guitar picks with unique materials. I wanted the brand name to be something that resonated with me in terms of all the "conspiracy" topics I became enthralled with. Skull &amp; Bones stuck out, as I've always liked the aesthetic of the Skull and Bones imagery (think Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland, just before going down one of the drops and the animatronic skull and bones talks to you. As a kid that always stuck out to me for some reason.) Immediately I thought, "Skull and TONES" could be a great music-related brand name. And so it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I offer these picks, made of Mother of Pearl. They're all currently sold out, so I'm honestly not trying to sell them to anyone here. I just thought I'd share here because I never actually post on this subreddit - I just read and research articles posted and have been for many years. I believe I've been on here since 2012, almost daily.

       I really do love this subreddit. I don't see a use in being mean. Everyone's entitled to their opinions, even if they're a bit harsh. To his defense, my post is a bit spammy, though when I wrote it that wasn't my intention.

       I'm calling bullshit already.  I live in this state and if it takes you 5.5 hours to drive from Red Hook, NY to NYC your going the wrong effing way.  It does not even take half of that time.

       Maybe parts of your story are true but in no way shape or form regardless of 2002 or 2018, it never took that long to go from Red Hook to NYC, ≈100 miles.  I live North of Albany and it does not even take me 5.5 hours to get to NYC.

       Dunlops are awesome. I use them too. Good choice. I live in Los Angeles so I've only been to Red Hook that one time and remember it being many hours away. If it's not 5.5 hours, I may be mistaken - but this isn't a very important part of the story. That's just how I remember it though. Point is, we were in a safe spot many miles away from ground zero, thankfully.

       haha! Awesome. I'm not sure if I can post a link here, but I'll try:
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078LF45DC">
        https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078LF45DC
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If that doesn't work, just search for "Skull and Tones Guitar Picks" on Amazon. They're pretty fun to use and totally inspired by this subreddit.
