    <div class="md"><p>Do you know the difference in how they can hit a receiver compared to 10 years ago? Official rules wise? They have a target area they have to hit while the recover is defenseless. The receiver is considered defenses at the point of contact in this play. So at this moment the defender has to process the catch, receiver position, and target area. Not easy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think football is the sport that is most forgiving when it comes to poor technique. It’s a physical sport and when you’re having process all that shit as well it just makes it harder. </p>

<p>I miss the head hits🤫 kinda miss those plays when seeing a receiver get they shit pushed in.</p>

<p>I’m not digging you. I just tend to think we take at beliefs a little too far in these communities. SOMETIMES things are what they seem. I see football as one of those things. It’s a business yes, but not a conspiracy to keep us retarded. Some of the best values In life I have learned came from the discipline and loyalty required to succeed at football. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don’t see how something of that complexity could be staged without anybody EVER saying anything. I think they may try to rig games with refs which is why I’ve seen more complaints about the clarity of penalties. </p>

<p>A great current example was the non catch by Dez Bryant in Green Bay during the 2014 playoffs.  Many football fans did not understand why it was not called a catch. The act of jumping, catching the ball, and then reaching for the end zone is a football move in a lot of people’s view. They called it a no catch. The ref said there was no football move made which was horse shit. So the ball touching the ground ( while Dez was reaching for the end zone ) and moving slightly meant the pass was incomplete. This was late in the game, could have made the difference in the game. </p>

<p>So if anything is rigged I would say it’s by a few people.  Rather than it being staged, I’d say it’s really just a few people trying to influence a particular outcome. </p>

<p>I’d say this is happening now more than ever though. All due to money and that pansy ass they pay 44 million a year. No way should anyone in the NFL, except owners,  make more than base salary for players. Not even a coach. </p>

<p>&quot;not at all, nba ref showed the world that not only was he rigging games but most likely so was the NBA and other ref&#39;s/players/coaches. nothing happened whatsoever</p>

<p>seriously mate, america just had massive election fraud happen and they settled for &#39;it was the russian&#39;s&#39;. The nfl could tell the public they were rigging games and the people would still watch&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spygate was nothing.  Rule went into effect that season, after being ok forever before and basically Belichick thought he outsmarted the rule but got caught by a new commissioner who wanted to make a name for himself and appease the other owners and fans.   Look at the facts.  You&#39;ll realize they didn&#39;t cheat to win, they broke a rule.   They never tapes the practice of the rams, that is all wrong and it was taken back by original reporter&#39;s once corrected </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NFL games get tons of action, far more than any other single sports events. If you had a few different people going all over Las Vegas, online, UK, you could get absolutely ridiculous amounts of money down on the game, whereas people would notice someone betting even a tiny fraction of that amount on a regular season college basketball game.</p>

<p>Really, the thing that the books are primarily looking for is professional sports bettors who run their own numbers and try to beat the house straight up, not rigging games. There are groups that make millions of dollars doing this. Someone who bought off the refs wouldn&#39;t look like the kind of people they don&#39;t want to do business with, they&#39;d look like some idiot that got lucky.</p>

<p>We already know that refs were throwing games in the NBA a few years ago, because one of them admitted to it. It&#39;s actually easier to throw an NFL game this way, because you can bet more, the playbook has gotten so subjective, and a single call can have such an influence on the game in a way that one change of possession or some foul shots in the NBA can&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How would the fix work, just biasing calls in one team&#39;s direction?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, probably trying to focus on plays where the call itself could go either way, or altering a game late when it&#39;s close to the spread. You don&#39;t want to have a fake call in the 4th quarter when the underdog is winning by 21, because it&#39;s not going to change the outcome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would instant replay be a defense against that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would make it harder, but if you buy off the top guy, he&#39;s the one that decides the replays, so he can stare at it for a few minutes and announce &quot;play stands&quot; (not enough evidence to overturn it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were going to pull off a scam like this, would you try to corrupt a ref to bias calls over multiple games, or go for one big score? I&#39;d assume the latter, given that lots of bad calls might get the ref replaced, but then you&#39;re betting it all (literally) on one game where the ref might not be able to affect the outcome--if, for example, there just weren&#39;t any close calls or it was a blowout despite the biased calls.</p>

<p>I think if I were a scammer, I&#39;d try to scam the betters. There&#39;s an old stock scam, which may be apocryphal, that makes the scammer look like he has an inside line on the market. You get a mailing list of 1,000 names, and send predictions to every one of them: &quot;Over the next week, stock X will rise/fall.&quot; Names 1-500 get the &quot;rise&quot; prediction, and 501-1000 get the &quot;fall&quot; prediction.</p>

<p>The next week, you see if the stock rose or fell. It rose, so you make a new rise/fall prediction, but you only send it to the people who got the correct prediction the week before. 1-250 get a new &quot;rise&quot; prediction, 251-500 get a &quot;fall&quot; prediction.</p>

<p>You repeat that as long as you have enough names. For every 1,000 names, you get (roughly) one person who&#39;s seen you make 10 correct calls in a row--something you&#39;d only have a 1/1024 chance of doing randomly. So you send those people a brochure offering your stock picking services for an outrageous price, then take their money and run.</p>

<p>You could pull the same stunt with sports betters, although I suppose you&#39;d be at a higher risk of winding up in a cement mixer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should point out that fixing a game is never 100% full proof.. No experienced gambler just throws it all down on black and crosses their fingers, even when the wheel is fixed.  When you fix a game you just do little things to tip the odds.  You dope a horse, you putt coins in the boxing gloves, you rub snot on the ball, and then bet just the right amount on the side you know now has the advantage.  Some times you loose, but it doesn&#39;t matter.. Some times the thrill of cheating the house is just as good as beating the house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly believe football has been staged to some degree for decades.  I think there&#39;s a boy&#39;s club of team owners who barter and trade certain victories amongst each other for the purposes of prestige and public face.  I live in Minneapolis and have to look at that ugly assed U.S. Bank stadium every day.  They (We) Payed a fortune to build it with a lot of vocal opposition from the tax payers.  Our team, the Vikings have <strong>sucked</strong> super hard for decades.  They don&#39;t deserve a new stadium, but we let our roads and parks and waterways go to shit so that funds could get diverted to build it.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-35W_Mississippi_River_bridge#Collapse">Remember how a decade ago we had a bridge fall over?</a> Well if you&#39;re coming to town next week i&#39;d avoid the rivers.  The short of it is, I think U.S. Bank needs to save face for forcing that damn thing on us. What better way than to pay off a few Ref&#39;s and maybe a clumsy Saints player or two, to pad the odds for the Vikes and maybe restore some of the fans waning faith in our team. The Pats are going to win the ring like always (Merica!), but they&#39;re going to play the Vikes for it and you and I are going to have to sit through two and a half hours of U.S. Bank commercials wile we watch it happen. </p>

<p>The only thing you can admit that is fixed is if someone on the field is proven to of thrown the game, or if a referee purposely made calls due to some higher up.

<p>For a couple of decades,they would introduce the teams starting defense and offenses, then they would do the coin toss.</p>

<p>Somehow,they managed to get the call right as to which team would be kicking off and which team would be receiving it.
This happened over and over for many years in a row. Enough so that I was comfortable making bets and winning them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every single other sport has had proven game rigging. Why would the NFL be any different? NCAA players are caught all the time point shaving or fixing games. Mostly proven while the players are in the NFL. Just look at the biggest sport on Earth......Foot Footall. The most corrupt game ever. It&#39;s estimated that hundreds of millions of dollars are laundered every year. Plus the NFL is a registered entertainment company just like the WWE. There is no law saying the NFL can&#39;t decide games. It&#39;s a joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah what about the Min NO game? All the players and coaches and refs forgot that you have the play the extra point snap after a td even if the clock has run out. When they did return Min didn&#39;t kick the extra point and just took a kneel Dow. Min didn&#39;t cover the spread and if you bet of NO at -5.5 you won your bet. Joke and fucking joke. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How would the fix work, just biasing calls in one team&#39;s direction?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, probably trying to focus on plays where the call itself could go either way, or altering a game late when it&#39;s close to the spread. You don&#39;t want to have a fake call in the 4th quarter when the underdog is winning by 21, because it&#39;s not going to change the outcome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would instant replay be a defense against that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would make it harder, but if you buy off the top guy, he&#39;s the one that decides the replays, so he can stare at it for a few minutes and announce &quot;play stands&quot; (not enough evidence to overturn it).</p>
