<p>Maybe his son in law and their family have deep ties to Isreali settlement group and Netanyahu himself. His son in law has done gigantic real estate deals with Israeli diamond kings.</p>

<p>Trump himself has seen significant investment come into his properties before from exrtemely powerful and corrupt Russian/Kazakh jews that gained Israeli citizenship.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TDfIIHK9p4">this video</a> you can see Tamir Sapir and Alexander Maskevich at a reception for Sapir in Kazakhstan. Maskevich particularly holds a lot of power in the region as he is the President of the Euro-Asian Jewish congress.</p>

<p>Both Sapir and Maskevich are financiers of the infamous Trump Soho project.</p>

<p>re your response to kushner, seems like you just have a bad feeling about him. Maybe its because he doesnt say much and MSM has portrayed him as a secret colluder? If you believe that there was ever anything of legal substance other, then  the MSM disinformation campaign was successful.</p>

<p>There is not a single business person in America that you can point me to that has done business with the Mammadov&#39;s in Azerbaijan. You won&#39;t find any because people generally don&#39;t go into business with ministers that launder money for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.</p>

<p>Donald Trump largely does business with organised crime figures at the Trump Org. It&#39;s the reason he doesn&#39;t want Mueller to look at his finances. It&#39;s blatantly obvious at this point.</p>

<p>The Mueller investigation is fake news. If there was substance Trump would have opposed rhe investigation in the first place. the reason it is being opposed now is because it has been a year and there is no substance. the investigation has empowered all sorts of trolls to recycle non arguments as facts.</p>

<p>The mueller investigation is a smokescreen. This is however, the opposite of the Hillary investigation, which has a lot of substance showing direct ties with illegal activities in a systematic way that has a clear agenda. This is highly illegal and not being covered. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that exactly why Mueller should investigate the Trump Org? To find out if the Trump Org has been a hub for laundering money for organised crime figures?</p>

<p>the investigation was compromised from the beginning. just look at Strzozk and Comey. how is it even still going?</p>

<p>Somehow they even subpoena&#39;d Bannon. thats obviously outside of the investigation, and intended as political theatre, discredit Trump through his association with Bannon.</p>

<p>Bannon was a good campaign strategist, got trump elected. Bannon is not a good cabinet member or WH adviser so he was fired. pretty straightforward story. </p>

<p>Kushner himself is involved in a $50 million laundering scheme for the Steinmetz family. His family&#39;s finances is almost as dirty as the Trump finances.</p>

<p>Quote me on this, Kushner is going to get indicted or make a plea deal in the next 6 months.</p>

<p>If you invest dirty money in a project that originates from corruption in a diamond mine in africa, then proceed to receive interest payment and loan payments on that money once it is invested, you are 100% money laundering.</p>

<p>This is one of the most common cases of money laundering. Real estate investment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is that the key?  It shows that the traditional brainwashing strategies failed.  But it doesn&#39;t show that Trump was specifically the reason.  The pervasiveness of social media and internet based media has completely changed the way people get news.  The problem is that people are also learning not to trust the government like they used to, which will increasingly lead to unrest which will lead to ever increasing police state.  Power elites will never voluntarily give up power.  &quot;The revolution will not be televised&quot;.</p>

<p>whos this random mafia associate you talk about? Real estate can be a shady industry, especially at the global level. Im sure Trump has rubbed elbows with some unscrupulous dudes.</p>

<p>Most Russians have ties to organized crime, almost all russian oligarchs or those with money have ties to organized crime. It&#39;s the way Russia is.I would hope Trump&#39;s attorney has ties to organuzed crime. Who else would know how to get things done within a corrupt business? </p>

<p>These are good strategic business decisions.</p>

<p>Trump&#39; ex wife managed many aspects of the business for years. She was from the old USSR in czech republic. Maybe that made trump&#39;s companies more russian. Whats wrong with that?</p>

<p><a href="http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/abc_sater_card_lf_151130.jpg">Felix Sater</a>. He was convicted for stabbing a man in the neck and being at the head of a massive $40 million stock fraud scheme that involved several Italian mafia families. Felix&#39;s father was convicted for extortion as part of his membership in an Vyacheslav Ivankov extortion ring.</p>

<p>Michael Cohen is also has deep ties to Russian organised crime, but I doubt you are going to be willing to let me walk you threw that.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious that it&#39;s money laundering. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take Trump Soho as an example. </p>

<p>The entire corporate structure of the project contains Kazakh and Russian organised crime figures like Felix Sater, Tevfik Arif, and Alexander Maskevich. The development project did not disclose that is was being operated by a convicted felon. The development project was also funded largely from corruption and kleptocracy in the Kazakh mining that Maskevich and Arif took part of. I can also go deeper into the organised crime operations that Arif took part in Kazakhstan and Turkey, but again I doubt you want be to walk you through that all.</p>

<p>Felix Sater and another Bayrock/Trump Org employee, Daniel Ridloff, were also instrumental in assisting in laundering millions of cash from embezzlement that originated from Viktor Khrapunov in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Sater and Ridloff would launder the Khrapunov cash through the sale of several Trump Soho units.</p>

<p>Felix Sater&#39;s convictions for stabbing and massive stock fraud were well known in 2007. The sealed indictments were released in 2009. </p>

<p>Felix Sater continued to operate Bayrock without any disclosure to Trump Soho investors after his past was revealed. The Trump Org hired him in 2010. Trump knew. </p>

<p>It&#39;s Felix Sater. Get to know his name, because he is going to be a very popular person soon. Both him and Michael Cohen are going to be very important people in the Mueller investigation.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a ton of evidence that Trump personally was involved in massive tax fraud in Trump Soho. There&#39;s also evidence that Donald Jr and Ivanka were heavily involved in investment fraud in Trump Soho. You don&#39;t want to go through the actual evidence with me.

<p>It&#39;s so ridiculous that people were even defending Sater. &quot;No, he stabbed him in the face not the neck&quot; as if somehow that&#39;s ok?</p>

<p>You can keep being you and trying to insult me but much like imaginary points I don&#39;t care when people on the internet think they can hurt my feelings. </p>

<p>You mean when the other guy tried to portray a happy hour slap fight over salty margaritas as a gangland-style throat slashing.  Yea, that was a pretty ridiculous lie to peddle.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never said such a thing.  Pointing out the difference between an escalated slap fight and a gangland-style throat slashing is not the same thing as being, &quot;Ok with guys being slashed in the fact.&quot;  I mean, what an absurd remark.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly the &quot;scary Russian&quot; image the other user was attempting to paint with his lie.  No one was slashed in the throat, one guy was smacked with a Margarita glass.  How long are you going to keep pretending that you don&#39;t understand the difference?</p>

<p>Well, going into it with that attitude, I can already guess your reaction.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6sxfzk/trump_soho_a_criminal_conspiracy_involving/">Trump Soho: A Criminal Conspiracy Involving Russian and Kazak Mafia Figures</a></p>

<p>I would direct your attention to the section on the $50 million FL Group Investment that was illegally structured as a loan to avoid paying taxes on capital investment. Instead of paying back the loan with scheduled payments, the loan was paid back as future shares of profits in the project. Felix Sater and Salvatore Lauria, both convicted racketeers, had involvement in the loan and were alleged to embezzle millions from the illegal investment structured as a loan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>congrats, you followed the money to completely legitimate business transactions. thats not conspiracy. thats the hole in your entire argument.</p>

<p>theres no links to money changing hands that was used to commit crimes, just people who trump did transactions with who happened to commit crimes.</p>

<p>Do you see the difference? theres no conspiracy there. </p>

<p>Business is done very different in different countries, especially for Russia, where its basically pay to play. Despite this environment, Id say Trump has done a really good job not being involved in any of that. Its easier than you might think. I know because I worked in China for 9 years. </p>

<p>Although you are right to point out that Trump runs his own smokescreens and strategic manipulations with the media, he has no choice. They are attacking him and not reporting the real news. </p>

<p>This is different than MSM, which is running an agenda against trump because the deep state is terrified and need to see him impeached, or else risk being exposed.</p>

<p>this is the obvious plot.</p>

<p>comparing this to &#39;flat earth&#39; is obviously retarded. </p>
