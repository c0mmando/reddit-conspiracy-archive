<p>I&#39;m from Southwest Virginia.  It&#39;s some of the most beautiful country you will ever see, think Ireland in the spring.  Prior to the Net I had never spoken with anyone that was from another country.   I had never met anyone with any other religion than Christianity.  I had never really heard dissenting opinion about the United States and it&#39;s foreign policy. Prior to the Internet, people from small town America were isolated and the only news of the world we had was the television.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really enjoy life man. I know that&#39;s not a popular opinion here on Reddit, but I do. I wasn&#39;t born rich, haven&#39;t achieved anything truly remarkable (outside of my personal goals), but I still find absolutely everything so fascinating. I don&#39;t want to bet on an off chance.</p>

<p>I clinically died about two years ago and it was nothing but blackness. That is all I know. I know that I was here, and then I was not, and from that I know that I like being here more than not. </p>

<p>I have had a good run, and I have accepted death as an inevitability, but I would love the ability to see life over a course of a couple of hundred years. Maybe after I would die, but there is too much life has to offer that I would like to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mental death! And a successive rebirth. Very healthy. Can be experienced through psychedelics as well. </p>

<p>As an example: Fast foward to your death. You leave your body and can no longer interact with this domain. You meet your &quot;soul&quot;. Your soul shows you every possibility of who you could&#39;ve become, every opportunity you could&#39;ve jumped on, every parallel timeline that you could&#39;ve chosen. </p>

<p>You feel immense regret. You realize life was not about sitting on Reddit and digesting endless information. It was about the PASSION. the FIRE, the EXCITEMENT, and JOY. It&#39;s about the relationships you grow and nurture. It&#39;s about evolution and perpetual growth. You see 1000s of ways you could&#39;ve played life differently, and you beg to go back in and give it a better shot. </p>

<p>So your soul agrees, as it loves experiencing &quot;you&quot;.</p>

<p>So you get shot right back to where you are now.</p>

<p>What choices will you make now? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, I was a naive college freshman at the time. But the point being that reading can be dangerous not only because one can choose to swallow a bunch of mindless literature porn but because it can also misguide a developing mind into believe in the wrong things. I think there is something to be said about spending hours with a book, regardless of whether you agree with the author&#39;s message or not. Especially if the writer is incredibly charismatic and crafty in presenting his message, it&#39;s easy to start to buying into it. Not to say that this will happen to everyone but I would argue that it will to many. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well shit I read Marx in high school and I wasn&#39;t really convinced by it. Maybe it&#39;s because I read a lot as a kid so I was used to taking books with a grain of salt. I&#39;d say that if you take in many different perspectives then you can avoid being brainwashed and you&#39;ll be a more knowledgeable person in the end.</p>

<p>And also communism (as in the stateless classless society) isn&#39;t bad or impossible <em>provided it takes place in a small homogenous population</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue people like you are the exception and good for you(no sarcasm intended). Ideally that is the desire to be so well-read or be naturally aware that one can take everything with a grain salt but I think it&#39;s fair to state that the majority of people even readers are simply not so self-aware. </p>

<p>In addition to your observation about communism working provided that it takes place in a small homogenous population, I think the greater flaw is in the lack of addressing the darker side of human nature which is that of greed and our desire for power. I think all systems have failed(although we can argue that one has failed to lesser degree) not due to a flaw in its ideology but that those who are  practicing it(us humans) have to evolve first on an individual level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think brotherhood and family ties along with social pressure would basically force you to contribute equally in a small scale (as in a decentralized cluster of villages as in Catalonia or the YPG) homogenous communist society. </p>

<p>The only issue is that if someone&#39;s ambitious (a communist would call ambition greed but I disagree) then they&#39;d feel stifled by the lack of efficiency and the chains of the structure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your identification of brotherhood and family ties as it relates to a homogenous society is closely linked to my idea that people need to evolve on an individual level first(in order for any ideology to work). The connection being that close homogenous society&#39;s will naturally be more collectivist that is to say have the ability to take on a single identity or a collective consciousness where they will hold in higher regard the well-being of the whole over themselves or their immediate loved ones.</p>

<p>If we are able to relate to one another simply as human beings on this small planet, so in other words, recognize the homogeneity at a larger scale extending to all beings on this planet, then we wouldn&#39;t have any issues implementing any reasonable ideology whether it&#39;s communist or capitalist. So again, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily the ideology that we should be focusing on but in enlightening the individual to see that we should identify as humans rather than a specific sect of that group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever been to a more rural area or an extremely small town? The kind of place where everyone knows and looks out for each other? They already have the same homogeneity and brotherhood that we&#39;re talking about. The only issue is that this sense of community sharply goes down as diversity increases (as described in Bowling Alone). I think the best way to tackle this is something like Hoppean libertarianism, where each small settlement is independent of each other. You might have one tight knit communist village selling surplus crops to a capitalist city filled with greed and vice.</p>
