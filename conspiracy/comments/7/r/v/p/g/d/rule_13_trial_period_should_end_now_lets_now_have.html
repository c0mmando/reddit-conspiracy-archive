<p>Here was my comment recently</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s just 30 seconds of your time&quot; the herd says</p>

<p>Except for: neurosis, spontaneity, anonymity, bias, barriers, censorship,etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t want to see the information on this sub dry up, nor do I want to see extra barriers to participating that don&#39;t exist on the preponderance of Reddit. Please don&#39;t make this a special club were everyone has to say a password every time they enter. The neophytes are as valuable as any. Having been frequenting this sub for over 5 years (yes i&#39;ve heard from the old timers it was even better before this), I&#39;ve never been as dissapointed as I am now with this rule. Thank you for your time and dissent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rule 13 doesn&#39;t apply to self posts (like yours!).</p>

<p>Rule 13 only applies to link submissions.</p>

<p>If someone can&#39;t type out a couple sentences about the link they submit, the &quot;more information&quot; they&#39;re adding is likely not even worth much to <em>them</em>, let alone the rest of us.</p>

<p>There are still the occasional avalanches of low-effort flashmobs when this or that hashtag hits, but overall this subreddit is more how it was pre-2016 election (or even better?) than it was in 2016-17.</p>

<p>Rule 13 is good. We don&#39;t need a trial period without it. We had that. It was terrible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your neurotic, it takes just that much more time to submit your post. Being spontaneous is now diminished: the first time poster on their way to work, etc. Some don&#39;t want to expose themselves on a conspiracy forum; the SS statement forces them to reveal themselves to a certain degree. Instead of the post standing on its own merits, the user&#39;s bias is now introduced to the content. Barriers; this is not a common rule on Reddit. Just another rule to be manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a losing battle. The problem is that the mods have allowed this sub to become completely overrun with politics spammers using mostly self posts. They&#39;re now the majority and love the fact that there are so few actual articles posted because of Rule 13 and their self-post political spam drowns out everything else. Political quantity over conspiracy quality. And the mods seem to love it too. Although from what I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s just the one ex-worldnews mod that <em>actually</em> controls this sub so you can understand why it&#39;s the way it is now. </p>
