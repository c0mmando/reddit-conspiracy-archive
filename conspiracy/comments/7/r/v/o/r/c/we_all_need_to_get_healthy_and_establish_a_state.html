       We live in a world where we are being intentionally poisoned by criminal elements within this global crime syndicate that currently rules over us. Medications, fast food, flouridated water, and alcohol/cigarettes; most Americans are indulging in at least a few of these self destructive vices/behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anybody researched the "borax detox"?
      </p>
      <p>
       This natural mineral salt is actually sold as a common household product in most stores, under the name "20 mule team".
      </p>
      <p>
       It has shown promise in removing flouride from the body and preventing skeletal flourosis and bone related diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has also shown promise in the decalcification of the pineal gland, where large amounts flouride are deposited in the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.naturallifeenergy.com/boron-fluoride-detox-to-combat-skeletal-fluorosis-and-decalcify-the-pineal-gland/">

      <p>
       A full body detox could help rid you of heavy metal accumulation (no, not Black Sabbath). I reccomend supplementing iodine with the boron regimen.
      </p>

      <p>
       You can't go wrong with a diet consisting of organic produce as well. Avoiding GMO foods riddled with pesticides can only be beneficial to our health.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we should to divert a certain amount of our collective focus toward getting our physical and spiritual health in order. There's no reason why we should allow ourselves to be casualties of this system and its covert means of depopulation and systematic suppression of the human spirit.

       Or not really really worry, because there's no GMO wheat on the market. It's all conventionally bred.

       And the only gene-edited potatoes are brand new, and just changed to reduce browning and levels of a carcinogenic compound, not anything to do with glyphosate.

       I actually do like distilled water sometimes, it's not as "heavy" as normal water, even bottled water (which is most of what I drink, Deer Park to be specific). But try not to make it a regular thing because it lacks the nutrients normal water provides, like iodine.

       You’re just further proving my point. You test urine, the part of your body in which waste is excreted , instead of blood, the part that matters. I would love to hear why you think testing urine pH would tell you anything useful, or why that means anything more than “I ate a bunch of alkalines, so my body excreted the excess into my urine in order to maintain homeostasis of 7.35-7.45”

       It's called an analogy.

       Of course blood is a certain pH, otherwise you'd be dead in 3 minutes.

       From my own experience, eating mostly fruit I've seen much less mucous in my own body. It's a drastic improvement. Improved mental clarity, a whole host of benefits really.

       For you to claim that claim 100% that "alkaline diet does nothing" is empirically false. I'm living proof it changes at least one thing.

       It’s a shitty analogy. Your heart rate can go as high as 140-160 when you’re working out and you’ll be just fine. It also drops below 50 consistently when sleeping, again completely fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       However , if your blood pH goes to 7.25, you’ll become deathly ill and need medical attention.

       Your analogy does not prove that eating ash-forming acidic foods doesn't cause cell-damage. The blood pH is just one factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blood is just a way for the body to deliver fuel to its cells. You can be quite sick and still have proper blood pH.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why my analogy
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       valid. You didn't prove causality, neither did I. That's kind of the whole point, both statements are meaningless. Why am I even spelling this out...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, not that that really matters. The over-archingpoint is that you are wrong. Your claim that "alkaline diet does nothing" is obviously false.

       How about instead of watching stupid shows try it yourself?
       <br/>
       My father is doing keto since 1,5 years, he is 53 now and has more energy than in his youth. From a fat lazy fuck he transformed into fit and healthy, he looks at least 5-8 years younger, no one believes his age. At first he lost lots of weight then he became inspired to excercise daily. He is running 3 kilometers every day, if he feels very energized he does 6.
       <br/>
       His transformation is incredible, I would not believe it if I was not seeing it with my own eyes. So how about getting in touch with people who does this diet, or do more research and stuff before talking shit?

       I lost 70 in 6 months with keto. It works at the metabolic level preventing pyruvate from being formed, killing off glucose feeding microbiology in the GI. It creates a great snow ball effect into the diet, which is why it is hugely successful if done correctly. It has to work if you stay under 30 net carbs a day and actually measure them. Ketosis is literally a scientific process.

       So I did keto and lost 35 pounds in about 3 months effortlessly.  I was rarely hungry, often ate only once per day and had an insane amount of mental energy even after a full 8 hour work day in intense mental work.

       It was amazing but you seriously have to drink loads of water, supplement with electrolytes and do your best not to over indulge on alcohol (my weakness).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell, alkaline diet does nothing.  If you want to lower the PH of your piss, drink water and add Arm and Hammer baking soda to it.  It's an alkaline and it's quite inexpensive.

       As far as raw veggies meh....that's debatable.

       I thought the alkaline diet was more for disease. Father treated his cancer with weed oil but the Alkaline diet was the other holistic method that was preached about. Didn't a black guy win a court case as well? He said he could cure people, judge said bring in 9 people you've cured and so he brought in 77 people and won the case.

       IIRC it was a acidic cell which lacks oxygen will become cancerous, and mucous restricts oxygen from your cells. The war on mucous.

       Even read parts of Genesis to find hidden clues. I remember genesis 22:2 (I think): the leafs are for the healing of all nations.

       Turns out all the healing benefits in vegetables and fruits are in the leafs.

       The hard part with nutritional knowledge is finding trustworthy sources for info that won't change.  I'm old enough to have seen many fads come and go and lots of misrepresentation of information.

      <p>
       For example, when discussing the Atkins diet (which during the induction phase is identical to Keto) people used to love to bring up the fact that Dr. Atkins had a heart attack.  Then they would jump to the diet as the cause.  But it's not true and
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Atkins_(nutritionist">
        his own doctor confirmed it.

       I can't put into words how good I feel after a 3 day water fast.  Also, I not only feel pain-free now, and younger, people who know me tell me I look younger.  I don't dare tell them what I'm doing, though, as I quickly grew tired of fat, sick people trying to shame me for "starving myself".  These obese gluttons don't know what starving is.

       Distilling that's been sitting around in a plastic bottle isn't very healthy anymore but is better than nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       To do it right you should get a good water filter, such as a zero water or more expensive RO system, and a home distiller. Filter your tap and then distill it. Don't wait around too long either, just let it cool enough and drink it down. Pure water loves to grab onto anything it can (which is why it works so well as a detox) so making a batch and storing it is less effective than fresh.

       i drank and cooked only with distilled water for years, while living in a fluoridated country.  i used an airstill, which is very easy to use.
       <br/>
       the residue was always a brown, thick, sticky and smelly (typical toxic chemicals smell) sludge that needed citric acid to remove from the pot.  when you see the amount of crap thats in only a gallon of fluoridated tap water, you really start to appreciate clean water.

       GMO is great and organic is a complete sham. Sure, things from your garden that you grow will taste better. But 'organic' foods sold at stores have just as many pesticides and shit put into them. They are expensive and useless and if it weren't for GMOs there would be a fuck ton of diseased meats we'd be eating, let alone an extremely scarce food supply. Your body detoxifies itself, it doesn't need help. If your body somehow does NOT then I'm sure medical advice would be needed.

      <p>
       While i agree that there is a lot of woo woo shit surrounding health, as someone who has fixed their own health issues as well as helped plenty of people fix theirs with dietary changes, i can personally tell you that there are a lot of biologically sound principles to eating right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also plenty of biologically sound evidence to the fact that unhealthy industrial shit food will make you sickly. GMO companies do their own internal safety checks and between that and the revolving door that GMO and chemical companies have with the FDA they can data dredge and falsify their way into selling literal poison as healthy. Like Canola.

       I agree with eating healthy, for sure, but to shove organics  around saying they are better is just a lie. When companies say their food is 'organic' it doesn't mean it's not treated with pesticides or insecticides. I work in agriculture and know the policies regarding that stuff and it's just a huge disappointment.
      </p>
      <p>
       With GMO related foods we eat them on a daily whether we want to or not. Nobody has died from canola oil, no one has died from eating super market produce or meats, there's nothing bad with GMO products.

       I was agreeing with you until you said:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nobody has died from canola oil, no one has died from eating super market produce or meats, there's nothing bad with GMO products."
      </p>
      <p>
       While i doubt that anyone has died from acute illness by ingesting canola oil, it is demonstrably deleterious to your health and does cause an inflammatory response. Yet the commercials sell it as better than olive oil, which is complete horseshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Super market produce" is too broad. There is Chinese imported produce, produce with heavy metal and pesticide contamination as well as pathogens that are a result of its country of origin as well as the use of biosolids fertilizer, which is a case of "repackaged waste" entering the food supply with improper regulation and a financial incentive that puts peoples health at risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       GMOs are also a broad category. Sure, some wont hurt you, and others will. And its not simply because theyre sprayed with glyphosate, although that is now recognized as a probable carcinogen. Its because cross kingdom gene splicing from bacteria to plants allows for novel allergens and proteins, which once ingested can dysregulate the microbiome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rampant rise in autoimmune disease is likely due to a combination of all the garbage modern humans who eat a terribly unhealthy diet of industrial foods, the pathogens and toxins in biosolids fertilizer, unsafe GMOs and a complete disregard for what the body actually needs to be healthy. Isolated, one or two of these things labeled safe wont hurt you in a trial of their safety. Bombard someone with it for years and you get the obese unhealthy mess that is many people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anecdotally, i have fixed many of my own health issues with my diet which includes avoiding GMOs and fixing my microbiome.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you know about agriculture, then you will know what biosolids are. You will also know the regulations regarding feeding cow carcasses to cows in their feed. You may or may not be aware that this regulation is bypassed by feeding the dead cow parts to chickens, and then using the "chicken litter" carcass remnants in cow feed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know the big scare about prions? The things that kill you 100% of the time very quickly for which there is no cure? The dead cow being fed to other cow prohibition was intended to stop the spread of spongiform encephalopathy. Yet cows are being indirectly fed to cows, bypassing an important safety regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did i bring up the prion thing? Its just one of the many dishonest and dangerous practices that skirt safety regulations in the agriculture industry. I can keep going but you get the point.

       It's true that there is a lot of fuckery going on in both areas. I suppose my defense of GMO simply comes from the fact that they are important. As much as no one wants to stuff their face with it it does help the food industry ad a whole. I'd avoid them but it gets to the point where how much can you avoid and at what cost?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're completely right and I agree with you and the points you bring up. The canola thing, I stay away from. People who eat poorly and choose that lifestyle...there's nothing yoh can do for them. I suppose it's just when people start preaching the 'organics' spiel I just shake my head because some people think "oh it's grown naturally with no chemicals and is 100% better" and that too is inaccurate. Not to discredit you, I mean kudos to finding a better lifestyle! If you feel great then that is good news, everyone deserves a healthy life :)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the trap that you see so many people fall for, especially endorsed people like models and fitness gurus who send their fans onto am expensive endeavour with little payoff. It's important people eat proper food and less processed shit. But when I go to the super market and buy my peppers or chicken there's a large chance it has been genetically modified in some way. And just for my own personal account it's better than whatever junk I could put into my body. I refuse to spend twice as much for a bag of potatoes that have the same values as non-organic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ps thanks for the discussion and not being a sassy person :) I like debating but not arguing

       I didnt think GMO animals were in the food supply yet. Thatd be weird depending on where they got the genes from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that GMOs make it easier to produce and sell food, but our society is full of perverse incentives. We provide cheap plentiful food but at what cost to the people eating it?
      </p>
      <p>
       A big problem with the food industry is targeting children. Most parents are debt slaves and livestock themselves with neither the time, money nor inclination to be healthy. They pass their non adaptive eating habits along to their children, which makes that county sicker overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we are at the point where it is no longer the exception but the rule to be fat and unhealthy, and im not just talking about adults either. I heard something about the military having a hard time getting fit recruits. Something like half of people over 18 have chronic illnesses. It wasnt nearly this bad 30 years ago when i was a kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont buy organic everything, but i do try to buy produce from a decent country that isnt "washed" with fecal contamination like they have in China and Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       I probably spend a lot more on non GMO, but if anyone CAN afford to buy non GMO or better quality and instead buys cheap shit thats unethical. I consider myself morally obligated to buy the best i can afford, as it is sellers obligation to sell the best they can make.

       However, the cult of kombucha has gotten a bit out of hand. I don't believe it is the magical panacea people claim that it is. It's just one thing you can have out many, many options. Kombucha can be quite sugary and I'm not convinced it is the best thing to drink every day. I say, don't put all your eggs in one basket. There are other ways of getting a healthy gut. Lacto-fermented veggies like kimchi, pickles, and sauerkraut are incredibly good for you and very inexpensive if you make it yourself! You can ferment any vegetable, actually. And it is stupid easy to do. And going beyond kombucha even more, cultured dairy (if you eat dairy) is where its at. Kefir is easy to make once you have grains (called grains, but are actually a bacteria colony). Cultured butter is more delicious than regular butter. Cultured sour cream, buttermilk, yogurt, cheese, ect are all available and they taste better and are better for you than the "regular" stuff.

       Also, sourdough bread. If you're gonna eat bread, make it sourdough. Even supposedly gluten-intolerant people can often handle sourdough bread, due to the way the flour is fermented and processed. Fermentation is kind of like "pre digestion" so fermented foods are more readily digestible. Your body can just handle it better.

       you are correct that most dis-ease is a build up of waste and toxins in the body.   cleanse people... you will love it.   :D

       I can confirm it's done wonders for me as well, I've lost 70lbs on a HCLF diet and I'm never sick anymore. The energy I have, the easy digestion never makes me want to go back to animal products.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest I think it's an immense conspiracy that we're raised as omnivores. The benefits of a clean vegan diet are so tremendous for the mind, yet it is constantly dismissed and ridiculed...

       Stop copy and pasting misinfo. Yeah, they have goitrogens, but you have to eat a LOT of raw cruciferous vegetables to do any damage. The only people who should be careful are those with iodine deficiency or existing thyroid problems. In that case, just cook them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://draxe.com/cruciferous-vegetables-cancer-thyroid/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is also some concern about the relationship between cruciferous vegetables and thyroid problems. When eaten raw, the digestion of cruciferous vegetables in the intestines releases goitrogens, which can increase the need for iodine and can cause damage to the thyroid gland. (14)
       </p>
       <p>
        However, research shows that it would take a large amount of cruciferous vegetables to cause thyroid damage, and it’s likely only to be an issue if someone also has an iodine deficiency. If you do have thyroid issues, it’s best to only eat cruciferous vegetables that have been cooked and limit your intake to about one to two servings per day.

       No, dude, because you have

       The problems come from
       <em>
        eating too much cruiciferous vegetables
       </em>
       , and you have to eat a LOT to actually affect your thyroid function. Do you know what the fuck that means? It's
       <strong>
        dose dependant
       </strong>
       . Cruciferous veggies are also rich in isothiocynates like Sulfurophane which is mildly toxic to the human body - but that's where the benefits from ingesting sulfurophane comes from.

       The organic farm is more often than not right next to the farm that sprays their crops every day. There's a lot of run offs from the water cycle. People need to start realizing that all of nature is connected and we
       <strong>
        cannot
       </strong>
       have "dead zones" in the ocean or "organic farms for only those that can afford it". We're all living on one big ship and we keep shitting and pissing on the deck.

       Working in the trucking industry I can tell you all that organic and non organic shit all comes from the same place. Except organic strawberries coming out of California, those are grown on petroleum fields. Not sure about you, but not something I personally would want to eat.  Also you realize 80% +/- 3% of your fruits and veggies come from South America? You should really look into food facts. Anything that comes from the west coast is picked almost 3/4 done and then shoved in giant bags and gassed. Organic shit too. Berries can still be green and bitter and then when I get from CA to NY, they’re plump and juicy. Who wants to hear about meat?

       Meat is disgusting lol. Don’t get me wrong I still eat it. Basically from the time it’s slaughtered packed shipped to your celebrity grade fancy restaurants kitchen, it’s about 3 weeks old. Walmart and shit, 5 weeks old. If you look at the life of your meat say you buy it at a Whole Foods or whatever your place if choice is it’s still 4.5 weeks or so when you put it side by side in the fridge with Walmart meat it’s only good for an extra day or two. For almost 1.5x the cost. “Organic” meat and mass produced meat is all the same. They just aren’t fed the same things. It’s all terrible for you. Fuck it, right?

       A modern day Upton Sinclair about to write an updated Jungle on reddit. Lets hear it -
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Jungle is a 1906 novel written by the American journalist and novelist Upton Sinclair. Sinclair wrote the novel to portray the harsh conditions and exploited lives of immigrants in the United States in Chicago and similar industrialized cities.More at Wikipedia

       <p>
        most readers were more concerned with his exposure of health violations and unsanitary practices in the American meatpacking industry during the early 20th century, greatly contributing to a public outcry which led to reforms including the Meat Inspection Act

       Not really a game per say. It’s just kind of a mass game of what’s going to go bad faster. It’s all bad for you. I’m slowly switching over to plant based meat. Morning star has these bomb ass buffalo chicken nuggets that I could crush a whole bag of.

       Organic was a good step, but unfortunately still a lot of problems with it and it's become very diluted.
       <a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2017/11/14/hydroponics-aquaponics-in-organic-production.aspx">
        They're even allowing hydroponics grown in plastic with synthetic fertilizers to fall under the organic label.
       </a>
       As is said in that article, Demeter's biodynamic standard is the organic 2.0 and makes up for a lot of the problems with organic food. Hopefully we can keep progressing with each new standard. I'm not sure, but hope that the biodynamic standard is completely out of the USDA's jurisdiction...

       I feel like Demeter's website is obscuring the amount of cow skulls/animal viscera needed for biodynamic farming preparations, probably to their future detriment re: transparency. Also the astrology/zodiac part of biodynamics, but it seems like that's not a strict part of their standards.

       More re: skulls + guts. Biodynamic farms have to make multiple 'preparations' (page 57-59) that are blended into compost or spread around to 'get the cosmic forces into the soil'.  Ex. Preparation 502, Yarrow flowers stuffed in a male deer's bladder, hung in a tree, and then buried. Or 505, a pig/cow/goat skull with the brain-case filled with oak wood chips. There are

      <p>
       It's like organic agriculture plus tons of added occultist mysticism and pseudoscience. USDA wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole. I don't like at all that none of this history, theory, and practice is apparent on the Demeter website, which makes biodynamics seem like it's just a stricter/purer form of organic agriculture.

       Demeter at least enforces using the preparations (herbs/manure/quartz) buried in (stomach/skull/horn). These things might actually help the compost by seeding robust soil microbiome bacteria, but the actual justification for each in the theory is based around cosmic focusing and light energy.

       i wash, core and roughly slice the apples and chuck them in a 35l plastic barrel until its full,  then use a concrete mixer drill bit to chop them up a bit more. this will reduce the volume, since there will be less air left between the smaller chunks.  at this stage i add water to top it all up and use a stick blender to really smoothen the consistency.   without the water it would be too thick and chunky for the stick blender to work effectively.  the water will reduce the final abv but i enjoy cider even at 2-3% abv.
once i have a nice pulp i empty the plasstic barrel into a larger stainless steel fermenter and repeat the process until i run out of apples or all my fermenters are full (but always leave about 8 inches of air space).

       i rehydrate some champagne yeast from the brew shop. a 20 gram satchel is enough for 100 liters.  if you make a yeast starter you could easily do 200-300 liter batches with a single satchel.  after i pitch the yeast i aerate it all well again with the concrete mixer drill bit, so the yeast can propagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       i usually sanitize my barrels, fermenters, the blender etc with 20% white distilled vinegar and a quick rinse of (chlorinated) tap water.

       Probably going to get downvoted, but: I've been getting most of my calories of off fruit for most of 2018 now. Noticed benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        better mental clarity
       </li>
       <li>
        less stress
       </li>
       <li>
        feel "lighter"
       </li>
       <li>
        feel much more spiritual
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm doing it for health reasons. I had seen many videos from N.D. Robert Morse that homo sapiens is a tropical species and that it's also frugivore. So I gave it a shot. Working quite well for me so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your mileage may all vary, and I still think it's crazy. But then again, the concept of eating dead animals is also pretty crazy when I think about it. Mainly sticking with it because it works and everything Morse says has its foundation in physics and chemistry, acids and bases.

       One thing is to really watch your teeth and check with a dentist after awhile. Teeth can go downhill really quickly from the fruit sugars and acidity. Watch for tooth sensitivity, pain, and changes in enamel.

       Well thanks for the heads-up. I've heard both sides of the story now. One young man who spent 8 years on fruit and saw his teeth get better.

       So who to believe... Maybe the current strength and constitution of the body is a big factor.

       It just something worth keeping an eye on, since you don't know how your teeth will be, and it's a very common issue on fruit-heavy diets. There are tons of accounts online of multiple cavities and expensive dental bills, mainly because of neglecting tooth pain/sensitivity symptoms.

       Back to South America, Brazil and Columbia are so nasty that they douse the bananas in chemicals to kill the insects. It’s pretty bad. Even the organic stuff. Only thing from South America that’s legit and good for you are peppers, insects don’t like them. They plant hottest peppers on the outside and get sweeter as they go in. Picture a Russian doll box but with peppers.

       I ate nothing but 
tuna with mustard
chicken done various ways (for example pan fried and dipped in soy sauce or Ranch dressing.. or both )
and had a steak every Sunday. 
I ate rice and beans, frozen vegetables
drank water, OJ, and milk
a healthy cereal brand
eggs fried in coconut oil
That was the bulk of it. I read a bunch of body building articles about diet and basically used that info and never strayed.
      </p>
      <p>
       After many months of this I bought a small bag of chips (Doritos or something) and when I opened the bag and took out a chip, my hand stopped short of my mouth. It was so weird. I was looking at the chip and my brain did not register it as food. It seemed like cardboard with powder on it. I forced myself to eat a chip and the taste was very strange, but I adapted and finished the small bag. Made my stomach knot up a little as I digested it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing was organic or anything. Just basic groceries, but ate clean. It made a difference. I was VERY strict when I did this though. In the months (almost a year or more) I never broke my pattern. Had breakfast, lunch, and dinner all planned out for everyday of the week. I also lifted weights and went from skinny to bulky. Not huge, but very fit. Gained about 30 pounds of muscle and felt better than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       So discussing organic vs not is not really the issue. Want to be healthy.. eat right and exercise. don't drink or smoke. The level in which you choose to do those 4 things will be the level of your fitness.

       Also might want to add that while Marijuana is probably a better alternative to Alcohol, it's still not this "medicine" to be taken every day. I've seen way too many people lately start cropping up about how Weed is this miracle drug that has zero negative effects and it's really just a stupid thing to do to your body in excess.

       Excellent post, glad to see it not downvoted. The 'weed is a medicine' line has been pushed so hard for so long that it seems to have become an accepted myth of our times, at least in alternative circles.

       Want free organic food? Check your local organic CSA to volunteer for food! Most places will ask for like 4 hours a week for 3/4 bushel of veggies (that seems to be the going rate for my area). I do it for 20 weeks during harvest time, and can for the winter with all the extra veggies I get.

       While i agree that there is a lot of woo woo shit surrounding health, as someone who has fixed their own health issues as well as helped plenty of people fix theirs with dietary changes, i can personally tell you that there are a lot of biologically sound principles to eating right.

       There is also plenty of biologically sound evidence to the fact that unhealthy industrial shit food will make you sickly. GMO companies do their own internal safety checks and between that and the revolving door that GMO and chemical companies have with the FDA they can data dredge and falsify their way into selling literal poison as healthy. Like Canola.

       There is an enormous amount of flavors and they are all very different from each other. Plus when you make it yourself, you can flavor it how you wish.

       However, the cult of kombucha has gotten a bit out of hand. I don't believe it is the magical panacea people claim that it is. It's just one thing you can have out many, many options. Kombucha can be quite sugary and I'm not convinced it is the best thing to drink every day. I say, don't put all your eggs in one basket. There are other ways of getting a healthy gut. Lacto-fermented veggies like kimchi, pickles, and sauerkraut are incredibly good for you and very inexpensive if you make it yourself! You can ferment any vegetable, actually. And it is stupid easy to do. And going beyond kombucha even more, cultured dairy (if you eat dairy) is where its at. Kefir is easy to make once you have grains (called grains, but are actually a bacteria colony). Cultured butter is more delicious than regular butter. Cultured sour cream, buttermilk, yogurt, cheese, ect are all available and they taste better and are better for you than the "regular" stuff.

       Go beyond kombucha, people!
