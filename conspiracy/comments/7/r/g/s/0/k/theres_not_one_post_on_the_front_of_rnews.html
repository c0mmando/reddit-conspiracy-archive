       I don’t know if people can really trust politicians anymore without proof. For example one of the people tweeting he saw the memo is Steve King who just days ago tweeted “This baby already has a heartbeat.” A heartbeat guarantees a live baby. Time to pass HR 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act. pgj.cc/5mcFgo“ - thats a blatant lie. I havent really looked at anyone else that has seen it yet

       No, that has nothing to do with opinion. A fetus with a heart beat does not guarentee a live baby. That’s a fact. I don’t know how anyone could even argue with that

       A fetus has a heart beat at about 3 weeks however a fetus wont survive outside the womb any earlier than 23 weeks, and even then only about 20% survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between 3 weeks and 40 weeks a miriad of things can go wrong, fetus’ with only a partial brain and who will die within secinds of being born still have a heart beat. I could go on but I’m sure you get the point that the tweet was a blatant lie and has no basic in science or fact.

       So maybe the baby can’t survive without the assistance of the mother’s womb at that point but I don’t agree that “life” doesn’t exist at that point. Nor does it make it a fact that life doesn’t exist. If you plant a seed and it begins to germinate through the shell...but then you neglect the seed of water, light  and soil then it will die before it can become a plant. It doesn’t mean that the seed had no life just because it never made it to the point where the embryonic root dig into the ground to farm it’s own nutrients. It was on its way to having independent life from the embryo but the conditions were changed so life stopped at the first stage....I think you get where I am going. My point is that as the above user said, that is an opinion on when life starts, not a fact.

       Im not at all claiming life doesnt exist at that point, im saying it doesnt guarantee a live baby will be born. Which is what my whole argument was disputing.

       Late term abortions (after 21 weeks) are so rare because they're offered in so few places and pose such a great threat to the health of the mother, that it would make sense that most of them are for the health of the mother.

       You gave a number. That’s a stat. You’re obsessed with people believing in your science. We don’t know when life begins. We have witnessed a spark of energy created when the sperm meets the egg but to this day there are nothing but theories about what has happened at that point. Is it just an electrical spark? Is it a soul being created? What happened at that moment of conception? There are many theories just like with abortions. If you are so obtuse about everything then what’s the point of presenting your theories. You’re not changing my mind and I doubt anyone else’s. You’re just looking for agreement.  I definitely don’t agree that their is no life created until the baby is out of the womb....in the cases where the mother would die then yes we should use our scientific advancements to save the mothers life because ALL life is precious.

       Agreed. All life is precious, and no one's opinion is better than anyone else's. Is a 6 week old fetus more important than a 2 year old cow? We slaughter animals by the billions, who is to say they don't have souls? There is no right and wrong on abortion - just your own opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rape, incest, disease, all valid reasons to get abortions. Abortion as a form of birth control (someone that gets several) is wrong. But making birth control readily accessible should help with that - on top of fewer abortions, it reduces the number of unwanted children which likely end up requiring state assistance. I'd rather the state pay for BC than a lifelong "state-assisted" person.

       I don’t want lifelong state assisted children either just like I don’t want life long state assisted illegal immigrants. It is unfair to everyone involved. Besides, People end up having children in those situations anyway because they look at children as paychecks thanks to our welfare system. There are thousands (assumption amount not fact) of people trying to have children right now that would adopt and raise the children without state assistance. If the mother doesn’t want the child then we will find a home. People adopt newborns from every corner of the planet to bring back to the US. We are a nation of incredibly helpful and giving people regardless of what we are told on the television....as for a cow, well that gets in to the circle of life argument. Is a lion evil for eating a gazelle or was that how life was meant. Not for pointless death but for balance of the ecosystem to provide nutrients for life. Dead fetuses are not being used for consumption of nutrients to foster life (at least I pray not but I have my doubts after some of those planned parenthood undercover videos)

       An abortion is a lot cheaper than 9 months of medical bills when you can't afford health insurance. Bringing a baby into the world costs thousands and thousands of dollars in medical costs, days of missed work, and all the other costs of day to day things (clothes, more food, etc) that many people (especially poor, single mothers) can not afford.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you be in support of easily accessible BC, or are you more "don't have sex if you can't afford the unfavorable outcome" (a baby)?

       I’m not a bible pusher or anything where I believe condoms and birth control are sins or anything. I’m not even that sure I believe in Catholicism anymore. I believe life comes from an unexplainable universal “light” that some call God. .... My wife is on birth control because I’m done. It doesn’t mean I’m done having sex. I think of them as responsible moves. So yeah I support providing birth control. That’s what planned parenthood was sold as + gynecologists for those who couldn’t afford them. That’s not what it became...sex is for creating love and creating families but our society has turned it into a pretty perverse activity more about immediate pleasure than love. There are also ways to do it without birth control if you have a stable partner and you avoid having sex for about 10 days in a cycle while a woman is fertile. That’s not the way our society treats sex though. I don’t claim to know the fears of a single mother and if there are doctors willing to do it then that’s on their conscience. I just don’t think the state should be involved in any way with the abortion process.

       You didn’t answer his question but instead deflecting. If you were pregnant past 21 week and your life depended on you getting an abortion, would you do it or die and potentially still have the unborn die too?

       Im not sure what the laws are in America, but in Australia abortions is legal until 12 weeks. After that point they are only allowed for the purpose of medical intervention (to save the mother) or if the fetus is not viable for life. You cant just decide after 12 weeks i don’t want to be pregnant anymore.

       It guarantees it by about 90-95 percent. Those are pretty damn good odds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chances of miscarriage are actually quite low if you already see fetal heartbeat on ultrasound. There is approximately a 5%-10% chance of miscarriage after the baby’s heartbeat is visible.

       Right?  Looks like there is too much fact for a theory?  Representatives went on national television talking about it.  Perhaps to build it up and make it more believable? Maybe there is truth within the document?  We do know there is a document.  But, yeah, Lizard People.  Sigh.

       If it was posted and just downvoted it wouldn't not appear. Just be at a low karma rating.

       I know what you meant. The Twitter staff would be shouting from the rooftops right now if they thought this trend was not organic, and it would have been shut down long ago. They can do that, and half of the population would applaud them for censoring / "fixing" this hashtag right now just because it involves Trump.

       This is the same concept behind letting Franken call for an investigation into himself and Republicans not doing so.  The air of scandal is seen as more damaging than a scandal itself to Republicans.

       There must be a majority vote within the committee and then must get checked and accepted by the executive branch before getting released to the public. It's not as easy as just releasing.

       I'm legitimately confused. Is this something that was being talked about before today? All of the sudden it's all over right-wing sites (from looking at memeorandum), but not elsewhere.

       I know the overall subject of FISA has been discussed, but it's weird how out of nowhere this memo discussion is. It feels like some switch was flipped and suddenly a bunch of people are declaring it the most important thing ever.

       True, but a memo isn't like a bomb going off. There's a lead up to it. I assume the memo is based on information that had already been presented to them. Why would a summary of information they've received over the previous months suddenly be so urgently important?

       r/news is a neoliberal cesspool.  I wish people would stop confusing/conflating neoliberalism with the left.  Neoliberalism or third way democrats are essentially pro
choice neo conservatives.  There isn’t a non neoliberal MSM news source.  Actual left wing Americans despise neoliberals and distrust the MSM media as much or more than people on “the right”.

       this level of denial is frankly hilarious. It wouldn't matter if it was 10 years ago, or yesterday. business dealings and money laundering for the mob doesn't somehow expire as a point of leverage. do you think a russian mob oligarch would buy a 20mil property for 100mil out of ignorance? i have this bridge man, its going on sale next week, 20% off, hmu.

       That's like trying to blackmail Elton John in to telling the world he's gay. Not a great tactic, and you'd get more laughs than money. Wouldn't you agree?

       What the fuck are you even on about? That is an awful, nonsensical analogy. He could owe them a shit load of money, for one. There are about a million different scenarios where financial dealings with the mob would result in leverage or blackmail (especially when that mob essentially runs a country and has an inelligence agency at their disposal)

       You didn't follow it, but it was solid. The point in one little sentence for you: you can't use something as blackmail if everyone knows about it.

       Everyone knows Elton John is gay, so you can't blackmail him to keep that secret. Get it? :-)

       Dude, I followed it. It's a terrible analogy. Being gay is one simple piece of information that is a binary, either you know it or you don't. This is a complex issue where a person spent 20 years doing business with Russia rife with mob ties, red flags and suspicious business deals. It's not a fair or good analogy in any way shape or form.  People may "know" that trump has done 20 years of business in Russia, and that it's common knowledge that big money doesn't flow through Russia except through the mob, but it's not so simple a topic as "either you're gay or you're not." How in the same breath trump supporters say "everyone knows so it can't be blackmail" and "the public has no right to see Trump's financial or tax returns because he has nothing to hide". This cult of personality has created an insane doublethink community. I hope you feel at home.

       As for your tired old "cult of personality" bullshit... you can save it. We've heard it all before. We heard the same said about Obama and his fanatical devotees. Again: who cares?

       You're really fucking reaching to defend that bs analogy, and you know it. The question of someone being gay(that's a specific term btw) or not, is a simple yes or no question. Are you so desperate to not be the "norm" that you'll deny reality and logic? I think we both know the answer to that. Cultists see no nuance. Your analogy was absurd and has no meaning. Here, fill in the blank. It is (possible, probable, unlikely, impossible) that Trump owes money to Russian mob connected oligarchs. As a bonus, explain to me what that has to do at all with whether or not people know that trump has done business in Russia and has made suspicious biz deals. It's all moot anyway, because he could go on TV tomorrow, admit he owes 50 mil to Russian oligarchs and you would still be sitting here trying to come up with absurd rationalization as to why that's somehow ok or not a big deal. Yes. Cultists. I use that word carefully.

       No, just refuting your claim that I'm "at home" in "an insane doublethink community" here with pure facts. You got more upvotes than I did, which means you are more "at home" here and more at peace with the mainstream narrative here.

       What kind of shitty cult votes against its own member (me, apparently) in favor of an outsider (you, I guess)? I'd leave that cult in a second. What's the point of it if they're not gonna back you up, right? :-)
      </p>
      <p>
       You bore me with the "Russian mob / oligarch / lizard man" stories and hypothetical scenarios, by the way. Like I said, you can't step back from treason to just say he did some business deals with shady Russians. You could have had that as the story from the beginning, but it's too late now. You're a prosecutor who charged him with murder, and now the jury isn't having any of it because you've failed to prove your case... so you want the jury to consider simple assault instead, just so you can get your little win.

I don't give a shit how many downvotes your shitty reasoning gets you here, you're still in a cult, and that cult is still a loud annoying minority here.

       And, when we have been told over and over that this was no doubt about it, 100% collusion, Putin's Puppet, all of that... and now just want to nail him on any little thing to prove a point.

      <p>
       I'll say it again: you can't step back from treason at this point. "Trump Russia collusion" is what you need. That's the only prize to be won here. Any less of a crime is minor in comparison, and would make it hard to justify a 2+ year long expensive, politically biased, and possibly illegal, investigation in to Trump and co.

       Perhaps the money laundering and ties to the mob are all part of the build up to the collusion case. I kinda understand what you mean about the wasted time and money if there is no collusion per say but I don’t think these things are mutually exclusive or minor if any are true.

       It better be, for their sake. But it seems more and more likely that they've switched away from looking at collusion and are just trying to "get him" on something to justify their existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the thing is... if you have 2+ years, unlimited resources, teams of lawyers, and clearly biased intel agents, you're going to find something on anyone. Just imagine if any other politician or even another kind of public person was put under this much scrutiny... they wouldn't look great by the end of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously he's the president so he should be under more scrutiny than most people, but where do they draw the line? How many years of his presidency are they going to tarnish, with little to show from their investigations? Do they just enjoy being a cloud of negativity hanging over his head?

       I don’t think he looked great before he was elected, tbh, and I’m sure some people do enjoy having a cloud of negativity over his head just as some people enjoy seeing one over Obama or Hilary. I’m not sure if you remember when Clinton was president but the Lewinski scandal stayed around for a long time with Trump himself parading some of Clinton’s accusers around as recently as 2016. So political scandals have a way of tarnishing reputations forever. It won’t just be: “Turns out there was no collusion with Russia by Trump so back to business!” Sex scandals, money laundering, bribes, shady business dealings... he will be lucky if he doesn’t go to jail which I think is what some people really want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t see the recent allegations as pivoting away from collusion just more revelations as information comes to light. And you keep mentioning 2+ years but he has only been in office a year with the Mueller investigation being shorter than that.

       I know. I'm accounting for how long the investigation will be ongoing, not how long it has taken so far. The investigation could last 8 years until he's out of office for all I know.

       Oofff.... I cringed when I read that attempt at "nailing" me. Utterly reprehensible attempt at being an SJW hero. I shudder to think how badly you must misunderstand the whole world around you if you did such a poor job at understanding that simple example.

       Money laundering for sure, and the way Trump miraculously emerged from bankruptcy when no banks would touch him or his projects. And of course Russian connections especially illegal ones are relevant to an election which almost everyone agrees was manipulated by Russia. Also makes Trump vulnerable to blackmail by a foreign power.

       I don’t believe that came out while he was President? Biggest scandal I can recall during his Presidency involved IRS. Can’t recall Truman ever being spanked with a financial magazine with his daughter on the cover either, by a porn star he had told he thought reminded him of his daughter.

       That quote from Chris Stewart doesn't do anything to dispel this story. In fact, it gives it 'legs' even if he's damping down some of the wilder speculation.

      <p>
       As for the question of why vote to maintain FISA, that would be a core national security issue, and not something that either party usually dicks about with for partisan purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, voting for FISA's upkeep is a separate issue entirely from denouncing people who have (allegedly!) misused it. There's no contradiction.

       How so? The story they are parroting seems to be as though there was some horrible actions undertaken by Obama, Clinton, and the DOJ and FBI. Stewart's quote makes it clear that this has more to do with a handful of people in the DOJ and FBI, not some concerted conspiracy involving the president harassing political opponents.

       The GOP leaks everything. There's nothing to this, otherwise it would have come out already. This will be more spin, nothing else (just like the whole "Here's the

       It seems like a lose-lose situation for him, and if this information is extremely important (as some are making it seem), then it will be released without the need to declassify.

       That quote from Chris Stewart doesn't do anything to dispel this story. In fact, it gives it 'legs' even if he's damping down some of the wilder speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the question of why vote to maintain FISA, that would be a core national security issue, and not something that either party usually dicks about with for partisan purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, voting for FISA's upkeep is a separate issue entirely from denouncing people who have (allegedly!) misused it. There's no contradiction.

       If Trump did declassify it, wouldn't people criticize him for impeding in the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like a lose-lose situation for him, and if this information is extremely important (as some are making it seem), then it will be released without the need to declassify.

       No, just refuting your claim that I'm "at home" in "an insane doublethink community" here with pure facts. You got more upvotes than I did, which means you are more "at home" here and more at peace with the mainstream narrative here.

       What kind of shitty cult votes against its own member (me, apparently) in favor of an outsider (you, I guess)? I'd leave that cult in a second. What's the point of it if they're not gonna back you up, right? :-)

       You bore me with the "Russian mob / oligarch / lizard man" stories and hypothetical scenarios, by the way. Like I said, you can't step back from treason to just say he did some business deals with shady Russians. You could have had that as the story from the beginning, but it's too late now. You're a prosecutor who charged him with murder, and now the jury isn't having any of it because you've failed to prove your case... so you want the jury to consider simple assault instead, just so you can get your little win.

       Can I just ask you that if Trump is/was in the pocket of the Russian mob then that makes no difference to you? Make the argument that all presidents are in someone's pocket, yada yada... but really, it would make no difference to you if our president had done business dealings with a foreign syndicate? Or am I misunderstanding your stance?

       At this point, I don't think they are even trying to distract. They're just desperately trying to shape the narrative into anything they can feed their base so they don't lose what little support they still have.
