    <div class="md"><p>Well i would never visit Scotland, not because i would not like it or the scottish nor that i have something against Kilts. I just have the imagination of Scotland as the lands where it always rains in the highlands and where forrests are absent. ;)</p>

<p>Fun fact, i was several times in Norway and a lot of the regions in the mid and northern parts are not too much different from those in Scotland and i loved it there. But i was there only in the summer months, in the winter i guess it would be too depressing looking for me.</p>

<p>But as i said i&#39;m not interested into such things as Las Vegas or entertainment parks like Disney World or some sky scrapers build upon the gulf of persia, even if they show some contemporary cultural developement.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m mostly trying to avoid visiting more common tourist regions when going on holiday vacations. All those big tourist and hotel complexes build in some regions look pretty frustrating to me.</p>

<p>There in lies the problem (I know what I think you are talking about - boil incidents in advisory) . I&#39;ve drank from fresh sources from the shores of Maine, to all the way up into Alaska. Maybe, it&#39;s a northern thing, along with the shit they are spraying? The best and freshest water I&#39;ve ever had, was on the shores of Lake Superior. It&#39;s hard though, because, Alaskan water... OMG...</p>

<p>What the fuck are you talking about? Do you seriously believe that just because I&#39;m proud to be American, I &quot;think it&#39;s okay to kill some other normal person halfway around the globe?&quot;</p>

<p>That is laughable, and frankly more than a little bit insulting. Your facile understanding of how other people see the world betrays a deep distrust of differing viewpoints. I&#39;m proud to be a part of the culture that put human beings on the moon and I hope my culture gets its act together, stops needless wars, and sends people to mars in the near future as a standard bearer for the human race&#39;s progress towards a better future. I&#39;m sorry if you have a problem with that but frankly I don&#39;t give a single fuck if you think it&#39;s wrong for other people to take pride in their national identity. It&#39;s part of human nature. </p>

<p>Nope! But nice try twisting my words. It&#39;s pretty clear I&#39;m saying it creates situations where this occurs, on an industrial scale (see WW1).</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to be an American to want a peaceful future. Do you think nobody else thinks that? See how now I&#39;m twisting your words?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, your hyperbole betrays a facile understanding of complicated issues. There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with having a sense of pride or belonging to one&#39;s country or &quot;tribe.&quot; The vast majority of the time, it&#39;s totally harmless. People from New York City have a certain sense of pride having come from the Big Apple - does that mean they want to go to war with everyone who isn&#39;t from New York?</p>

<p>I could waste more time arguing with you over this but ultimately you&#39;re just speaking in platitudes. &quot;Tribalism only leads to war and mistrust&quot; is a perfect example of the kind of boring and cliched mantras you tend to hear when urbanite twentysomethings gather in online forums like Reddit to circlejerk over their political sensibilities without really having to justify or question them. You could have just said &quot;HURR NATIONALISTS ARE BAD&quot; and saved us all some time...</p>

<p>Yes, my point exactly. I am basically in a 24th century, picard like mentality where we are one species split up by culture/language. But there&#39;s no reason we can&#39;t work together.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How is nationalism useful?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s actually a very easy question to answer. Nationalism is useful because <em>nations</em> are useful. Ultimately, the human is a tribal animal and will naturally organize itself according to common interests by integrating to some extent or another into a larger social organism. Whether that social organism is a family unit, a tribe, or a nation, the organism functions more effectively when all of its constituent parts are working effectively together. Therefore, a concepts like nationalism that increase in-group loyalty are beneficial because they foster jolly cooperation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Both can be true, or either, or neither, depending on the situation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, great argument &quot;it&#39;s part of human nature&quot;. You could use that as positive argument for a whole lot of horrific and utterly stupid things humans do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is what it is. Nationalism is &quot;good&quot; in the sense that it is a useful tool to strengthen the bonds that form the Nation itself. Whether or not that tool is used for good and evil is a different matter entirely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isn&#39;t having individual viewpoints and philosophies superior?</p>

<p>Surely you can be both nationalistic and simultaneously have individual viewpoints and philosophies, no?</p>

<p>Those people left the Democratic party in the 60s when JFK and LBJ started supporting the Civil Rights Act, the Great Society, the Voting Rights Act, etc..

<p>There&#39;s plenty of that too, but in public they have to code it these days.    Trump was proven a racist in court for not renting to blacks.  Trump took out full page ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park five who were later proven innocent. </p>

<p>“ Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes… Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money.

    <div class="md"><p>You know since we are on the history of the democrat party. Screw it here goes:
Jim Crow laws passed by democrats
Democrats opposed the civil rights act
Democrats started the black codes (separate drinking fountains)</p>

<p>Those devil republicans like Nixon started Affirmative Action. And that awful Ronald Reagan he only passed MLK day. Even further back 1867 and 1866 republicans enacted antislavery legislation. The 13th, 14th and 15th were passed by republicans. </p>

<p>And fyi, im not even a republican. This is just off the top of my head im sure i could easily google more from the party who founded the kkk. So dont dare to presume that i dont know history asshole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is wrong with your brain? lmao</p>

<p>What part of the Democratic and Republican parties switched platforms don&#39;t you understand? Jesus Christ on a scooter the education in this country needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>Again, looking at historical context, Nixon was a pragmatist (yet still a well-known racist) who continued affirmative action measures first championed by the likes of <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/462937/origins-affirmative-action">FDR, JFK, and LBJ.</a> </p>

<p>As for Reagan &quot;[passing] MLK day&quot; LOL, </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://time.com/3661538/mlk-day-reagan-history/">By the following summer, however, it was clear that some version of the holiday bill was sure to pass. (It had been reintroduced in July, by Rep. Katie Hall of Indiana.) “Faced with inevitable congressional passage of a bill to make Martin Luther King‘s birthday a national holiday, Reagan swallowed his longstanding objections that this would open the door to many other groups seeking similar holidays and decided that he would support the measure,”</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay lets pretend i believe you. You say the gop of today is the same as the democrats who formed the kkk. Name the hate group the current gop started. Name the legislation the current gop has introduced that limits a citizens rights based on their skin color. Name a current gop congressman or senator that campaigns on being a racist or how white they are. Sounds pretty retarded huh? Because the idea that they are the same is just that, retarded.  The gop controls the senate, congress and presidency yet people of color still have rights. If they had actually flip flopped and believe as you say, this would have happened the 1st day.</p>

<p>As for the mythical party switch/flip, this should help explain:

<p>Well, Calais and perhaps some other cities in the north of France with a ferry route to UK have a problem with a high number of refugees Camping in that regions, but the French coast is a bit more than Calais. Oh well, wouldn&#39;t sound that sensationell then, i can understand your motivation.</p>

<p>Btw. the coast of the french mediterranean sea is the one with the biggest numbers of tourists, which is easily predictable due to the flair and climate of the mediterranean sea. ;)</p>

Ripoff healthcare maybe, but most people have socialized medicine at home, they don&#39;t travel while ill, and insurance for a few weeks isn&#39;t that expensive.</p>

<p>He described most of the United States as being &#39;run down&#39;. Old, lost businesses, rusty brick buildings that were once producing manufactured goods, broken down roadways and infrastructure. I thought that was an east coast thing, drive around Delaware, Philadelphia and parts of NJ and it&#39;s like a bomb went off, some places are better than other of course, but it seems to be a national phenomena.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manufacturing used to be the US&#39;s biggest industry. Between the 70s to 90s, much of the US manufacturing industry has been lost to corporate globalism. They shut down US factories and sent jobs to China, India, etc...</p>

<p>In the 50s, like 65% of the job market was manufacturing. Nowadays I think it&#39;s around 9%.</p>

<p>The US is more like a sales country now. More people work in sales and advertising now instead of making stuff.</p>

<p>It seems like it&#39;s shifting back a little bit but not much. Exports are good for a nation&#39;s economy. If you make and sell stuff, your country generates a higher global income. If you just sell stuff made elsewhere, you don&#39;t make shit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why China is rich now and why the US lives on credit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the one I work for is doing pretty well, we have several plants in the US as well as several others world-wide. I agree it&#39;s fallen (manufacturing) over the last 50 years, but it&#39;s not dead yet. It&#39;s just a little irking when someone says that your industry is dead when your boss tells you that you&#39;ve got new hires for the next month and still over 25 open positions on the careers site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it is true that outsourcing has contributed to the US&#39; current economical system, most people do have to consider how the US became a super power in the mid-20th century in the first place. </p>

<p>After World War Two, most of developed nations with international influence were in rubble (Germany, France, Japan) and/or losing colonial influence (Great Britain, France). The US and the Soviet Union were the two nations that suffered minor destruction and did not rely heavily on colonial influence. Thus it made it easier it easier for both to expand their influences throughout the world (Cold War) because there was no one to challenge them.</p>

<p>However, as the the rest of developed world began to recuperate and developing nations started to gain more traction (China, India), there was less of need for America and the USSR to be manufacturing juggernauts. People forget that there a huge fear in the 1980s over the Japanese becoming our new overlords because it seem like ever consumer product was Japanese. </p>

<p>All things considered, it seems unlikely for the US to regain its grand manufacturing status.</p>
