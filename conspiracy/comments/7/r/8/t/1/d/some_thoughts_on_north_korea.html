       Nobody seems to have considered (at least that i have seen) the fact that a unified Korea with the added "benefit" of their own nuclear weapons should at very least hugely unsettle America's foothold in the eastern/Asian parts of the world. The re-unification of North and South Korea would also likely have strong approval from both China and Russia due to a plethora of shared common political, economic and defence interests. But where would that leave America and the west in regards to global power?

       South Korea aren't about to give up their relationship with the USA to be buddies with the north. This isn't the first time they've participated in the Olympics together and it still may not happen, protests are happening over it in SK. The USA has a large amount of military personnel stationed in SK. It's not as simple as holing a flag together then everyone making ul.

       I understand this but that doesn't change the fact that South Korea is its own country with it's own leadership and therefore would have every right to remove any American military from their territory if in the future they considered it in their best interests.  As a westener myself i don't feel that i can accurately assess how the average North and South Korean person actually living in Korea feels about this stuff.

       South Korea is twice the size of the North in terms of population, is rich, and isn't an authoritarian and starving shithole.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they sure as hell aren't going to give up democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, South Korea would need stronger ties with the west to unify (German unification cost well over €1B and there's still a big disparity), and since North Korea borders China and its close to Russia then that puts a strong US ally closer to their doorstep.

       Obviously hypothetical but it could perhaps become a democratic monarchy. Kim Jong could continue as "King" with a democratic government elected to handle the proper stuff. Like England? As far as i know China and Russia both currently trade with North Korea and thus far have been somewhat reluctant to offer strong opinions on the nuclear arguments with America. All bordering countries would rather enjoy a positive relationship with their neighbours than deal with the fallout of either war or famine in North Korea. This itself suggests that's the same bordering countries would benefit from seeing a successful "Korea". It'd be fair to say that South Korea has relied on America for protection from the North, but what if that protection was no longer required? All of a sudden America would have no allies at all in that whole area and Korea would have strong alliances with the wests main rivals.

       Anything is possible, but East Germany gained no concessions from West, save for investments / money. They adopted the West German currency, constitution, governance, etc without adding anything from the DDR.
      </p>
      <p>
       And South Korean tours with the US are stronger than just militarily. They are a key trading partner, as compared to North Korea and Russia /China that do little more than give old arms and enough food to keep the south from conquering it and keep the people from fleeing across the border into their land.

       Reunification will only occur on America's terms. Trump has made this very clear. That's why he has been posturing against NK for the past year. Peace through strength. NK's goal is to force reunification on their terms via a nuclear threat. NK doesn't want to nuke anybody. They know if they do they will be obliterated by nukes themselves. The people running NK aren't stupid. There is a reason they have existed for so long on their own terms. What other enemy of America has achieved this? Even the Soviet Union had to bow to capitalism and reform. Giving up all of their vassals in the process. Gaddafi gave up his nukes and they were destroyed. Saddam started to go rogue and build up his military and they were destroyed. NK has played their cards very well. But we have slowly backed them into a corner. So much that their closest ally who helped prop them up for years now wants them gone. And then Russia steps in to help them because we are at war with them.

       No trap. It's debatable whether or not Trump's policy on NK is the best thing. But he knows what he's doing. That's why China changed their tune on NK so quickly, and Russia had to come in and help prop them up. I wouldn't be surprised if NK got their nuclear tech from either China or Russia as a last ditch effort to thwart the reunification of Korea.

       There is no way China wants a unified Korea, neither does the US. Once America plants a base in a country it never leaves. I can't see the US ever removing its military presence from the Korea peninsula. It's a strategic location. If there is ever a unification of Korea, which is highly unlikely it's not going to be under the banner of communism. So a democratic, unified Korea with a large garrison of US troops and equipment on China's back door...not a snow flakes chance in hell. You got more chance of seeing a unification of Ukraine and Russian than a unified Korea.

       The biggest thing is capitalism loving koreans aren't going to give up their capitalism for a kim Chinese regime. Especially with so many of the people who experienced first hand the split and never seeing family again.

       You say that like there isn't a similar rate of the same age/demographic that is doing the same with Counterstrike / PUBG  / and especially Overwatch in the US.

       South Korea is twice the size of the North in terms of population, is rich, and isn't an authoritarian and starving shithole.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they sure as hell aren't going to give up democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, South Korea would need stronger ties with the west to unify (German unification cost well over €1B and there's still a big disparity), and since North Korea borders China and its close to Russia then that puts a strong US ally closer to their doorstep.

       Because you're basing this hypothetical theory on the fact that this unification would fall in favour of communism, when in all likelihood it would be the opposite.

       Reunification will only occur on America's terms. Trump has made this very clear. That's why he has been posturing against NK for the past year. Peace through strength. NK's goal is to force reunification on their terms via a nuclear threat. NK doesn't want to nuke anybody. They know if they do they will be obliterated by nukes themselves. The people running NK aren't stupid. There is a reason they have existed for so long on their own terms. What other enemy of America has achieved this? Even the Soviet Union had to bow to capitalism and reform. Giving up all of their vassals in the process. Gaddafi gave up his nukes and they were destroyed. Saddam started to go rogue and build up his military and they were destroyed. NK has played their cards very well. But we have slowly backed them into a corner. So much that their closest ally who helped prop them up for years now wants them gone. And then Russia steps in to help them because we are at war with them.
