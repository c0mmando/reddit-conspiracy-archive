        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Nobody seems to have considered (at least that i have seen) the fact that a unified Korea with the added &quot;benefit&quot; of their own nuclear weapons should at very least hugely unsettle America&#39;s foothold in the eastern/Asian parts of the world. The re-unification of North and South Korea would also likely have strong approval from both China and Russia due to a plethora of shared common political, economic and defence interests. But where would that leave America and the west in regards to global power? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand this but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that South Korea is its own country with it&#39;s own leadership and therefore would have every right to remove any American military from their territory if in the future they considered it in their best interests.

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously hypothetical but it could perhaps become a democratic monarchy. Kim Jong could continue as &quot;King&quot; with a democratic government elected to handle the proper stuff. Like England? As far as i know China and Russia both currently trade with North Korea and thus far have been somewhat reluctant to offer strong opinions on the nuclear arguments with America. All bordering countries would rather enjoy a positive relationship with their neighbours than deal with the fallout of either war or famine in North Korea. This itself suggests that&#39;s the same bordering countries would benefit from seeing a successful &quot;Korea&quot;. It&#39;d be fair to say that South Korea has relied on America for protection from the North, but what if that protection was no longer required? All of a sudden America would have no allies at all in that whole area and Korea would have strong alliances with the wests main rivals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No trap. It&#39;s debatable whether or not Trump&#39;s policy on NK is the best thing. But he knows what he&#39;s doing.

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way China wants a unified Korea, neither does the US. Once America plants a base in a country it never leaves. I can&#39;t see the US ever removing its military presence from the Korea peninsula. It&#39;s a strategic location. If there is ever a unification of Korea, which is highly unlikely it&#39;s not going to be under the banner of communism. So a democratic, unified Korea with a large garrison of US troops and equipment on China&#39;s back door...not a snow flakes chance in hell. You got more chance of seeing a unification of Ukraine and Russian than a unified Korea. </p>
