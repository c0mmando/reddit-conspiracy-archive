        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the news they’re saying that the kids were starved, beaten and tortured. It’s also says the family had an annual pass for Disneyland. It’s shows lots of family pictures of them out doing things or a portrait taken professional. They keep saying this has been going on for years and the kids are emaciated and look years younger than they actually are. But the pictures they show are fairly recent and they look like a normal family. No bruises or abnormal weight in any of them. Something seems off to me about this whole story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To my understanding, that program was shut down due to it being abused. Children were being taken from their homes at points, simply because a nurse decided she didn&#39;t like the parents for one reason or another. (Note: I could be wrong about this.

<p>And there are other things that ring falsely about that story.  </p>

<p>There is an ongoing AI protect to gain public reaction to as many issues as can be imagned.    example:  I think the Orlando shooting is one, mass  killing of gay patrons. </p>

<p>One clue is how much coverage and time each receives in the media. 
And how the falseness is intuited.</p>

<p>Some are more obvious than others,  the AI people are chasing false trails on the path to understanding human intelligence and our emotional responses. </p>

Those are fucking expensive, especially for a family of 15, they most have gone at least to Disney fairly regularly?</p>

Trust me, I used to run away, had no clue where I was going I just sensed innately that shit was wrong where I was. I was too young to understand police and what they do and that they can help. The little I knew about them suggested they were antagonistic and to be avoided. They weren&#39;t totally isolated from the wedding video they met other people that weren&#39;t chaining them and starving them so.</p>

UK media shows a few photos of family holidays, yet we are told they lacked an education or didn’t know what a police officer or dentist were. Why didn’t they escape on said vacations?

Or did they make the older ones have sex with each and have the babies? Then they would always have a source for smaller children. Maybe those family days out were for cataloging them.

    <div class="md"><p>I used to live in a very abusive home (not this bad but still incredibly bad). The “perfect family on the outside” charade is pretty much required to sustain an abusive relationship this long. If people heard/saw/guessed that anything remotely like “abuse” was happening the authorities would get involved, fast. This is also the reason why abusive parents rarely go as far as the Turpins allegedly did; the kids are pulled out before it gets that out of hand.</p>

<p>Please, call the authorities if you fear that kids are being abused at home. You could literally be saving someone’s life.</p>

<p>Another interesting aspect of the perfect family charade is that it’s often portrayed <em>inside</em> the family too. Bad things only happen because the kids “misbehave”. From an outsider’s perspective it’s hard to grasp how shackling someone to the bed for days could be a just punishment for, well, anything, but in some fucked up way this often plays out as the parent being “forced” by the child to “do bad things”. Hence the Disneyland pictures; the kids don’t hate their parents because they genuinely believe their hearts are in the right place.</p>

<p>I hope none of you can relate to this.</p>

<p>Fuck these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Something doesn&#39;t add up. If you look at the photos of their residence, they live in a very affluent area. Also, the photos of the family look perfectly normal in terms of the children&#39;s weight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my perspective as a professional who assesses people for malnutrition on a daily basis...</p>

<p>Baggy clothing can mask how skinny someone is.</p>

<p>In some of the photos you can clearly see the collarbones of some of the children. While this may be normal to some extent in women and girls, is less so for men and boys. Take a look at the boys in the Disney photos for example. Could be the style but the boys pants always seems to look very baggy in all the photos I&#39;ve seen.

<p>In reference to the extremely low weights reported... one of the adult children in their late 20&#39;s weighing 80 something pounds... There is no way to know from the reports if this weight was maintained over years or if weight was lost over a more recent shorter period of time.</p>

<p>Louise herself has physical signs of malnutrition. Her eyes are sunken in and this is evident in some of the older photos as well... however not in her high school photo... Court photos also show indentations at her temples and her cheeks are somewhat gaunt compared to past photos. You don&#39;t have to be skinny to be malnourished or starving. And these changes to the face are not necessarily normal signs of aging.</p>

<p>Louise&#39;s mother appears VERY anorexic in photos. And her father appears obese. Scroll down to view the family photo with everyone standing.

Could there be a history of eating disorder in the family or food being withheld form the mom or kids? Articles from sister Elizabeth&#39;s perspective mention Louise&#39;s mom experiencing abuse. Sometimes various forms of abuse go hand in hand with food issues. And sometimes abuse and food issues get passed down as learned behaviors unfortunately.</p>

<p>Some people with anorexia who have a history of sexual abuse might want to make themselves less curvy/womanly or less attractive to their predator. I haven&#39;t heard of a parent starving their kids for this reason, for example to protect them the dad if that was part of it, but I guess anything is possible in this bizarre case.</p>

<p>I also find it odd that the youngest seems more nourished than the rest, dressed a little nicer and getting more attention according to some articles. I wonder if this particular child is favored or if all the children were favored until they became a certain age.</p>

<p>Not really getting at anything in particular here. Just some thoughts.</p>

<p>at 24:58 with one of the sons dancing you can really see how big that suit is on him, even though it&#39;s the right sleeve and pant length. Also at 16:00 when the girls say their names really stuck out to me. I don&#39;t know how old this vid is but they don&#39;t sound like teens at all. </p>
