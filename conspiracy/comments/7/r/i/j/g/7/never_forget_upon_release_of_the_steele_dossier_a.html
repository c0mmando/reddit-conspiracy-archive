<p>This theory was pushed by RT and Fox News as well. </p>

<p>Now that the Steele dossier keeps being corroborated, people have died as a result of its publication, and the GOP has tried and failed to keep the firm&#39;s testimony sealed, I&#39;m here to remind you to be vigilant of all disinformation, however in line with your beliefs it might be.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it, you were used to this sub being a bastion of right wing lunacy and hate during the Obama administration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it wasn’t a “bastion of right wing lunacy and hate...” it was a sub where people didn’t buy into the left/right divide and considered establishment politicians to be controlled and essentially puppets for the ultra wealthy. The run-up to the US election seemed to turn this place into posters fighting for their “team”.</p>

<p>I can understand why people voted for Trump over Clinton as he was essentially framed as the anti-establishment choice. After he bombed Syria when he campaigned on a non-interventionist policy and when he installed  so many Goldman Sachs people is when the trust should’ve stopped and people scrutinise him more. However, this sub is now just an extension of the politics sub. </p>

<p>Criticism of Obama by people who visit conspiracy sites wasn’t because those people were on the right, same as Bush wasn’t being criticised by people on the left, it was because in the conspiracy forums people understood that politicians push an agenda that is ultimately moving towards the same goal which is to take away freedoms and rights of the general public and make sure they’re not a threat to the dominance of the wealthy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find your comment odd. I have no need or desire for some sort of safe space. I don&#39;t have any political affiliation, although, I&#39;d say on a few issues I lean to what people would regard as left as I believe in national health care system, but for almost everything else I think it&#39;s best if the government had as little say in a person&#39;s life as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CTR, Soros, and shareblue were talked about daily. Meanwhile no talk about Mercer and Cambridge Analytics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, all sides of the political spectrum are equally trying to push their agenda. As I said before, the main idea on the conspiracy subs and forums was that the vast majority of people in politics are working for their own interests and those of their wealthy benefactors not the interests of the people they claim to serve.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sorry, but the safe space is gone. Your batshit insane theories are going to require evidence now. Go to r/CBTS if you can&#39;t handle it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What part of my previous comment was a &quot;bat-shit crazy theory&quot;? I&#39;m not sure that the general idea that the ultra wealthy want to maintain their wealth through manipulating politicians, politics and public opinion is a particularly &quot;out there&quot; idea. I would be more surprised if the people at the very top weren&#39;t trying to do that as it&#39;s the pragmatic thing to do if you&#39;re in their position.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you think I&#39;m a right-wing voter or something, but I&#39;m in the UK and have never voted for any party that is anywhere near the right. Again, it seems like you are trying to defend your &quot;team&quot; by saying &quot;the other side do it too&quot; and I agree with you on this point.</p>

<p>I too think both sides are corrupt and want to implement ideas and policies that benefit the few and not the many. I guess on a personal level I believe in one or two conspiracies that might be considered crazy, but even then, I believe that there is at least some sort of evidence in the form of published papers, books and research to support my opinion rather than resorting to pure speculation.</p>

<p>I did try to go to the sub you linked to but it said it had been banned 7 years ago so not really sure of the relevance of the link. You&#39;re in a sub called conspiracy, so may I ask what conspiracies you do or don&#39;t believe? </p>

<p>Again, please feel free to ask me to provide evidence for any of the things you apparently think I believe and I&#39;ll be more than happy to do so. It feels like from your comment though that you&#39;ve automatically assumed that any position someone on a conspiracy forum holds must somehow be crazy or lack evidence. Feel free to provide your own counterpoints or evidence to any idea I&#39;ve expressed here that you think is incorrect. I&#39;m not really interested in defending a position I hold for the sake of winning an argument if all the other evidence points to me being wrong. I&#39;d rather admit I was wrong and update my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand the frustration about the shill label being thrown around. It was getting ridiculous at one point a few months ago when it seemed that every other post was someone being called a shill and the other user saying “you’re a shill for calling me a shill”.</p>

<p>I don’t think disagreements are necessarily an indication that someone has nefarious motives.</p>

<p>Personally I’m not so sure about Russia and Trump (I guess it would be more Trump than the Republicans in general who are being accused of this right?). I’m not knowledgeable enough on the subject to say definitively one way or another though. I do think that states obviously have preferred people they’d like to see elected. Again, this would just be pragmatic. I guess the question if the claims are true  is the extent to which Trump is compromised and what they would be required to do to return the apparent favour. I’m not seeing what Russia is benefiting from Trump being in office, but again, I’m not knowledgeable enough on the subject to say what’s credible and what isn’t.</p>

<p>I have trouble with Pizzagate too. Mainly because the supposed code words have never been confirmed by any other source apart from 4chan from what I’ve seen. I also don’t like the idea of claiming that code words are in emails as this could end up being used against ordinary citizens if it’s just decided one day that your email saying x actually means y. There’s enough evidence of actual child abuse rings in high places being covered up (certainly in the UK at least) that warrant investigation above this example. </p>

<p>Seth Rich I have no idea really. It did seem from the fact that Wikileaks put up the reward for information about his murderer that he might have leaked some info, but again, I’m not sure there’s enough info in the public domain to draw firm conclusions.</p>

<p>The FBI working for Obama and Clintons I’m not sure about. I can believe if it’s related to drug running that presidents have some information about those practices. It’s been proven that the CIA run drug rings. No doubt they’re told that they help prevent more deaths and help fund operations for taking down “the bad guys” but it wouldn’t surprise me if every president since Vietnam has approved of and had knowledge of drug running. </p>

<p>Alien contact I believe is nonsense and likely a cover story for any military tech that hasn’t been released to the public. The fact that NASA astronauts are claiming there’s aliens and UFOs I think is them trying to increase the budgets for NASA as obviously the general public might be willing to finance missions where the aim is to find alien life more readily than agreeing to send probes into space to look at planets etc.</p>

<p>Flat Earth is I think what happens when you believe that everything is a lie. In some sense it’s commendable to want to know for yourself what is true or not without relying on official sources but I’m not convinced by the Flat Earth argument at all. I don’t see a motive for anybody lying about the shape of the planet. I’ve seen people say it’s so people don’t believe in god, but there’s enough people who believe in god who think the Earth is round .</p>

<p>Sandy Hook I always wonder if the video footage that people believe shows signs of being fake was actually news stations asking people to do or re-do certain things to make their story more compelling for TV. There are some weird things about the day, but there was the Dunblane massacre in the UK where kids were really shot and it turns out that shooter was connected to Labor MPs (the party in power at the time) and that the information about the shooting is locked away for 100 years for “national security “ reasons even though that’s highly unusual. Again that suggests a real cover up. I just think it would be a lot of effort to cover up faking the deaths of kids but there’s still probably something being hidden at Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>Regarding 9/11 I really believe that this wasn’t just the work of a terrorist cell. I believe that it’s likely that rogue elements of various intelligence agencies are likely to have helped. I don’t have enough knowledge about demolitions and that kind of stuff, it just seems that protocol at multiple points wasn’t followed from NORAD to the staff on the planes. I don’t think it was Bush plotting an attack, he seemed pretty clueless on the day and there was the Webster Tarpley lecture where he explained that Bush’s code name was “angel” and the secret service received a call saying “angel is next”. How accurate this is I don’t know fully as apparently the code name had appeared in public documents so potentially anybody could have phoned in the warning but it seems unlikely to me. </p>

<p>At the very least though I think an argument could be made that government knew about the planned attack and let it happen. The attack created apparent justifications for endless wars that the Neo-Cons were advocating before the attacks so there’s definitely a motive for either making it or letting it happen without the need to argue about if the towers came down on their own or via demolition </p>

<p>Lol, no. Members of the House Intelligence Committee are right now saying that it was part of a massive hoax to justify FISA authorization to spy on Trump and his transition team. Everyone from Hillary Clinton (who paid for it) to Steele himself has admitted it was bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but this is capitalists activity. Americans went on a buying spree when Yeltsin liberalised the economy so I think you&#39;d be hard pressed to find any rich folks in America which didn&#39;t have business ties to Russia. Manafort was in contact with Russians while employed by the Podesta group. And if we had the media scrutiny on the Clinton camp I bet we&#39;d find equal activity among them and Russians as we do with Trump&#39;s camp. </p>

<p>Does it amount to collusion? No. Flint got ahead of himself and started backroom diplomacy before it was his place to do so but that is not unheard of. Obama&#39;s team contacted Canadian authorities to assure them that things was just politics in relation to statements about NAFTA. It&#39;s par for the course, but understandably people latch onto the most regular things when it&#39;s Trump because of the openly hateful things he&#39;s said. </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t Trump/Republicans produce a similar thing on Clinton? They didn&#39;t have to, the corruption was obvious and there is a multitude of sources proving this, not even counting the DNC <em>leaks</em> and the Podesta emails.</p>

<p>Do the trump meetings amount to collusion? 100% yes. They had meetings with the russian for dirt on HRC which they where told would come from wikileaks then they worked with wikileaks as well. Trump saying he was going to have dirt and make a major press confrence, Trump asking the russians to find the missing email and they would be rewarded. Trump lying to conver up his russian connections. Trump saying wikileaks a billion times giving free promotion to the russian cut out. Trump parroting russian talking points on the UN and NATO. Trump changing the Ukrainian platform.  Collusion is 100% proven now it&#39;s only conspiracy and RICO.  Maybe if it was only 1 thing and they where not constantly lying I would believe them but they lied then lied some more got caught then lied about there lies. </p>

<p>Sorry, but them saying something doesn&#39;t make it true. </p>

<p>The Clinton people met with a British former agent who was paid to find dirt on Trump, is this collusion with a foreign power to influence the election? If you hold trump to the standard you seemingly are, you should hold the others to the same standards. If what Trump did amounts to collusion then the Steele dossier does as well. His ties to a foreign government is even clearer then the Russian lawyers is to the Russian government. </p>

<p>Quit the double standard. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned it once. And it&#39;s kind of funny how you just seem to dismiss anything regarding Clinton.</p>

<p>But sure, I&#39;ll give you two more examples, a couple which I am much more familiar with as it&#39;s related to corruption within my own country.</p>

<p>Swedish company Ericsson was under investigation for selling aluminum tubes to Iran, a sanctioned goods due to it&#39;s usability in uranium enrichment. They invited Bill Clinton through the Clinton Foundation and paid him $250.000 for a 45minute speech. A few weeks later Hillary Clinton in her capacity as SoS signs a waiver for them to not be investigated.</p>

<p>Lundin Mining, a Swedish company with mining operations throughout Africa was to be investigated for numerous human rights abuses which would&#39;ve, if found guilty, led to sanctions against the company. Bill Clinton got invited to speak at their conference and the foundation got paid $250.000 for it. A few weeks later Hillary Clinton in her capacity as SoS signs a waiver for them to not be investigated.</p>

<p>Are these bribes? Sure does look like it to me. </p>

<p>Does it follow the same pattern as the alleged U1 deals? Yeah. Does it lend credence to the accusations about U1? To me it does. </p>

<p>But again, I&#39;m a neutral observer from another country so what do I know? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/2/clinton-foundations-sweden-fundraising-arm-cashed-/">The telecommunications giant didn’t make any contributions to the Swedish fundraising entity set up by Mr. Clinton, but it did pay the former president a record $750,000 for a speech in Hong Kong in November 2011, just weeks after Mrs. Clinton released the first sanctions list that excluded Ericsson and other Swedish firms.</a></p>

<p>Do note that this is during a right-wing Swedish government which included Carl Bildt as Foreign minister, whom has a substantial investment in Lundin Mining and generally corrupt as hell. There&#39;s a diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks(one of their first big published items, back when they were generally loved by democrats) detailing a young Carl Bildt being referenced by a know CIA recruiter as a person of interest for Washington, you do the math.</p>

<p>[Lukas Lundin, a Swedish investor whose family had founded the Lundin Group, also personally gave between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation prior to 2013, donor records show.</p>

<p>Lundin&#39;s lucrative mining operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were threatened by the piece of legislation Clinton herself had cosponsored in 2006.](<a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-helped-companies-that-donated-to-foundation-profit-off-africa/article/2564001">http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-helped-companies-that-donated-to-foundation-profit-off-africa/article/2564001</a>)</p>

<p>My details may be mis-remembered and I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not a perfect human with perfect memory, but from what I&#39;ve read it&#39;s perfectly obvious the Clintons are corrupt as hell and only engage in &quot;philanthropy&quot; because they can enrich themselves by doing so. </p>

<p>But this is more or less how I imagined this discussion would go, especially so since your account is newly created and only active in r/conspiracy and r/askreddit. I&#39;m not going to say it but I sure as hell am thinking it. Might want to look within yourself and your morals with what you&#39;re doing. </p>

<p>Sorry, but when you look at the evidence or lack there of, what we see is a partisan conspiracy theory designed to take focus away from the faults of the Democratic party. Assign blame, deflect. It&#39;s highly unconvincing and will burn them badly.</p>

<p>Or Trump jr was told about the wikileaks release and in exchange they lobbied for putin. Only Mueller knows cause we 100% can&#39;t beleive don jr&#39;s word. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not even clear that Russia had any impact on the election at all.</p>

<p>We all know that advertising works. Targeted advertising to low info voters works. You might think it didn&#39;t effect the election I do. Fox viewers are a testament to the ignorance of trump voters. They will beleive anything from unmasking and wiretaps to u1 and seth rich. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t sound like a joke. Sounded like he ment it when he went on to say they would be rewarded mightly. Maybe if this was the only point of context and I viewed this is a bubble it could be ok but his lies about meeting russians over and over and over don&#39;t help his case and makes him look dishonest in all other activities. </p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/5056997/donald-trump-jr-wikileaks-email__trashed/">You mean beside the DM&#39;s between wikileaks and Don Jr?</a> 
You know where the &quot;journalist&quot; Tried to influence US politics by saying trump should refuse the election results? </p>

<p>Why would trump say it during a speech instead of secretly if they were colluding</p>

<p>Because this is stupid watergate. Trump is idiot who just does things. Let Trump be Trump right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why were they never published</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they were deleted and the russians can&#39;t undelete things no matter how much Trump might have wanted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about that even remotely appears to be collusion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asking a foreign government to commit cyber intrusion and break US laws to get damaging information about your political rival in return for removing sanctions? Lol Quid pro quo= Collusion.</p>

<p>Russians stole from DNC(Just like water gate but forgein agents instead of hiring american)
They released the info through the cut out wikileaks
Trump talks it up and give it as much advertising as he possible could
Russian cyber attack americans using bots
Trump changes platform on Ukraine
Russia probes election infrastructer
Trump tries to remove sanctions. </p>

<p>Thats the short version. Lack of evidence? We have everything from emails to Trumps taxes, plus all the things trump tried to do to remove sanctions,  2 cooperating witnesses (That we know of more in the shadows.) Gates maybe #3. </p>

<p>We have the quid pro quo. We have the meetings, We have witnesses, So I understand you guys have to promote a message but we are a <strong>LONG</strong> way from &quot;I never had dealings with the russians and no one I know did&quot; At this point we&#39;re just waiting for mueller to come out with the next round of indictments. It&#39;s been a year of drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip. So sorry if i find it laughable when you say no evidence of collusion we are wayyyyyy past that Conspiracy and RICO. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>quid pro quo = collusion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Directly after admitting there was no quo. Brilliant. This argument is incredibly weak and undermines your effort.</p>

<p>Trump Jr DMs proved the opposite of what you are claiming, there was no collusion. Despite the breaking article headline misquoting him and only releasing partial text, and later being corrected, the DMs showed a media agency attempting to promote their articles and acquired content to publish. Trump Jr had little to no interest in them and in the end they did not give WikiLeaks what they wanted. And again, there is no know tie between Russia and WikiLeaks and the documents they published were probably leaked by Democratic party insiders based on all public information we have available.</p>

<p>Targetted advertising can have an affect sure but after looking into the claims it&#39;s pretty laughable. The number of ads we&#39;re quite low as a portion of the total ads and money spent over the election. Furthermore the ads themselves had mixed messages, not even pro Trump in many cases. And finally the ads werent even clearly tied to Russia but other eastern European countries, like Estonia. It&#39;s much more logical to conclude that click farmers were attempting to draw users in with whatever fake news they could.</p>

<p>What you said about Fox news is true, but your bias is showing again. You should be aware that the same is true of msnbc, CNN, etc. Also, the extremely large amount of money the Democratic party is spending in Share Blue / CTR is highly dystopian. We don&#39;t need the Russians to manipulate our elections, our own unelected power structure is already here and way better at it.</p>

<p>And yeah obviously the Republicans do the same shit. Like this release the memo stuff. Who are they waiting for? Who are they telling to release the memo? They have the power to do so, so just do it. It&#39;s a partisan distraction as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>No trump jr was asked to do a thing and then he did the thing. Trump was asked to change the Ukraine platform and he did trump was asked to remove sanctions and boy did he try. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your opinion. Maybe you didn&#39;t notice because your on the other side of it (I assume You might not be)but every progressive noticed the bot attack. My family was exposed to propaganda and they thought it was real until it was shown with out a shadow of a doubt to be fake. <a href="https://www.snopes.com/clinton-supporter-defecated-on-sign/">This</a> So IMO it worked enough even if it only changed 1 vote. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And finally the ads werent even clearly tied to Russia but other eastern European countries</p>

<p>Yeah all the same talking points I&#39;ve heard for the last year.It&#39;s pretty clear it was russia. People in much more informed places then you have corroborate that. Including every single trump and obama DNI DHS CIA AND FBI head including Christopher wray. Both sides of the shit bird. So I don&#39;t think you have the credibility to say otherwise at least not to convince me. Your welcome to try but the bar is very high. Everything I&#39;ve seen from the creation of T_D to the bots on twitter to the fake facebook news IMO it had a major effect. My friends noticed, My family noticed, I noticed, </p>

<p>MSM(-fox) has been pretty good over the last year after trump tried calling them out. Calling someone the enemy of the people gets people riled up. Tax debate, healthcare, daca, everything has been pretty clear. On russia CNN and MSNBC have been far better at reporting then FOX. u1 debunked, seth rich Fox being sued, unmasking nothing burger, wiretapping nothing burger, Up coming memo going to be the same nothing burger. <strong>VS</strong> Mueller who is bring indictments and getting convictions. Slow and steady. </p>

<p>If trump hadn&#39;t lied about his and his families contacts with russians and then fired comey saying it was because of russia. Maybe I would give him the benefit of the doubt but truly this is stupidwater gate and everyday it&#39;s a new lie or meeting. From Flynn to manafort to kushner and trump. Everyone was talking to Russians in that camp. </p>
