        An educated guess by anyone who's been paying attention for the last year leads to the obvious conclusion that the report reveals extensive abuse of power and highly illegal collusion between the Obama administration, the FBI, the DOJ and the Clinton Campaign against Donald Trump and his team during and after the 2016 presidential election.

       Funny, I thought the FBI knew about the Russia story and said
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the election. Meanwhile they were talking about Hillary's emails a couple of weeks before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, Obama and the DOJ were working with Hillary to publicly mention her email scandal while hiding any suspicion that Trump was working with the Russians until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the election.

       It's all good. The downvotes were expected and actually help get my comment seen by regular users who only browse 'controversial'. Facts, opinions and misinformation have become very difficult to separate. That quote, for instance; is 'an educated guess' the same for someone from Harvard University and someone from Geneva College? They are both educated people. It's the reader who determines the legitimacy.

       It wouldn't bother me a bit to lick every politician in America in prison.  But the Clintons have made an entire career out of criminal behavior, and have attempted to subvert the American government.  Novody in power right now comes close to the level of corruption the Clinton cabal represents.

       Lol, nobody with a brain believes the Russia propaganda.  As far as Trump's other dealings I have no doubt he's dirty.  But he's certainly no worse than the 5 presidents before him, and nowhere close to the levels of corruption that the Clinton / Obama cabal practised.

       Lowest approval rating for the first year of any presidency= no worse than the 5 presidents before him? Does not compute.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Manafort/Gates indictments along with Papadapolous/Flynn guilty pleas who are now directly working with the special counsel, yet this is all just propaganda? We've also gone from "no one in my campaign ever met with any russians" to "well most of my campaign including my son and son-in-law met with russians multiple times but don't worry it was just about adoptions." Why the lies from the beginning if nothing nefarious happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're in a conspiracy sub yet you're defending the acting US government of a conspiracy with mounting evidence.... what are you even doing here other than to defend Trump?

       Well, is that surprising when 90% of the media is working for the other team?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  Trump did nothing with Russia that wasn't common practise.  We know ffrom the that the whole Red Scare 2.0 attack was planned out by the Hillary campaign when it became clear that their pied piper candidate actually had a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump absolutely is guilty of criminal collusion with America's enemies though.  It's just that those enemies are Israel and Saudi Arabia, not Russia.

       Wow, they laundered money you say? Just like most of our corrupt government? My god, color me shocked. We sure need 2 years of Russia hysteria to figure that out!
      </p>
      <p>
       These deals happen literally everywhere, and Russia just so happens to be singled out. It also just so happens that Russia is the primary roadblock for our MIC's continued conquest and rape of the Middle East as well as the continuation of NATO's expansion eastward (after they promised not to, of course). Go figure.

       The minute that Halliburton and Goldman Sachs aren't able to buy any vote they want is the only priority.    Until then,  arguing about whether the mass murder of millions is worse than whatever horrible things the Trump people have done or not is academic.    Except that its going to be seen as partisan.   Which is really a vote FOR Goldman and Halliburton.   They smile :)

       Where's that coming from?    List out any and all of the Fortune 500 you want,  and while you are at it,   why not list out every country that has ever done pay for play,  which is a lot of countries if I am not mistaken.    Heck,   list out everyone who ever paid a lobbyist for influence.    What's your point,  that there is some honest movement you are a part of that has a higher ethical standard?

       You can go after both simultaneously. My concern is that this investigation/memo is primarily about discrediting the Mueller investigation. They aren't really trying to convict Hillary, they're just trying to prevent Trump from going down.

       There's nothing to discredit. There is no evidence of any Trump-Russia collusion after a year. The investigation is just a Deep State tool to attempt to handicap someone who they didn't expect to win. If you buy into all the mainstream media propaganda without looking at the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       evidence, then you're just being played.

       Everyone involved in this are government actors. Only difference is that some of them are partisan hacks like Nunes, some are respected veterans like Mueller.

       No one had anything but the highest praise for him when this investigation started. Suddenly he starts actually doing his job, indicting people for lying about their Russian connections, and Republicans turn around and pretend he was a hack all along. It's very transparently bullshit smearing of a hero.

       Look, our government (both Republicans and Dems) has become very corrupt. They are mostly all on the same team, and pretend to be political rivals. Just because many of them are corrupt criminals,

       After Nixon we got Agnew.   After Agnew we got Ford.    The same Gerald Ford who had been such a great American that Lyndon Johnson could count on him to sit on the Warren Commission and rubber stamp one of the sloppiest cover ups in history.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Gerald Ford also altered the location of the entry wound in Kennedy’s back so that the path of the bullet would match up with the Commissions invention of “the single bullet theory”. The Commission knew how many seconds it took to fire the rifle that was found in the school book depository, and claimed only three shots were fired.

       TLDR:   Pence was acting on the outside to help the 9/11 Cover Up "Investigation".    Mueller was acting on the inside to blow the investigation into the 9/11 Anthrax fiasco.    There are dozens more Pence's and Muellers where they came from who will straight face lie to the American people to recover from this unfolding Civil War between the Hillary loyalists and Trump loyalists where Russia,  FISA,  the Steele Dossier and everything else,  which should be serious matters properly addressed,  but instead seem to be nothing but footballs in a game.

       It will be even more interesting if the Trump haters find out something they have been in denial about.    We might actually get a larger group of people who are able to think for themselves out of it!    These left/right trolls are looking more stupid by the day.

       In other news,   you could probably padlock all the gated communities in the US and cut the criminality and corruption in half.   The elites of both sides have that much in common:  they have fattened themselves up beyond all belief and are terrified of the people.

       Frothing incoherently from the lips.   Forgot your meds?    Putin is doing the US a favor,   putting a roadblock to endless war.    Have a little respect for the better statesman.    Overthow the tyrants whose thumb you are living under who are even worse than Putin.    At least in Russia they can say they are better off under Putin.   Can we say we are better off under Obama or Trump?    Are you nuts?

      <p>
       It is just partisan propaganda at this point. Until they release the report in full, I will remain highly skeptical.

       Dude!    And miss an opportunity to let the news agenda do its magic on the hypnotized mass while behind the scenes,   something more serious and sinister can be affected,   like cutting deals with banks to let them slide on corruption charges?    Come,   on,   be a sport,  lets draw this out and maybe we can get Trump to tweet something stupid about it that takes the focus elsewhere.    Headline:  "Trump wants to revoke Mueller's Civil Rights"   or "Trump told Prostitute that he had the Clinton's by the balls,   but wanted to drag it out over his entire first term"   or "Reality TV Script found for Trumps entire first 4 years"   (and the first year has already eaten up all the material for the first three seasons!!!)   Trump seeking screenwriters to extend his presidential reality show!!!!!

       Trump has written many best selling books on Influencing People and he is an extremely high IQ. I'm surprised so many people by into his show, but that is sort of the point. Stop listening to the dog and pony show and look at what the guy has done. You can call him (outwardly) aggressive at times, but lacking intelligence is not one of his qualities. After all, look at what he had to do to get to run for President, much less win it (and with MUCH less money). Give credit where credit is due.

       unmasking is spying. (But it got much worse than that). Put 2 and 2 together. Why did Trump move his headquarters after the NSA's Admiral Rogers paid him an unexpected visit (That Obama was furious about)?

       Strzok was bounced from Mueller "probe" due to his many biased (and in the end illegal) statements to Lisa Page (and she was removed also). The most worrying might be his insurance statement against Trump. It is not the FBI's job to determine the President. They were weaponized. This might be treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was the top of the Executive Branch. Of course he knew about this (but most likely was an orchestrator). The number of crimes Obama has committed in this whole coverup are a many. Honestly, he might be going to jail or worse if convicted for Treason (Where did those hundreds of billions that were flown in on jets to Iran end up?) Where did the Uranium 1 uranium end up in the world? This is looking very bad for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't create an investigation before the crime. The FISA warrant was finally issued with the fake data in the Russian Dossier. They were refused a FISA warrant on Trump prior (though it looks like they were already spying on him and had to get that warrant to make it look legit.) So, the DNC/Hillary and likely the FBI, helped FUND and CREATE the Russian Dossier. People are going to hang for this.

       Christopher Steele seems reliable.  Lots/all of the claims seem  plausible.  The weird number of Russian connections in his campaign seems inexplicable.  Too many weird coincidences.

       I'm suggesting most of his campaign was already under investigation.  They also wouldn't be getting wiretapped if they weren't caught talking to people who were already wiretapped.

      <p>
       I would love to read that article. (I just hope it is sourced and and sauced.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Uranium 1 deal was improper because it appears to try to skirt the provision of the deal which made export out of the country forbidden. They tried to get around that by having the trucking companies license, be their "out". (Their are also moral issues of course). Once that Uranium left America (to Canada) we know it went to Europe, but then? Iran? N. Korea? etc. You do understand that Uranium has a signature and if a bomb goes off we/they can track its country of origin. But if Obama sold our Uranium, with the intention of supplying a terrorist org/power with our Uranium, that could be like a setup. (Just one interpretation of course.) So, a this end, it is treason, punishable by death. A bigger question - Why do you not care about America selling Uranium, which can be obviously made into weapons, outside the country, much less to Russia (You know, that Country they are continually trying to connect Trump to.) Can you imagine if Trump sold Uranium to Russia, this would be over.
      </p>
      <p>
       This investigator makes some great points, not so much about the Uranium one deal, but mostly focussing on the Russian Dossier.

       Because the memo is a partisan hack job designed to misinform the public. If it is released everything has to be released (sources, supporting documents) for things to actually be transparent and Republicans will never allow that.

       Was it sourced?  Were the sources released?  Who retained Steele?  As an employee of the DNC, with his action benefitting the DNC, are you trying to imply that the GOP must hold itself to a different standard than an acting representative to the DNC?  How about Feinstein then?  She did not release a fact check of Simpson’s testimony.

       I'm not sure how Steele just became an "acting representative to the DNC".  He has worked for both parties and he isn't even an American.  Feinstein released a transcript of congressional testimony, you can't equate that with a memo written by Nunes.  You don't have to believe congressional testimony but you at least know if someone is answering a question under oath there's a good chance they're going to tell the truth as they see it so they don't end up in jail.  Or they're going to use wriggly lawyer language, but Simpson didn't do that.

       It's easy to pretend that both parties are buying and selling bullshit but that's not true.  Republicans have been playing dirty politics for years, look at the Benghazi investigation.  You have a president tweeting lies and the whole rightwing media circling around to find some way, any way, that they can say he there's an inkling of truth.  The right has something the left doesn't have, a giant propaganda arm that is willing to defend each any everything they do.  I know people on this sub like to equate CNN with Fox News but it's not even close.  Do you know how many articles were put out by the "liberal" media telling me why I needed to listen to Trump voters economic concerns?  Do you think Fox News was telling anyone to listen to liberals?  It's a joke to pretend that the two parties are cut from the same cloth.  It's an easy view to take, it makes you feel cynical and smart, but it is not based in reality.

       I dont remember much about Bengazhi, other than that it was showed that the democrats were deliberately lying about what happened.  They said it was a demonstration because of a movie made about islam. This demonstration only happened in the heads of democrats and never took place in reality.  Thats a strange thing to lie about. Even if it was true, so what? Is it acceptable for democrats that we begin murder each other over youtube videos?

       Really? Another way to see it, is that the msm go into sleepmode every time a democrat is in the white house, and becomes rapid, wild dogs as soon a republican enters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can agree that fox might be a little more biased historically, (I doubt this is the case anymore after Trump won)  but they kinda have to be. They are playing a game of "1 against 10", as the only big news corp supporting republicans, while the rest are democrats. Why would republicans listen to the MSM when they just stop critical reporting all together  as soon as a democrat enters the white house, and literally becomes a flock of hungry hyenas when a republican enters?

       We've seen this time and time again. They will tease it to the point of hysteria, wait until interest dies down, release it, the few that still care will see that it vaguely hints at wrong doing, but the damage is done and people will continue to refer to it as if it was aomething

       You people are so dumb. This is a sensationalized Devin Nunes fairytale. Trump can declassify the original application for the FISA warrant. He has that power. He won’t, because it was by the book. Surround yourself with mobbed up shady figures with ties to Russian intelligence, expect to get scrutinized by the government.

       your title makes zero sense... it only exposes these peoples criminality if it's released? hasn't it already exposed their criminality to the people in power? can't they arrest and prosecute them without waving the memo around in front of the public like a red flag to a bull?

       If the FISA memo was harmless,  it would already be out.    Now is the time to pressure for it to come out,   and to wonder what's in it.    But then again,  we may never know.    What we already know is enough that Obama,   Trump and Hillary should be sharing a cell.

       "Don't Putin a President"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are we twisting the meaning of an independent counsel?
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Mueller, a registered Republican, has the reputation of having unwavering morality and being experienced, fair, responsible, tight-lipped, and dutiful. There won’t be trumped up charges or fabricated evidence if there is nothing there. The innocent will go free. Let the investigation run its course without any hullabaloo or character assassinations. Anyone that believes external forces have backed off bots or intelligence gathering against America’s democracy, doesn’t live in truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before anyone jumps on the bandwagon that the FBI or the DOJ have gone rouge for political reasons, here are facts to better help you form opinions:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Intelligence Committee chaired by Devin Nunes has lost focus on the concern of Russian intelligence and bots interfering with our past election or the cybersecurity interference from foreign adversaries. No legislation has been introduced to protect the independence of our voting process from foreign influence. Historically, America’s priority has been our concern with external attacks, both physical and intangible.
Devin Nunes, who served on Trump’s transition team, recused himself from the Russian investigation because of his furtive mishandling of classified information between the White House, yet continued to sign the committee’s subpoenas as chairman.

       Let's put it this way,   if this stands,  Trump will legally be able to hire a Russian smear job with no substance on any challenger to his re-election,   get a FISA warrant out of it,   and use the Justice Department,   NSA,  cabinet,  FBI to spy on and dig up dirt on his opponents,  even if it takes catching them in an untruth to take them out.    You may be fine with Obama and Hillary doing that,  but would you be fine with Trump doing it?
