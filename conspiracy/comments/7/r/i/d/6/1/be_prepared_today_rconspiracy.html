Pro-don&#39;t-question vaccines, no-such-thing-as-chemtrails, pro-mainstream-groupthink in general. </p>

<p>I know he&#39;s been a long-time user of this sub, but his contribution to conspiracy discussion is to detract from it. I have no idea why he spends so much time here since conspiracy theory is gently, but consistently, derided in his comments.</p>

<p>So we&#39;re supposed to just take his word on this? I&#39;ve been called a shill and a Russian bot, too, that doesn&#39;t mean that shills aren&#39;t here. There is no point being made. Just that some people call authentic users shills, occasionally.</p>

<p>If you have a problem with his argument, take it up with him. I was just acting as an interpreter because so many people were fallaciously attacking his point without refuting it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t ignore it. You are saying his point is that supposedly some people have wrongly accused him of being a shill, therefore some people supposedly can&#39;t tell the difference between shills and genuine users.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that is true, but I generally can and I&#39;m sure many others can as well. Sometimes its so obvious that wonder how biased some people are to not see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You, having been here for years...</p>

<p>...intelligent, observant, and quite clever, know fully the answer to this question.  </p>

<p>Feigning ignorance doesn&#39;t suit you, Rocky.</p>

<p>Mainstream Media talking points and agendas simply didn&#39;t become &quot;popular opinion&quot; here until paid influence reared its ugly head.  The brigaded posts and comments take on a very &quot;unreal&quot; feel, wherein the simplest response by someone in the brigade gets a very similar number of immediate upvotes even though the comment may literally make no sense at all or be quite inane.
That&#39;s the result of a brigade group upvoting and downvoting based soley on username, not on the merit of the content.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious to most that spent any time here a few years before the election.</p>

<p>Extremely Simplified Example:</p>

<p>B: The government is working in everyone&#39;s best interests.
(59)</p>

<p>CT: That is obviously and demonstrably not the case.
(-32)</p>

<p>B: You&#39;ve got to be insane if you think that money could influence our great institutions of learning or research...
(58)</p>

<p>CT: Did I log in to the wrong sub?
(-29)</p>

<p>B: No
(60)</p>

<p>CT: I like your handle.
(-35)</p>

<p>B: mayonnaise

<p>Exactly. For example, I typically disagree with <a href="/u/Mooseisabitfat">/u/Mooseisabitfat</a>. I think many of his opinions sound &quot;pro-Establishment&quot; or whatever you want to call it (no offense). BUT, I don&#39;t think he is a shill and that his dissent is paid for (of course you can never be 100% sure). </p>

<p>Its the same thing, when pointing out shill brigades, when &quot;people&quot; replay with &quot;Everyone who disagrees with me is a shill!&quot; Its a classic strawman and I&#39;m sure they know that isn&#39;t what we are saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No matter what happens, that memo is on field and nothing can change that.  Maybe it&#39;ll be done above the board, but I don&#39;t have that kind of faith in these animals.  Team red won&#39;t pass up a good stab at team blue, and neither team really wants to stop spying on us.   I think this going to get leaked, surely to Wikileaks and certainly with in the next few days.  Then wile we&#39;re all bickering about the memo&#39;s content, Trump is going to slap the final signature on FISA. Then both teams are going to turn around and use their renewed super spy powers to come down hard on &quot;those dangerous, and treasonous leakers and also Russa somehow&quot;, because &quot;this should have been done by congress.&quot; even though neither team can accomplish anything that doesn&#39;t fuck over everyone else.  My prediction is that this will be the thing that brings down Wikileaks and both teams will come out looking clean at the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that, but the stakes are being set for what they expect this memo release to accomplish. I&#39;ve seen comments and articles claim the release will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reshape the DOJ and FBI</p></li>
<li><p>Remove many politicians</p></li>
<li><p>Remove Rod Rosenstein</p></li>
<li><p>End Mueller investigation</p></li>
<li><p>Put Hillary in jail</p></li>
<li><p>Put Bill in jail</p></li>
<li><p>Put Susan Rice in jail</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When it&#39;s unlikely that any one memo will accomplish any of this. A memo may hurt. It may direct an investigation. But it&#39;s not going to vastly change how the DOJ or FBI operate. </p>

<p>The problem with these claims, is that when it doesn&#39;t happen, people will claim it&#39;s all rigged and the entire thing will continue to support their own narrative that everything i listed is evil and corrupt but can&#39;t ever face any consequences. Even though no one memo is going to implicate all those things, and put away every right wing enemy and end any investigation that may involve any right wing figures. </p>

<p>It would be like saying a memo written by Hillary Clinton will bring down Donald Trump. </p>

<p>Would it? Or would it more likely just be something that confirms the beliefs of everyone who already disliked him? </p>

<p>Nope. Any real evidence is going to come from inside the party responsible. DNC evidence is going to come from inside. Trump campaign evidence is going to come from inside. </p>

<p>Not some memo written by an opposition party member. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how you all feel about this but to me it is a bi-partisan issue.  Whatever damning information the may be in the memo should be carefully looked at by both sides prima facie.  If there is illegal and/or subversive action taken by governmental actors then both side should be enthusiastic about removing the problem.  That is if they truly give a hoot about we the people and their own government.</p>

<p>This is an opportunity for the the side who has supported wrongdoing to come clean and reprimand those elements of their party that are counter productive.  But that&#39;s just me thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Propping it up as if it will substantive is definitely pro-R bullshit. Remember Nunes&#39;s last dramatic press conference about surveillance abuse? He talked about all the illegal activity he&#39;d discovered in terms of unmasking? </p>

<p>And then other lawmakers saw those same documents and said there was literally no wrongdoing there. It was just bullshit, and nothing came of it, because Nunes was lying in order to destroy the House investigation. He&#39;s still doing the exact same fucking thing. You have to be especially gullible or a partisan hack in order to think that his latest escapade is worthwhile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s frustrating that we&#39;ve already hit this stage of the story on r/conspiracy. We&#39;ve gone from discussing the subject to meta posts whining about brigades, but we&#39;ve still seen nothing of what&#39;s actually in the memo.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen nothing but spin from various politicians and the front page is dominated by the story, but still we have posts like this whining that people are saying things they don&#39;t like about it.</p>

<p>Oh, and add in the classic &quot;look at this brigade&quot; when people start posting at normal waking hours for the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the most dangerous lines of thinking the liberals promote is that &#39;everybody is doing it, it&#39;s not just us&#39;.  They impose the idea that both parties are equally corrupt as a manner of scapegoating and deflection from their overt criminality.  The con is all about personal enrichment, and consistently liberals come into power poor and come out rich without jobs while conservatives go into power rich and come out of power only to continue working.  This is the true pattern and Democrats do everything in their power to obfuscate this fact.  Hell, Ron Paul doubled his net worth in 2011 from $2 million to almost $5 million on a government et salary - Warren Buffet would be impressed.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand where all of the anti-Trump users came from in this community.

<p>You don&#39;t understand why all of a sudden Anti-Trump conspiracies would be more popular on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, post-election, when the Trump Administration took office and begun to hold authority?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As of right now, the top 8 posts on this sub are about an unreleased memo that Republicans claim will be the end of the Democrats. It has not leaked, the only people so far claiming it is damaging are those with reason to be dishonest. </p>

<p>Is that the brigading you are talking about? I agree, seems excessive to have that many posts on an unreleased memo.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve already made up your mind based on party lines then what do you want from me?  </p>

<p>If you discount the fact that this sub and any posts that may show the DNC in not a good light are repeatedly preyed upon by other members of other subs you&#39;re blind or you are one of them.  Either way, no matter how much things are laid out for you will always stick to your party line.</p>

Saying &quot;consider the source&quot; is not only reasonable, it&#39;s a talking point pushed to an absurd degree on here, yet apparently saying <em>maybe</em> Republican politicians are playing partisan games is &quot;sticking to the party line&quot;.</p>
