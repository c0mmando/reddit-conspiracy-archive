        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: Even if people disagree with this post, it is sad they are downvoting instead of discussing. I feel I presented some fair arguments with evidence, and I spent a lot of time on it. I am not saying you have to agree with any of my conclusions, but the amount of downvotes is absurd.</p>

<p><strong>Why You Might Be a Satanist and Not Even Know It: An Analysis of Satanic Beliefs in Modern Society</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do you practice Satanism?</strong></p>

<p>You are probably going to say, no.</p>

<p>Some time ago, I was on <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>, and I was surprised to see a large defense of Satanism in some of the threads. As I was downvoted to negative 40 points, most people simply told me that Satanism is not what I think it is – it is not <em>really</em> devil worship. It is a movement against anti-intellectualism and religion. It promotes rationalism, thought, equality, and justice. These were their arguments.</p>

<p>On the surface, it appears they are right. I mean most people today who claim to practice Satanism do not really go around worshipping the devil or sacrificing animals. Maybe they really just want to create a better, more free-thinking world, and “Satanism” is a great way to get people to pay attention, right?</p>

<p>My friend, who used to be a Christian, recently became a Satanist. She posted something about the Church of Satan on her Instagram, and in the comments, she ensured everybody it was not about worshipping Satan, really. It was something else and she would be willing to provide more information for those willing to ask.</p>

<p>Not only do I think my friend is being deceived, but I think thousands more are being deceived, too, because ultimately, the best way to keep a secret is to hide it in plain sight.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to discuss Satanism on three levels:</p>

<p>1)  Yes, there are people out there who really do worship Satan, and whether or not you think Satan is real, they do. There are people out there who have participated in human and animal sacrifices in the name of the devil. There are people out there who have sold their souls in the name of the devil.</p>

<p>2)  Yes, there are people out there who belong to a Satanic church, but they may not really believe in Satan. Still, they are being deceived, and I will show you how in this post.</p>

<p>3)  Finally, I believe that people indirectly practice Satanic principles in our society and do not even know it. This is the biggest level of deception that I see.</p>

<p>As you read this post, know that I am not trying to convert you to any specific belief or thought. Rather, as always, I want to expose how some may be falling into deception and illusion of  nihilism, selfishness, and self-worship under the guise of &quot;innocent Satanism.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Argument 1: Satanism is not really about Satan!</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, many in the threads in <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> (and other places) support Satanic churches, which they claim are really only there to counter anti-intellectualism of most theology, and act as a sort of “opposing viewpoint” of rationalism in schools and other places. For example, many support “After School Satan Clubs” for this very reason:</p>

<p><a href="https://afterschoolsatan.com/">https://afterschoolsatan.com/</a></p>

<p>They state, “These are the environments into which the After School Satan Clubs (ASSC) are being inserted and, in contrast to the Good News Clubs, our curriculum will focus on free inquiry, rationalism, and scientific understanding. Proselytization is not our goal, and we’re not interested in converting children to Satanism.”</p>

<p>I have a simple question for anybody reading this – Would you believe, when I write this post, that I am not trying to get anybody to believe in any Christian beliefs at all, even though I stated as such in my introduction? Look, I try to be neutral when I write, but ultimately, you probably can detect the Christian bias. It is something I am often accused of in my writing. The thing is, no matter what I do, my bias will influence my perspective, and I am being clear about that right now. I do not want to deceive any when I write. When people call me out on my Christian bias, I say yes, you are right, it is there. But, had I not included my statement earlier, would you trust me? Even if your answer is no, many trust that the After School Satan Club is not there to promote Satanism. Really?</p>

<p>So when, this after school club says it really has nothing to do with converting children to Satanism, I stand a little suspicious. By the way, I will discuss what Satanism really is in a moment. </p>

<p>Before I do that, know that Satanism is on the rise and “cool”:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jan/08/chelsea-clinton-church-satan-got-cool">https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jan/08/chelsea-clinton-church-satan-got-cool</a></p>

<p>From the article, “Satanism’s latest mutation is something else, a contrarian uprising against a patriarchal world order that deserves its comeuppance.”</p>

<p>So, it seems today, that Satanism is everything but Satanism. Satanism is everything but worship of Satan. Satanism seems to be some sort of counter-culture movement to attack “backwards” ideas. That is what ‘they’ want you to believe anyway.</p>

<p>Before you slip into those beliefs, I want to look at this innocent sort of Satanism with you. Sure, maybe it is a political movement of some sort, but what really are the tenets of modern Satanism? Like any “religion”, there are many sects, so I wanted to focus on the most popular sect at the moment – the Church of Satan.</p>

<p><em>The Tenets of the Church of Satan</em></p>

<p>I wanted to explore the foundational beliefs of this “church”, and I wanted you to examine whether of not our society operates in conjunction with these beliefs. For the sake of brevity, I am only going to discuss some of the tenets, but you can always explore them yourself. </p>

<p>1)  <em>Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence</em>: Wow, I could probably make another post about this, but I would say that the United States is a pretty indulgent society, from food, to sex, to pleasure, to money. In our country, “more” is painted as better. While I could provide many examples of this from the obesity epidemic to materialism in general, I always think of the rise of sexual taboos in our society. For example, incest, or “Genetic Sexual Attraction” is on the rise:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/family/disgusted-by-incest-genetic-sexual-attraction-is-real-and-on-the/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/family/disgusted-by-incest-genetic-sexual-attraction-is-real-and-on-the/</a></p>

<p>2)  <em>Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates!</em> This one really stands out to me, as I try to operate on the principle of the golden rule. Though it can be difficult, I have a strong belief that kindness begets kindness, and the world needs more kindness. There are more and more news articles that show how unkind our world really has become, as cities are enforcing rules and laws that do not allow people, organizations, or churches to feed the homeless:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/malibu-united-methodist-church-asked-to-suspend-homeless-food-service/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/malibu-united-methodist-church-asked-to-suspend-homeless-food-service/</a></p>

<p>While there are arguments as to why this is being done, it is just one example or reflection of the unkind world we are living in – the belief that only some deserve kindness is simply ludicrous to me. By the way, the next tenet is “Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!”. Is that really the world we want to raise our children in?</p>

<p>3)  <em>Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all!</em> Some may be taking this a little too literally, as many are identifying as “trans-species.” Seriously:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvwknv/what-does-it-mean-to-be-trans-species">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvwknv/what-does-it-mean-to-be-trans-species</a></p>

<p>If we are nothing more than animals, then all things go, I guess.</p>

<p>4)  <em>Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!</em> This goes back to number 1, and our society certainly seems to be operating under the principle of “do what thou wilt” and “as long as it makes you happy!” I like to call this “Oprah Morality” because she leads her audience to believe that everything is about the pursuit of happiness. This is selfishness in disguise, though, as sometimes what makes us individually happy can harm others. I know the following article is “The Daily Mail” but you can find a lot about this man who left his family to identify as a 6 year old girl:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3356084/I-ve-gone-child-Husband-father-seven-52-leaves-wife-kids-live-transgender-SIX-YEAR-OLD-girl-named-Stefonknee.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3356084/I-ve-gone-child-Husband-father-seven-52-leaves-wife-kids-live-transgender-SIX-YEAR-OLD-girl-named-Stefonknee.html</a></p>

<p>He says, “&#39;I can’t deny I was married. I can’t deny I have children,&#39; she says in the video. &#39;But I’ve moved forward now and I’ve gone back to being a child. I don’t want to be an adult right now.”</p>

<p>Can you imagine how painful this experience is for his family? Yet, people will proclaim that it makes him happy, so that is what he should do. There is no reason for him to seek therapy or mental help or anything like that, so as long as he is happy. In one interview I watched of him, he said he did not even really think of his family, or it was easy for him not to.</p>

<p>5)  <em>Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!</em> I think this is true. Think about how many people give up on religion all together because of the corruption of churches. Many churches massively deceive their followers with countless scandals. Think about the BTK killer who was the president of the congregation of the at Christ Lutheran Church:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/28/cnna.btk/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/28/cnna.btk/index.html</a></p>

<p>Many fall from God because of the corruption and hypocritical nature of churches. I do not blame them. Still, I am under the belief that one can come to God and Christ without a church, and while fellowship is important, one does not need a church to be saved (Here is my Christian bias leaking in…sorry).</p>

<p>There is clearly much more that I can write here, but I think it is clear that many in our society operate under Satanic principles, even if they do not know they are Satanic, but this leads to my next argument.</p>

<p>(PS: I saw this interview about a Satanist whose role was solely to break up churches. I will see if I can find it).</p>

<p><strong>Argument 2: I am not a Satanist – I am just obsessed with myself!</strong></p>

<p>Many reading this, I believe, do not realize that even if somebody is not praising Lucifer every morning, they simply may be worshipping themselves. To me, selfishness is the equivalent of Satanism, or really, Satanism in disguise. </p>

<p>First, our society has become increasingly narcissistic: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/narcissism-the-science-behind-the-rise-of-a-modern-epidemic-a6925606.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/narcissism-the-science-behind-the-rise-of-a-modern-epidemic-a6925606.html</a></p>

<p>It really is no secret that technology has bred a new level of narcissism, where people can literally be worshipped as Gods. People spend their days posting selfie after selfie, doing nothing really for the world or anyone else, seeking praise and validation. Look, I’m not saying I never take a selfie, but since I have been examining my own selfishness, I have found I feel more and more terrible after participating in social media. There are countless articles about social media, selfishness, and narcissism, so I am not going to bore you with things you already know:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.collegemagazine.com/social-media-making-generation-selfish/">https://www.collegemagazine.com/social-media-making-generation-selfish/</a></p>

<p>Rather, I want you to think about how the current and upcoming generations of children are being raised. For example, these teens decided to film a drowning man instead of helping him:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/20/us/florida-teens-drowning-man/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/20/us/florida-teens-drowning-man/index.html</a></p>

<p>That one honestly makes me sick to my stomach. As selfishness rises, empathy is on the decline:</p>

<p>The Scientific American states, “The research, led by Sara H. Konrath of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and published online in August in Personality and Social Psychology Review, found that college students’ self-reported empathy has declined since 1980, with an especially steep drop in the past 10 years. To make matters worse, during this same period students’ self-reported narcissism has reached new heights, according to research by Jean M. Twenge, a psychologist at San Diego State University.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-me-care/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-me-care/</a></p>

<p>So, maybe people do not claim the label of “Satanist” but operating on pure selfishness is not really that different, is it? Besides, does the label really matter in the end? Selfishness is selfishness, rather somebody labels themselves a Christian, a Buddhist, or a Satanist.</p>

<p><strong>Argument 3: People do not <em>really</em> worship Satan</strong></p>

<p>Throughout this post, I have argued that people are operating on Satanic levels, even if they do not know it. However, there really are people out there who do worship Satan and believe he is real, whether you do or not, and many of these people are in positions of power. </p>

<p>There are many, many news articles about sacrifices and murders being associated with Satan worship:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/most-feared-gang-mara-salvatrucha-ms13-america-satanic-ritual-sacrifice-teenage-girl-satan-alvarez-a7623826.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/most-feared-gang-mara-salvatrucha-ms13-america-satanic-ritual-sacrifice-teenage-girl-satan-alvarez-a7623826.html</a></p>

<p>This one involves a couple who are bled to death during a Satanic ritual:</p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2018/01/04/couple-bled-to-death-on-vacation-island-in-satanic-ritual-cops/">https://nypost.com/2018/01/04/couple-bled-to-death-on-vacation-island-in-satanic-ritual-cops/</a></p>

<p>The articles linked above mention “normal?” people participating in Satanic rituals, but what better place to start than Hollywood and celebrity culture?</p>

<p>As many of you know, many worship celebrities as Gods, and there are many ties to Satanism in celebrity culture. Since there are thousands of hours of YouTube videos on this stuff with creepy music, I want to say that only you can be judge and determine if these celebrities really worship Satan. If you watch this video with Bob Dylan, he talks about the bargain he made for his fame. In an entirely serious tone, he explains he made a bargain with “the chief commander on this Earth and a world we cannot see.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_wAZ02JUtM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_wAZ02JUtM</a></p>

<p>Bob Dylan is just one of the countless celebrities that has claimed to sell his soul to the devil, and whether or not you believe in the devil does not really matter, because many of these celebrities seem to.</p>

<p>There are other celebrities who are more blatant about it, like Marilyn Manson, and I already know the argument. It is just a ploy, right? It is just a way to shock people and sell records, right? But, Mason did say, “Music is the strongest form of magic.” Here is a list of celebrities, like Manson, who are self-proclaimed Satanists:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/famous-satanists/jessika-gilbert">https://www.ranker.com/list/famous-satanists/jessika-gilbert</a></p>

<p>But, going beyond all of that (and there are just so many directions we can go here), I wanted to go deeper. Whether or not these celebrities are worshipping Lucifer is not even really what is important. It is more important that we look at what these celebrities promote. When I log on to the front page of Reddit, I see the worship of celebrity culture daily. I was guilty of this worship as a teen, but it all changed when I realized what these celebrities (whether movie or music or whatever) promote: selfishness, indulgence, sexual deviancy, materialism, narcissism, greed, and so on. Do I have to even link to anything to prove this? To me, those words are pure reflections of Hollywood. Not only that, these celebrities often preach about helping others or giving to the poor, as they sit in their mansions on a house on the hill. </p>

<p>In one of my classes, we are doing a thematic unit on utopia. I played different songs with utopic ideals, and students discussed if they are agreed with them or not. We listened to John Lennon’s “Imagine”, and I kind of laughed (in my mind) about the hypocricy of him talking about no possessions and such, though in his defense, he did seem to be aware that it was hypocritical, so he changed the lyrics over time to account for the hypocricy:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/john-lennon-hypocrite">https://www.theodysseyonline.com/john-lennon-hypocrite</a></p>

<p>Anyway, the point is that most movies and music today are about pure indulgence and selfishness. Sure, it is what sells, but I believe that these people in power can sell anything they want to, really. They are the Gods of the modern generations, and people will do what they say. The point is, too, that many celebrities are simply hypocrites. I was on <a href="/r/buddhism">/r/buddhism</a> a few months ago, and they love to talk about celebrities that are Buddhists. I called it out and said it seems like a complete contradiction to claim to be Buddhist and have millions of dollars. They did not like that, but it just complete hypocricy to me. Many point of the hypocricy of churches, yet never do you hear about the hypocricy of rich and famous celebrities who preach about helping the world. </p>

<p>I am getting of topic, but the point is that whether there are real Satanic practices in Hollywood is not even what I am trying to argue – that is for you to decide. Rather, I am saying that these celebrities preach Satanic ideals on a daily basis, and many are simply deceived.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Wherever you are in your spiritual journey, I want you to ask yourself if any of these beliefs have really made the world a better place. What I mean is Satanism is often disguised as &quot;do what you want as long as it makes you happy&quot;, but does that really make the world better?</p>

<p>I also find it interesting that somehow they twisted the meaning of Satanism to seemingly mean everything but devil worship. Does that not seem deceptive? Are you falling into this trap of deception? By the way, if the devil is real, he is said to “twist” things or turn them “upside-down.” Could it be that Satan really did convince the world to worship him by making them believe he does not exist? Isn’t that the ultimate deception?</p>

<p>But, even if Satan is not real, the world certainly seems to be operating under his principles.</p>

<p>The world literally seems to be upside down at the moment, to me. Every day, it seems more non-sensical. Sometimes I literally feel like Alice in Wonderland as she wanders through a non-sensical world and tries to rationalize it:</p>

<p>“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?&quot;
&quot;That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t much care where –&quot;
&quot;Then it doesn&#39;t matter which way you go.” 
― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland</p>

<p>Where do we go from here? To me, it starts with caring. If we do not care about anything but ourselves, then it does not matter what we label it, we are leading the world to pure destruction. We are leading our world into complete chaos, where everything goes and nothing makes sense. But, if we do care about things, and we do not support this nihilistic worldview that nothing matters, than maybe our world would be a better place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,  helplessness,  hopelessness,  victim-hood,  it often seems the authorities are fine with that as long as it can be played by them in their schemes.

And also who by necessity must know where the fast money is,  which is drugs,   prostitution,  and war.    Sad.</p>

<p>We can dedicate a portion of our time exposing that,   especially when we find a sincere audience.    Somehow,   looking back over time,   we can also see this has be evolving over a long period of time,   and the pace of change has increased exponentially.</p>

Each of us has our own center,   marked by the present moment and the half inch in front of our next step.   If we forget that,   we won&#39;t be a help to anyone,  least ourselves.    Its a balance.    Each point is a point of view.   No two points have the same perspective,  but no two points are separate.</p>

They often try to build statues of Baphomet in public places where others have tried to place the Ten Commandments, in order to point out the hypocrisy of Christians who use the 1st Amendment to justify placing their religious symbols on public lands but then get angry when non-Christian groups want to do the same.  </p>

<p>You can&#39;t &quot;accidentally&quot; worship Satan, just as you can&#39;t accidentally worship Christ. You can perform all kinds of Christian rituals without knowing it, but you&#39;re not worshiping Christ unless you believe that Christ is your savior and your intend to worship Him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s simply not true. The PDF application form you fill out to join states the Church of Satan is a religion, and recommends you read the Satanic Bible:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php">https://www.churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php</a></p>

<p>The companion book to the Satanic Bible is The Satanic Rituals, which includes the following: &quot;Rites in the book include a version of the legendary
Black Mass, the Ceremony of the Stifling Air (inspired by the history 
of the Knights Templar), and Satanic baptismal rites (both child and 
adult).&quot;
<a href="https://archive.org/details/Anton_Szandor_Lavey-The-Satanic-Rituals">https://archive.org/details/Anton_Szandor_Lavey-The-Satanic-Rituals</a></p>

<p>An outline for one of the rituals:</p>

<p>Dress for ritual.
2. Assemble devices for ritual; light candles and shut out all outside light sources; place parchments to right and left of the altar as indicated.
3. If a woman is used as the altar she now takes her position – head pointing south, feet pointing north.
4. Purification of the air by ringing of the bell.
5. The “Invocation to Satan” and “Infernal Names” which follow are now read aloud by priest. Participants will repeat each Infernal Name after it has been said by priest.
6. Drink from chalice.
7. Turning counter – clockwise, the priest points with the sword to each cardinal point of
the compass and calls forth the respective Princes of Hell: Satan from the south, Lucifer from the east, Belial from the north, and Leviathan from the west.
8. Perform benediction with the phallus (if one is used).
9. Priest reads aloud appropriate invocation for respective ceremony: Lust, Compassion, or Destruction.
10. In the case of a personalized ritual this step is extremely important. Solitude is compatible with the expressing of the most secret desires, and no attempt to “hold back” should be made in the acting out, verbalizing, or casting of images pertaining to your desires. It is at this step that your “blueprint” is drawn, wrapped, and sent off to the recipient of your working.</p>

<p>An &quot;invocation to Satan&quot; is included. Pretty strange for a &quot;Church&quot; that professes not to believe in Satan, huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true whatsoever. Nowhere does Christ ask to be worshipped. When he says to &quot;follow me&quot; he means his teachings. </p>

<p>Satan/Beezlebub/Baal/The God of a thousand faces doesn&#39;t need you to worship him either. Just following his tenets is enough. Worship of the self as God, no belief in any objective morality.</p>

<p>&quot;You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&#39;s desires.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t like the bible? From the Quran:</p>

<p>&quot;The Devil [Iblis] said,</p>

<p>“If I am successful in persuading man to do three things, 
then that will be all I need:</p>

<p>To make forget his sins.
To regard his good deeds as too many.
To be proud of his own opinion.“</p>

<p>&quot;O you who believe, do not follow the steps of Satan. Anyone who follows the steps of Satan should know that he advocates evil and vice.&quot;</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re doing his desires, he&#39;s your &quot;father&quot; whether you believe in him or not. </p>

<p>Funny people who claim to be atheist would join a Church of Satan anyway. Why would one need any kind of doctrine or set of beliefs as an atheist? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Like what, if you don&#39;t mind me asking? I&#39;m familiar with the alleged connections with the Knights Templar and possible bastardization of the name of Muhammad, but I&#39;m more familiar with what the famed occultist Eliphas Levi wrote about the image typically used by Satanists:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The goat on the frontispiece carries the sign of the pentagram on the forehead, with one point at the top, a symbol of light, his two hands forming the sign of occultism, the one pointing up to the white moon of Chesed, the other pointing down to the black one of Geburah. This sign expresses the perfect harmony of mercy with justice. His one arm is female, the other male like the ones of the androgyne of Khunrath, the attributes of which we had to unite with those of our goat because he is one and the same symbol. The flame of intelligence shining between his horns is the magic light of the universal balance, the image of the soul elevated above matter, as the flame, whilst being tied to matter, shines above it. The beast&#39;s head expresses the horror of the sinner, whose materially acting, solely responsible part has to bear the punishment exclusively; because the soul is insensitive according to its nature and can only suffer when it materializes. The rod standing instead of genitals symbolizes eternal life, the body covered with scales the water, the semi-circle above it the atmosphere, the feathers following above the volatile. Humanity is represented by the two breasts and the androgyne arms of this sphinx of the occult sciences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s a complex sigil representing a bunch of different but related occult principles. That said, I may be glossing over or unaware of other things. </p>

<p>The Satanic Temple is an atheistic organization. I should note that even though people mistake the Satanic Temple and the Church of Satan, BOTH are atheistic organizations, though the Church of Satan likes the ritualistic aspects of ceremonies, they do not actually believe in any deities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, well, now you&#39;re talkin&#39;! There is enormous philosophical debate over whether determinism necessarily means that free will doesn&#39;t exist. I tend to be a compatibilist, meaning I believe that the concept of free will is compatible with determinism. The best defense of this view, I think, comes from Harry Frankfurt, in “Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be upfront, my views on this are informed by people like Sam Harris and Dennett, who make statements like &quot;science has proven beyond doubt that humans are just biomechanical puppets&quot; and I&#39;ve associated that kind of absurd pseudo-philosophy with determinism/materialism in general.

    <div class="md"><p>I think OP has done a pretty solid job of showing that Satanism has in many ways taken over our society and is seen in the media, in education, and in most social settings. I am a Christian and even I will admit it is dangerous to have a single religion or philosophy that has that much control over society, especially as OP points out, when people follow it unwittingly. If this was a discussion about Christianity you would be saying we don&#39;t need news outlets, telivision shows, movies, music, games, even politicians, pushing it down your throat and I would have to agree with you, but somehow Satanism is allowed to monopolize Western religion without anyone even recognizing its existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I like this topic. I believe there is a battle going on and many things that do destroy our world are being propped up as normal and okay, nothing to see here. I have looked alot into the pineal gland, crystals, reiki, ect and look at the bible with a bit of an unconventional view (supernatural and what is possible). However, as intriguing as these ideas are takes God out of the equation and essentially is making yourself God, capable of healing and so much more if you believe it. </p>

<p>I agree with you, in the sense that I do think an emphasis is being placed on only thinking about yourself. You can&#39;t sin, do wrong, we are all the same, you are God, we are all God&#39;s ect. It&#39;s a trick to get people to just do their own thing and disregard others so we stay divided, fighting, and doomed. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with mainstream Christianity, but the above thinking (all about me)  is just evil being paraded as normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Christian, probably not a good one lol, I&#39;m more based on grace and more open minded. I do not like the attitude of churches and agree they drive away many. I think love is what the world needed and Jesus had a plan (what he taught, goodness). I believe more then that, but for people who don&#39;t believe in it all, they should at least see the wisdom in the teachings of Jesus (not the church today). </p>

<p>Some things that may interest you, on top of what you noticed. I&#39;ve seen theories on here that it&#39;s actually flipped and Satan is good and God is the bad one. Gnostic beliefs were parading by a LARP on 4chan (high level insider) that had lots looking into self enlightenment.</p>

<p>It was a long read and I skimmed a bit. But I think you are spot on in your observations. I don&#39;t think they are trying to make us Satanist. I think they just want to normalize it and make it okay that they are. That way people can say, nooo that&#39;s not what it is because they don&#39;t fully practice and higher ups who practice for real can do so under the guise that it is make believe. Plus Satan doesn&#39;t need us to believe in him, we just have to o act like him and he is happy.</p>

<p>I had wanted to write up a similar post based on things I have seen, but it seems posts get hit hard like this if it&#39;s religious. Put it out there anyway because it&#39;s important :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, my thoughts are jumbled lol! But that&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen. Make Christian&#39;s think they don&#39;t need Christ (they are like Christ, have his powers, beliefs that if your good you&#39;ll be blessed with money and power and can bring it to you, ect.). Also, make non Christian&#39;s believe Satan and God does not exist or better yet that Satan is the good guy, not so bad, or maybe he was right all along or misunderstood. The best lies I&#39;ve seen pushed is the universalism or whatever were we are worshiping the same God or that we are all God&#39;s. I guess it doesn&#39;t matter which way you go as long as the end result is what they want.</p>

<p>Have you read into the pineal gland and healing with chackras? Supposedly (I&#39;m wary to try it) the energy feels like a serpant coil up and around your spine. Reading peoples experiences with all of it and unsealing the crown chackra is interesting and makes me wonder if it&#39;s opening them up to evil influences or something vs the enlightenment they were going for. </p>

<p>What I find perplexing is the growing number of people who believe in some kind of spiritualism. Energy healing, crystals, &quot;raising their vibration,&quot; magic etc.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It&#39;s a new age religion. A religion without any personal responsibility or responsibility to others. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a very interesting observation. Personally, many of the people that I associate with (friends, co-workers, family members, etc.) study the specific spiritual interests that you mentioned, yet they absolutely and completely believe in &quot;personal responsibility&quot; and &quot;responsibility to others&quot; -- often more so than others who follow more &quot;traditional&quot; and/or organized religions.</p>

<p>In fact, it is actually nearly impossible (if not entirely impossible) to pursue any or all of those interests in a sincere and devoted manner without first learning and/or possessing a profound understanding of the concept of responsibility, and behaving accordingly.</p>

<p>For instance, with regard to &quot;energy healing&quot;, in order to be most effective, one must generally attain as &quot;pure&quot;, aware and connected a state as possible, and recognize (and deeply respect) the lifeforce, consciousness and &quot;sacred&quot; (for lack of a better term) nature of all those around them.</p>

<p>In addition, anyone who is a serious student of the subject of &quot;magic&quot; possesses an understanding of all of the issues surrounding the concepts of &quot;Do no harm&quot;, the &quot;Rule of Three&quot; and the like, and realizes that one must <em>always</em> be responsible for their thoughts and actions, lest they personally face the consequences -- or unintentionally cause negative repercussions for others. In truth, &quot;magic&quot; (in its truest form) is all about recognizing that everything is connected, in some manner, and realizing that one must be responsible for that which they create.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the key purpose in &quot;raising one&#39;s vibration&quot; is to attain a far more positive, open, responsible and loving state of being -- and to hopefully help others in the world to reach or transition to that state, as well.</p>

<p>I deeply respect your personal beliefs, and I truly don&#39;t mean to be rude or dismissive, in questioning your statements...but it honestly seems as though you might not actually understand the beliefs of those to whom you are referring (and the foundation of those beliefs), or afford them the same level of respect that they deserve.</p>

<p>(I also think that you might not be taking into account the fact that many of the people who currently follow different spiritual paths <em>have</em> extensively studied the Bible or other holy books, already, and simply didn&#39;t find truth, or the insights that they were seeking, there.</p>

<p>I, myself, was raised in a Christian household and community; in my youth, I even attended a parochial school where I had to read the King James Version of the bible, front-to-back, multiple times, and compose a number of essays and speeches about it. </p>

<p>However, shortly after that period in my life, I had a near-death experience that was completely different to -- and far more extraordinary and complex than -- anything that is described in any of the teachings of the Abrahamic religions, including Christianity. I later had a number of other &quot;spiritual&quot; encounters and incidents, as well, which, to me, confirmed the truth at the heart of my initial experience.</p>

<p>(To clarify: I would never insult or disparage a follower of Christianity for their beliefs; it&#39;s just that I, personally, cannot ascribe to that system of faith, on account of my experiences and studies.)</p>

<p>Long story short, I have now studied a multitude of subjects related to &quot;spiritualism&quot; -- including those that you mentioned -- and, as a direct result of the insights that I have received, along my journey, I have been a vegan for three decades, I spend much of my time volunteering for charitable organizations, and I actively try to be as responsible a person as possible.</p>

<p>More importantly, many of the people whom I volunteer with happen to share &quot;spiritual&quot; beliefs that are similar to mine and, as I had mentioned, also share this same strong belief in personal responsibility and responsibility to others.</p>

<p>I do hope that you&#39;ll forgive my lengthy comment, and I sincerely apologize if I didn&#39;t adequately explain things, but I just wanted to make an attempt to convey to you the fact that, in truth, people don&#39;t need to believe in a traditional &quot;God&quot; figure, per se, or believe in &quot;any of the teachings in the Bible or any other holy book&quot; in order  to believe in &quot;personal responsibility&quot; or &quot;responsibility to others&quot;...and that perhaps you&#39;re being a bit unfair and inaccurate in your overall assessment.</p>

<p>Moreover, a large part of the practice of &quot;responsibility to others&quot; involves recognizing the fact that <em>many</em> people have personal beliefs and experiences that may differ from yours, and trying to at least understand those differences. One can&#39;t truly be responsible to others if they are dismissive of others&#39; thoughts and beliefs, or view others as morally, ethically or &quot;spiritually&quot; inferior, as you appear to be doing.</p>

<p>In other words: It&#39;s all about mutual respect, and perhaps the world would be a much better place if everyone just put a little effort into really understanding what others believe, why they believe what they do, and how their personal experiences have shaped those beliefs. Perhaps, by doing this, we could all learn more about the true nature of our reality and existence, too. :) )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing. I apologize for making such a blanket statement. I should have been more specific. What I meant to refer to were the people who mistake those teaching to mean they should just ignore and not think about anything negative because it will lower their vibration, and focus solely on the self. That dismiss others beliefs as &quot;old fashioned&quot; while preaching their own as superior. They hurt and take from others and then refuse to address it because to do so would be focusing on &quot;negativity&quot; and it doesn&#39;t matter anyway because everything is an &quot;illusion.&quot; That&#39;s the best way I can think of to describe them. </p>

<p>I knew a lot of them, being from California. ; )</p>

<p>There are people of all &quot;belief systems&quot; that use them as a justification for their own selfishness though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to provide clarification on that, and I apologize again, as well, if my comment seemed dismissive in relation to your beliefs. There just appears to be an awful lot of blind judgment, hypocrisy, misinterpretation, and misrepresentation in this particular thread [I don&#39;t wish to go into detail or mention specific people or comments, but I would like to clarify that I&#39;m not referring to you or your posts], so I&#39;m afraid that my interpretation of your comment was likely adversely affected by all of that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really glad that you provided more details about your perspective, though, and I understand what you mean, now.</p>

<p>(...and, I used to live in California, myself, so I have to admit that I knew a lot of &quot;those types&quot; of spiritualists, too. ;) )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree! I can&#39;t help but wonder if (as others have mentioned, in other threads) the ad hominem attacks and arguments are just the products of shills, bots, trolls and the like, though...or if, instead, they&#39;re actually the organic result of changes in society and the increasingly aggressive nature of interactions on social media.</p>

<p>For example, the general tone of things on Twitter has grown infinitely more hostile, over the past couple of years, to the point where a person can rarely even share a personal opinion on a topic without receiving hateful responses from strangers around the globe. Just the mention of a non-controversial, non-partisan story involving conspiracies or corruption can evoke replies like &quot;You crazy tin foil hatter&quot;, &quot;What are you, a flat earther?&quot;, or &quot;You probably think Elvis is still alive, too, don&#39;t you?&quot;, even. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so crazy. But...for the most part, it does seem like the legitimate, genuinely curious members of this specific sub do try to respect one another, whenever possible, so it still appears to be a relatively safer -- and saner -- zone than other places on the net (for the time being, at least). ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I&#39;d been wanting to leave but had a couple ties still here that i didnt wanna leave. The straw that broke the camel&#39;s back for me Was my grandma&#39;s death a week before Christmas. She was the best and her house was likr a sanctuary from the rest of the shit in my life. And she LOVED Christmas, like was the Christmas number 1 fan. I inherited my love of novelty from her i realized when the family began organizing her&#39;s and my late grandpa&#39;s stuff for prepping the house for sale. Literally 20 Christmas CDs of different types and 10 Christms vinyls. Im not sure why i started with that, but yeah i guess her family gatherings made Christmas special to me every year so this one felt very hollow.</p>

<p>The only consolation, which barely feels like one, is that i guess im getting a decent inheritance as well as the other grandchildren, which will allow me to move out sooner than projected</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment was bang on and you were not being dismissive in any way. This is a complex issue for most Christians to wrap their heads around, both for those who leave the faith as well as those who observe others leaving. There is always this assumption and fear that we will not tread carefully, and the moment we step away from the guidance of the bible, we will trip up. If anything, it is often out of a desire for a better understanding of God that certain decisions are made, with eyes open. I was always very very wary of &quot;that&quot; brand of spirituality, and still recognize that there are tons of gurus out there pushing empty wishy washy nonsense... but then, that is true of Christianity too. It is so easy to identify frauds on all sides, and even easier to assume that everyone besides yourself is some kind of slackjawed dimwit.</p>

<p>When I read religious interpretations that say things like that, it seems cool to me and like a hidden knowledge. I think that it wouldn&#39;t be truly bad for only elite to use it. </p>

<p>Other than that sorta thing I agree. I think religion had a good base for moral and people are pushing it away because &quot;science and its 2018&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I&#39;m still on the fence. Nothing wrong with emulating God as in trying to be like him. Saying you are is different though and feeling like you are so mighty you don&#39;t need him anymore would be more what I wouldn&#39;t want to do myself.</p>

<p>I think man can learn to live like God (or Jesus) and I think there is something to the hidden knowledge stuff. I&#39;m sure we do have powers if we are  indeed his children made in his image. I&#39;m sure TPTB know the secrets too and want us to laugh at it. I personally just try to be better and use tools given to me like meditation and stuff, but I&#39;m not trying to open the pinael gland or be Good or anything. That&#39;s a road I want to go down myself because there is likely unseen consequences of all that extra wisdom/power.</p>

As I was downvoted to negative 40 points, most people simply told me that Satanism is not what I think it is – it is not really devil worship. It is a movement against anti-intellectualism and religion. It promotes rationalism, thought, equality, and justice. These were their arguments.</p>

<p>sorry but this makes me laugh - can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised that an ideology of pure self-worship appeals to the Rational Skeptic Atheist crowd. These are the kind of people who talk from one side of their mouth about how enlightened and free from dogma they are, but become extremely uh, &quot;agitated&quot; if you suggest that the materialism, empiricism, and scientism which form the foundation of their worldview are themselves a kind of dogma.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think in good conscience that I can call myself a Christian - as I don&#39;t go to church or read the Bible (not very often and never the whole way through anyways) - but I can identify with a lot of what you&#39;re saying  </p>

<p>Reminds me of a quote from the Baha&#39;i Writings which, in my own view, sheds some light on the nature of &quot;evil&quot;, &quot;satan&quot;, &quot;hell&quot;, etc as being born of the individual who has rejected God. In this quote, God is speaking:</p>

<p><em>&quot;They say: ‘Where is Paradise, and where is Hell?’ Say: ‘The one is reunion with Me; the other thine own self, O thou who dost associate a partner with God and doubtest.’&quot;</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another great post. You are a modern heroine. I really think you should consider the ministry. </p>

<p>Chasing through your links, particularly the Ranker one, I think we need to hit the celebrity thing a little harder. </p>

<p>First off: Matt Skiba is now the new singer/guitarist for Blink182, replacing Tom DeLonge. Not unreasonable to think DeLonge is a satanist as well, which would fit in with him hanging around with Peter Levenda and John Podesta, and cast a shadow over all that so-called &quot;Alien Disclosure&quot; stuff. </p>

<p>Liberace being a satanist thing is interesting also. Unlike a couple others on the Ranker list, there&#39;s no link or citation for proof, though he fits the profile--ostentatious, lived in Vegas, gay. So then when Michael Douglas plays the guy in a movie, the connections ripple outward. </p>

<p>Anybody who digs into satanism can see that all that it is, is based on being what Christianity ISN&#39;T. They turn a cross upside down, but it&#39;s the cross that came first. Jesus talks about being the shepherd for sheep, but satanism makes it a goat (do you think the ESPN-driven &quot;G.O.A.T.&quot;--greatest of all time--acronym, via the Disney subsidiary, is subconsciously trying to elevate the goat to greatness?). </p>

<p>Most of all, though, are the key elements of prayer--Jesus instructs us to say the LORD&#39;s prayer, asking &quot;Thy will be done.&quot; The basic tenet of satanism is &quot;Do what thou wilt.&quot; All of of it comes back to &quot;Service to Others&quot; or &quot;Service to Self.&quot; </p>

<p>And this, in the end, is how contemporary American capitalist culture is pushing people unknowingly into satanism. It&#39;s a &quot;service to self&quot; culture, pushing materialism and possessions, win at all costs. A lot of screenwriter William Goldman&#39;s truism about Hollywood has snuck in too: &quot;It&#39;s not enough for me to succeed, everyone else must fail.&quot; </p>

<p>Hollywood is satanic, for sure, as can be seen in their awards show rituals, sexualization of children and transgressive content. More and more, I think it all ripples outward from there. </p>

<p>As for the world being upside down, well....that&#39;s even, almost the name of Marilyn Manson&#39;s most recent album, &quot;Heaven Upside Down.&quot; The leadoff track is called &quot;Revelation #12&quot;--in the Bible (capitalized, please!), Revelation 12 is about the war in heaven--and contains the lyrics &quot;We&#39;ll paint the town red/With the blood of the children.&quot; </p>

<p>And that may well be how they rule. The blood of children, fed to Moloch, via child abuse, rape and murder, abortion. It&#39;s certainly worked for them in the past. For a while. Then it goes south, thank God. </p>

<p>And thank you! I&#39;m just spitballing around some stuff here, not giving it nearly the deep thought you have. but I may have tossed a puzzle piece in the mix for you. Or not!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really not that surprising if you stop and think about it.  The christian Romans, in order to get the populace to embrace the new religion of the empire, basically just assimilated their current pagan holidays and tweaked them a little bit.   </p>

<p>Believe it or not, there&#39;s actually a passage in the Old Testament that mentions Christmas trees.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 10:2-5.</p>

<p>10:2 Thus says the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</p>

<p>10:3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</p>

<p>10:4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</p>

<p>10:5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.”</p>

<p>Yet pretty much all Christians do it.  We chop down trees or put up plastic trees and decorate them.  Why?  Because of the Roman Empire and what they did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think, the world is just as it is because it is how it is always going to be. You can&#39;t control free will. You can only control yourself. That is your free will. You can exert your will onto the world and by so doing bring about change. But you can&#39;t enforce change. The world is chaos. So long as free will remains it will forever be chaos. But chaos doesn&#39;t describe destruction. </p>

<p>PHYSICS definition of chaos
behavior so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions. It seems this best describes the state of the world. </p>

<p>I follow no religion, but I know god. I understand that all is potential. Ready to be developed. Waiting for it&#39;s moment of future use. There is no absolutes. It is all potential. You and I. Potential. </p>

<p>Do not deny those that do misdeeds for I see in them the same as I see in you. The potential. Show them the way to be righteous. Why call them out for their wickedness. When you can embrace the embodiment of your faith. And love thy enemy as you love thy self. Do not see them for the monsters. It is for god to judge. Is this not the case? </p>

<p>The twisitedness you see is a reflection of self. I see suffering and a plea for help. to be embraced by the light and not be shunned by it. To scorch them with tempest heats because we know not how to share the light but wield it as  a weapon. TO cast down our brothers and sisters. </p>

<p>Instead we should help them rise up, bathe in the light of love. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say it would be foolish to not think critically on all that you have bore witness too. Though some need the tool of the bible ot guide them to bring them to god. It is not necessary to know god. That all paths will lead to god. </p>

<p>Nothing is new as you say. What will be done will be done. What has been done will be done again. </p>

<p>It is not that we are gods. It is that we are apart of god.</p>

<p>We are the potential. We are the will of god. He knows we will find our way to him. He doesn&#39;t even consider it a battle for you know the story is already told. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never felt the need to truly pick up the bible or jump into any theology. My understands have come from many hours of thought. </p>

<p>My brain doesn&#39;t stop. It knows no end it is maddening. I don&#39;t claim to know every bodies truth. But I know mine, and I know god. I see the potential in all. The divine spark. It is the glue, it is what holds us together. Not just you and I. But the world, the universe. The great beyond. The heavens  and the hells. Nothing is separate. We are all bound by god. We aren&#39;t apart or ever alone. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any love for this world alone, so why would I want to be stuck on it for all eternity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. I&#39;ve given it a chance, but mostly I learn god with speaking to others. And pondering. I&#39;ve read parts of the bible, listen to many hours of theology lectures. But I have never read through and through. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry friend. I respect you all the same. I respect those that can believe in the divine. No matter the form they choose. Where they can place their trust most.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t for me to make judgement. I only see myself in others. I see that they are infact like me. They think, they feel, the hurt, they bleed. They have aspirations, supersitiations. THey have love, they have hate. THey have everything I have. We can only be the same. So I choose not to hurt myself, by hurting them. I want them to succeed, and by proxy I succeed. </p>

<p>I am but a tool for god. To understand and learn is my job. To understand his creation, to know my brothers and sisters. To understand that this time and all time is no time. That we are but reflections of the divine. That we are to help one other bring about their potential. To help mold the clay. To show them the way. </p>

<p>Until they can begin to mold themselves. Know that free will, will lead to god. No matter the path taken. The one true god. The most high. THe mighty of mighty. It matter not what you call him, it is not a him. It is what it is. Can&#39;t have form because his form is unimaginable. All is of god. All is god. Not individually no,  but in totality yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What problems? I know cruelity, I&#39;ve know the devil if you will. I know evil. What problems do I have with somehting that craves the divine. THat does not know how to love. But wants to all the same. Craves it so much that it would try to destroy the light. Because it can not have it. I see no problem I will give it what it wants. It wants the light. Then I will show it the divine, i will embrace evil open arms and know that my faith in the light will not falter. That evil must be shown love, and this alone will stop it. We do not condemn evil it isn&#39;t our place to condemn. We must show evil the path to righteousness. Not cast judgment yest you think you god.</p>

<p>Faith:
complete trust or confidence in someone or something.
strong belief in God or in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual apprehension rather than proof.</p>

<p>So how can my faith that I have cultivated with accumulation of not just one practice of religion but a multitude of many different works. My faith in which is born through my experiences. I ask you how is it this can be a misconception. Or do you use the wrong words?</p>

<p>Perhaps you have a misconception of the definition of faith.</p>

<p>And it is through this way can we  know the father. It isn&#39;t a means to worship him. Jesus doesn&#39;t want to be worshiped. At least from my understanding. </p>

<p>He is the way, the know jesus is to know yourself. I do not worship myself. But I empower myself, by allowing god work through me. </p>

<p>By allowing my divine spark to shine, can I come to know god. To acknowledge that Jesus is as much me as I am him. And don&#39;t twist my words I am not exclaiming I am jesus. just that I see no difference in him than I see in my self. that this is what he tries to teach.</p>

<p>The methods of this world don&#39;t show evil the way, they only allow it to fester, they don&#39;t show it the light. Do you understand why this is Satan&#39;s world. Because satan is in the hearts and minds of man. But he has convinced the world that he isn&#39;t there. That he was a lie. That there is no way that evil could reside in me. And this is how he has conquered men. Because they refuse to look within and recognize him.</p>

I don&#39;t know. I know that he was my hero. I know that I hated him for most of my life, and that it caused me so much pain. I know that I felt broken. Powerless. </p>

<p>That I never once been asked why I was so angry, why I was violent. Why I had such a disdain for authority. </p>

<p>WHy was I the way I am. People called me evil for being a drunk, people knew I had anger in me, but they just thought it was the booze. Now I&#39;m a felon for my actions, I accept that. </p>

<p>But am I evil for the things I&#39;ve done? Is my dad evil? I don&#39;t know.
Can I forgive. I think I have. Does he know it, no.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have that hate though. Not any more. It&#39;s gone, transmuted into passion and love and understanding. That I can&#39;t be the judge. </p>

<p>Thelmites are  pretty cool but get lumped in with satanists a lot. Mostly by Christians. it&#39;s funny that most religions, in practice break down,  when people use them to dominate others.  People in general have a really shitty definition of what love is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets start with your frame of mind and well take the whole post down piece by piece</p>

<p>My friend, who used to be a Christian, recently became a Satanist. &gt;She posted something about the Church of Satan on her Instagram, and in the comments, she ensured everybody it was not about worshipping Satan, really. It was something else and she would be willing to provide more information for those willing to ask.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only do I think my friend is being deceived, but I think thousands more are being deceived, too, because ultimately, the best way to keep a secret is to hide it in plain sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you enter this with a preconceived opinion already formed? You didn&#39;t once thin that your friend who looked in to the religion might know what she is talking about? No it seems like you just decide she couldn&#39;t possible be right about what she knows and that you are and that she must be being deceived. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Next you never once reference the satanic bible you reference articles. The book is 8 dollars and I&quot;m sure if you looked you could find it for free.

<p>Let me just ask you a question how would you like it if I wrote a whole post about how you are deceived by organized religion because I read a article about how you believe in zombies, talking snakes, wizards and men that live over 800 years. </p>

<p>You put some decent points of satanism out there then completely destroy what you said by following it up with &quot;I think my friend has been tricked cause she can&#39;t actually believe this&quot; You talk about your bias but this is to much. You need to expect that your friend might actually believe the things she has studied especially when you have failed to do the work to study the religion yourself. </p>

<p>Your welcome to believe in a invisible boggy man but when you start saying other people are deceived by your imaginary friend thats when you cross a line. </p>

<p>Sorry if I come off rude but I found your post kinda insulting. If you are interested in a doing non bias research here is a link to the Sb text you can read it for yourself and stop using other peoples opinions of whats it in for your base of knowledge. </p>

<p>If I was you I would take the post down and rewrite it as if the devil does exist then this is how it could be delving my friend. There is no accidental satanist. You have to read and understand what you are doing to be a satanist. Just because you have a vice and sin in a way a satanist would be ok with doesn&#39;t make you a accidental satanist. The closet thing they might be is agnostic. </p>

<p>Consider the satanic bible as a terms and conditions if you don&#39;t read and understand it you can&#39;t be one. Once you have read it your free to what ever believes make you happy though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think while this topic may hit hard with others, it won&#39;t with me. The ideas, yes are behind it, but I live my life as an atheist and a nihilist. I do what I can for others, but never hurts to indulge in myself a bit here and there. How can you give to others if you hate yourself? Some people take selfishness overboard, but those people need to be taken from power. Everyone who has a good mind and good heart should work together and spread awareness of the corruption to take down the corrupt.</p>

Why do you believe what you believe? What makes you so confident in this? While I can probally never fully except the white robed man in the sky and his only 2000 year old son who shares the story of so many others, there are reasons to believe what some of these folks believe. And that&#39;s concerning. &quot;Christianity&quot; as in worship of Jesus himself strikes me as off cuz its just too recent where we got religions like Babylonian Talmud, that are worshipping things that are 20,000 years old not 2000.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. My whole thing is you know &quot;jesus&quot; was just made up by a bunch of people that want to control you. Horus was also &quot;alleged son of god that died on the cross&quot;. So calling yourself &quot;Christian&quot; would give validy to the divinity of Christ, or that he was somehow one of a kind which I also find falicious. Christianity is worshipping the messenger, not the message. But yeah id love to see why you consider your self Christian. You were very thorough in this post. It jives for sure, I just can&#39;t get over the whole Jesus as literal son of the allmaker. Especially considering if that did happen it was only 2,000 years ago. Why if humans have been around 300,000 + years did he wait till just then. I&#39;ve said too much though, your turn. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of a mind to consider more likely that jesus was just a regular guy who, after traveling East for a large portion of his life, brought back eastern philosophy to his people and taught of divine/higher perspectives of the universe and consciousness, which in turn exposed the hierarchical authority power structure of the time, and made people realise that they don&#39;t need a middle man to realise divinity/the absolute and see that they are inherently one with it all. Then over the next few hundred years Rome had most of the original Christians killed and rewrote the story of jesus to once again fit their hierarchical power structure, until we were left with what we see as Roman catholicism today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct. Romans, who if nothing else knew how to rule &amp; control others, saw monotheism in general &amp; Christianity in particular, as a valuable tool to controlling large numbers of people. In a changing world where the old ways were no longer working, they moved on to other more advanced methods of &#39;crowd control&#39;.</p>

<p>They eventually wrested control of Christianity from actual spiritual practitioners/believers (Gnostic Christians especially, who would later be viciously wiped out by generations of &#39;Literallist&#39; Christians), did away with the more spiritual texts &amp; deeper lessons (Gospel of Thomas, Mary, &amp; others), editing out the parts that taught that one did not need a church or priest to have a <em>real</em> relationship with God, that God was literally <em>already inside &amp; a part of them</em>. These are some the beliefs of the Gnostic Christians &amp; it&#39;s a crime against humanity that these treacherous Roman bishops at the Council of Nicea committed this crime, to rob followers of Christ from the deeper lessons. Leaving instead just 4 gospels that told &#39;golden rule&#39; homilies &amp; stories about following the Laws, &amp; that if you do so, you&#39;ll be rewarded in the afterlife when all the suffering is done. Just be a good little human, follow the rules, memorize the beautiful prose &amp; lessons about how to be this, non-troublemaking rule-follower, and the rewards await you after you die. Thanks a lot Rome. Way to ruin what could have been a good thing.</p>

<p>Not so say Christians don&#39;t get value from believing in Christ, and feel him in their heart which can &amp; does make <em>some</em> them better people, but don&#39;t forget that followers of Islam get that same feeling from Allah &amp; the Prophets, and it&#39;s similar for followers of Judaism, Hunduism, whatever -ism you can think of, that has over centuries graduated from cults into religions (age of the belief-system &amp; numbers of followers being the usual threshold to cross).</p>

<p>So you are left with a situation where all these different people get the same basic religious experience, but have wildly different belief-systems, and these systems are fairly non-negotiable, no fudging allowed.. this leads a rational person to look at the one thing they all DO have in common, and that is that a human mind/consciousness is what is doing the &#39;believing&#39; (which is what leads to these experiences). So, inevitably it appears as if <em>human consciousness</em> is the common denominator here... Make of that what you will, but please don&#39;t fall into the indulgent trap of just assuming &quot;Well, <em>those</em> people are just being mislead by demons, fallen angels, jinn, satan, et al, so their religious experiences must not be legit.. Only MINE are legit&quot;, even though in their hearts, most people do fall into this trap. I know a lot of Muslims that believe this about Christians, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s vice-versa as well.   And so it goes ad nauseum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a follower of Christ, so as I let Him be the cornerstone of my life. What sources do you have to make such a claim? I care because I am basing my whole life on this faith.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;amp;v=HOD5sINobq8">Michael Heiser - Gnosticism and Early Christianity</a> is a good source to the current academic view on the things we know about the origins of the New Testament, and some of the Old. I would think if he was made up, his enemies would at some point in the first century make the &quot;..but, but, but he&#39;s made up!&quot;. Do we worship the messenger? No, we follow the way of Christ. Before the term christian was made, it was called &quot;The Way&quot;. As far as I know the myth that he went to the east is a UNSOURCED claim made by a Russian jew in 1887. 
These are the MYTHS that are part of the attack on Christianity by the satanic elite via pop culture things like the bullshit Zeitgeist and Dan Brown. As r/conspiracy user should know there is nothing the Elite hates more than Christ. check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDDGl79x4Pc&amp;amp;list=PLCED9C361662866BD&amp;amp;index=1">Know Your Enemy</a> series and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu5ThSF9jSc">the War on Truth</a>.

 The name Jesus used in the English New Testament comes from the Latin form of the Greek name Ἰησοῦς (Iēsous), a rendition of the Hebrew Yeshua (ישוע), related to the name Joshua. The name is thus related to the Hebrew verb root √yšʿ &quot;rescue, deliver&quot; and one of its noun forms, yešuaʿ &quot;deliverance&quot;. There have been various proposals as to how the literal etymological meaning of the name should be translated, including YHWH saves, (is) salvation,  a saving-cry, (is) a cry-for-saving, (is) a cry-for-help, (is) my help</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And i&#39;m saying you have fallen for Illuminati bullshit to deny their enemy Jesus Christ the Savior. this conspiracy is 300 years old. read Albert Pike( or as the bible teaches; almost as old as Man aka Adam. Satan is the father of all lies.). You are on a conspiracy forum, so I thought this was common knowledge. If you have any source of these theories I would be happy to read them. &quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction. &quot; Proverbs 1:7
I guess if I come across as judgmental, is because of how sorry I am for having spread slander and fake new age propaganda about the bible and Jesus myself for many years, before I was saved. I once was as blind as you, but now I see. My God is as Abraham said ; &quot;the God that answers&quot;. So pray to Him and ask Him to make Himself know to you, read the bible, and LISTEN and SEE for His answer. He IS the ONE TRUE GOD ALMIGHTY!  I recommend Luke if you like drama, Mark if you like it short. John 12:46  I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</p>

<p>47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every faith has their differences when describing God and it&#39;s counterpart, but I feel like Christianity is by far the most off.</p>

<p>God created all and is all. This not only means that he created &quot;Satan&quot;, but he also is him. God is not cruel, he is just and righteous. Both are parts of the same coin. There is no physical embodiment of Satan, not could there be, unless it were to be artificially created and wor shipped by man, which would be a malevolent super-AI that the cabal wrships as God. There is no reason to fear Satan or evil if one does not play into those atrocities themselves. There is no devil and there definitely isn&#39;t a hell. These are lies perpetrated by the church of olde, to encapsulate people in a slave/master mind set regarding God and man.</p>

<p>The religion that was built up around Jesus had, in reality, almost nothing to do with him. After his departing, men claimed to know what his message was, but heavily distorted it. Jesus came not to profess how awesome he was, but to profess how awesome we ALL are. He came to teach us that we can all be and do as he is and does. We are all equally-made children in the eyes of God. The only reason Jesus was/is the &quot;only&quot; person to be able to perform miracles was not because he was a unique son of God, but because he uniquely and solely revered and honored God in the proper way. THIS is why man is basically offspring of fallen angels. We are children who have lost our way and forgotten the Glory and Might of God. We have forgotten our true nature, divinity.</p>

Morally, you can practice anything, so long as you do not claim that it is a “better” way. Religiously, you can hold to anything, so long as you do not bring Jesus Christ into it. If a spiritual idea is eastern, it is granted critical immunity; if western, it is thoroughly criticized. Thus, a journalist can walk into a church and mock its carryings on, but he or she dare not do the same if the ceremony is from the eastern fold. Such is the mood at the end of the twentieth century.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s well documented that Lucifer predates Christianity, the lightbringer/son of the morning/dawn. A good character. The mythological figure was then co-opted by Christianity as a villian, undergoing a moral reversion to how it is viewed today.</p>

<p>Moral reversions used to squelch pagan worship were standard operating procedure.</p>

<p>No offense to anyone but everything in the OP is quantifiable fiction. That people identify with a fictional perversion and ideal is a perhaps the more interesting discussion.</p>

<p>Regarding attachment, the buddha was born bery wealthy, and but for his life’s material freedom would not have attained nirvana. </p>

<p>Regarding the temptor, does satan really rule this physical world? If so, why would he allow bibles? Or allow Christians to meet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think the original text uses satan in this verse, and neither does the king james version. Satan, of course, coming from the hebrew and meaning, simply, “adversery.”</p>

<p>But even if it did, that does nothing to refute that the only old testament being with sufficient power to rule this world is yahweh, the creator of this world. </p>

<p>Most fundamentalists i know claim that satan’s rule extends only to unbelievers. Which means that christs temptor would not have sufficient power to grant the temptations if his power extended only to the unbelievers. To be be credible, the temptor would have to be able to compel believers and unbelievers alike, as well as the angels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, most modern Christians have that same interpretation, but the words are not there in the text. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, are you saying the Christ would be susceptible to the same deceptions as we are? Assuming he would not be deceived as we are, in order for the temptations to be credible (and even if he were deceived, for the story to have meaning, the temptor must actually be able to deliver on his promises) he must actually have the power, and the only entity in the bible to have that power, outside of Christ, is yahweh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too long of a post OP but I skimmed through the bolded parts and your logic seems clear cut.</p>

<p>I just wanted to add that Satanism is quite simple and very real. It is defined by the ego. Understand that the ego is not bad (it takes a certain amount of esoteric understanding to recognize this component). The ego in many normal individuals is analogous to a survival instinct. For those who start to approach the deadly &quot;sins&quot;, their ego starts to take on more voracious behaviors. The &quot;deal&quot; people allude to is the deal with one&#39;s ego. That you will do whatever it takes to get what you want or what the ego wants. What you commonly hear in music is actually the spirit arguing with their ego. </p>

<p>For example, Lil Wayne&#39;s - Mirror. It is this mistake of believing their ego can satisfy what they truly crave (unity with God) that casts them into hell. Hell is a very real thing and it is something almost all &quot;satanic&quot; artists are going through right now. You see the glamour but you have not seen their pain. The laws of our world require that every high also has a low. The law of sacrifices is also very real. Every decision/action you take, means an action/decision you did not take. This often drives individuals with huge egos crazy. As their appetites are even more hungry and want to conquer everything and are faced with this impossible law that they can&#39;t break no matter what. The only &quot;entity&quot; that can break this action/decision is God. And not the biblical God either. It is the understanding of God and what things are, the Buddhists call it surrendering as well. To surrender to infinity and allow it to take you where you want to be in total faith. The trick... is not to challenge God and increase your awareness. Instead of seeking pleasure, learn to endure in pain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your thoughts on the ego. Many religions try to villainize the ego but it is just a tool. It can be used for good or bad.</p>

<p>In Buddhism one tries to get rid of the ego by meditating on the ego. In Christianity one lessens the ego through service to others and humility.</p>

<p>That pretty much condensed your entire post into a single sentence.</p>

<p>Among Satanists there are basically:</p>

<p>Atheism:  Don’t believe in God but may follow virtues or lead good lives.  Philosophy is here.</p>

<p>“The Left Hand Path”: which is the atheistic form of “Satanism” that preaches narcissism and self-advancement where deceit is totally Ok.  The “Church of Satan” is here.</p>

<p>Luciferian Satanism:  Actual esoteric worship of Satan or other mystical entities.  Gnosticism, Kabbalah, Satan worship by sacrifice etc. is here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read your reply, and commend you for being reasonable. </p>

<p>As a Christian, sometimes it is difficult not to take a &#39;hardline&#39; stance, since what we believe to be the truth is our reality - not a &#39;story we believe in&#39;, but as more me personally, &quot;The Bible is Truth and the literal Word of God&#39;. </p>

<p>But as Jesus showed us, is that all of the laws, ALL of the rules...are there as a framework for us to stop treating each other like such selfish pieces of shit. It&#39;s more of a &#39;fake it until you make it&#39; way of not being assholes to each other. And if you&#39;re being an asshole to someone because of what you believe in the Bible...well...good motivation, but, you&#39;re doin it wrong!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm ok. I guess I was thinking of Satanic Temple,  not sure the difference, but the tenets are far superior:</p>

<p>“THERE ARE SEVEN FUNDAMENTAL TENETS.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One should strive to act with compassion and empathy towards all creatures in accordance with reason.</p></li>
<li><p>The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.</p></li>
<li><p>The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo your own.</p></li>
<li><p>Beliefs should conform to our best scientific understanding of the world. We should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit our beliefs.</p></li>
<li><p>People are fallible. If we make a mistake, we should do our best to rectify it and resolve any harm that may have been caused.</p></li>
<li><p>Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>2 Timothy 3 (KJV)
3 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. </p>

<p>There is a man named Rick Renner, he lives in Russia and has been studying Greek for 30 years. He says the &quot;Last days&quot; actually started at the &quot;Day of Pentecost&quot; Which is why people have been saying we are living in the last days for the last 2000 years. And this is what he interprets this one passage to mean after going through all the different meanings of the greek words used and the way they were compounded together. It really gives a much better insight than any english bible translation ever could. Makes me wonder what else the bible says that we don&#39;t know about.....And mind you, this passage is only one areas of the N.T. talking about the last days. Jesus also talks about them being full of &quot;wars and rumors of wars&quot; Nature and animals dying ect... And that these are only the beginning of birth pains.....</p>

<p>Renner started giving this expounded version back in the 90&#39;s way before our obsession with violent video games and movies, social media, cell phones, the spread of &quot;anything goes&quot; crude and vulgar language and comedy like we have now today. (Sam Kinison is the first absolutely vulgar comic I know of from the early 90&#39;s) the massive spread of Pornography, the LGBTQI movement. ect...</p>

<p>One of the greek words actually translates into the &quot;I AM&quot; Generation or what we now call the &quot;ME&quot; generation. A term that was coined in the 70&#39;s was actually coined in the bible 2000 years ago</p>

<p>2 Timothy 3 Greek expounded</p>

<p>The Holy Spirits prophecy warning speaking through the Apostle Paul,</p>

<p>&quot;You emphatically must know what I am about to tell you! In the very part of the last days - at the very end of the age and at the very last of the last days, - periods of time will come that are hurtful, harmful, dangerous, unpredictable, uncomfortable, and high-risk. People will feel encumbered by it, like you are standing in the middle of it with prison bars around you and there is no way to escape it. Mankind at large will have misdirected love from godly love to being self-consumed, self-absorbed, self-focused and in love with themselves more than anyone else.</p>

<p>As a result of this self-love, they will hoard money for themselves while spending very little to help others. These boasters are so committed to their own self-promotion and agenda that they are willing to exaggerate, overstate the facts, stretch the truth, embellish a story, and even lie if it will get them the position, advantage, or goal they desire. They will be arrogant, haughty, impudent, snooty, and insolent. They will never be satisfied and will never have enough.</p>

<p>They disdain, mock, slander, and speak ill of anyone that stands in the way of their plans. Everything will be off the table, anything goes. They will think they have a right to everything and in this environment, parents will no longer be able to persuade, control, lead or exercise authority over their children. Although they were once thankful and appreciative, people will become void of gratitude and generally unappreciative of everything in the last time. As a result, impurity will seep into society and cause it to become unholy -- impure, ill-mannered, unclean, indecent, coarse, vulgar, offensive, crude, lewd and rude. Behaving and carrying on in a way that God would never sanction.</p>

<p>Love and commitment for family will degenerate; divorce will become epidemic with irreconcilable differences being the major cause for separation; and the court system will be overwhelmed as people go overboard in their suing others and in being sued. People will turn savage, vicious, uncivilized, violent, ferocious, and inhuman. A society where law is not primarily intended to protect the rights of good people but rather is used instead to protect and defend the rights of offenders. People will be preoccupied with and known for their obsession with violence.</p>

<p>People will be lovers of pleasures and creature comforts more than lovers of God. Romantic with themselves, kissing themselves, showing deep profound affection for themselves, have a deep profound love for philosophy and wisdom while wanting to do everything they can to remove Truth (God laws) from their minds. Their doctrine will be that pleasure, comforts and happiness is the highest good; addiction to and obsession for pleasure as a way of life.&quot;</p>

<p>Renner said some of the Greek words used in this one passage were so rare that they are not used anywhere else in the New Testament.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to break this into sections and it could use an editor but I, who have a completely different viewpoint than you do, agree with your main points. It&#39;s a very good post.<br/>
I went to church as a little kid and I never believed it was real. I was still kind of superstitious though and afraid that I could be wrong.<br/>
I was curious about the &quot;Satanic bible&quot; and I imagined it must be like the Christian bible but told from another point of view. When I finally read it I realized it was not that. The Church of Satan teaches philosophy, not religion. And I discovered that their philosophy made a lot of sense to me.<br/>
There are different types of Satanists, like you say, and some do really stupid and horrible things. Religion and the occult (and interest in conspiracy theory!) have some things in common. Now this isn&#39;t true of everyone that is attracted to these things but many have a potential for mental illness. Like let&#39;s say you think Queen Elizabeth is a shape-shifting reptilian. Now, you might think that because your neighbor&#39;s dog told you by barking in code, or you might think it&#39;s a funny idea until you start listening to David Icke six hours a day and come to believe it. Same with God talking to you. I mean, He used to tell people to do some pretty terrible things in the Bible, but that was okay. If God told you to sacrifice your son today though I really think you&#39;d have a hard time finding anyone to agree it was the truth.<br/>
And with the occult, some people have crazy beliefs or want to get back at their enemies or gain power. Short story is that some are attracted to the power of working with demons because they are mentally ill. Others have experiences that cause them to question their beliefs in a way that can be really disturbing so that, even if they were &quot;sane&quot; when they started, they can develop beliefs and behaviors that will cause them harm.<br/>
When people start talking about Satanists they usually don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about, and since there are different types of people who call themselves &quot;Satanist&quot; that is understandable.<br/>
But as far as looking at the tenets of the Church of Satan, a lot of people would be shocked to find that they agree with many of them.<br/>
And many of our leaders in government and religion may claim to be Christian when actually their statements, actions, and core beliefs are more in line with what the Church of Satan promotes. However I don&#39;t think that they are actually &quot;Satanists.&quot; They are just hypocrites and liars.<br/>
You&#39;re not exactly explaining what they believe. It&#39;s not &quot;nothing matters&quot; or &quot;anything goes.&quot; Hurting children and animals is out. Telling other people how to live is not okay. It&#39;s about doing what you want to do as long as you harm no one.<br/>
And since I believe that the &quot;God&quot; that made us has a direct source to us, I feel that this is a better way to live than by interpreting an ancient book or listening to another human being doing that for you.  But I also understand some people want this. The world is scary and when you realize that your parents don&#39;t have all the answers as you grow up, some people look to religion, political figures, and the police to make sense of things and take care of them.<br/>
That&#39;s how I see it anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you are right that many do not realize they are practicing Satanism.  Satan is the adversary. I think an issue is that the bible is not relatable to the every day person living un the US. The only shepards I have seen are the ones dressed up as one on Christmas eve children&#39;s mass. What&#39;s dangerous to society is that  Satan prevents cohesion.</p>

<p>However, Satan also does the work of the Lord. And Satan is a part of the one true God. God is the alpha and Omega. Satan, is forgiven. The remedy is forgiveness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are really two versions, according to Anton Lavay&#39;s son. One for the masses that is just for &quot;entertainment&quot; purposes. Where they say you don&#39;t have to believe in an evil entity or actually worship one. It focuses more on the hedonistic aspects. But behind the scenes, there are real satanists who not only worship an entity, but believe in one. Lavay&#39;s son said he also had more private rituals where the players were serious about the occult and believed in what they were doing. But the idea promoted to the masses was more about the entertainment value, and that was what the Hollywood type people were usually involved in. The other did involve actual sacrifices, blood drinking, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think the elite in a way worship Satan/Baphomet/Baal/Set. Much of this goes back to symbolism and its power on humans, they use symbols to get you to obey them. Let me explain this using Christianity since that seems to be your perception bias. I&#39;ll tell you my thoughts of Christianity.</p>

<p>I think Jesus was a man/prophet. But his life story was taken by the Roman elite and changed to be marketed to the masses as a Savior of humanity. His story shares many similarities with the Egyptian God Horus, the many avatars of Vishnu, and the many mythical heroes of various cultures. The Savior story has existed for a long time, because it appeals to everyone. Most fictional stories, for example (not saying Christianity is fiction btw, it could be true but to me anything is possible) involve a hero overcoming a struggle. </p>

<p>Also, all Christian religious holidays are based on pagan festivals that were twisted to include Jesus. The Bible doesn&#39;t mention the need to celebrate Christmas or Easter. There&#39;s a lot of verses where Jesus, who was supposedly executed by the Roman authority for inciting rebellion, tells people to obey the government. They also associated the ankh (the symbol of resurrection) with Christianity, so people associated it with power. Priests would tell people to follow the King or Queen the nobles had installed. Now priests tell many people how to vote. I have met people who claimed Obama was God&#39;s chosen President, same with people claiming that about Trump.</p>

<p>The elite are replacing religion with money though, because money is their true god so to speak. People are becoming less religious due to more easy access to information from all over the world. So the elite need another reason to control. So atheists themselves are also controlled in this way.</p>

<p>Attaching yourself to specific cultures is a form of control. The elites do not subscribe to a culture, some may follow some traditions from their birth place, some may mix various cultures in their lives, and others may just follow only themselves. As I said at the beginning, the elites use symbols to control. Culture is a collection of symbols, patterns, social norms (saying hi and goodbye and waving etc) and behaviors that form a mass belief among more than one person as a way to do things. The one percent of the one percent are those are are smart enough and rich enough to influence these cultural narratives, as well as convince people they know what they are doing.</p>

<p>The reality is nobody truly knows what is going on, we are all just a person stuck in the cave of our own perception.</p>

<p>Just some food or thought.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not atheist by the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;To me, selfishness is the equivalent of Satanism, or really, Satanism in disguise&quot;</p>

<p>So, your title, why you might be a satanist and not even know it, is equivalent to saying &quot;You might be selfish and not even know it&quot;</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t a conspiracy theory, that&#39;s blatantly obvious.
Of course if you define something like satanism as broadly as &quot;being selfish&quot;, some people are going to be satanists and not know it
Luckily no-one in their right mind would define satanism that way!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Satanism&quot; or Luciferian doctrine knowlege as i like to refer to it, because it is not a personafied being, is just something to atribute the energy harvested, it is a symbol a point of canalization of concentration for energy that is given out of free will (never can be forced, manipulators of reality must always respect the rules of free will), to be consumed and used.</p>

<p>Appeals to the Ego, the selfishness, the &quot;rational&quot; part of the human that is limited by the obvious reality, you could say that it is who we are, you can&#39;t get rid of who you are; your ego because it is who you are in here (believe me, i tried.), but you can identify it and in that;learn to control it to be sovereign of yourself master of your divine realm. It appeals to the duality games we experience in this realm of existence, because thats what they are, they are duality games and they laugh their ass off when they see us buy into that, playing and really spending our energy to further fuel this/their games, because if it really were there any real sense to fix this, it would be so instant that we could eliminate world hunger from one day to the other; our planet would be really a paradise, but the &quot;rational&quot; mind would think that it is opossible and yet again we fall to the duality games.</p>

<p>see the manipulation there? </p>

<p>and you would tell me (as they have told you) &quot;you are bias towards christianity.&quot;
then again i would say that is just another doctrine to give up your energy, another doctrine that focuses in your desperate need in this times for spiritual guidance, freedom and comprehension of the self of that voice without words we always feel in our head and sentiment in our body, by searching that guidance and (false) illumination in an outside &quot;force&quot;,</p>

<p>See the manipulations there?</p>

<p>And then you will tell me maybe I am a nut of the new age or buddhism, and maybe we are here to do a mission that for some reason we don&#39;t remember what it is, or pay a karmic debt that we don&#39;t remember to ever have commit, why cant we remember our past mistakes from other lives? if this is some kind of school why does the pupil isn&#39;t allowed to remember their past teachings and mistakes, wouldn&#39;t that help achive a higher evolution and spritiual development?</p>

<p>see the manipulations there? the deceit is so big so grand that our minds are not made (and in purpose) to comprehend the complete magnitude this embarks.</p>

<p>our best weapon? learn to trust yourself, listen to you, and learn that maybe you are right and your intuition isn&#39;t crazy, but never from a place of sobriety, egocentrism or any synonymous of that, that&#39;s just the ego pulling its weapons because it feels threatened and scared to lose its own self-identity, always do so from a place of Humility (this does not mean to lose your own dignity in any sense) and love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree entirely especially on your point of the affect on children, the steep decline in empathy the past 10 years. I would guess there is also a steep incline in childhood sexuality as well. I&#39;m 18 and I witnessed this first hand. Celebrities and tv shows encouraging the children that watch to be mean, narcissistic, nihilistic, and to display their sexuality.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s the &quot;cool&quot; character on the show? The one that&#39;s dressed the cutest. The one that has the snarkiest retorts. The one with the boy/girlfriend, or the crush they are obsessed with. </p>

<p>Who are the &quot;loser&quot; characters on the show? The ones that are very kind. The ones with the average looking clothes. The ones who are unaware of dating, or crushes, or the ones who are constantly rejected.</p>

<p>On Disney and Nickelodeon there are shows about young adults and adults, targeted at kids as young as 6 or 7. Young people look up to these narcissitic, indulgent, unkind characters and emulate them. </p>

<p>Victorious comes to mind when I think of the shows that mislead me. icarly, Hannah montana, Suite Life... I could analyze each one and elaborate. Look at the people,who produce these shows, look at the way children these days act. We have elementary kids acting like middle schoolers. Middle schoolers act like high schoolers. High schoolers act like college kids. By the time kids get to college they long for the childhood they missed out on. They regret growing up so fast.</p>

<p>But when this regret sets in do they figure out where it comes from? Do they right the misconceptions they had? Do they alter their spirituality to reflect beauty, kindness, and innocence? </p>

<p>Most of the time, no.</p>

<p>This must be righted, kids are having sex at younger and younger ages, something pedophiles would be in full support of.</p>

<p>Please monitor your children&#39;s TV and Internet habits. Please instill in them empathy, innocense, and other strong values. </p>

<p>The T.V won&#39;t do it for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the Quran, if you listen to a person who encourages you to do something God has forbidden, you are worshipping that person by obeying them instead of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allah&#39;s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal), for sure it is Fisq (a sin and disobedience of Allah). And certainly, the Shayatin (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) to dispute with you, and if you obey them [by making Al-Maytatah (a dead animal) legal by eating it], then you would indeed be Mushrikun (polytheists) [because they (devils and their friends) made lawful to you to eat that which Allah has made unlawful to eat and you obeyed them by considering it lawful to eat, and by doing so you worshipped them, and to worship others besides Allah is polytheism].&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://quran.com/6/121?translations=18">https://quran.com/6/121?translations=18</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, when Prophet Abraham, upon whom there is peace, tried to convince his father to worship God instead of stone idols, he did not say, &quot;O father, do not worship stone idols&quot;; instead, he said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&#39;O my father, do not worship Satan. Indeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful [God/Allah], disobedient.</p>

<p>&quot;O my father, indeed I fear that there will touch you a punishment from the Most Merciful so you would be to Satan a companion [in Hellfire].&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[His father] said, &#39;Have you no desire for my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you, so avoid me a prolonged time.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[Abraham] said, &#39;Peace will be upon you. I will ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me.</p>

<p>&quot;And I will leave you and those you invoke other than Allah and will invoke my Lord. I expect that I will not be in invocation to my Lord unhappy.&#39;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://quran.com/19/44-48">https://quran.com/19/44-48</a></p>

<p>Worshipping anything other than God, the single Creator of all creation, is to worship Satan, the deceiver who whispers evil suggestions to mankind from where we do not see him, although he sees us.</p>

<p>Before reverting to Islam, I was first an Atheist, and later an Agnostic for over a decade. I was a big Marilyn Manson fan, and I looked into Satanism because of him. He said in an interview that Satanism is about worshipping yourself, and that Satan is just used as a symbol for rebellion against the status quo. I started to incline toward this line of thinking. Thank God that God led me to Islam. I got far enough into researching Satanism and the beliefs of self-proclaimed Satanists to discover that many of these people <em>do</em> indeed acknowledge that God exists, and they have actually chosen to worship Satan instead, because they see him as a powerful being that &quot;freed&quot; human beings from the confines of God&#39;s laws/rules, allowing us to do whatever we want. </p>

<p>Satanism reminds me of Scientology, in that they appeal to your logic and reason before eventually revealing their actual beliefs. Scientologists recruit people by using an &quot;E-meter&quot; to &quot;audit&quot; them, making it appear that there is some sort of actual science or technology behind their ideas. Satanists sell you this idea that Satanism is just about worshipping yourself and doing whatever it takes to secure your own success and happiness. </p>

<p>Ultimately, however, both of these ideologies eventually lead to a great reveal: Scientologists believe that an extraterrestrial dictator named &quot;Xenu&quot;, who ruled a &quot;Galactic Confederacy&quot;, shipped billions of his members of his alien population to Earth and killed them, leaving behind their &quot;immortal souls&quot; which now cling to human beings. Satanists actually believe in Satan, and they believe that by sacrificing living beings in his name, he will give them what they desire in this world.</p>

<p>Both of these belief systems try to start you out with ideas that you will be drawn to, but as you progress/are initiated into different levels of these orders (much like in Freemasonry!), they begin to reveal their true beliefs.</p>

<p>As you said, u/polkadotgirl, it is indeed a deception, and those who have newly adopted this belief system do not yet know enough about it to discover what long-term practitioners truly believe and what activities they are actually engaged in. Whether a person is worshipping themself, Satan himself, multiple deities, or simply chasing material gain and worldly pleasures, ultimately, they have been deceived by Satan, and they are doing what pleases him, which, according to God Himself, is akin to worshipping Satan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this well thought out post, you’ve summarized some of the issues I’ve been thinking about for a while now. I was raised Southern Baptist, then spent time as an adult in a Unity church, then in a Unitarian Universalist church ( the congregation were generally either atheist or pagan). I have studied metaphysics, world religions and the occult throughout my adult life, so while I am nowhere near being an expert, I do have. some basic knowledge of the subject. The closest belief system to my own is Pantheism- I believe the Divine is in all things and most evident in nature. I believe that atheism and  satanism are a necessary reaction and  a balance to the hypocrisy and ignorance that often accompanies fundamental Christianity. However I also see in my personal experience with satanists, that it is what I consider to be a spiritually immature belief system because it does not promote selflessness and compassion. </p>

<p>I think that the idea that just because you don’t believe in an actual entity Satan, it doesn’t mean that the archetypal Satan does not have an effect, and lower emotional/spiritual energy. I agree that we are seeing a push in society toward narcissism and a lack of empathy.  I do feel concern too when I see this wave of transsexual children. I’m hesitant to use the word deviant in describing it because I understand people are born gay, that some people feel trapped by their gender, etc. However, how can we encourage small children to be transgender? Their brains haven’t developed yet, they have no understanding of sexual identity yet. Im probably expressing this very poorly, but the point is I agree with you - in looks like inversion to me.  </p>

<p>I’m glad you’ve given us this opportunity to discuss it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was really surprised to learn about how the Catholic Church and how evil it is, how it got its start.</p>

<p>After Nero persicuted christians, a new ruler came and decided to make Christianity the state religion bc he believed he God saved his life. He then took many organ rituals and turned them into this new Christianity (like statues of idol and painted Mary over them, ect) and introduced new things like the idea of purgatory, Sunday being god holy day (it&#39;s not it&#39;s Saturday), changing the lords super and the popes living in extreme wealth, fraudulently getting money ect. Later this became the Catholic Church with popes being treated like gods ect.
They then actually took the Bible and hid it from the people and gave there own teachings . Real christians again were persicuted and hunted and went into hiding. Many tried to standing up to the Catholic Church and they (called then martyrs) were burned at the stake and drowned ect.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church winded up being the largest killer of all killing Over 100 million christians and Jews (the Inquisition).</p>

<p>If Satan is behind a church, one of the main ones is the Vatican.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve unsubbed from r/conspiracy but still continue to read your articles for the insight and emphatic tact you show. If more Christians were like you, I&#39;d convert back. I&#39;m still open to Christianity being real in some anti-religious form, like God&#39;s gonna wipe away organized religion when he fixes stuff whenever. Even if that means wiping me out for the sake of better people... but yet how am I gonna know God&#39;s on the same page as humanity and isn&#39;t just some entity pretending to be God?</p>

<p>I&#39;m flat out going to say here, I&#39;m diagnosed with a personality disorder, I hate reading the Bible because it&#39;s a pain in the fucking ass to understand without seeing it through the pain of all the fundamentalism of organized religion I got put through my life, and selfishness and indulgence is... pretty much what I&#39;m stuck with because I don&#39;t know how to reach anything more than that.</p>

<p>All I can say is that if nothing truly matters, then that makes it even more important to have it matter anyways, because that&#39;s what there is for the time being, before it falls apart like everything else before it, from dust back to dust... what happens in between? Better things can happen.</p>

<p>I accept the existence of deities but they feel like more of a guaranteed cosmic horror story, but there may yet be some faint fraction of a percentage of there being a benevolent God, which seems like a frail and uncertain roll to make, but I accept people who can make that roll. I can&#39;t due to all the bad associations I have with Christianty after now leaving organized religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Christian, probably not a good one lol, I&#39;m more based on grace and more open minded. I do not like the attitude of churches and agree they drive away many. I think love is what the world needed and Jesus had a plan (what he taught, goodness). I believe more then that, but for people who don&#39;t believe in it all, they should at least see the wisdom in the teachings of Jesus (not the church today). </p>

<p>Some things that may interest you, on top of what you noticed. I&#39;ve seen theories on here that it&#39;s actually flipped and Satan is good and God is the bad one. Gnostic beliefs were parading by a LARP on 4chan (high level insider) that had lots looking into self enlightenment.</p>

<p>It was a long read and I skimmed a bit. But I think you are spot on in your observations. I don&#39;t think they are trying to make us Satanist. I think they just want to normalize it and make it okay that they are. That way people can say, nooo that&#39;s not what it is because they don&#39;t fully practice and higher ups who practice for real can do so under the guise that it is make believe. Plus Satan doesn&#39;t need us to believe in him, we just have to o act like him and he is happy.</p>

<p>I had wanted to write up a similar post based on things I have seen, but it seems posts get hit hard like this if it&#39;s religious. Put it out there anyway because it&#39;s important :)</p>

<p>The Satanic Temple is an atheistic organization. I should note that even though people mistake the Satanic Temple and the Church of Satan, BOTH are atheistic organizations, though the Church of Satan likes the ritualistic aspects of ceremonies, they do not actually believe in any deities. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What I find perplexing is the growing number of people who believe in some kind of spiritualism. Energy healing, crystals, &quot;raising their vibration,&quot; magic etc.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It&#39;s a new age religion. A religion without any personal responsibility or responsibility to others. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a very interesting observation. Personally, many of the people that I associate with (friends, co-workers, family members, etc.) study the specific spiritual interests that you mentioned, yet they absolutely and completely believe in &quot;personal responsibility&quot; and &quot;responsibility to others&quot; -- often more so than others who follow more &quot;traditional&quot; and/or organized religions.</p>

<p>In fact, it is actually nearly impossible (if not entirely impossible) to pursue any or all of those interests in a sincere and devoted manner without first learning and/or possessing a profound understanding of the concept of responsibility, and behaving accordingly.</p>

<p>For instance, with regard to &quot;energy healing&quot;, in order to be most effective, one must generally attain as &quot;pure&quot;, aware and connected a state as possible, and recognize (and deeply respect) the lifeforce, consciousness and &quot;sacred&quot; (for lack of a better term) nature of all those around them.</p>

<p>In addition, anyone who is a serious student of the subject of &quot;magic&quot; possesses an understanding of all of the issues surrounding the concepts of &quot;Do no harm&quot;, the &quot;Rule of Three&quot; and the like, and realizes that one must <em>always</em> be responsible for their thoughts and actions, lest they personally face the consequences -- or unintentionally cause negative repercussions for others. In truth, &quot;magic&quot; (in its truest form) is all about recognizing that everything is connected, in some manner, and realizing that one must be responsible for that which they create.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the key purpose in &quot;raising one&#39;s vibration&quot; is to attain a far more positive, open, responsible and loving state of being -- and to hopefully help others in the world to reach or transition to that state, as well.</p>

<p>I deeply respect your personal beliefs, and I truly don&#39;t mean to be rude or dismissive, in questioning your statements...but it honestly seems as though you might not actually understand the beliefs of those to whom you are referring (and the foundation of those beliefs), or afford them the same level of respect that they deserve.</p>

<p>(I also think that you might not be taking into account the fact that many of the people who currently follow different spiritual paths <em>have</em> extensively studied the Bible or other holy books, already, and simply didn&#39;t find truth, or the insights that they were seeking, there.</p>

<p>I, myself, was raised in a Christian household and community; in my youth, I even attended a parochial school where I had to read the King James Version of the bible, front-to-back, multiple times, and compose a number of essays and speeches about it. </p>

<p>However, shortly after that period in my life, I had a near-death experience that was completely different to -- and far more extraordinary and complex than -- anything that is described in any of the teachings of the Abrahamic religions, including Christianity. I later had a number of other &quot;spiritual&quot; encounters and incidents, as well, which, to me, confirmed the truth at the heart of my initial experience.</p>

<p>(To clarify: I would never insult or disparage a follower of Christianity for their beliefs; it&#39;s just that I, personally, cannot ascribe to that system of faith, on account of my experiences and studies.)</p>

<p>Long story short, I have now studied a multitude of subjects related to &quot;spiritualism&quot; -- including those that you mentioned -- and, as a direct result of the insights that I have received, along my journey, I have been a vegan for three decades, I spend much of my time volunteering for charitable organizations, and I actively try to be as responsible a person as possible.</p>

<p>More importantly, many of the people whom I volunteer with happen to share &quot;spiritual&quot; beliefs that are similar to mine and, as I had mentioned, also share this same strong belief in personal responsibility and responsibility to others.</p>

<p>I do hope that you&#39;ll forgive my lengthy comment, and I sincerely apologize if I didn&#39;t adequately explain things, but I just wanted to make an attempt to convey to you the fact that, in truth, people don&#39;t need to believe in a traditional &quot;God&quot; figure, per se, or believe in &quot;any of the teachings in the Bible or any other holy book&quot; in order  to believe in &quot;personal responsibility&quot; or &quot;responsibility to others&quot;...and that perhaps you&#39;re being a bit unfair and inaccurate in your overall assessment.</p>

<p>Moreover, a large part of the practice of &quot;responsibility to others&quot; involves recognizing the fact that <em>many</em> people have personal beliefs and experiences that may differ from yours, and trying to at least understand those differences. One can&#39;t truly be responsible to others if they are dismissive of others&#39; thoughts and beliefs, or view others as morally, ethically or &quot;spiritually&quot; inferior, as you appear to be doing.</p>

<p>In other words: It&#39;s all about mutual respect, and perhaps the world would be a much better place if everyone just put a little effort into really understanding what others believe, why they believe what they do, and how their personal experiences have shaped those beliefs. Perhaps, by doing this, we could all learn more about the true nature of our reality and existence, too. :) )</p>
