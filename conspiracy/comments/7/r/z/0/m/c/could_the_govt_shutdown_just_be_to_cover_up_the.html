       Submission statement:  now that the Democrats have shut down the government, that is the number one issue consuming all political news. If they had simply agreed to a deal the Nunes memo might be the number one story today, but instead it's been buried.

       Even Trump says the president should take responsibility for this type of shutdown. It's his job to make sure negotiations go smoothly. You can keep blaming Dems, but everyone (aside from Fox News viewers) know better. There were deals on the floor that Trump turned down. This is on him and the GOP.

       The Democrats did not shut down the government.  The GOP controls every branch of the federal government including the White House.  As the leaders of the country they should have been able to concede enough to the minority in order to come to an agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact there was a bipartisan bill that would have passed Congress, except Trump decided to squash it because it lacked funding for his border wall (which I thought he promised Mexico was going to pay for?)
      </p>
      <p>
       As a candidate who campaigned on his unparalleled ability to "make deals", why can't our commander-in-chief guide us to a compromise?

       46 Republicans are for the CAR and 5 Democrats which gets them a 51 vote majority. So technically were it not the Democrat refusal to vote to vote (60 vote requirement) the CR would currently pass. Therefore it's clearly the Democrats shooting down the government. Making the blame even more clear cut is the fact that Democrats don't actually disagree with anything in the CR but are simply using the shut down as leverage to get a deal on DACA.  It's Crystal clear which side shut down the government, the only taking point the Dems have in the face of what I just laid out is the irrelevant "Republicans control all three branches" argument which completely ignores the Senate filibuster rules

       Your down voted because people are refusing to hold their party accountable. Just like the media blames Trump for the publics distrust of them. Just like it's the Russians fault that Hillary lost. No one wants to hold themselves accountable these days.

       Trump gains nothing by releasing it. By putting it out there, he can negotiate with Dems who value integrity and their jobs. The info will be released to the public in 19 congressional days. Any stalling or shutdown grants more time to smear Trump and spew propaganda.

       If it is legit, it won't be the Democrat party burning down. More like Obama's DOJ/FBI. And you and everyone else know exactly why he won't declassify it. You and everyone else would be accusing him of obstruction. We'll find out in March if it's nothing. We'll also get the IG's report. Can't wait.

       How liberals perceive Trump hasn't remotely slowed him down before. But now he's worried about how he'll look? There's some other reason for him not releasing it. We'll just have to wait and see what that reason is. My guess, there's a ton of bullshit to the memo with no facts to back it up.

       I think your right in that he doesn't care what liberals think of him. Those cats are never getting on board. But I'd bet he cares what his base thinks. And why would he purposefully subject himself to that anyways, especially when others are already pursuing it? You wouldn't. We'll get the release and the IG's report soon.

       His base would absolutely lose their minds with glee if Trump released a report that showed democrats were caught up in something worse than Watergate. The collective orgasm from his base if Trump released the report that would lead to Clinton and Obama in shackles would be deafening. That's what it's been made out to be.

       I have to assume that the report isn't quite so cut and dry it they're taking their sweet time releasing it.

       I haven't heard any Representative make those claims. Gotta source for that? The stuff I've seen about the FISA 702 queries doesn't have direct ties to either Clinton or Obama. But there was abuse by the DOJ/FBI, that's already out there. I have no idea whether this memo is a big fat nothingburger or the real mccoy, but we'll get to find out soon enough.

       People involved in Watergate went to prison. Describing something as "worse than Watergate" is saying people will get prison time. And Hillary and Obama are the two right at the center of the accusations.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Our sources are telling us that the abuse of power is far bigger than Watergate," Hannity said on his TV show Thursday. "Remember, Watergate was a third-rate break-in. What we're talking about tonight is the systematic abuse of power, the weaponizing of those powerful tools of intelligence and the shredding of our Fourth Amendment constitutional rights."

       If this is true, many people are going to prison. This would be the biggest victory Trump or the GOP have ever seen. The fact that they're delaying this bombshell is fairly suspect.

       Say what you will, but ultimately, Republicans control the
       <em>
        agenda
       </em>
       and must compromise to end the shutdown.
      </p>
      <p>
       This looks bad on Democrats? Imagine having a majority everywhere and having nearly every agenda item fail. Except a tax cut.

       It was one guy, Nunes, who wrote the memo. What cause do you believe Republicans were trying to bully a Democrat into joining the on? No, no threat. Their releasing it. You are aware the Democrats held the majority in Congress from January '07- January '09, right? If it's just those shitty Republicans allowing the Patriot Act why didn't the Democrats do something? Did you know Obama was a supporter of the Patriot Act? He was. He even had his own, USA Freedom Act. He's a Democrat, right? Looks like this shit crosses aisles my friend.

        They have not proposed any legislation to stop the program or even limit it. In fact as we all know they have passed and Trump has signed legislation that expands the spying and data collecting.

       If the Nunes memo is as damaging as Nunes and his buddies claim it is, and the government shutdown is a conspiracy orchestrated by democrats could prevent its release, Trump could release the memo yesterday, or today, or any day, and no one would be able to stop it, and it would be entirely legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no, its not a cover for that, and this memo is likely overblown bullshit just like the last time Nunes uber'd over to the white house to cry wolf.

       I think Trump can afford to bide his time until Congress releases it, which will look better anyways than Trump releasing it to exonerate himself.

       It has nothing to do with "4d chess". I don't even believe he's that far into the strategy. With that being said, two things are fairly obvious:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) whenever Trump mentions something that he knows to be true but the proof is out there people always make an ass out of themselves lying about it
      </p>
      <p>
       2) it will look significantly better if it isn't Trump himself releasing the memo that exonerates him.

       It could be, to use the Republicans own language, a nothingburger.  To me, honestly, whether Obama spied on Trump is kind of a whatever anyway: Trump won, and no Collusion had been found. But, if it could be proven laws were broken, might as well come out with it. I'm just not sure how easy it will be too prove when everything's classified.  But,
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       it's as bad as they say and it is provable than I'd imagine the Dems are panicking being the scenes, possibly including the real reason for this shut down

       Because you don't play your hand on the biggest target of the investigation until the investigation is complete. The investigation is all encompassing and obstruction of justice will be only one of the aspects. You hold on to your cards so you can gather the most evidence possible, you dont show your hand so that your targets dont know what you have and you can catch them in falsehoods and then use that as leverage against them. You play your hand when you have the strongest hand you can have, to ensure the best case.
