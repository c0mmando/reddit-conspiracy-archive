<p>The Democrats did not shut down the government.  The GOP controls every branch of the federal government including the White House.  As the leaders of the country they should have been able to concede enough to the minority in order to come to an agreement.</p>

<p>In fact there was a bipartisan bill that would have passed Congress, except Trump decided to squash it because it lacked funding for his border wall (which I thought he promised Mexico was going to pay for?)</p>

<p>As a candidate who campaigned on his unparalleled ability to &quot;make deals&quot;, why can&#39;t our commander-in-chief guide us to a compromise?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>46 Republicans are for the CAR and 5 Democrats which gets them a 51 vote majority. So technically were it not the Democrat refusal to vote to vote (60 vote requirement) the CR would currently pass. Therefore it&#39;s clearly the Democrats shooting down the government. Making the blame even more clear cut is the fact that Democrats don&#39;t actually disagree with anything in the CR but are simply using the shut down as leverage to get a deal on DACA.  It&#39;s Crystal clear which side shut down the government, the only taking point the Dems have in the face of what I just laid out is the irrelevant &quot;Republicans control all three branches&quot; argument which completely ignores the Senate filibuster rules</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t heard any Representative make those claims. Gotta source for that? The stuff I&#39;ve seen about the FISA 702 queries doesn&#39;t have direct ties to either Clinton or Obama.

</blockquote>

<p>Because you don&#39;t play your hand on the biggest target of the investigation until the investigation is complete. The investigation is all encompassing and obstruction of justice will be only one of the aspects. You hold on to your cards so you can gather the most evidence possible, you dont show your hand so that your targets dont know what you have and you can catch them in falsehoods and then use that as leverage against them. You play your hand when you have the strongest hand you can have, to ensure the best case.</p>
