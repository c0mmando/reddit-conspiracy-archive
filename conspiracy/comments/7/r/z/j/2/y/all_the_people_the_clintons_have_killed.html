        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Clinton Body Count: 
1. James McDougal — Clinton’s convicted Whitewater partner died of an apparent heart attack, while in solitary confinement. He was a key witness in Ken Starr’s investigation. 
2. Mary Mohane — former White House intern gunned down in a coffee shop. Nothing was taken. It was suspected that she was about to testify about sexual harassment at the White House. 
3. Vincent Foster — former White House Counsel, found dead of a gunshot wound to the head and ruled a suicide. He had significant knowledge of the Clintons’ financial affairs and was a business partner with Hillary. If the Clintons are guilty of the crimes they are accused of by Larry, Vincent Foster would have detailed knowledge of those crimes. 
4. C. Victor Raiser, II – former National Finance Co-Chairman of Clinton for President, and Montgomery Raiser, his son. Both died in a suspicious private plane crash in Alaska. No cause determined. Raiser was considered to be a major player on the Clinton team. 
5. Paul Tully — DNC Political Director, was found dead in a Little Rock hotel room. No cause was ever determined and no autopsy was allowed. Tully was a key member of the damage control squad and came up with some of the Clinton strategies. 
6. Ed Willey — Clinton fund raiser. Found in the woods in Virginia with a gunshot wound to the head. Ruled a suicide. 
7. Hershell Friday — Clinton fund-raiser. His plane exploded. 
8. Jerry Parks — former security team member for Governor Clinton. Prior to his death he had compiled an extensive file on Clinton’s activities. His family had reported being followed and his home broken into just before being gunned down at a deserted intersection.
 9. John Wilson — former Washington D.C. council member. Had ties to Whitewater. Died of a very suspicious hanging suicide. 
10. Kathy Ferguson — former wife of Arkansas State Trooper Danny Ferguson, the co-defendant with Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Found dead in her living room of a gunshot wound to the head. Ruled a suicide. Interestingly, her packed suitcases seemed to indicate she was about to go somewhere. 
11. Bill Shelton — Arkansas state trooper and fiance of Kathy Ferguson. Allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself at her grave. 
12. Gandy Baugh — attorney for Dan Lasater in a financial misconduct case. Supposedly jumped out the window of a tall building to commit suicide. 
13. Dr. Donald Rogers — dentist. Killed in a suspicious plane crash on his way to an interview with reporter Ambrose Evans-Pritchard to reveal information about Clinton. 
14. Stanley Huggins — lawyer investigating Madison Guaranty. Suicide. His extensive report has never been released. 
15. Florence Martin — Accountant for the CIA and had information on the Barry Seal case. Three gunshot wounds to the head.
 16. Suzane Coleman — reportedly had an affair with Clinton. Was seven months pregnant at the time she was found dead of a gun shot wound to the back of the head, ruled suicide. 
17. Paula Grober — Clinton’s interpreter for the deaf. Traveled with Clinton from 1978 until her death in 1992 in a one-car accident. There were no witnesses. 
18. Paul Wilcher — attorney investigating corruption. He had investigated federal elections, drug and gun smuggling through Mena, the Waco incident, and had just delivered a lengthy report to Janet Reno. He died in his home of unknown causes. 
19. Jon Parnell Walker — RTC investigator who mysteriously fell to his death from an apartment balcony. 
20. Ron Brown — former DNS Chairman, Commerce Secretary. Reported to have died in a plane crash, but new evidence reveals he may have been shot in the head. He was being investigated by a special investigator and was about to be indicted with 54 others. He spoke publicly of his willingness to “make a deal” with the prosecutors to save himself a few days before the fatal trip. He was not supposed to be on the flight but was asked to go at the last minute. (This count does not include the other business leaders and other passengers who died on this government-sponsored trade mission.) 
21. Barbara Wise — Commerce Department secretary. Worked with Ron Brown and John Huang and had extensive knowledge of their activities. Found dead in her locked office the day after Thanksgiving. It was ruled a suicide. Interestingly, she was found partially clothed, bruised, and in a pool of blood. 
22. Charles Meissner — Assistant Secretary of Commerce. John Huang was given a special security clearance by Meissner. Shortly thereafter, he died in the crash of a small plane. 
23. 22 &amp; 23. Kevin Ives and Don Henry — seventeen-year-old boys who apparently saw something related to drugs in Mena by accident late at night. Officially ruled an accidental death on the train tracks, but evidence shows they died before being placed on the tracks — one of a crushed skull and the other of a knife wound in the back. 
24. Keith Koney — had information on the Ives and Henry deaths. Died in a motorcycle accident with reports of a high-speed car chased involved. 
25. Keith McKaskle — had information on the Ives and Henry deaths. Stabbed to death. 
26. Gregory Collins — had information on the Ives and Henry deaths. Gunshot wound to the head. 
27. Jeff Rhodes — had information on the Ives and Henry and McKaskle deaths. Tortured, mutilated, shot, body burned in a dumpster. 
28. James Milam — had information on the Ives and Henry deaths. He was decapitated. The coroner ruled death due to natural causes. 
29. Jordan Kettleson — had information on the Ives and Henry deaths. Found shot in the front seat of his pick up truck. 
30. Dr. Stanley Heard — Chair, National Chiropractic Health Care Advisory Committee. He personally treated Clinton’s mother, stepfather, and brother. His personal small plane developed problems so he rented another. Fire broke out in flight and he crashed. 
31. Steve Dickson — attorney for Heard. Died in same plane crash. 
32. John Hillier — video journalist and investigator. He helped to produce the documentaries “Circle of Power,” and “The Clinton Chronicles.” He mysteriously died in a dentist’s chair for no apparent reason.

    <div class="md"><p>I was multi tasking an just hit send. So to expand a little more on my original comment, I think if we had someone to compare these numbers with it could/would give us more ammo when debate those who cannot fathom this actually being true. Statistics was not my strongest subject, but if numbers are true then what are the statistics on this. How many non soldier, non gang member, politician lawyers can say they have that many people closely connected with them die in those ways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re assuming that everyone on this list died exactly as described, that the Clintons had a motive for all of them, and that all of these people had &quot;intimate&quot; connections to the Clintons.

    <div class="md"><p>Your assumptions. My original comment is a statistical based one. Asking if there are any other lawyer/politicians that have had this many people who have worked for them die in these circumstances. According to <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/how-many-planes-crash-every-year-how-many-people-die-plane-crashes-chart-1560554">this</a> page in 2013 462 people died in 138 plane crashes around the world. I wonder what the statistics of those working for politicians are. I wonder how many other secret service agents, and others have committed suicide while working for other politicians. You assumed I have never read anything about the clintons an their suspected crimes. You assume that my mother cared enough about me to even notice I was in the room. You assume I do not have any intimate knowledge of the clintons and the shit they did while slick willy was in office. Now what I am going to have to do is guess that you assume everything the msm says to be 100% truth, an since they say there is nothing to see here, you assume that is true. That is why you made your assumptions and topped it off with an attempt at an insult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, looks like op just discovered the clinton body count (which is a good thing and everyone should know about these suspicious things), but there&#39;s so much more to all these events/stories. Op just copypastad a list from online. But it can&#39;t be discounted as just coincidence as your comment semi-suggests. A lot of these cases are not just suspicious, but absolutely should be formally investigated (but we all know how those investigations end). Vince foster and the kevin ives case are the most intriguing. And the body count is still growing. Seth rich being the latest (I think, it&#39;s hard to keep up) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t researched into all of them.  The Vince foster case was obviously corrupt and any attempts to dig into inconsistencies were shut down.  Suzanne Coleman was a good example of the suicided in this list and exactly the kind of thing I&#39;m talking about. There were a LOT of inconsistencies in so many of these cases and this is what I&#39;m getting at.  I guess my choice of words wasn&#39;t that great.  But I can&#39;t help but think that if these murders happened to everyday people, there would be open investigations still going or probably solved and justice served.  Instead, these shady situations like in colemans case (a pregnant woman shot in the back of the head) are ruled a suicide and shut down.  Have you read up on any of these cases? The amount of inconsistencies and misinformation is incredible. The investigations were definitely not carried out in a normal fashion.  The kevin ives and vince foster cases were a complete failure of our judicial system and law enforcement </p>

<p>What inconsistencies - Specifically - exist with her case? </p>

<p>What autopsy report or police report have you seen that determined it to be a suicide by gunshot to the back of the head? </p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t read it on an autopsy or police report, then where did you read it? A biased website? An unsourced gish-gallup list like this one? </p>

<p>Where did you read that she was pregnant? Where&#39;s that source? Interviews with her family? Autopsy / police report?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ll say again, if you really are interested in the inconsistencies in a lot of these deaths then do your own research on this stuff and read up on it (not just coleman) and you will be suspicious of the official narrative.

But if You’re making claims (i.e. “they” claim Coleman shot herself in the back of the head while pregnant,” and I look that up and can’t find anything that supports your claim, it’s reasonable for me to ask where you got your information from in case I missed something.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I Was referring to the Coleman claims there, because I didn’t wanna spread us too thin - having a conversation about one case’s easier than having a conversation about 3. You earlier addressed a concern I was gonna drown you in questions, and I felt like it’d be less likely to drown you in questions if I asked you about one case. </p>

<p>I’ve read into Kevin Ives and Foster, both of them, several times in the past. I can’t tell you if I’ve exhausted all the same sources You have, because I don’t know what you’ve looked at as opposed to what I have. I’m not 100% convinced they’re corrupt, but that doesn’t mean I can’t come to realize they are.</p>

<p>That’s kinda what I was getting at with the Coleman thing, if you don’t mind zooming in on that. You said above that you’re just talking about general inconsistencies, but you mentioned very specific details - I’m just asking what your source for those details are as an example. Have you changed your mind to prefer a wider scope of questions talking about multiple investigations, or do you wanna zoom in on one for the sake of easy communication?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know that it&#39;s okay to say you don&#39;t have backing for the Back of head suicide claim, right? I&#39;m not keeping score, not taking notes. Just trying to learn. If you show me an autopsy or police report claiming that she back of head gunshot suicided, I would agree with you whole-heartedly that that&#39;s bullshit and needs to be investigated. All I&#39;m getting at is, if you make that assertion that it&#39;s true based on 0 evidence, it doesn&#39;t give me a lot of reason to trust other assertions you make, because for all I know, you may have no backing for those either. </p>

<p>Also, if I&#39;m going by your standard, I could tell you that every single account on this sub except for you and me are fakes submitting fake articles just to distract and confuse us. When you ask what I have to prove that, would you roll your eyes if I told you to do the research yourself? Yes, you would, because you shouldn&#39;t make absolute statements (that the official story on Suzanne Coleman is a back-of-head-gunshot-suicide) unless you have proof. What police report makes that claim? What autopsy makes that claim? And if you have no proof, why did you just state it as if it was an absolute statement?</p>
