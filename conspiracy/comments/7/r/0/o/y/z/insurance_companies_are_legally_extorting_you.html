       Very few actually.

      <p>
       Auto Insurance - make sense if one is driving on public roads, they owe a duty of care to others.  Also having the liability insurance be required by law it actually saves the State Money.  Otherwise who would pay for those expenses?  Hospitals can not turn some one away, better to have that expense on the consumer than the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       And anything where one owes money on or using as collateral...those doing the lending have the right to require insurance.

       This is the answer.  Understand what you are buying.  Hang them if they refuse to pay.  But above all else, understand what you are buying.

       Happens ALL the time, which is why my patient advocacy business is still in existence for the past 12 years. It's sad, but true, patients (the common American) is very ill informed of their policy and what it allows and disallows.

       It does not happen often at all.

      <p>
       On average 66-70% of every dollar collected in premiums is spent on claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claims are more often declined because they weren't covered in the first place.  People don't read the legal contracts they signed.

       Cosign!!!!! I sell insurance for a living.  you'd be amazed at the number of people who call and try and get some insurance AFTER they been diagnosed with something...and the entitlement of these assholes when you tell them you have to buy a shitty obamacare plan, because they feel like somebody else should pay for their problems....

       no difference between mandated insurance and two mob hitmen telling you that it would be a shame if your nice business burnt down, for a few hundred a month Jimmy Baggadonits and Fredo Canoli will make sure you stay in business.  Cops are collection agents for the banking-insurance complex   At least mob collection giys keep 30% of the take, these fuckin idiot cops do it for 13 bucks an hour.

       So you decide you don't want car insurance, get drunk as a skunk, and plow into my parked car in what is obviously your fault. It becomes my and my insurence company's responsibility to pay for the damages? Am i now supposed to sue you for the damages and possible increase to my insurance? What if you don't have the money? Can I bleed a stone dry?
      </p>
      <p>
       You think you are fit as a fiddle so no health insurance for you. You get really sick and stack up more medical bills than you can afford, it now becomes the responsibility of the medical facility and everyone else to pay your bills?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds a bit like you are the one trying to extort others into paying your bills...

       I guess it depends on the level of inebriation and damage to their vehicle. A few years ago, a drunk skunk plowed through my cousins' fence and into their back porch. That skunk wasn't going anywhere.

       Nah, I went three years in my owned home without homeowners, we couldn't come to agreement on replacement cost and insurance value so I told them to cram it. The only reason I re-insured it is because it's rented now.

       Maybe in other countries, but in this country, if you don’t carry insurance for certain things, you’re fucked.  Can’t drive with out it for one. Certain doctors will hit unover the head of u don’t have it.  Some loan companies make u carry it to buy a house me.  Like I said.  Necessary evil.

       I never tried to argue the medical and pharamceutical industry weren't overcharging what I am going guess you mean Americans. Thing is though, citizens in most other developed nations are required to have health insurance at the same time the med/pharma industries charge lower prices because even with lower prices shit happens and there are times when a person couldnt be able to pay for treatment that no hospital/doctor is going to not perform because they can't pay. Those things need to be paid for in the end, though and in situations where people who opt out of insurance can't pay the cost gets moved to others and my argument was that's not fair.

       FYI In many cases you can self insure, so long as you have proof of sufficient funds to cover expenses incase something happens. Self insurance is a thing - many municipalities self insure their fleets, etc. That's where the whole freemen on the land self insuring thing comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is, most people do not have the funds to self insure.
      </p>
      <p>
       So really what is going on with insurance is you are paying a monthly fee to have access to that bankroll to pay out in case something happens. If you have something like $2M full coverage car insurance, and you are paying $150 a month for your premiums, you are paying a 0.1% of the total $2M yearly in order to have potential access to those funds. It would be fair if you have a 1/1000 chance per year of having something happen to you that required a claim for that full amount - but the odds are much lower. The great thing for the insurance companies is they don't actually have that money to start with - they get it from all the other users who are also paying premiums. It's collectivized income for them, but the profits are privatized, like some deranged mutant child of socialism and capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The racket is in the profits and the risk calculations. If they though you had a 1/1000 chance every year to get into an accident or have some sort of claim for $2M, your monthly premiums would be in the $1000's.

       I was seriously injured in a car accident (drunk driver) ten years ago. My medical expenses were huge; a lot of my larger bones were broken and my neck badly herniated. 5-6 years after the incident, the insurance company representing me at the time sends me a bill for every cent they had paid out on my behalf.
       <strong>
        Uhh what.
       </strong>
       Here I am thinking the obscene amount I already sent them in monthly payments would cover this type of thing. Luckily I had an incredible attorney who was able to prove this was criminal and I didn't have to pay anything back. My attorney is still entwined in a civil lawsuit against them on behalf of the tens-of-thousands of people who they already extorted/are still extorting.

       Blue Cross Blue Shield; but through some specific operation based out of Texas. Through investigation, my attorney learned there are super backwards loopholes for insurance companies allowed in Texas and not in most other states....which is probably why they chose to operate out of there in the first place. Sketchy all around.

       Sounds like health insurance. They prolly got a settlement that included the full cost of any medical related issues dealing with the accident, therefore, blue cross wanted what they paid out back. Not agreeing that it’s right, just telling you from experience what it probably was.

       It's definitely what it was. BCBS, although his health insurance, was NOT responsible for the medical bills. The Auto insurance company was and therefore, they would have been responsible to pay the bills. If they didn't pay the providers directly, but included it in the settlement, then the patient then needs to pay the medical bills out of the settlement. The patient doesn't pay BCBS back, BCBC takes the money back from the providers and the provider is then left to get the money from the patient.

       I wish I knew exactly what my attorney dug up...there were a lot of more layers to my case which are unfortunately escaping me ten years later. It was also hard for me to follow along closely at the time as healing/feeling better was top priority. If I recall, we were almost to the point of filing harassment charges against them due to the extent they were contacting me for payment, while simultaneously ignoring every phone call/letter/email from my representation. It was really crazy stuff and those people are criminals through and through. Even before this, they double-billed me for almost every procedure claiming 'clerical error.' Once or twice maybe, but 20+ times is purposeful. When you are sick or injured, you are more vulnerable....and these are the people they are attacking.

       Odd...usually that happens if you were the Drunk Driver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Locally if a drunk driver is responsible for the accident then by law even though they have broken the contract they still get the legal minimum for absolute Liability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here the Minimum is $200,000.  If the drunks insurance company pays out anything for the loss they can and will invoice/sue their client for what is owed to them.

       It was really odd and illogical. Which is why most states don't have the same loopholes allowing it to happen I think.

       Obama care was intended as a tax on the lower middle class, people like me that cant afford insurance get fined when taxes came around...i said it the day i first read about it in the paper. My opinion never changed.

       to put it in perspective, in many ways, insurance forces you to bet against yourself.

       You make it sound as if you get nothing in return.  Pick any policy and tell me you'd rather pay out of pocket for the potential life-altering claim that someone can make against you. Insurance is a 300+-year-old industry for a good reason.  Pay a little now to save your ass from a financial sling.  Think of it another way;  Insurance is the original peer-to-peer solution that helps you rebuild if your house burns down from wildfires saving entire neighborhoods from blight and societal deterioration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extorsion is what people say about insurance who have never experienced a devastating claim.

       Don't use the age of industry as a gauge of its utility or rightfulness.  Slavery and gambling have been around a hell of a lot longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, buying insurance without understanding what you are doing is gambling with becoming a debt slave.  We all gamble with becoming a debt slave every day of our life, and the purpose of insurance is to minimize this risk.  But you should know what you are buying, or else you have no idea whether you have succeeded in minimizing this risk.

       So your saying people are too stupid to not understand what they are buying?  Not sure I agree with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why you think paying premiums is being 'debt slave' I don't understand. I play the stock market but would never think of it as me being a slave to the market. Insurance is similar in that you are hedging your investment against a catastrophic, life-altering events.  Sometimes you loose (no claims) but sometimes you come out smelling like roses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, think its a conspiracy all you want. Insurance exists for a reason. Enough said.

       No, "debt slave" is what you will be if you live life without insurance and end up needing to cover the costs of a catastrophe out-of-pocket.

       You do not understand how the Insurance Industry works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not extortion.  You are not required to get insurance to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to drive a car on Public Land - the state has the right to require you to carry Liability.  It helps prevent the state from having to pick up the costs if and when one has an accident.  Driving is a Privilege not a Right.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are required to have property insurance either, you are free to do without it.  The Bank has the right to say you need to have insurance if you borrow money from them as they have invested interest in your property and benefit the longer you own it and pay back your mortgage.  After the mortgage is paid off...one is free not to carry insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like you had a bad Claim Experience.  That is usually why most people hate insurance because a claim was either declined or was not settled the way the had wanted.
