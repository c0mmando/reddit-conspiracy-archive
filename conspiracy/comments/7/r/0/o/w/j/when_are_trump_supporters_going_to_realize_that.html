       At this stage, the only way to support Trump is to fool yourself into believing 4chan LARP stories about how he's
       <em>
        this close
       </em>
       to shutting down the Clinton Cartel™
      </p>
      <p>
       That or their hatred of the left, feminism and social justice warriors is so consuming that they are willing to ignore the fact that he is a conman and support him out of spite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q posts a bunch of vague crap that never comes true; making it obvious that he is just some bored anonymous 4chan user that is playing on the fantasies of Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       He makes weapon deals with the Saudis. He refused to release his tax returns. He launched missile attacks in Syria. His administration wages a war on marijuana legalization. He supported Jerusalem being named as the capital of Israel. Bill, Podesta and Hilary are all doing just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this while he plays golf and surrounds himself with the same bankers and globalists that he promised to take on.

       Yeah exactly. His approval is at 38% and likely won't dip lower.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question now is not "why are these people supporting him?" But "where did we fuck up so bad that a third of our 360 million person population is so fucked in the head they can honestly back Trump".
      </p>
      <p>
       How. How can they look at what he's done and support him? See him selling national parks, opening our shores to oil exploitation. Watching how he acts in the complete OPPOSTIE way of a president who wants to keep us globally safe. The man makes us a mockery. It's just a fact. He is the absolute worst of us personified.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the people who support him are also the worst of us. How the fuck did we allow the bad parts of our culture to become so rampant and so ingrained? I find myself lately wondering how the reasonable logical people felt in Germany crica 1933. As Hitler was cementing power, did they also feel the same as us? Did the rest of the Germans try to shout them down in the same way? Was there a mass turning away from logical and critical thought?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could talk to them.

       The world was headed a certain way before Trump (globalism) and now, for the time being, it’s not. The economy is fine and didn’t come burning down like the left said it would.  The Establishment is publicly getting some much earned shit flung at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you people continue to just piss and moan. You repeat the same old shit over and over and you never seem to tie anything together as to how, exactly, Trumps actual presidency is deserving of this level of unbridled hysteria.

       no son, its pure fucking fact.  YOUR piss diaper media overused the term RACIST to where it has no meaning except to those attuned to piss diaper media dogwhistles.  Also, Haiti is a shithole, Carnival Cruise Lines doesnt have Port Au Prince as a destination and people openly shit on the beach and streets, that, my lumpy headed friend is the very LITERAL definition of shithole.

       did you skip over the part about open defacation in the streets and the beaches? that defines shithole.   Haiti is a shithole.  when was the last time you saw a commercial to visit sunny and pungent Haiti for vacation? you havent, because shitholes dont attract tourists.

       So you agree that Haitians coming to the USA on unpowered rafts hoping the good fortune of ocean currents washes them up on a Florida beach arent escaping a SHITHOLE, they are just coming for a better life? If Haiti isnt a SHITHOLE, why would they risk their lives to get to Florida?  You argue from emotion with a distinct lack of facts to back your play.

       fuck your repost, you should use your words, since you are so feverish and adamant about your belief that Haiti isnt a SHITHOLE.  You cant adequately express your concrete beliefs how or why Haiti isnt a SHITHOLE, and whats more you parrot buzzwords like "RACIST" when facts are presented.  For the best interests of this nation, I hope you use birthcontrol.

       Once again you use a meaningless and trite term that has ZERO fucking meaning except to those enamored by the talking heads of mainstream media. Haiti is a SHITHOLE. Haitians act like SHITHOLERS.  Africa is a SHITHOLE. Get a grip, son, you are acting like a ninny.

       Identity politics in a nutshell:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm demographic A, so my thoughts, assumptions, and feelings are a truth that needs to be heard, but you demographic B people shouldn't be allowed to express your thoughts, assumptions, and feelings because they contradict my truth."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like absurd arguments, stop supporting the people who continue to make them mainstream. Identity politics are fascist tactics masquerading as progress.

       It's their own anti-white bias coming out.  Remember, all white people are "racists."  As a white person it is Donald Trump’s job to beg and grovel daily for minority approval lest his silence itself be construed as ascent to violence.

       How is he racist? I've never understood this view, nor the "Trump is homophobic" belief. I totally get the "Trump is sexist" (check), "Trump is anti-foreigner" (debatable, as opposing the previous regimes H1B visa policies is arguably the far left wing approach since the tech industry uses them as a form of corporate welfare, and this costs each unemployed professionally trained US citizen roughly two grand per week in average expected lost wages), and "Trump hates the poor" (Possible, but he hates them as little or as much as at least every President since Reagan) viewpoints by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historically, there's much more of an argument to made for our past few presidents being racist than our current one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump is racist, then I'd argue the US has never had a President that wasn't racist.

      <p>
       The world is still heading that way, it is mostly the US that now tries to isolate itself politically. Personally I suspect it will do some damage to the american economy long-term, since it is losing global political influence daily. If some of the protectionist policies Trump talked about are actually enacted (they won't), the economy might hurt a lot more.

       This is definitely a truth (though not necessarily true for all.) I was so against Trump prior to the election that I may have even had the fabled Trump derangement syndrome but so far I generally support what he has done and I believe he really wants to improve America which is not something I've been able to say about a president in my lifetime.

       Awww, how cute.  You're graph conveniently cuts out the best part.  See your graph proves what I said, its easy to rebound from near bottom, not much you have to do but pump billions into a fake economy through stimulus packages, pump millions into banks and auto, etc.  It had nowhere else to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now lets look at the time it took Obama to gain 1,000 pts on the market vs how long it took Trump. Lets also look at the fact that it wasn't manipulated market via temporary stimulus BS.  Its actual economic growth through reduction in regulation/taxes that improve consumer confidence.  Since the market is an anticipation of positive gains in any given sector, this is an important distinction.

       Lol, when it went up under Obama, it is manipulated stimulus BS. When it goes up under Trump, it is due to a great economy (the growing economy that he inherited, btw). The fact is we have been in a bull market since 2009 and there were more gains under Obama. That is a fact. You complain about pumping billions into banks when bank stocks have been the biggest winners under Trump's new tax bill, which favors large corporations 😂 Question: when the market corrects in the next year or two (and a correction IS due), will Trump fans be owning that as well?

       Great economy prompted by removing Obama regulations, yes thats exactly what it is.  Trump has removed a countless number of business killing regulations which actually allow companies to now be competitive.  A competitive market is key to a booming economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in regard to the taxes, I see you're drinking the leftsist Kool-aid.  How do you think you stimulate an economy?  By reducing big corporate tax it allows them flexibility to pay a higher wage and invest more within our borders.  Overtaxing them forces them to find ways to make a profit usually by offshoring (which has been the norm has it not?).  Now companies are moving back, increasing wages, investing within our borders and actually kick starting the economy properly.

       You have no idea how companies work. You increase jobs to increase supply. You increase supply because of increased demand. You don’t just add jobs because you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also don’t just start paying people more because you can. Publicly traded companies have a fiscal responsibility to the stock holders, not the employees. You are ignorant and blind.

       Now you want to move onto unemployment numbers so you can say Obama did better and then I can educate you on how he manipulated unemployment numbers by creating more PT jobs while putting FT employees out of work? See when ACA was launched employers used the hours requirement loophole and used 2 people to do 1 job.  Thus avoiding OT pay, ACA requirements, etc.

       Furthermore, this hardly matters to working-class Americans anyway.  Mr. "blue collar billionaire" was supposed to help members of the lower and middle class find acceptable employment. Instead, more and more Americans are struggling to afford housing, let alone healthcare.

       I'm sure the coal workers that Trump promised to help really care about the state of the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a fake populist. He cares nothing for the common man-- his entire presidency is designed to enrich himself, his failsons, his criminal son-in-law, and his fraud of a daughter. He seeks to exponentially expand income inequality on the backs of the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, Trump is a national embarrassment with the vocabulary of 4th grader; but I'm far more concerned with the damage his administration will continue to do to our nation.  His policies are a grotesque, bloated caricature of the worst ideas ever muttered by former GOP leaders.

       You would probably need to have a lot of money invested to live off dividends. Dividends are usually small enough and not every company will offer them (growth companies plunge their profits back into growing the company and its stock price higher).

       The S&amp;P triple from under $700 to $2100 under Obama. DJIA also tripled. Under Trump the S&amp;P only increased roughly 27% and the Djia about the same. It's nowhere near the same pace and at this rate likely will not even double.

       Seeing as Trump followers are so obsessed with the performance of the stock market: Funnily enough, the S&amp;P 500 started to rise the very same month that Obama signed his stimulus package into law.

       I wonder why this is in r/conspiracy instead of r/asktrumpsupporters or something similar :thinking:
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what I think, politics is all smoke and mirrors, Trump was meant to win in the first place (it was obvious Bernie would've been a better choice in the general than Hillary, there's no way anyone didn't see that). It doesn't matter if you like him or not. They
       <em>
        want

       you to have strong feelings in one way or another. If you hate him, you're going to clash violently with those who don't. That benefits everyone in TPTB. His approval rate is in the 30's, you don't have to be a genius to realize that he's losing support quickly, and yet here you are, shit stirring as if he has a 50% approval rate or as if this was a community of solely Trump supporters.

       I don't see why anyone would trust the approval percentage poll after the way the polls were completely wrong before the elections. I haven't been called for a poll and asked my opinion on if I approve of what Trump has been doing, have you? I don't think so.

       Like you said, politics is all smoke and mirrors and the polls are obviously apart of that. It would be naive or intellectually dishonest not include that in the realm of politics.

       You don't poll rain, stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interpreting weather is a qualitative science, polling a population is a quantitative science.  The issue with polling this last election was that people weren't willing to admit support for Trump openly because of ravenous pro-Hillary try-hards.

       There was no issue with polling. Hillary won the popular vote exactly as the national polls predicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump won by very slim margins in some very important swing states and it made the difference. Largely due to the last second FBI emails announcement that the polls could not account for.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a myth that Trump supporters were somehow afraid of telling someone on the phone that they support Trump. Trump supporters are loud in their ignorance.

       This is why people think Trump supporters are morons. Less than a 3rd grade understanding of probability.

       There is only a 25% chance that you will flip a coin and get heads 2 times in a row. That is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet apparently if you flipped a coin twice and you did get it twice in a row, that means the above statement is a lie according to Trump supporters.
      </p>

       Not to mention the polls weren't wrong. the predictors based on the polls were simply inaccurate.

       I think the part most people are disagreeing with is your assertion that Trump was meant to win in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely understand where you are coming from and why you are suggesting that, and it is a viable theory for sure, but there are countless reasons to believe that Clinton was meant to win in the first place and something
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       unusual happened instead. The point is neither of us
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       know for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if votes and opinions didn't matter
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       , then the media wouldn't go to so much effort and expense to manipulate and propagandize voters. The democratic systems are still technically functional, although they have taken an enormous amount of abuse over the years. If the government tried to directly overrule the outcome of an election after the fact through some kind of executive or emergency power, then there would be bloodshed. The manipulation happens all the way up to election day, and they've probably managed to get away with straight fraud through vote weighting code and ballot tampering, but once the tallies comes in there is not much that even the Deep State or NWO or whatever could do about the results.

       But why was Trump supposed to win? Big money was behind both candidates, but more was behind Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I can't buy that Trump was supposed to win just because he's polarizing. Hillary is also very polarizing, although I don't think the divide would be this ridiculous if she won. Most traditional media sources wouldn't be actively opposing her, and that's a big reason we get so much melodrama with Trump.

       I say Trump was supposed to win because the general election just doesn't matter. I don't believe that public opinion has an influence on who wins the presidency, because the election is smoke and mirrors, and they've decided who wins before it even happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       What president do you know of that commands as much media attention and public hate as he does, just by virtue of being Trump? CNN has opted to cover things such as Trumps soda drinking habits and the Shithole incident than major international news because the American public is so fixated on hating him, even if those feelings are justified.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've taken the American attention and diverted it to shit that does not matter. The fact that Trump winning was made to look like an upset just fueled the intense divide we see today.

       So the media is cutting its own throat.... for what reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read the DNC emails, they WANTED to run against Trump, assuming he was the weakest candidate on the roster.  Oops. So much for it being decided in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump only took individual contributions for the election. Everything else he paid out of his own pocket. He doesn't owe anybody anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       90% of the coverage of Trump is negative.. this isn't "reporting". Its propaganda.

       What makes you think the media is cutting it's own throat? I don't know what bubble you're living in but I work in an industry where CNN is on TV around customers 24/7 as a policy and I assure you people are eating up the shit like spaghetti. The people you may associate with may not watch it, your entire personal circle may not watch it, but it's still watched by almost a million viewers a day. 2017 was CNNs most watched year ever. Whatever they're doing, it's making them more watched than they've ever been.
      </p>
      <p>
       The root of my argument this entire time is that everything we see is a result of control that we can't. The DNC probably did want to run against Trump. Someone at some point
       <em>
        made
       </em>
       that decision. The fact that they did doesn't eliminate the possibility that they weren't going to win anyway by design. Hasn't the argument
       <em>
        always

       been that Hillary's support was manufactured? That the news supported her because she was "supposed" to  win but no one actually liked her as a candidate enough to drag themselves out to wait in line to vote for her? That people only voted for her out of fear of a Trump presidency? She was probably one of the weakest candidates I've ever seen along with Palin, and everyone knew it. I mean shit, Bernie Sanders, the socialist, beat Hillary the centrist in
       <em>
        Oklahomas
       </em>
       primary. If losing the primary in a state as red as Oklahoma to a socialist isn't a strong sign of weakness, I'm not sure what is.

      <p>
       I'm not even sure why you're bringing up his campaign spendings. I'm not arguing that Trump is being directly manipulated or that he owes anyone anything, I'm saying that Trump winning was absolutely not a loss for TPTB, and logically, they would have wanted him to win because it threw this entire country into a cesspit where everyone is either a Nazi or a Cuck. Along with this, they benefit from all the shit on TV because it makes everyone in the country hate each other and only show interest in learning more reasons to hate each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obviously propaganda, and it's working perfectly. I'm not sure if I came off as any other way. It's bullshit made to fuel the divide even further.

       I talk about getting money out of politics a lot, and considering the absolutely astounding amount of corporate cash Clinton took in 2016 for the election, and the number of Clinton voters on this sub, her corporate cash comes up a lot.

       Please.. look at my post history, you won't see my try to apologize anything Clinton/Democrats have done. In fact, I've advocated several times that Citizens United needs to be taken down. For me getting money out of politics is priority number one, and Trump's administration has shown no signs that he's capable of doing this, in fact he's only making it worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this point, anyone who still attacks Clinton is essentially beating a dead horse. Hypothetically, let's say Clinton does get thrown in jail. Does that solve anything?? We still have a corrupt AF administration running things that continues to lower the bar on a daily basis when it comes to ethics, policy, and dignity.

       To me, it isn't so much about people attacking her. It's about the iron guard that shows up to defend her and whatabout their way around any scrutiny of democrats every single time it's brought up. And then, these establishment supporters have a sense of self righteousness because Trump supporters are establishment supporters. It's absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how many people voted for her? More than people that voted for Trump. If polls are to be believed, when you fasctor in those who didn't vote...
       <em>
        way, way
       </em>
       more people wanted her to be president, and still do.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think that's a problem? That somewhere in the ballpark of half the country thinks Clinton is a great, clean politician who isn't a corporate golden child, and would put her in office today, if they could.
      </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And we still will, until the issue of hyperpartisan bootlicker-ship is addressed. Because most of the people who oppose Trump would see nothing wrong replacing him with Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what annoys me the most about the "she isn't president" deflection. You voted for her (not you, I know)! You wanted her to be president! If you have that kuch faith in a politician, shouldn't you be able to handle scrutiny without resorting to a "let's just not discuss It" deflection?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, anything that involves attacking one of the two major parties and forcing their blind, hyperpartisan proponents to acknowledge or address the flaws in their rigid Hyperpartisanship, is not beating a dead horse, in my book. Anything that sheds more light on the corruption of our current "two party" system and the need for 3rd parties is a discussion worth having.

       Yeah no.. pretty sure a lot of people voted for Clinton because she was simply the better choice than Trump, and if you're going to sit here and still think Trump would make a better president than Clinton, given the past year. Then you are beyond help and there is no point continuing this discussion. We can simply agree to disagree.

       Simple common sense? I've never seen anything that suggests he or Clinton is a racist. Although Clinton thought Sanders was a racist during the primaries... So I guess that makes you a racist for supporting him, right?

       She was a senator... you seem to be really trying hard to distract from that. Also, I don't know why Melania stays. Probably the same reason Hillary does- that it's all show, it's all politics. You seem to think this whataboutism will work on me... but it won't. Because I didn't vote for Trump and have never supported him, unlike your unwavering support of corporate golden child Clinton.

       The fact that a sitting President of the United States, Barack Obama, had his Administration conduct espionage on a political rival during a Presidential election, effectively turning the surveillance state into a weaponized domestic surveillance apparatus for the DNC/Clinton? Yeah that's a pretty big one.

       First of all, you're moving the goalposts. Your first post was basically accusing me of being crazy for even suggesting the Obama Administration was actively spying on their political rival during a Presidential election. Now, you've changed your argument to "they did spy on their rivals but it was justified."
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the source making this claim is Fusion GPS,
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/clinton-campaign-dnc-paid-for-research-that-led-to-russia-dossier/2017/10/24/226fabf0-b8e4-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html?utm_term=.60ad320d63a4">
        who was being paid by the Clinton campaign to produce opposition research on Trump.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's summarize: the Obama Department of Justice used intel from a "reliable source" that was in reality
       <em>
        being paid to produce opposition research by the Clinton campaign,
       </em>
       in addition to a drunken conversation by a Trump staffer recounted to them secondhand to justify NOT ONLY spying on people at the very top of Trump's Presidential campaign, but
       <strong>
        also unmasking others who were not under investigation for any crime, including Donald Trump himself
       </strong>
       and this is somehow NOT a massive political scandal?

       A campaign aide got drunk and talked shit about rumors that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton, rumors which were spreading wildly on the internet at the time. He repeatedly suggested that the Trump campaign meet with proxies of Russian officials to get this information and they repeatedly told him no until they eventually fired him.

      <p>
       The Hillary Clinton campaign paid a former British spy who collected unverified rumors from a literal Russian spy (okay, former KGB) and leaked the information to media and a highly politicized FBI, and then they had the nerve to accuse
       <em>
        Trump

      <p>
       The crimes committed by Manafort happened several years earlier while working with the Podesta Group. Regarding the campaign, Trump and Manafort did not know each other well beforehand and it was Manafort who approached Trump based on his record of past successes, not the other way around. Manafort was fired from the campaign two days after Trump received his first security briefing and realized his mistake.

       Nah, I just have a habit of looking at peoples' top comments to get a feel for whether they can engage in good faith or not. You have comments where you say you're autistic, and have a learning disability or something.. but you also have comments where you say you aren't autistic.

      <p>
       So yeah, I think I've got you beat. Also, imagine pretending to want to engage in any good faith discussion with someone and giving yourself away by the first thing you say to them. Surely, this subreddit has it all figured out!

       That's not a prevailing opinion here. I would go on, but I feel bad arguing with you, since you are learning disabled, politically, economically and socially illiterate, and almost certainly can't be taught anything.

       So, if you really feel the need to have a conversation with me, I'd politely request you just skip to the part where you sperg out and suggest a little-too-detailed method of suicide you'd like me to undertake. Thanks.

       Just to mention the fact that Donald Dump is living like a 18. century aristocrat in the gold plated interior of his Dump Tower, proclaiming he is a "man of the people", while in the meantime homeless Americans are dying in the streets, should be enough to wake anybody up, but sadly it isn't.

      <p>
       Trump was elected by whatever is left of the middle class (about 10%) and upper class (about 10%) only anyway, since the rest is either not interested, is in prison (can't vote) or has a felony/criminal record (can't vote, unless you BUY the right again for 10,000$).

       He presided over them losing over a thousand seats. His appointees gutted the DNC, he used OFA to starve state parties of resources and infrastructure, and policy-wise his wholesale adoption of W’s foreign and economic policies (after running on hope and change) not only cemented the cynicism of a generation, but handed economic populism and anti-deep state sentiment to the Republicans on a gilded platter.

       That's not Obama's fault. It's the American public retarded belief in Republicans that caused that. They were obstructing him for 8 years and he couldn't get anything done.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, voters reward the republicans for stagnating American development for 16 years (including Bush) AGAIN and now we're stuck with Trump who is dumber than your average drunk dude in a pub.

       It’s Obama’s fault in that he was in charge, both organizationally and politically, of the campaign’s against the Republicans and utterly screwed the pooch. If he hadn’t demobilized OFA and done all he could to piss off his base in 2009, or put in place a DNC team that ignored state-leg races, the Great Gerrymander of 2010 never would have happened in the first place.

       I agree but it's not that simple...a lot of them don't want the help, are addicts, or mentally ill. I live in CA and trust me there are plenty of programs and help. This has nothing to do with Trump.

       Nah, half of the voters voted for him. He obviously has a lot of support. And if he keeps the economy going up to record levels, secures the boarder, increases investment in the country by companies bringing money back home, keeps unemployment at super low levels, continues to bring the middle class back, continues to have the lowest ever rate for unemployed blacks, etc... it is going to get worse for you.

       His support is growing and growing. His policies are turning the country around. And he is deporting violent gang members that Obama welcomed here (MS13), arresting pedophiles at an unheard of rate. Things are just looking brighter and brighter. Gonna be a great 7 more years, then hopefully it becomes a dynasty.

       Worse in the sense that his economic policies alone will make him more popular and all but guarantee relection. It seems like this sub used to like him as he was against the system. Around 3 or so months ago the sub took an abrubt turn. It is a bit like the politics forum when it comes to Trump here. Just not representative of the population.

       Laughable. At the end of Obama's 2nd term, the average American had less than $1000 to their name.

       At the end of Obama's term, the average American was one $500 surprise bill away from bankruptcy.
       <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-americans-cant-handle-a-500-surprise-bill/">
        Source.

      <p>
       During Obama's term, we saw food stamps usage climb to record highs. We saw the Labor Force Participation Rate fall to record lows. We saw healthcare costs climb to record highs year after year after year. This isn't even getting into the absolutely abysmal disparity between the wealthy and the poor, which grew to record highs under Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       The median wage under Obama was lower than the day he took office for the entirety of his presidency. How's that for the middle class getting fucked?
      </p>
      <p>
       All this happened against a backdrop of
       <em>
        doubling
       </em>
       the national debt - again, to record levels under Obama. The debt to GDP ratio has never been higher than the day Obama left office. He was a profligate spender and despite all of that the middle class you pretend to care about didn't see their wages raise a single dime under his Presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hate on Trump all you want, but for fuck's sake stop embarrassing yourself with this political garbage. Barack Obama oversaw what was unambiguously one of the worst economic "recoveries" in US history
       <em>
        despite
       </em>
       profligate government spending and record low Fed rates designed to spur business growth. Very few US Presidents have presided over
       <em>
        worse
       </em>
       middle class woes than Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Barack Obama is literally the only President in US history to
       <em>
        never have a single year of 3% economic growth or higher.
       </em>
       It was eight years of unmitigated disaster for the American middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only an entitled, privileged, and utterly sheltered fool would argue that Obama was in any way shape or form good for the American economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buddy I lived through that fucking shit, every day for eight fucking years.

       Never said I was a fan and trump didn’t change anything obama implemented until the tax bill which hasn’t been around long enough to really do much. Trump continued what obama was doing like many presidents do in their first term. I pointed out a fact. Shit sucks and republicans just tipped the scale even more towards the rich it’s gonna get even worse

       i didn't call your comment stupid because i believe trump can take credit. it's stupid because you think obama can take credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       the president doesn't have complete control over the economy. most of the time, he acts as a cheerleader. however, there are a number a things trump and obama have done to affect the economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       although trump's "cheerleading" regarding jobs has actually brought jobs into the country. i don't believe he can be personally credited. you could argue his sabre rattling, especially with mexico and nafta, has caused a number of corporations to invest billions in american factories, creating jobs. the stock market is performing well, and although i would attribute it to trump, i wouldn't say it was because of his actions. wall street exploded on a bull run the second he got elected. obama has nothing to do with it. the bull run was likely caused by wall streets anticipation of deregulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are a few things i definitely give trump credit for. his criticism and implosion of the TPP. I don't think this has affected the economy yet, however those world trade deals only benefit international billionaires, and slowly kill the middle class over decades of time. another thing would be the recent tax cuts. there is a provision in the law designed to take dollars kept out of country and tax them, in theory it should bring US dollars back to the US from around the world. i know reddit likes to circle jerk over the "corporate cuts" being evil, but theyre not. most corporations, especially the ones i work with, are small closely held family businesses making $50-100k annually. these cuts are huge for the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       the obama economy under performed in terms of jobs and GDP growth, but i couldn't necessarily blame him. he came into office right around the time of the housing market bubble bursting. that can understandably fuck up the economy for years.  i can give obama credit for some things though. the "stimulus package" that came out around the time of the 2008 recession dumped a lot of money into the economy, essentially putting a floor on the amount of damage the housing market would cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe the economy will eventually collapse. like ron paul recently said: it's an illusion. the tax cuts will keep the party going for a little while longer, but everything must come to an end.

       another ignorant comment.

      <p>
       the president has a cheer-leading role in the economy. the president can negotiate trade deals, form tax policy and cheer-lead. even trumps bullish stock market is due to perception, not because anything he did. obama's low GDP growth was due to the housing recession in 2008, not because bad fiscal policy (i "liberaled" up my point for you otherwise you'd plug your ears).
      </p>
      <p>
       it's retarded to give full credit of the economy to the president. it's even more retarded to give it to the last president, especially obama.

       It takes years for a president' s actiojs to have a noticeable difference on the economy, if even then. The current economic situation is most likely a combination or a natural rebound from 2008 and some Obama ers policies. Calling this Trumps economy is laughable bro

I don't think this has affected the economy yet, however those world trade deals only benefit international billionaires, and slowly kill the middle class over decades of time. another thing would be the recent tax cuts. there is a provision in the law designed to take dollars kept out of country and tax them, in theory it should bring US dollars back to the US from around the world. i know reddit likes to circle jerk over the "corporate cuts" being evil, but theyre not. most corporations, especially the ones i work with, are small closely held family businesses making $50-100k annually. these cuts are huge for the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       the obama economy under performed in terms of jobs and GDP growth, but i couldn't necessarily blame him. he came into office right around the time of the housing market bubble bursting. that can understandably fuck up the economy for years. i can give obama credit for some things though. the "stimulus package" that came out around the time of the 2008 recession dumped a lot of money into the economy, essentially putting a floor on the amount of damage the housing market would cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe the economy will eventually collapse. like ron paul recently said: it's an illusion. the tax cuts will keep the party going for a little while longer, but everything must come to an end.

       In my opinion, when you're at war you'll take in the enemy who wants to fight for good.  If he can't grow good fruit he will be cut down by his own words.

       That’s true, and he’s lost a lot of supporters. I’m sure there’s a lot of people are disappointed that the things he promised aren’t going to happen. Maybe some have even realized that their biggest fear shouldn’t be Muslims.

       How do you know he's lost a lot of supporters? Where are the stats on this info? In my experience more and more people are jumping on the Trump Train. Trump is doing an excellent job in his first year so I have  no idea what you're talking about when you reference "people [being] disappointed that the things he promised aren't going to happen." He's in his first year. Things are happening. And Muslim violence is a problem, but it isn't the only problem. Your post is very low energy. Do a better job.

       What bullshit exactly?  The pedophile arrests are up.  A lot of politicians have announced they will not seek reelection.  Others have resigned.  The stock market is up.  People are finding jobs, especially black people.  There are more manufacturing jobs.

       As if pedophile arrests have anything whatsoever to do with Trump. They are the direct result of women and men (mostly liberal) speaking put against their accusers. How about the pedophile Roy Moore who Trump was backing?

       Serious question.  The Bushes, Clintons, McCain, John Kerry, Soros, Obama, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, etc. are all New World Order globalists.  Trump is more of a Nationalist, which directly conflicts with the NWO globalist agenda.

       So, how do you tell the difference between a Trump supporter and someone who is anti-NWO?

       You didn't even say anything but spew your feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, Trump has more ties to the Rothschildclan then the Clintons do,
       <a href="https://philosophyofmetrics.com/how-rothschild-inc-saved-donald-trump-freepom/">
        https://philosophyofmetrics.com/how-rothschild-inc-saved-donald-trump-freepom/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And in reality Trump has stacked his cabinet with globalist bankers, and in reality Trump has furthered globalist-agendas, such as repealing the CFPB rule allowing for class actions against banks,leaving American consumers to twist in the wind against the bankers in forced arbitration in which the bankers hold all the cards. 
But you don't care about that because you only regurgitate propaganda, and nobody told you to care about it.

       You gave him nothing to answer, you just listed some names, and then puked out your emotions, you did not qualify your opinion, you did not even try. You're a joke who utters hollow proclamations.

       I am aware of Trumps connections to the Rothschild banker, Wilbur Ross.  Trump is also connected to the Jesuits, which is pretty alarming.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is how much control did Trump have in selecting his Administration?  Obama did not have much control, so why would Trump? Obama was given a list from Citibank of bankers to appoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Trumps cabinet is stacked with NWO globalists.  They unexpectedly lost control of the White House.  What else do you think they would do?  Allow Trump to appoint a bunch of Nationalists?  LOL.

       How much power do you think a President really has?

       You can't be both. Trump is doing everything that an elite secretive order would want. War mongering, huge tax cuts for elites, better suppression of the poor, misinformation campaigning every day, weakening of public power structures like EU, Union busting, more surveillance structures .

       <p>
        "in my experience"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       let me tell you my thoughts about your experience...
      </p>
      <p>
       in my experience, it is better to remain silent and allow the other person to talk, so that you can learn what kind of person they are, without revealing what kind of person you are
      </p>
      <p>
       if you are the first to speak, you will probably signal to the listener(s) that you are a left-leaning person
      </p>
      <p>
       and the right-leaning listener will sit there silently, politely listening to your virtue signaling
      </p>
      <p>
       and so therefore you, the speaker assume the listener is like-minded, and also left-leaning, because the listener doesn't challenge anything you say, and only gives vague feedback that signals they are listening like OKs, yups, un-huhs and amens at the appropriate times
      </p>
      <p>
       so what happens is that you surround yourself with a bubble of people who you assume are like minded lefties, but in fact they are a mixed bag
      </p>
      <p>
       and when these people go into a voting booth, they might not vote the way you expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       by behaving the way i do, by letting the other person talk first, i pretty much allow everyone to assume that i am just like them, and consequently they open up and tell me all kinds of stuff that they would be reluctant to tell other people
      </p>
      <p>
       this may seem like creepy behavior, but i sincerely do want to hear peoples opinions and thoughts or troubles etc and i sincerely try to empathize with their situation, to walk in their shoes, in my mind. i value peoples opinions, and am sincerely curious about how those opinions are formed
      </p>
      <p>
       i can say that what sounds "crazy" coming out of someones mouth, often has a logical explanation, if you allow them to explain themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       i can say that i have never met a "crazy" person.
      </p>
      <p>
       i have only met good people who are living in a crazy world.
      </p>
      <p>
       dont judge a book by the cover. a lot of people don't "look" like a stereotypical conservative... like that guy in the mosh pit
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump didn't win because Russians hacked the electoral college
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump won because HRC was a terrible candidate who alienated the lefty base with her shenanigans against Sanders
      </p>
      <p>
       that and PizzaGate threatened to bring the whole thing down, and so the deep state threw HRC under the bus.

       I think this is such a complex issue that we are honestly just never going to fully know what is actually happening. Ever. While I am not inclined to trust anyone who is willing to run for president and submit themselves to dealing with the deep state; I am fully convinced that things are miles better than if Clinton was sitting in the Oval Office, and that everyone I don’t like, just happens to not like Trump.

       so basically you have no evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       i didn't see anything presented that would have convinced me, as a juror.

      <p>
       would you mind describing the evidence you assume you see in the article?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In late April, at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just learned from high-level Russian officials in Moscow that the Russians had “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails,” according to court documents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although Russian hackers had been mining data from the Democratic National Committee’s computers for months, that information was not yet public. Even the committee itself did not know.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Not long after, however, he opened up to Mr. Downer, the Australian diplomat, about his contacts with the Russians. It is unclear whether Mr. Downer was fishing for that information that night in May 2016. The meeting at the bar came about because of a series of connections, beginning with an Israeli Embassy official who introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to another Australian diplomat in London.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the information from the Australians, the investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...

       Adam Goldman, Eileen Sullivan and Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.

      <p>
       and after reading the article I'm left wondering what exactly the evidence is, and what laws were allegedly broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       i also like the part where some government officials decline to comment on an ongoing investigation, but other government officials freely comment on that same investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       the distinction seems to be whether commenting on a case would be helpful or harmful to the official narrative
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious, why do you suppose that cooperating with Russians is not allowed, but cooperating with Israel is almost required?

       But the Attorney General of the United States has already said there's not enough evidence on them to start an investigation. You clearly have better information/sources than he does, so why should they be investigated?

       I was thinking Loretta Lynch.

       I think that Jeff Sessions is a NWO globalist, so I believe he will protect other NWO globalists.  To me, it is not a Democrat versus Republican conflict.  It is the NWO globalists versus the Nationalists.

       I think it goes case by case. I think the Mueller investigation is pretty solid, I mean hell they got 2 separate charged crimes already. The Ken starr investigation seemed like it got stonewalled at every turn, but also I paid no attention to politics at the time so that's thru a historical lense. But the benghazi investigation seemed like nothing but political theater. And I know there were some others for Clinton, but idk enough to comment

       I don't really think you know me well enough to make that assumption. Do you want to perhaps rephrase that as a question and then we can actually discuss it, or do you just want to assume you know me or my thoughts on the matter?

       I think a new one for uranium one. So let's see if there are any indictments. I mean, the benghazi investigation lasted like 2 years? (Please correct me if I'm wrong) with no indictments at all, so how is an investigation with multiple charged crimes a witch hunt?

       It links directly to here....clear violation of reddit best practices.

       OP doesn't know what he is talking about:
example:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He supported Jerusalem being named as the capital of Israel.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Probably the exact same moment that all the Hillary supporters realize she is an utterly corrupt, amoral, war-criminal that should be sitting in a cell.  In other words - never.  Anyone stupid enough to have supported either Hillary or Trump lacks, by definition, the ability to think critically.  Unfortunately that is the vast majority of the country.  An intelligent, moral person would never even consider voting for or supporting either Trump or Hillary - yet ~98% of voters did.  This tells you all you need to know about the state of our society and how far we have to go if we are to survive - let alone thrive - as a nation and as a species.  Trump is not the cause of our problems - he is a symptom of the disease - just like Hillary Clinton.  In a decent society, the Trump's and Hillary's of the world are laughed at, mocked, and held in disrepute.  Their transparent scams work on nobody and they are both reduced to selling pencils in a subway station since they have absolutely nothing worthwhile to offer.  In the world we live in, they are at the top of the pyramid.  Rather than crying about Trump or Hillary, take a look around you.  Take a look at the person standing next to you.  Take a look in the mirror.  That's the problem.

       When Obama, Bill Clinton, Bush and every other supporter of a president ever realize it. He is the same puppet as everyone before him, simply doing what he is told and putting on a nice show for everyone to consume lives with divide and hate. It's all bullshit and half the "users" you see on Reddit or Twitter for any presidential candidate are fake as shit.

       I think incoming Presidents do not know what they got themselves into until they walk into the White House.  I recall Trump said he had no idea how deep the swamp was, and I believe him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conflict Trump had with the CIA before the inauguration was very telling to me.  It was like Trump thought he was going to waltz into the White House and implement his policies, but instead he was told what policies were going to be implemented.  Why would the Cabal allow a 4 or 8 year President to determine policies that may have affects 20 years down the road?   The Cabal put an end to this with JFK.

       I am no Trumpette but you do realize he has de regulated Obama crap, Congress and Senate won't work w him or the Obamacare would be stopped completely. The left spews hatred at every level, when did you hear of any President that has been met w so much hate? You haven't i detested Clintons and Obama, Bushes, etc but i never called for their demise. When they fail we fail why can't people realize that. Everything he undoes the lat Admin did are things we never heard about till he fixed them, He tries w the wall and is met w rocks. But, he is still part of the Swamp, Govt is smoke and mirrors. I would urge everyone to listen to this video.

       This boost started before he even took office.  As often reported it was due to consumer and business confidence in reduction in stifling regulations as well as the promise of corporate tax cuts.  Both of those things happened and the Trump rally continues today.  DOW 26,000+ pts!!!

       So in your mind a boost that happened before he took office can be attributed to him because of the promise of a corporate tax cut as well as end to stifling regulations? You believe pre-election, that corporations not only 1) knew Trump would win, they 2) knew what his tax plan would like, and what his 3) deregulation efforts would look like? Which de-regulation efforts by the President are you referring too? Him saying "I'm pro-deregulation"?
      </p>

       Do you see why that logic really makes no sense?

       So "Obama's DOW" went from 12k-18k in 8 yrs.  Okay, not bad, my 401k did great in those early years too.  Was glad I voted for him in '08.

       i didn't vote for trump and see him as a human dumpster fire, but all of this harranguing of people to admit this or accept that about anything do nothing but entrench those harrangued and harden hearts and make fixing the shithole we find ourselves in impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       i could care less what someone admits or accepts or believes.  what i care about is pulling a ron paul-dennis kucinich partnership. most trump supporters agree with me on at least some issues, so let's fix those issues. there are enough problems to work on before we hit empassess.

       There is likely a large block of them that will never realize this, the same way you'll never convince my almost 90 year old grandpa that Bush and Cheney were conmen... or the way I get downvoted to oblivion anytime I'm critical of Clinton, Obama or really any democrat on reddit.

       Hyperpartisanship.

       Trump's been a political conman since the 2000 election, at least, when he helped destroy 3rd party viability in the US. Many of his supporters were sucking their binky in 2000.

       I got plenty of exit plans. If the Cultural Marxists are eventually successful in getting one of their commies in as Prez in the U.S., after 8 years of Trump skyrocketing the Dow Jones and bringing back the economy into 3.2+ gdp and climbing, it will take the libtards some time to undo everything good.

       I can either A.) go off the gird, hunting rifle, cabin, solar, chickens, fish/garden. B.) Move to Singapore which has tough immigration, is an actual meritocracy (meaning they dont allow losers like MS13 and ISIS in from Syria unvetted) and work til I retire there. or C.) Join and stay at a Buddhist monastery in a somewhat safe and Libtard free country. I have done 6 months at a monastery before so this is possible too. or D.) Move to an East Europe Country and help fight against the libtard and islamic takeovers of Europe.

       Odd, me? Dude, Im over here wondering what the fuck is wrong with you myself. I was considering a number of things: You're a child, or autism, or brain damage, or live in some sort of safe space, or very low intelligence, or anti social.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know which one or combo of things best describes you, but clearly I thought from the getgo you were the odd one here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'll tell you what. On top of this, I am part of a debate club with intellectuals and college professors, am friends with musicians (some of which are famous) and have a large group of family and friends, and no none of them find me odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time someone called me odd, was when I was going to school and working at a welding place (to save for college). There was a guy there who was special, and clearly only worked there as a favor to his parents. He was not allowed to touch any welding equipment there. Only sweeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day I was discussing with the guys working there about the connections between democrats and globalists and how they are screwed if globalism continues. The special guy that works there, couldnt really comprehend the level of intelligence I was speaking at, so he called me odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is why I am guessing there is some brain or special issues with you.

       Sigh, when you label critics of the libtard movement as Nazi's, that's pretty much Cultural Marxism. Congrats, you got played and make sure to continue calling anyone who disagrees with you as "nazi" because this is what alt-left does these days, and its fucking pathetic.

       Yes. Does it exist now? Yes, its already infiltrated the U.S. education system, media, tech, music, movies/hollywood, etc

       My god, we have reached ludicrous levels of cognitive dissonance. Now I used to work with a lot of Brits, and they were fuck all with any sort of critical thinking skills or intelligence. I try not to judge a whole country by all of them, but you just keep proving it true.

       Were jews initially behind it, and involved with it? Sure, the research and facts suggest so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it some JEW based global agenda? I dont know maybe maybe not. Israel just got a flood of African immigrants that they dont want there and want to kick out, (and supposedly cultural diversity is part of it) so who knows.
      </p>

       Is the jew question part of your tactic to not do research, bait someone, and then call them anti-semitic if they answer a certain way?

       100% you just pulled a bait and switch, and got called the fuck out on it, and now look stupid AF because of it.

       Some of them were jews, and some were Germans. And now, if you look at all the people who identify with, teach, support, and are part of this movement, they arent all Jewish. For example the rise of the anti-white movement and increase in pro-black racists, doesnt necessarily have Jews in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this certainly makes you think, in terms of all those people who say "jews" are behind it all, lol. I was also a centrist on the matter and never involved myself in these debates, until I finally sat down to do the research to see if its true. Most certainly it shows jews are most definitely involved in all aspects of the world

       When U.S.S.R. collapsed, those in the countryside off the grid continued life as usual, some didn't even know there was a collapse for a decade or more later. Same deal w the great Depression, the off the gridders survive no problem.

       Technology changes all things. Already the existence of the internet, supercomputers, gps, satellite tracking, military tech in police hands... changes the scenarios you mentioned. I believe the elites will pull the trigger once everything is in place to prevent any kind of escape off the grid.

       That said, I do own a cabin with a propane tank, a wood burning stove and a water pump, in an area that doesnt even technically have a zip code and would make an attempt to go off grid if I was out of options.

       actualy it sounds like youre the one with the strawman. Here's me: Trump didnt sign Globalist agreements TPP + Paris Agrrement (+2). Wants closed Borders (+3), is against the lying propaganda fake news media (+4), doesnt want people coming here from shitholes just like I dont want that (+5), lowered corporate taxes so apple is repatriating its money and Chrysler is coming back to Detroit (+7), and my 401k and Stocks are murdering right now (+1000)
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey i'll tell you what, being an ex-Dem born and raised in Chicago and growing up poor and around minorities and blacks, Obama was supposed to be the savior as senator and as President, and he did JACK SHIT to help the South Side and that's when my eyes were opened that Democrats are virtue signaling pieces of shit just like republicans. No one ever does shit for the poor neighborhoods, but now under Trump, lowest Black Unemployment rates since the rates have been recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also a patriot, constitutionalist, and independent and Trump is goddam national Treasure. We are lucky because we were this () close to having a SJW Sell Out Crooked H who ruined Libya become the true dictator and causing a collapse, at least now its averted for 8 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I really hope you prosper, learn to love America, the constitution, own a gun, learn to shoot, have a family, and become a productive, intelligent, and educated member of a society which should be Meritocracy, just like I am, so that one day we can all eat at the same table and be merry and joyous

       We have the right to bear arms, the law is there so citizens are armed against the Gov or enemies of the state. Its your duty as a citizen to get yourself a gun and protect yourself, your family, and others in case any MS13 illegal immigrant gang members or terrorists from muslim shithole countries try to do something, then you are properly trained to take down the threat accurately and save lives

       Because you do things like say all his policies helped black unemployment, then flip out asking how a specific policy does that when asked yourself, and then you double down saying that is in fact the case right after. You also don't actually directly answer anyone's questions. It's not coherent and there's no debate to be had.

       I wish that was true. I just can't believe a real grown up with a real life and love in his heart would spend his short existence defending a millionaire that would rather step over his corpse than give him a nickel.  He fucking despises you from the depths of his soul and he just used you. Despite that, you lick the government's boots because he made you feel important for a moment and parrot an elderly lifelong conman's words as gospel. It's so sad.

       he doesnt have to give me a nickel, Id rather work hard and prove myself instead of being on Government handouts. His tax cuts already allowed my company to give me a bonus this Xmas of $1,500 and I will be getting like an extra $3k back from taxes. Plus he decided not to take the $400k Presidential Pay which is Awesome in itself. Most important is the moves he made to grow the economy and bring the corporations back.

       I love how you think he was referring to Trump going to strip clubs while on the campaign trail. That would be an amusing story to read about.

       Does he wear a suit and tie along with his red maga hat while he's tossing ones on a stage in these Podunk town strip clubs, or does he go incognito with Mike Pence, dressed like plumbers?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The group is now suing Donald J. Trump for President for breach of contract, Bloomberg reports. A complaint filed Tuesday claims that the campaign has violated a verbal agreement it made with the U.S.A. Freedom Kids regarding a rally performance in Des Moines, Iowa. It includes an email they received from Stephanie Scruggs, the Trump campaign’s field director, which read: “As discussed, we are not able to pay the girls or cover travel, however, we have coordinated with the event space to allow the girls to set up a table and pre-sell their albums, shirts, etc. if this is helpful to you.” The arrangement was meant to substitute the group’s $2,500 fee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The troupe claims that after arriving in Chicago, and paying for travel and lodging at their own expense, they were informed that their performance had been canceled. They’re seeking between $5,000 and $15,000 in damages.

       Dude you’re trying to tell me you have a PhD in finance and you only got a $1500 bonus and you’re getting a tax RETURN? You might be the most poorly paid finance PhD I’ve ever heard of. I’ve also never heard of anyone in finance getting a Christmas bonus. Finance bonuses come in between 2/28 and 3/31 and they usually start in the 6 figures. Maybe look for a new job? Are were you just lying? 🤔

       You definitely should be dude. You ought to look for something new because you’re being paid well below market value. A 1st year with your degree should be getting at least 50k in bonus. But maybe you didn’t get a finance related job? Nobody in finance gets a Christmas bonus. They all get paid out late feb to late March.

       I'm good. I'm on a 1year internship at a brokerage. They always pay shit the first year, but as long as I make it past the rookie hazing and shit pay in year one, then they bring you aboard for 6 figures which will be this summer for me. I have a friend who got me in here who has been here for 5 years now so Im all good

       TONS of companies gave out bonuses because of Trump. Literally everyone in this brokerage, in the CME markets, stock markets, they all love trump cause they know he's smart AF to turn the economy around.

       Do you really think the black unemployment rate went down because of Trump? What policy or policies, specifically?
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't consider that policies take time, and that the rate decreased far more under Obaka, due to Bush's admin skyrocketting it, do you?

       On top of ending the police reform, Trump and Sessions are ramping up the drug war as well. Anyone who knows anything about history knows that gangs thrive when there are black markets to profit off of.

       "Chicago gangs no longer know or fear the police, and bodies pile up"

        You mean police were going to be held accountable? So that if they claim someone tried to stab them, they better have actually tried stabbing them instead of moving away from the cop when they were executed? Followed by police deleting evidence of their actions?

       Ok so just got done reading all the links except fake news CNN which this sub agreed to no longer allow any stories from because they are fake propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 2 sides of the story. The first is that police need reformation and new training so they follow the rules, regain community trust, less murders, less law suits, and everyone wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second side, is that the doing the above makes the police soft and makes the crooks, murderers, gangs no longer respect a soft police force so everything should go back to hands off policing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with a middle ground. I saw the latter part happen here in Chicago, police were scared to go on the news, to get a law suit, and to lose their jobs so they stopped being hard asses, and they stopped policing as much in the south side and west side shitholes, so crime went up, which is one of the side effects.

       Trump said he would lets states handle MJ, but sessions is against it. Obviousl I dont agree w sessions and it should be federally and nationally legalized. This isnt going to stop the coke and heroin though, which will continue to get sold and fund cartels, who should be fought against. Also people are OD'ing on street heroin, so you think legalizing it is the way?

       I did, its all the same shit about police reform. Doesnt change the fact that I witnessed Chicago police become a bunch of scared pussies who no one respected anymore because they were scared to police

       Yeah a lot of cops suck. There are situations where the cop is wrong and should go to jail, but there are also many situations where the cop was in the right. Like i said, if you reform and pussify too much, you've let the thugs win. IF you let the cops be too hard, then they end up doing bullshit we all agree is wrong

       That sentence means everything. I fucking live here and saw the cops become pussies and the crime and murder rates go up and watch as the ghetto thugs now take rides into downtown and nice neighborhoods to do their crimes before escaping back to the ghetto. This used to never happen until the reformation and pussification here

      <p>
       I dont. However, someone dies on Earth every 8 seconds. If some thugged out shooter who has already killed others gets killed by the cops and they plant a handgun on him or lie about it, to be honest I'm okay with that. Some trash will never reform and never turn around.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, there is a law and cops should adhere to it, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, this is complicated. Its not about police reformation and we're good. Its so much deeper than that

       Sure I'm rational. I have had guns put to my head, my house broken into and robbed, and my car shot at with me in it while doing no wrong and no harm.

       The "boogeyman" most certainly exists in some areas of the country like Los Angeles.  And at the same time, SJW D politicians cut secret deals with R politicians to fuck over the poor.

       That's hilarious because the article states
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Senior Trump administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, defended the move as consistent with Trump’s desire to have multiple, one-on-one trade deals with countries, rather than a single agreement like TPP, which included a dozen nations.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which is typically what you want to see, negotiations with the bigger more trade heavy big gdp countries (all countries in general) using a variety of negotiation tactics instead of being thrown under a global wide umbrella which more than likely wouldnt have allowed him to lower corporate taxes to bring back apple, chrysler, and many other corporations back

       Are they all bad hombres though? Tillerson for example, did work for Goldman Sachs, but only momentarily and he's ultimately a patriotic constitutionalist who admittedly loves the country.

       This is the first time Trump has ever run for office, so he was not really a politician before.  Trump is also not an attorney.  It is interesting that people prefer Hillary who is both a politician and an attorney.

       You're putting all trump voters in a single block which is really stupid.
       <br/>
       People voted for Trump for one or more of the following reasons.
       <br/>
       People like his policies.
       <br/>
       Hillary was a much more horrible choice.
       <br/>
       The left wing pissed off so many people with their nanny state, political correctness and calling half the country "Nazi's", they went to the polls to say "fuck you" to liberals.  I'm a racist because I sent my kid to school with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?  Yeah, you're not getting my vote.

       Do NOT underestimate this last one.  It had a significant impact on my voting choice.

       Dude, I didn't put all Trump supporters into a single block. I said there's a large block of them who will just always vote Republican, just like there's a large block of people who voted for Hillary who will vote for any candidate the DNC puts out.

       There is likely a large block of people who voted that way, yes. Doesn't change what I said. Doesn't change the fact that my 90 year old grandpa voted for him simply because he's a hyperpartisan who would literally vote for anyone the RNC puts out.

       The Hyperpartisanship is the problem. If you are an issues voter, great. Not everyone is, and that's a huge problem.

       The last one is the weakest of all the arguments. Policies and personal quality of opponents are all valid reasons to vote for Trump. Being angry because a collection of leftests called you names isn't. If you agree with Nazi ideology, then being called a Nazi isn't so far off the mark. If you don't agree with the Nazis, then those calling you a Nazi are wrong. Not you. You should probably just ignore that idiocy.

       You refuse to acknowledge the fact that neo-nazis are actual nazis by putting nazi in quotes like what they want was dubious or something.....like they weren't open about their very specific beliefs....like they were only being accused of blatant nazism.....are you following me here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain it further:
      </p>
      <p>
       Your issue is you like feeling like the victim in this instance. You have nothing to say about the actual racism perpetrated by this group and instead pretend they don't exist by not acknowledging their existence. The same group that is trying to revive to movement our parents/grandparents/great-grandparents fought against. The very same group who, if they had their way, would only allow white people to exist. The fact that you don't denounce what they say, do, and wish indicates you agree on some level with what they say. It's easier in your mind to say "libtards hate me because I'm a Trump supporter and that's why they call me racist because anyone who doesn't agree with them is racist. Fuck those snowflakes" rather than "wow it's messed up that the ideology that we fought against in WWII (not even a century ago) is resurfacing and has super fucked up ideals." I'm not even a liberal and I don't call single person who disagrees with me a racist, but in this case I'm going to act under the assumption you are simply because of the reasons stated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes you are allowed freedom of speech, but that doesn't mean others will have to like it. If you support nazis assholes then take a guess as to what you pretty much are?

       I must have missed that.  It quickly went the opposite way.   R/T_D was definitely brigading the entire site, but I noticed eventually that literally any corner of this site will jump on any anti-liberal ideas very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sucks on both ends.   Whether you are liberal or conservative you are going to get shit on by the polar opposition for your opinion.  That’s just how it has ended up being one year later.  There is no middle ground it seems.

       heres a conspiracy of my own: the people who are loudest online often spend most of their free time there and are swayed by the crowd to think one way, either red or blue. its their daily routine. i think its a minority
the silent majority, who go about daily lives without actively searching for online prey or circlejerking, form their opinions by what truly matters to them with the time they spend and it usually ends up as all different hues from violet to magenta.

       You are probably onto something.   It makes sense and I have had that same thought.  Almost a self fulfilling prophecy in a way.  Those of us that cant spend 8 hrs a day on reddit have our own opinions formed that are more or less not the extreme left or right we see here.   I always come to reddit and I’m like ehhh I don’t really get down with full blown PC liberalism.  Then I go to Voat and I’m like “wellllll you guys are kinda nuts too and have been openly racist on this site so this isnt for me either”.

       Remember when I brought up Hillary? Because neither do I. I don't like Hillary, I think she is a crook. How is she relevant however? She isn't president, she lost to her pied Piper. So what does bringing her up have to do with Trump following the same fucking bought and sold agenda every president before him has pushed? Why is it that in a topic discussing him, you need to deflect to Hillary Clinton who is irrelevant to a discussion about Trump being a puppet?

       I'm sorry, i obviously mistook your for a HRC voter.

      <p>
       Hillary is relevant because usually when we are talking about an election it comes down to the lesser of two evils
      </p>
      <p>
       like when people used to complain about Obama, i just remind them that it could have been HRC, and then the light bulb lights up and they get it, and then i tell them they can thank me later.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the same applies to Trump
      </p>
      <p>
       sure he has some problems, but at least he's not HRC
      </p>
      <p>
       i dont think you quite understand just how loathed she is across the spectrum of people. she's been in the public eye long enough to have made a bad impression on everyone
      </p>
      <p>
       her campaign slogan was "I'm With Her"
      </p>
      <p>
       selfish, all about her, not about the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       "first woman president" hardly outweighs her baggage
      </p>
      <p>
       his campaign slogan was "Make America Great Again
      </p>
      <p>
       which was a blatant rip off of Ronald Reagan's campaign slogan
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump copied success. that seems to have been a smart move

       Lol congrats on being a putin cuckboi
      </p>

       no1currs what "you claim to have done" and I don't believe you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Er thinking about it, I think I should thank you for getting Trump elected.  If Hillary won then Republicans would of just obstructed and try and throw more bullshit bengahzi email investigations then imaginable that never go anywhere but stalls her agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Trump winning we all get to see how shitty Republicans are, how shitty Trump is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean with out Trump we wouldn't know that the Republicans are traitor fuckbois accepting money from Russia to win the election.  We wouldn't know that Trump has money laundered millions of dollars of Russian Oligarch money stolen from the Russian people.
      </p>
      <p>
       All those racist fuckbois sticking there head into the light get a big target marked on them and we get to point an laugh when the sunlight hits them and then they try and hide but can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thanks for getting Trump in to office.  I think its going to make America much better after the Mueller comes in a fucks those Russian traitor fuckbois in the GOP and VP / Presidency when the are frog marched and put against a wall and shot in their shitty traitor faces. Hopefully it will be Trumps "wall" when it happens on public TV

       Omg I took high school history too thanks for pointing out that the Democrats were fuck boi racists piece of shit way back then and all the way to the 70's  but that all changed in the 70's  thanks to the Southern Strategy you should read up about Nixon since Trump is doing a speed run on Nixon's impeachment.

       I also remember when Obama
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/13/enemy-combatant-guantanamo-detainees-obama">
        stopped using the word "enemy combatant"
       </a>
       and we thought we had a peacemaker, but as you know since
       <em>

       totally not a fanboy yourself,
       <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=9&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;hp&amp;amp;adxnnlx=1338289213-gFazCDrgzwY2RtQCER9fGQ&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&amp;amp;referer=">
        he simply changed the wording, but business continued as usual with arguably more diabolical means.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Iraq, Libya, and then almost Syria fell to this bipartisan attempt to Balkanize the Levant and Middle East, and people like you seriously think people's problem with Obama was that "he looked cool" or that "those racist white people just had it out for him."  What a cartoon-vision of the world to hold.

       And, while definitely true about Trump, the stat alone is misleading.  Do we count all the deaths caused by "moderate rebels" that we trained and armed in those numbers?

       I don't know how anyone could disagree with that characterization, regardless of their political leanings or personal feelings about Trump. The post is just whining about people who believe in the White Hat counter-coup conspiracy theory involving Trump. Okay, so maybe OP thinks that theory is stupid, maybe a lot of people do, but how in the hell is it worthwhile to make weekly self posts to express disdain for people who are interested in the theory? Oh right, because the post is actually just traditional politicking masquerading as organic conspiracy chatter, trying to chip away at the morale of his supporters.

      <p>
       <a href="https://medium.com/@tswriting/trump-is-a-genius-e2306bf6ba96">
        "The problem is that his base — those who, despite everything, still think he’s great, a genius, and doing a good job — are almost by definition also Dunning-Kruger dunces. To support Trump now, with anything other than embarrassed reluctance, you have to be ignoring or disputing such an avalanche of facts, criticism, and dissent that belief in Trump is more like the blind faith of a religion than a considered opinion."

       You asked for evidence that the Trump administration is arming the Kurds. I just gave you two well-sourced articles describing a Trump administration plan to arm and train 30,000 Kurdish forces to patrol Syria's borders and Turkey's outrage about Trump going back on that one-off statement he made back in November. You know, the statement that is your sole piece of evidence for your assertion that Trump isn't arming the Kurds any more. So explain to me how those articles aren't about what I think they're about.

       I mean, it's very clear what the reply would be, and none of them would be very helpful. After reading my comment, he would (in descending order of probability):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Dismiss it entirely off-hand as not worth his time or the energy required to respond. (Looks like this is what happened in actuality. Crazy how that happens.)
       </li>
       <li>
        Write off my comment as simply lib propaganda. (This could be combined with a dismissal of both al-Jazeera and the LA Times as biased.)
       </li>
       <li>
        Just admit to himself that he doesn't actually care about what happens to Syrians or the Kurds, and try to reaffirm himself that the Trump administration's other policies are far more important and beneficial to him than any lies or betrayal related to Syria.
       </li>
       <li>
        Flip his position entirely and say that Trump must have re-evaluated the situation, and since he has more information now, arming the Kurds must be right!
       </li>
       <li>
        Actually examine his own beliefs, admit that he had the wrong impression of Trump's policy, and renounce Trump for continuing the balkanization of Syria.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       My point is: the majority of the people on Reddit who are willing to go out of their way to make outlandish, half-remembered comments on Trump administration policy are usually in too deep to own up to their mistakes. These people absolutely litter this subreddit. The most we can hope for is to shut down the cylce of radicalization. We can show anyone who happens upon these comments and is at risk of being radicalized (typically young men who think that logic is the only way of examining the world) that joining the Trump-cult involves giving up those things that they value most (logic, independence of thought, any semblance of connection between reality and political beliefs). It doesn't matter if those like
       <a href="/u/pm_me_bread_you_made">
        /u/pm_me_bread_you_made
       </a>
       actually change their ways. As long as we call out users like that on their complete and utter bullshit, we can break the cycle. They'll end up stuck alone in their sad little ideological bubble, while the rest of us will be free to actually think rationally, examine evidence, and make ideological decisions independent of false idols.

       Class action law suits against banks are now much more difficult to bring to court.  If a bank screws over a poor person, their ability to get their money back is now impeded.  If I didn't say which side did this, would you say that screwing over the poor to help the rich is a good or bad thing?

       Turkey is on the brink of invading Syria right now, and the US support of the Kurds is a gigantic reason for it. The operation could begin any minute, with some Twitter users saying it already has.

       How? How are there so many comments about Clinton in this thread? She’s irrelevant. Get over it. Clinton being a shithead doesn’t make trump immune from being a shithead in his own right. What is it with trump supporters that think if there’s someone else corrupt in the world then that means trump can do whatever he wants? I just don’t get the level of partisan in here. It’s frightening

       Are you faking serious? So you think trump can be a gigantic conman piece of shit and saying “wahhh but I didn’t like Clinton either” absolves him of anything? That’s the weakest bullshit I’ve ever heard. He’s POTUS. Every POTUS should be held accountable and held to the highest of standards. It’s literally irrelevant how bad anyone else is or was. wow. I wasn’t expecting that as the response. Mind blowing really.

       Why do you suppose I'm supposing everyone in the corrupt system is against Trump?  Where did I say anything that even implies that I think "everyone is against Trump"?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say that he doesn't have
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       people against him.  Of course he does.  He has many against him.  All you have to do is look in this sub and in the MSM in general to understand that much.  Matter of fact, even though I literally do not care about Trump one way or the other, I can honestly, legitimately, and quite objectively say that I have never ever in the history of this country seen a president as maligned and constantly, openly marginalized and made fun of and ridiculed as I see Trump being around almost every corner.  I was just thinking the other day that if this were Russia or China or some other communist-like country and the president were being as openly vilified as Trump's been, motherfuckers' heads would seriously be rolling.  People would likely be getting hung and shot left and right for as much flak as he's been getting.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I - again - am not thinking, nor did I say or imply, that "everyone in the system is against Trump".
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       …
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait a minute.  I’m going to give the benefit of the doubt here and ask the following question:  Did I just misinterpret the sentence you asked?  Maybe I did.  If you weren’t assuming that I thought everyone in the corrupt system is against Trump and you were instead simply asking a legitimate question, then I will say that even though I (again)
       <em>
        don’t
       </em>
       “suppose everyone in the corrupt system is against Trump”, I will say that one reason I think he’s gotten so much utter vilification from the system up to this point might be because A) there was/is a very powerful DNC machine that was pushing hard for Clinton to get in, and they’ve pushed a lot of ill-will toward Trump.  Also, B) there are a LOT of citizens in the 99% that unfortunately unthinkingly swallowed up “Go Hillary!” propaganda that the DNC and the MSM threw out en mass and many of them have now teamed up to further vilify Trump now that he got in and Clinton didn’t.  I'm not defending Trump here, btw.  Again, I don't gaf about him.  I'm just being objective and saying that this seems to be what the case might actually in part be.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah.  I’d say these could be some reasons if you were asking the question legitimately and not assuming that I was assuming that “everyone in the corrupt system is against Trump”.  I certainly don’t want you or anyone to think that I’m thinking that Trump is somehow some poor whipping boy that is undeservedly getting bullied by an “oh so corrupt system”, because I'm not thinking or feeling that.  What I feel is quite a bit more nuanced than that.  The system, of course,
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       very much corrupt.  However, Trump is no less corrupt than every other politician.  They’re all corrupt.  However, it personally seems to me that he most definitely has been a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       more vilified and marginalized than pretty much any other president I've ever seen.

       You're using that term incorrectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a logical fallacy "whataboutism" is calling a the defense of a position hypocritical by attempting to create a
       <em>
        false
       </em>
       equivalency between it and another markedly difference position.
      </p>
      <p>
       All presidential candidates make promises they can't keep to get elected, therefore Trump, Obama, Bill Clinton, GWB and all the rest are equivalent in that sense just as
       <a href="/u/no1113">
        /u/no1113
       </a>
       said.
      </p>
      <p>
       An actual example of "whataboutism" would be something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Redditor A: "Trump is such an asshole! He had an affair with a porn star while his wife was pregnant!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Redditor B: "Oh yeah? What about Hillary Clinton? She spearheaded the disastrous invasion of Libya and laughed about Gaddafi's lynching!"
      </p>
      <p>
       See the difference? On the one hand Trump is a callous adulterer, while on the other Hillary is a warmongering psychopath. The situations are totally not equivalent, so therefore Redditor B is engaging in "whataboutism."

       There's like two people who believe that. This kind of straw man bullshit is why your impotent whining has little to no effect on Trump supporters. You have nothing. Your statements are based on the mainstream narrative around Trump which has already been well and truly dismissed by Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words: You need to try harder. You can't just cry and copy/paste the same old nonsense we've heard a million times. Well, you can, and you'll get a lot of love on Reddit just for being anti-Trump, but again: it has no real effect on people who aren't already on "your team."
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, please point me to where you commented on Obama having a "cult of personality" around him, and how people believed him to be a magical being, and still to this day can find no wrong in anything he did. Oh, sorry, that wasn't part of the mainstream narrative that you're copy/pasting for us here. Please continue. :-)

       I'm not going to make a long list of suggestions here. First of all, I already get downvoted to hell every time I don't go along with the anti-Trump bullshit here, with no counter-arguments from the downvoters of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main suggestion: just be reasonable. Think of some things you like about Trump. If you can't think of anything, you're not a reasonable person and your opinions will be dismissed, so you may as well not even bother.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, think of all the shady bullshit that every president in history has done. You will have to do your own research on this for the most recent ex-president, obviously, because the media is certainly not going to tell you about what he did. All of this talk about "Trump's cult of personality" is hilarious to anyone who was paying attention during Obama's rise to stardom.

       At this point I can only marvel that there exists anyone who opposes President Trump. He has completely revitalized the economy and pulled millions out of poverty. Added trillions giant to the stock market. Record low black and Hispanic unemployment. Isis nearly extinguished. Big tax cut. Illegal immigration plummeting.

       I haven't been able to scour most of these links yet but I appreciate you compiling and sharing this information. I questioned the line 'lifting millions out of poverty' because I don't see any evidence for this - especially since most of these policy changes don't take effect immediately and often are 6-12 months out minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
       These links help me understand some of Trump's economic policies that rarely get exposure; however, I'm not sure the linkage between these policies and the current market improvements is really there.

       many of these regulations, there have only been a handful of ones that are rescinded.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I didn't want to go through each one by one but it felt like I needed to, because I hear everyday that Trump's economics policies improved the economy in the US in 2017, but again, I am still not seeing direct proof. I really appreciate all of the links that were provided, but the evidence seems to show that a lot of policies are TBD in terms of a go-live date, and we cannot attribute much of this economic growth today to future TBD regulations or deregulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get especially triggered with the claim of Trump "lifting millions out of poverty" because there are many places in the US that really need that - but again, proof of that happening is coming up dry.

       Coal industry employs very few people overall. A few businesses giving employees a few hundred dollars one time is not in any way "lifting them out of poverty." You basically just list a bunch of protectionist policies and assume they're actually going to help the average person, which as of now, has not been proven or even suggested.

       Buy American, Hire American executive order : Again, just the issuing of a report - these assessments were due in Sept 2017 and results of this haven't been reported on in terms of procurement changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keystone and Dakota Pipelines : These are in effect, despite the release of over 210,000 gallons of crude this past November. But 170 people were there cleaning it up!
      </p>
      <p>
       executive order that requires all federal agencies to create task forces to look at and determine which regulations hurt the economy - cut red tape : Another report-based policies, there is no word on what these task forces are doing to change the regulatory framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPP : this was a smart move, but even if TPP were moving forward, there's no way that it would have been implemented in 2017
      </p>
      <p>
       Xi Jinping, Donald Trump oversee signing of US$253 billion in trade deals : Sounds great, can't wait to hear about a progress report as these things are moving along, but I don't know how much we can attribute 2017 growth to this. These were signed in Nov 2017 and most of the deals are tentative and Memoranda of Understanding - basically non-binding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Increased tariffs on Canadian lumber by 20% : This is still in dispute with the ITC and some economists predict it could drastically reduce supply in the US in the short-term and the home building/construction industry could be impacted especially in NY/CA.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Resuming trading natural gas and beef with China * : Not implemented yet, and also Imported Cooked Chicken products from China - yum! /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Trading coal and rice to China : Contingent upon inspection procedure approvals, not implemented yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Negotiated new sugar deal with Mexico : This is currently being worked into effect, however industry experts in many articles discuss risks for Food Manufacturing and Candy Industry in US in terms of job losses due to higher costs of sugar. Economic impacts are non-existent as of today.
      </p>
      <p>
       US pork exports going back to Argentina for the first time since 1992 : Not implemented yet. Also, this is just a $10M market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trading energy with new countries in Europe : this is great news, but this is not a Trump or Government policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, 16 regulations have been cut for every 1 added - 800 Obama regulations cut (saved $200+ billion) : OK, let's get real with this one, they are reviewing many of these regulations, there have only been a handful of ones that are rescinded.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I didn't want to go through each one by one but it felt like I needed to, because I hear everyday that Trump's economics policies improved the economy in the US in 2017, but again, I am still not seeing direct proof. I really appreciate all of the links that were provided, but the evidence seems to show that a lot of policies are TBD in terms of a go-live date, and we cannot attribute much of this economic growth today to future TBD regulations or deregulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get especially triggered with the claim of Trump "lifting millions out of poverty" because there are many places in the US that really need that - but again, proof of that happening is coming up dry.

       They'll need to be affected personally by his decisions. The average person isn't aware of the LARP, globalism,  or the Podestas and a lot of the things you mentioned.  There are single issue voters that make up a large portion of his base who always vote Republican. I guess they'd need to lose their government subsidies like insurance or food stamps before they realize the system is set up against them. A surprising number of first time voters turned out and are probably ignorant to the Republican party and the possible reprocussions. They just voted for Trump. Also, first time Republican voters who switched parties bc of the drain the swamp agenda. Lots of variables outside of the online community of supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignorance plays a huge role in why these things are about to happen.

       Economy is doing great, jobs are coming back, illegal immigration is down. If Trump gets rid of DACA then his entire presidency will be worth it. Just wait till Trump builds the wall, that'll save billions from always having to deport illegals crossing the border. Trump isn't perfect but at least he's not completely controlled like Obama and Bush.

       A wall at the southern border is going to keep us locked in? You do realize the wall won't be at the northern border near Canada? Keeping us in would require a wall around the entire country, which doesn't need to happen since most illegal immigration is at the mexico border with the U.S.

       Trump has signed our internet privacy rights away so internet service providers can sell our data and what we search online. He appointed the FCC chair and gutted Net Neutrality. He has gutted the EPA—which was created by a Republican president—and has gutted regulations on pollution and has denied climate change so there goes the environment. His AG is cracking down on state marijuana legalization. The stock market isn't at record numbers because the masses are benefitting—the stock market is booming because the rich sensed blood in the water and are chomping at Trump's (potential) tax cuts and deregulation of Wall Street.  You know, because cutting up the financial regulations and regulations of Wall Street that were put in place to stop another 2008 Great Recession is obviously a grand idea.The stock market is a giant gambling table for the rich, not for you and I. He's creating policy to make it even easier to use nuclear weapons and is practically begging to use nukes on North Korea and invade and supporters cheer him on like sycophants even though he was the same man who said Bush lied us into Iraq and that we are done with invading countries and foreign wars.....riiight. He reauthorized the government mass spying program. $200 billion Saudi arms deal. Blind allegiance and sucking up to Israel. I know I'm forgetting a lot.....
      </p>
      <p>
       What did our parents teach us all as kids? Actions speak louder than words. Look at his actions and not all the hot air about Q and SECRET indictments and "Clintons being locked up any day now!" and the same old tired BS to blind and keep you supporting someone who is fucking you in the ass. Be SMARTER than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Obama did half the stuff Trump's done in his first year all hell would have broken loose and I'm no fan of Obama. The same exact things Trump criticized Obama on he has doubled down on or even has surpassed......how's that golf wing?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is ONE tangible, real thing he has done the last year for the average person? ONE? And don't mention some BS tax breaks. The forgotten man and woman my ass.

       You want nuclear war? Another invasion and quagmire? We don't like Kim and the idea of him having nukes? Okay, and? So are you willing to trade nuclear war and American cities in ashes and millions dead and trillions in $ spent and another quagmire like Iraq and also possibly setoff WW3 because you want to stop Kim from having them? This isn't a game. It's a trade—you break it, you buy it. You own it.

       Someone can launch a nuke but there will be no nuclear war on our side, we have superior air defense. No one could get us with a nuke. The US govt' doesn't make it publicly known that they can stop ICBMs so they can keep you afraid of the ruskies, koreans, and chinese and keep you controlled.

       No matter what advanced ways we come up with to shoot a missile out of the sky the reality is that shooting an object moving at mach 6 is really fucking hard and relies on more than a little luck

       Good points, as you said... action speaks louder then words. He says one thing then does another. I get confused by all the support myself... sure, the executive order for the indictments was a good thing, but most of his other policies so far don't seem very favorable for the general public. People seem to keep praising him tho for stuff that Q been talking about as if he is the leader in this justice effort. I dunno if Q is legit or not, so far seems possible, but I would think that its separate group doing all this and trump is still just a figurehead regardless of whose side he is on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes it a lot harder for me to try and share info bout all this lowkey stuff goin on with my friends too, since if I show a video and they are praising trump it will immediate turn them off or make em think its biased/bullcrap.

       It isn't even remotely relevant.

       The FCC board has 5 members. The President appoints 3 from his own party, and then 2 from the opposing party. In this case, Obama selected his Democrat members, and Ajit Pai was recommended by Mitch McConnell and appointed by Obama.
      </p>

       The only reason he was appointed to chair is because he wrote Trump a letter that was critical of Wheeler's regulation, and Trump was in agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a pretty reasonable thing to include opposing views on a board, and in government, it's common. What is also common is that the President will pick his FCC chair appointment based on what he wants to happen, not based on who was on the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump picked Pai because Trump wanted Pai's agenda in the FCC. Not because Obama put him on the board during his administration.

       I tend to think he was either threatened, or he just caved because he was surrounded by people who are hostile to what he was trying to accomplish.  In the first few weeks of the administration there was a flurry of effort to fulfill campaign promises and implement the changes Trump supporters asked for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the Syria bombing with the ridiculous explanation that Trump decided to bomb Syria because Ivanka cried.  Since then, we haven't seen the focused purposeful Trump that we saw at the very beginning of the administration.  Then Trump started war-mongering against North Korea and Venezuela.

       I disagree, I support many of his policies and promises that he's kept. Like appointing Justice Gorsuch, repealing stupid regulations at a rate of 22:1, lowering taxes, cutting down on illegal immigration. Trump has done a lot of what he said he was going to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now does that mean he doesn't say stupid stuff on Twitter? Of course he does. Does that mean Trump is perfect? Of course not.

        He makes weapon deals with the Saudis. He refused to release his tax returns. He launched missile attacks in Syria. His administration wages a war on marijuana legalization. He supported Jerusalem being named as the capital of Israel.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Saudi's believe it or not are our allies and they do not tolerate terrorists rampaging their country. To this end supporting our ally is fine. I'm not saying we should trust them unquestioningly but part of having allies helping them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Hillary release the Clinton Foundations Tax Returns? No? Then why should Trump? Does it change your view if he does? Look what happened when Romney did it? He got vilified and his taxes were totally above board.

       Jeff Sessions going on a Marijuana crusade I feel is short sighted so I'll give you that.

       Moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem is something we've voted on back in the 90's and we've put it off until now. I agree with this move.

       I look at Trump and see a man with no ethics, no morals, no thoughts, no guts, and no plan. He has a lot of very very stupid meandering and mostly false words, and that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has no goodness or kindness in him, no ability to lead, and no compunction about selling this country to the highest bidder.

       ALLLL these people can be fooled, but not you, right? Doesn't that set off a little alarm bell in your brain that makes you go "Wait a minute..."

       Nothing about this guy lying and lying and lying about his lies over and over again has made you question that the guy miiiiight just be a liar?

       Bro he won the election stop acting like I’m his only supporter haha your just being silly. And yes if I watched cnn I probly would think those things, luckily I have a brain and don’t watch that garbage. You wanna talk about liars btw, cnn is the worst of them all. How many times can one news station retract statements and apologize? Bad business. But anyways I’m gonna go now just make sure you watch the news next couple days. Come back and talk after if you would like

       You didn't answer the question. You're deflecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you think it's weird that (To you, apparently) every time somebody has pointed out that Trump has lied, and shown proof that he lied, those people are lying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow, every news organization save for Fox, most of the free world, a majority of Americans, and a huge chunk of politicians in the States are ALL lying to stop Trump from...doing...what exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a huuuuge conspiracy that involves most of the entire world that's organized specifically to stop this man who has been a paragon of virtue and purity (Again, to you) his entire life and this whole thing has existed even BEFORE he was President!
      </p>
      <p>
       The whoooooole entire world is against Trump, and it's just you and yours that are the last bastion of free thought and moral rectitude against it
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think that's a little strange?

       Aside from the Q bullshit, which I think is less a larp and more a propaganda/distraction/psyop, what you are saying is that Trump is just a regular old Republican.  Fair enough criticism, I find that he refreshingly got the party away from pointless shit like gay marriage and while giving nods to prayer and such, he isn’t trying to grandstand about religion very much.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, that isn’t going to do much harm to him among Republicans...  by your view he accomplished the “party transformation” they have been “attempting” for three elections now.

       I know I'll get downvoted to hell for this, but if it helps us better understand eachother then I think it's worth it. The world is so chaotic right now and we really need to be having honest discussions without shaming each other for having different viewpoints. Attacking each other for having different beliefa rather than talking us actually what drove me away from the left recently. (Thanks SJWs). Anyway, here we go:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At this stage, the only way to support Trump is to fool yourself into believing 4chan LARP stories about how he's
        <em>
         this close
        </em>
        to shutting down the Clinton Cartel™
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree. I don't KNOW 4chan isn't a LARP, but it's easy to hope it isn't. Certainly this hope causes people to forgive some of Trumps actions. We will find this out in time though.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That or their hatred of the left, feminism and social justice warriors is so consuming that they are willing to ignore the fact that he is a conman and support him out of spite.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is partially true. I'm willing to ignore that he's a conman because I hope he's conned his way into the whitehouse to crush conmen that have controlled government forever. 
I don't like business conmen but I hate murderous conmen even more.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It is undeniable that radical feminism and SJW has totally corrupted the left though. I'm actually a liberal which is why I am very agaisnt their attempts to restrict free speech and create tension between the genders as if the racial tension they're creating isn't enough. If these radical groups weren't around then I'd have a much harder time distancing myself from the left.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Q posts a bunch of vague crap that never comes true; making it obvious that he is just some bored anonymous 4chan user that is playing on the fantasies of Trump supporters.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are a handful of things that Q has been strangely accurate about, albeit his vagueness makes it hard to tell if it's intentional or not. Very well could still be a LARP, but props to Q if that's the case. Rather disingenuous to say NOTHING came true though IMO.
       </p>
       <p>
        He makes weapon deals with the Saudis. He refused to release his tax returns. He launched missile attacks in Syria. His administration wages a war on marijuana legalization. He supported Jerusalem being named as the capital of Israel. Bill, Podesta and Hilary are all doing just fine.
       </p>
       <p>
        -Saudis make progressive moves and round up corrupt elites. While I don't like Saudis getting weapons it's unfortunately par for the course, although this time hopefully in slightly better hands.
-Releasing any information will only be picked apart and spun against him, so why bring that on himself? Clean or dirty.
-Idk his strategy behind Syria but bombing a random air strip seems to be for show, which I think is better than actually killing Syrians and getting us into another full blown war. This also assumes it was Trumps idea and not some rogue military move.
-Fuck Sessions and his marijuana policy. Actually thought Trump would be pro-capitalism and legalize this market.
-Idk wtf is up with Jerusalem either. This one is maybe the hardest to rationalize. Pandering to Israel before coming for the Rothschilds and other corrupt jews so their screams of anti-Semitism don't stick perhaps? Or as a way to keep AIPEC out of his way while he fights his other side battles.

        All of this while he plays golf and surrounds himself with the same bankers and globalists that he promised to take on.

       The golf argument is just old and boring. Do people really think they're just talking about golf and not business? On a property owned by Trump where he doesn't have to worry as much about security/espionage.
As for the bankers and globalists, I'd really like if he took a stronger stance against them. This is likely political suicide for him though so I can hardly blame him for not doing this.

       I had this huge fight on my friends Facebook because she genuinely wanted opinion on what offended them over Trump's 'shithole' comments. Few of the comments were pro Trump but nothing nutty, so I commented about people's perception of what a Shithole is, and that it's people aren't necessary shitty people.
      </p>
      <p>
       That just started some kind of all out jumping on my back because I said I wasn't pro Trump. It's like you are cancer if you don't like him. Just don't understand his base, and what they are thinking.

       Is it a coincidence that as soon as Trump won the election all of the Benghazi investigations (21 total) stopped? Trust me, if she became president the Republican House and Senate would be on their third or fourth impeachment hearing. Republicans were already

       I'm saying that if anyone's reason for voting Trump was because the GOP would then pursue Clinton and "lock her up", then they would have been better off voting for Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP doesn't give a shit about bringing Clinton to justice or prosecuting her for any crimes - which is why as soon as she stopped being politically active or relevant and the GOP took power, they abandoned any attempt to "lock 'er up".
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the election there were any number of Congressional investigations into Benghazi, etc.

       Today there are zero.

       This is going to sound harsh and I get where you are coming from but to me a very small percentage of the billions of people we have on this planet are much much less important than the safety and security of the only planet we currently can call home. I know that is harsh and of course I want to help these groups of people you mentioned but they shouldn't be placed above the entirety of the human race and its survival.

       First you are totally misinformed. You state you feel we need to save the planet ASAP. Climate change is a hoax, a larp. You were fooled.

       I can give you reasons if you want to continue along this road. Ok, I'll starts with one. 10 years ago Al Gore predicted the North Pole would lose all it's ice or something like that around this time. What do we see now? Still ice there. HOAX. There's more ....

        Former Vice President Al Gore references computer modeling to suggest that the north polar ice cap may lose virtually all of its ice within the next seven years. “Some of the models suggest that there is a 75 percent chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during some of the summer months, could be completely ice-free within the next five to seven years,” says Gore.

       Okay so a couple points, "some of the models" and "75% chance" suggest that this isn't some bold statement like you are acting like it is, computer models were much less powerful and accurate back then, and Al Gore was one of the first to bring up global warming in the mainstream but that doesn't mean his words are fact nor that he is 'The Scientist' that is solely responsible for our information on global warming. Do you have any actual solid evidence that can legitimately disprove the idea of man made global warming that almost all scientists that study the field currently agree upon?

      <p>
       From the article

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While polls of scientists actively working in the filed of climate science indicate strong general agreement that Earth is warming and human activity is a significant factor, 31,000 scientists say there is "no convincing evidence" that humans can or will cause "catastrophic" heating of the atmosphere.

      </p>
      <p>
       Then do you agree ice caps in the north pole are thickening? Are sea levels not rising?
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being climate change DOES change but no solid evidence of this done by humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you don't know, the magnetic poles are shifting. Why would this not change the climate?
      </p>
      <p>
       MANY MANY examples. THEIR narrative on Climate Change is a HOAX to charge you a carbon tax, to make more money of every human

       Unfortunatelly one of the actual answers to your question is simply that Some men want to watch the world burn. They think anarchy is the best way to achieve order, and electing a huge egotistical fuckhead who claims no one can control is the quickest way to make crazy shit happen. Thats why my Dad supported him.

       Most people don’t vote for president expecting their preferred candidate to be their savior.  They simply vote for the candidate they can best tolerate.  Most Trump voters are not diehard Trump supporters.  Hardly anyone gets “duped” by a presidential candidate to the point of shifting support to the other major party candidate.  I could see people having less enthusiasm for Trump now compared to election night, but I don’t think that many of his voters actually regret their vote and would now prefer Hillary and a Democratic administration.

       Most of them that actually think for themselves already have.  The ones that are left pretty much treat politics like a sports team.  He was their pick for this season(term), and they will support him no matter what until next season.

       I’m saving on taxes now. My healthcare will be cheaper once I can buy overstate lines. I’m not rich. I don’t itemize more than 12,000 at this point, also another win for me.

       Your healthcare is about to skyrocket in cost. The tax scam removed the individual mandate, but kept the clause about not denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Washington State did this exact same thing in 1995. Premiums freakin' skyrocketed in 96 and 97, and by 98, no providers were offering insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what actually happens. Not your fantasy land where setting up hyper complicated relationships with health care systems in multiple regions that all operate independently and separately while simultaneously requiring that they give insurance to sick people without incentivizing healthy people from having insurance will somehow drive DOWN costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your pitiful tax savings are going to get steamrolled by your huge health care cost increase. Yeah, the tax rate is nice if you qualify for the AMT. And all those nonprofits that help people so the government doesn't have to? Yeah, they're scared shitless now that a huge percentage of their givers have less incentive to donate if they're not itemizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what do I know. I'm just someone who does itemize and uses critical thinking and takes historical performance in to account when thinking about future prospects.

       Temporary because it needs support from both sides for that to happen which many republicans have stated they want. Sanders said it himself, great tax breaks, just not permanent. With a little BIPARTISANSHIP that could happen. But if any Dems were interested in that we would not be in a government lapse.

       It appears you're from Ireland, what do you know of American politics? Q anon has dropped many posts that have come true. Even hints as to who he is in the government and not some paid shill sitting at home like yourself. What's wrong with claiming Jerusalem as the capital of Israel when so many past Presidents claimed they would? Are you islamaphobic? Let's not forget who created the war in Syria before you blame the current president for bombing a nation without borders (ISIS). Let's not forget who created ISIS in the first place. Our economy is booming, I'm sorry you've made some bad investments and aren't benefitting from it. So where do you get the cajones to claim he's a fraud? He's created jobs, put money into Americans pockets, annihilated ISIS, brought north Korea and South Korea together, arresting pedophiles across our country, getting rid of dead weight freeloathjng illegal aliens, and actually has a woman standing by his side instead of a pre-op tranny. Sounds all good to me shill.

       Yes, based on the information filled out on a W-4 which requires a social security number. An employer always has to pay taxes on anyone they employ, but that's the employer's tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll ask again in a different frame. When does the employee pay taxes if they have no social security number?

       So our government actively tracks these illegal activities, does nothing about it, and you find this to be a positive thing? What identities are being stolen for these false social security numbers? Would you like it if your identity was stolen so an individual who doesn't belong here can prosper? What if they commit felonies in your name? What if they murder with your social security number and you have to try to explain that to an employer when a background search turns up that's you're a murderer?

       How do they claim $13 billion in tax benefits when all of their provided information is "estimates"?

       No identities are being stolen, they are numbers that are not real Social Security numbers. The money is collected and used as if they were real numbers, meaning the people who were taxed that money (the illegal immigrants) see no benefits from that money. So that's why the SSA calls it a positive, because you are literally bitching about immigrants subsidizing your social security.

       What is your source that no identities are being stolen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say your theory is true. I pay my taxes and the benefit I receive is to be born an American citizen, not to milk the system for more money illegally. That's called fraud. Not only are illegal immigrants taking jobs away from Americans and veterans, but now they are breaking more laws by frauding the system so they can increase their standard of living? We have homeless veterans in America. Some from lack of work. Others from mental health problems and other disabilities. I want my tax dollars to go towards helping individuals who served my country, affording me the freedoms I enjoy every day, as so I don't have to pass them on the street begging for a meal, or a job, or a place to sleep at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly value foreign nationals who want to exploit our system over your fellow countryman? Please express your true feelings so it can be on record for the internet to see. Because yes, I am literally bitching about illegal aliens subsidizing from my tax dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore: Without a working social security number illegal aliens wouldn't be able to obtain a driver's license. No housing unless done under the table and I wouldn't let people who cannot provide evidence of income into a unit I owned. Would you? Without having record of who they are? So when they trash your place you have no recourse because they provided you with false information? Of course you wouldn't, unless you were financially irresponsible and then you wouldn't have rental units. They wouldn't be able to open a bank account. They wouldn't be able to subscribe for television, internet, or cell phones (except Obama phones, surprise surprise). All because these items require a credit background check and if it turns up that there is no record on file, they cannot obtain said items.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: The identities must turn up a record and cannot simply be made up. If you make up a number at random and it turns up another person's identity? That's identity theft.

       If the left, feminism, and social justice warriors would stop trying to destroy society, maybe we could find some middle ground. But so long as the enemy is balls to the wall crazy, well, desperate times call for desperate measures.

       Trump's a good guy. He's legitimately doing the best he can. He's got the right ideas, if only he could put them into practice. We need straight up deportations to start pronto. We need to rid the government of those who've burrowed themselves deep in cliques of wealthy, manipulative, scheming bastards. Trump isn't one of them - it's obvious from how they're using the constant media pressure to attack him - so he was legitimately the best guy for the job this election cycle. If you don't like it, sorry. Deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need the wall. We've needed this economic boost that, yes, his policies are responsible for. Well, that and optimism that the promise of his policies has stirred up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't give two shits about what he's done or who he's got dealings with. It's the people who hate him that are obsessed with the cult of personality, not the other way around. He's their big, loud, bully bogeyman that gives them something to hate. And here I am saying I don't give a damn about his littler personality quirks. Is he going to kick out the illegals? Is he going to continue to stimulate the economy? Is he going to continue playing hardball with the world community that's taken advantage of us for far too long? Is he going to root out the scheming establishment types? If he does even one of those things, his Presidency will be far greater than Obama's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm getting sick of hearing leftists bash him over stupid shit. It's not a fucking soap opera where you pick a side and get all emotionally invested in it. It's real life. It's our real future. It's our damn nation, and it's been dying for 60+ years. And this last election there was only one man who spoke to real Americans. Who said "I'm gonna stick my neck out and fight for you". He didn't have to do this. He's a billionaire. He could have retired on Maui and fucked 10/10 prostitutes til his heart gave out. Instead he put himself out there to be smeared by little, petty people who can't figure out what's actually a good policy and what's tabloid bickering by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's already the best President we've had in 30 years. If this keeps going, he'll be the best President we've had ever.

       You don't get it. You leftists will never get it. The presidency is a joke and has been for decades. It doesn't matter who the president is. If you think someone would be better than DRUMP because they talk nice on TV, you're a moron.

       <a href="https://www.snopes.com/2018/01/09/fusion-gps-fbi-trump-campaign/">

       There was no issue with polling. Hillary won the popular vote exactly as the national polls predicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump won by very slim margins in some very important swing states and it made the difference. Largely due to the last second FBI emails announcement that the polls could not account for.

       It's a myth that Trump supporters were somehow afraid of telling someone on the phone that they support Trump. Trump supporters are loud in their ignorance.

       If someone believes that aliens don't exist, you'd be an idiot to tell them they are "denying reality" just because some people saw a light in the sky.

       What in the world makes you think Trump is taking down the deep state and shadow government (whatever you think that actually is)? What actions has he taken to combat this shadow government?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is filling his cabinet with other billionaires part of that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or forgiving the crimes of the Big Banks?

       How about making deals with the Saudis? or doing Israel's bidding in choosing Jerusalem as the capital?
      </p>
      <p>
       Him yelling on Twitter that he's taking down the "deep state" doesn't mean he's actually doing so. The only "deep state" i think you can argue he's targeted is the US intelligence services, but that's clearly because they are actively investigating him (he even admitted to this.....)

       So you have no problem with corporate donations in the hundreds of millions. Very interesting, as a "Sanders supporter" for you to think that.

       You skipped the part where Clinton is a petty ass twitter-tard just like Trump.

      <p>
       Simple common sense? I've never seen anything that suggests he or Clinton is a racist. Although Clinton thought Sanders was a racist during the primaries... So I guess that makes you a racist for supporting him, right?

       I compared their respective approval rating for their respective political offices. Nice try, though.

      <blockquote>

        Once again the Clinton's are private citizens, and the same can be made for Melania? Why is she still with a person who has been accused of rape and sexual assault?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       She was a senator... you seem to be really trying hard to distract from that. Also, I don't know why Melania stays. Probably the same reason Hillary does- that it's all show, it's all politics. You seem to think this whataboutism will work on me... but it won't. Because I didn't vote for Trump and have never supported him, unlike your unwavering support of corporate golden child Clinton.

       Lol the Trumpies always think they got ya when they spin it on HC/BO. They dont get it, or realise it has nothing to do with anyone except Trump: and his closest admin.

      <p>
       HC/BO being corrupt isnt mutually exclusive to Trump being corrupt.

       Whenever someone is politically blind to one side, I pretty much have to assume they utterly lack any ability to critically think.

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Keystone and Dakota Pipelines

       </strong>
       : Another report-based policies, there is no word on what these task forces are doing to change the regulatory framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TPP
       </strong>
       : this was a smart move, but even if TPP were moving forward, there's no way that it would have been implemented in 2017

      <p>
       <strong>
        Xi Jinping, Donald Trump oversee signing of US$253 billion in trade deals
       </strong>
       : Sounds great, can't wait to hear about a progress report as these things are moving along, but I don't know how much we can attribute 2017 growth to this. These were signed in Nov 2017 and most of the deals are tentative and Memoranda of Understanding - basically non-binding.

        Negotiated new sugar deal with Mexico
       </strong>
       : This is currently being worked into effect, however industry experts in many articles discuss risks for Food Manufacturing and Candy Industry in US  in terms of job losses due to higher costs of sugar. Economic impacts are non-existent as of today.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        US pork exports going back to Argentina for the first time since 1992
       </strong>
       : Not implemented yet. Also, this is just a $10M market.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Trading energy with new countries in Europe
       </strong>
       : this is great news, but this is not a Trump or Government policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So far, 16 regulations have been cut for every 1 added - 800 Obama regulations cut (saved $200+ billion)

       <em>
        reviewing
       </em>
       many of these regulations, there have only been a handful of ones that are rescinded.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I didn't want to go through each one by one but it felt like I needed to, because I hear everyday that Trump's economics policies improved the economy in the US in 2017, but again, I am still not seeing direct proof. I really appreciate all of the links that were provided, but the evidence seems to show that a lot of policies are TBD in terms of a go-live date, and we cannot attribute much of this economic growth today to future TBD regulations or deregulations.

       I get especially triggered with the claim of Trump "lifting millions out of poverty" because there are many places in the US that really need that - but again, proof of that happening is coming up dry.

       Yeah.  I did that because I was CORRECTING the op statement.  I was correcting the fact that op singled Trump out in exclusion to all other presidents.  My correction was within the context of Trump being the only person op mentioned when pretty much
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       president ever is guilty of the same thing - so Trump was the only person I referred to in my own statement even though, as
       <a href="/u/frankenfish2000">
        /u/frankenfish2000

       mentioned, Trump is most definitely not the only one guilty of being a state shill.

       <p>
        "in my experience"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       let me tell you my thoughts about your experience...
      </p>
      <p>
       in my experience, it is better to remain silent and allow the other person to talk, so that you can learn what kind of person they are, without revealing what kind of person you are
      </p>
      <p>
       if you are the first to speak, you will probably signal to the listener(s) that you are a left-leaning person
      </p>
      <p>
       and the right-leaning listener will sit there silently, politely listening to your virtue signaling
      </p>
      <p>
       and so therefore you, the speaker assume the listener is like-minded, and also left-leaning, because the listener doesn't challenge anything you say, and only gives vague feedback that signals they are listening like OKs, yups, un-huhs and amens at the appropriate times
      </p>
      <p>
       so what happens is that you surround yourself with a bubble of people who you assume are like minded lefties, but in fact they are a mixed bag
      </p>
      <p>
       and when these people go into a voting booth, they might not vote the way you expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       by behaving the way i do, by letting the other person talk first, i pretty much allow everyone to assume that i am just like them, and consequently they open up and tell me all kinds of stuff that they would be reluctant to tell other people
      </p>
      <p>
       this may seem like creepy behavior, but i sincerely do want to hear peoples opinions and thoughts or troubles etc and i sincerely try to empathize with their situation, to walk in their shoes, in my mind. i value peoples opinions, and am sincerely curious about how those opinions are formed
      </p>
      <p>
       i can say that what sounds "crazy" coming out of someones mouth, often has a logical explanation, if you allow them to explain themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       i can say that i have never met a "crazy" person.
      </p>
      <p>
       i have only met good people who are living in a crazy world.
      </p>
      <p>
       dont judge a book by the cover. a lot of people don't "look" like a stereotypical conservative... like that guy in the mosh pit
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump didn't win because Russians hacked the electoral college
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump won because HRC was a terrible candidate who alienated the lefty base with her shenanigans against Sanders
      </p>
      <p>
       that and PizzaGate threatened to bring the whole thing down, and so the deep state threw HRC under the bus.

       I'm saying that if anyone's reason for voting Trump was because the GOP would then pursue Clinton and "lock her up", then they would have been better off voting for Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP doesn't give a shit about bringing Clinton to justice or prosecuting her for any crimes - which is why as soon as she stopped being politically active or relevant and the GOP took power, they abandoned any attempt to "lock 'er up".

       You asked for evidence that the Trump administration is arming the Kurds. I just gave you two well-sourced articles describing a Trump administration plan to arm and train 30,000 Kurdish forces to patrol Syria's borders and Turkey's outrage about Trump going back on that one-off statement he made back in November. You know, the statement that is your sole piece of evidence for your assertion that Trump isn't arming the Kurds any more. So explain to me how those articles aren't about what I think they're about.

       the president doesn't have complete control over the economy. most of the time, he acts as a cheerleader. however, there are a number a things trump and obama have done to affect the economy.

       although trump's "cheerleading" regarding jobs has actually brought jobs into the country. i don't believe he can be personally credited. you could argue his sabre rattling, especially with mexico and nafta, has caused a number of corporations to invest billions in american factories, creating jobs. the stock market is performing well, and although i would attribute it to trump, i wouldn't say it was because of his actions. wall street exploded on a bull run the second he got elected. obama has nothing to do with it. the bull run was likely caused by wall streets anticipation of deregulation.

       there are a few things i definitely give trump credit for. his criticism and implosion of the TPP. I don't think this has affected the economy yet, however those world trade deals only benefit international billionaires, and slowly kill the middle class over decades of time. another thing would be the recent tax cuts. there is a provision in the law designed to take dollars kept out of country and tax them, in theory it should bring US dollars back to the US from around the world. i know reddit likes to circle jerk over the "corporate cuts" being evil, but theyre not. most corporations, especially the ones i work with, are small closely held family businesses making $50-100k annually. these cuts are huge for the middle class.

       the obama economy under performed in terms of jobs and GDP growth, but i couldn't necessarily blame him. he came into office right around the time of the housing market bubble bursting. that can understandably fuck up the economy for years. i can give obama credit for some things though. the "stimulus package" that came out around the time of the 2008 recession dumped a lot of money into the economy, essentially putting a floor on the amount of damage the housing market would cause.
      </p>

       i believe the economy will eventually collapse. like ron paul recently said: it's an illusion. the tax cuts will keep the party going for a little while longer, but everything must come to an end.

       That's such a silly metric. More uneducated richer people voted Trump than uneducated poor.
