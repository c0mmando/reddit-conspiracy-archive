    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was a good philosopher and he said some real good shit. The &quot;golden rule&quot; is essentially at the core of many branches of our modern understanding of ethics. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re getting downvoted for suggesting he has some kind of magical power and that the best thing to do is sit back and wish for magic. Hoping for magical salvation is stupid. You&#39;re not even saying &quot;do good deeds to be saved&quot;, you&#39;re telling us to just hope for magical salvation. Even if we wholly accept the premise that Jesus of Nazareth was literally a deity, you&#39;d do better to follow his good example rather than sit back and wish that he&#39;ll magically help you. You&#39;d do better to tell us to follow his good example than suggest we just sit back and hope for supernatural shit to magically solve our problems. </p>

<p>And furthermore, the churches that claim to represent him are often just as bad or worse than the government. They routinely actively oppose the good morality he actually preached when he was alive and churches actually serve as a propaganda arm that helps ensure evil remains in power in government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had lost my faith until I learned that the elites worship Satan and evil is real. The church is also satanic. So people have a skewed vision of the religion and therefore God. You have to learn to separate the two. So much of the bible has started making sense to me. Satan’s deception has been to corrupt religion so intelligent people see it for the fraud that it is, but instead of losing faith in religion(as they should), they lose faith in God. You sound like a good person. Maybe you’ll come to the same realization one day but if not at least I believe you won’t be on the wrong side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know people fought to vote in the past. But our history is riddled with all kinds of proof that the elite and politicians have been together from the start. The only thing that caused any things in the past were stuff that is tightly controlled and regulated now.<br/>
If we vote, does it really matter? Because if our options are only candidates that are a part of the system that doesn&#39;t give a fuck about equality.<br/>
Then what is voting really good for? Throughout America&#39;s history ton&#39;s of movements and deaths have happened to allow people to break the chains of slavery, only to have them reattached in a different way. That different way is how we are under control now.<br/>
See them veterans who helped fight for your &quot;freedom&quot; on the side of the road?<br/>
What about Universal healthcare? That doesn&#39;t matter, every corner you turn is a McDonalds. Jobs are vanishing for automation, meaning that even if you did have free healthcare, what are the odds that you can afford to eat in the future when a robot takes your job?<br/>
The only way voting matters is if it can be made into profit for the system. If the elite and their army of think tanks and lawyers can think of a way to twist words into a bill to make what you want to their benefit, then maybe it will happen.<br/>
The question becomes, what do you want in life? Do you want to take care of yourself or your brothers and sisters on the globe? 
Once you answer those questions, does voting for any specific politician help do anything except bring more war, and more division amongst us? 
That&#39;s all I see. 
Not voting in itself is a form of rebellion against this plague of a system where we are spreading the idea of Americanism across the globe.<br/>
Can you convince me otherwise that my vote matters?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you change a system that is corrupt from the inside?
Lets say that I run, and I get voted in (for some reason).<br/>
If I ran on a platform of equality and fairness for all, how would the elite and their political puppets take that? Especially if I won the vote.<br/>
Well in their power lays the ability to decide my future. Since I want equality for all I think that if someone born anywhere on the globe should have an equal chance at a fair life as someone born anywhere else. This applies to Palestine. Which would mean I would have to go against the ideals of Israel, and say I don&#39;t support them. Anti-Semite is probably a label that would get tossed around while the media twists words I&#39;ve said.<br/>
Now not supporting Israel would be my first mistake. Because that is used as a sort of barrier in American politics. If you support them, then you support inequality and you support the idea that some humans should always be of higher class and wealth than others. The system won&#39;t change.<br/>
Personally, I think the only way to change the system as it is now, is with the use of the internet. But the government is trying it&#39;s best to get a stranglehold on it.<br/>
In essence, we are more powerful together than they are, but that&#39;s why they have to keep us divided.<br/>
Back to me being a candidate myself, lets pretend I play ball and I say I support Israel, and I take my time perfectly planning my political moves and eventually can run for president. What happens next is once I decide I want to run for president, I have to go behind the scenes and show somehow all of my loyalties to the system. Let&#39;s pretend I do just that and I pass, I get the green light to be a candidate and get tons of air time on the MSM and all of my ideas that I run on for presidency are portrayed in a way that the masses soak up. I get voted as president.<br/>
Well, now I&#39;m the big man, I have to take my directions and work hand in hand with big business, while trying to appear to appeal to the masses. Profits come first, war and keeping the economy afloat so the system is a top priority.<br/>
But I&#39;ve lied the whole time, I really just care about the common man, I care about equality, I know, ill expose the system on air and see how that goes.<br/>
Impeachment, now I&#39;m not doing what the elites wanted me to be president for, I&#39;m doing something counter productive to what they wanted.<br/>
Do you think I would stay alive long? What about stay president? How long until a narrative that is concocted from nothing is being  pushed into the mainstream media narrative for the masses to consume?  </p>

<p>Sorry, I don&#39;t personally think change from this system will come from the inside, it&#39;s all too interconnected. Maybe i&#39;m speculating way to much, maybe not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are trying to tackle the biggest problems from the start. That&#39;s not how progress works. You have to start small, at a local level. There are real politicians out there not playing &quot;the game&quot;. They get cheated and sometimes killed, but they are out there. The problem is they are outnumbered to actually do anything. They need more people to run and make it with them.</p>

<p>The system is fucked, but that&#39;s because we allow it to be fucked. We watch as scumbags run for office, win and proceed to use laws to enrich themselves and their friends with our money. Then sit here and bitch about the system being fucked while we do nothing about it. Not voting isn&#39;t going to fix the system. Only thing that will is for us to actually care enough to actually try and take over it. It&#39;s a giant task, but if you actually want to change it. You have to try. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the best things I&#39;ve ever seen posted here when it comes to voting. My sister had that epiphany recently and decided to run for a minor city office to get her foot in the door. She lost by 170 votes out of about a 1000 total votes but is going to take what she learned and try again. I&#39;m super proud of her.</p>

<p>That last bit about the vote total is another reason why you should still vote, too. When people talk about how voting is useless, they always seem to be talking about national level stuff. School board, city council and other positions like auditor and tax collector probably affect you more directly than any national election and the vote counts are so low that your vote CAN make a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A perfectly valid argument, thanks.<br/>
I agree change has to start from somewhere.<br/>
However, it seems to me to be an insurmountable task, especially from within.<br/>
Maybe I speak from a place of ignorance or fear. Or I just see history repeating itself as usual with the rich as the victors.<br/>
Change is a constant, it always happens all the time around us. Maybe there is a certain set of steps humanity can take to reclaim unity and equality. It&#39;s just not apparent to me is all. Maybe I need to learn more and see if there isn&#39;t some opposing force that already exists and research it (a secret society).<br/>
We know the rich conspire to stay in control, but is there other people whom are similar that don&#39;t care to have such power?<br/>
Anyways, thanks for listening to me vent a little. Have a good day.</p>

<p>I guess the reason I do is because that&#39;s what they paint themselves as. &quot;Pragmatic&quot; they say, and we can;t forget Bill Clinton&#39;s &quot;triangulation&quot; strategy.

<p>That is not the case, at least in America.  In America, a centrist is merely someone who is ideologically between where the Overton window of &quot;acceptable&quot; political discourse is at any given time.  Communism isn&#39;t acceptable to advocate for if you want to be taken seriously in America, though libertarianism is acceptable.  </p>

<p>The far left side of the Overton window is people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who are basically social Democrats.  The right side of acceptable political discourse are libertarians (Koch Bros) and nationalists like Trump and Sessions. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why neoliberals and neoconservatives are seen as the centrists in America.</p>

<p>Cause the solution to those problems is to first get rid of first past the post, then enact campaign finance reform.</p>

<p>To do that, you need to push some legislation through, and the dems and repubs don&#39;t want that. So it&#39;s a catch-22 where you can&#39;t pass legislation favorable to 3rd parties cause you need a 3rd party to do that.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Fake News&quot; is a disinfo term that was used to discredit alternative media by denegrating any non-official story. Think of what scandals were being broken on this sub when that term came about. A nerve was hit.</p>

<p>It irks me that people use that term now as if it&#39;s legitmate. It shows how easily people are controlled. And Trump is so easily manipulated, I bet someone whispered it in his ear and he thought it was his idea.</p>

<p>But the mainstream media love the term because they can discredit any &quot;unoffocial&quot; source indiscriminately.</p>

<p>There have always been manufactured media reports, for nearly as long as there&#39;s been media. Go back to the turn of the century, unionization/anti-unionization, race issues, suffrage, temperance... You&#39;ll find establishment and anti-establishment media telling outright lies for their cause.</p>

<p>So you have to ask yourself why. Why after all that history does the term come to bloom now? It&#39;s not organic. If comes from the mouths of the media machine, you can never assume it&#39;s organic. These sound bytes are engineered, and it&#39;s at our own peril.</p>

<p>How do wingless missiles generate lift?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t. It has been explained to you, exhaustively, a vast multitude of times, by many people, that lift is not how a missile flies. And yet you always reset back to this question, which intentionally encodes a misunderstanding of how missiles work. You are intellectually dishonest. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>how can they fly horizontally</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In exactly the same way that I have explained it to you before.</p>

<p>Control fins create drag, which causes the nose of the rocket to tilt up.</p>

<p>This the drag-induced rotation of the rocket&#39;s thrust vector away from perpendicular with respect to gravity introduces a vertical component to your thrust vector.</p>

<p>It is this y-component in the thrust vector that overcomes the force of gravity and obviates the need for lift. No need to generate lift because the rocket motor is literally pushing you up.</p>

<p>All missiles capable of horizontal flight achieve this through active control surfaces and a high thrust-to-weight ratio. This allows a small amount of the power from the rocket engine(the y-component of the thrust vector) to be used to cancel acceleration due to gravity, while the rest of the power(the x-component of the thrust vector) is used to accelerate the missile to target.  </p>

<p>Flight is kept level by internal computers that monitor accelerometers, gyroscopes, and any other relevant sensors and constantly adjust the servos controlling the flight surfaces.</p>

<p>None of this technology is exotic, civilian versions of most of the components are in your smartphone, and nothing more than a high-school understanding of physics is needed to comprehend the underlying principles. </p>

<p>No, we have been correcting your strawman.</p>

<p>You want to argue against an incorrect model of missile flight that no one else is advocating for. That is textbook attacking a strawman.</p>

Are we really supposed to just shut down kids that are seeking answers? Perhaps if theorists gave a shit about anything but the present and themselves they would be happy to see teens expanding their minds and worldview. The biggest cover up is covering up the impact we can have on the current generation of kids, and the impact they can have on the US and the world. Most people here would rather sit comfortable behind a screen and feel powerless to the elites, than go out and make the country better for the future adults. </p>

<p>See has has a website where the content costs $20 per month. This video like his other videos are convoluted crap but usually direct you to his site where full membership cost $20. He makes fun of anyone who disagrees with him as normies or conspiritards... he has videos making fun of &quot;conspiritards&quot;... aka people on this sub. </p>

<p>He comes to this sub to get you to sign up for his site. Aka a... well we all know what that is. </p>

<p>And he uses the same language as people selling diet pills or self help programs... that he will blow your mind, that people don&#39;t want you to know his secrets, that you will question everything but to get it you just have to pay him more than you would for premium cable channels or newspapers... or you could save up for xbox. John thinks his content is worth about the same per year as a brand new xbox...</p>

<p>He posted one video that is just easily disprovable and then when he got called out on it made another video where he pretended to retract his first video, then doubled down and decided it best he stay behind his pay wall. </p>

<p>So if you watch his videos and can&#39;t figure out what he stands for, or how it makes sense, or what he is prattling on about, he just wants $5 per week, for nice $280 on the year (he charges weekly, not monthly)... not sure if $AUS or $US... John you can chime in anytime...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, you aren&#39;t the NYT or WSJ. It is frowned upon when sites post their own content though.... reddit is meant to be user driven. People post their own content in certain subs, but usually this is not monetized... or at least not behind a paywall.  </p>

<p>You tried to post your own videos as direct posts but that didn&#39;t work, very few got upvotes even in this sub. Then you tried to link in the comments... that is where I found you shilling you own product. </p>

<p>Also even the MSM papers offer free content up to x many articles per month... not some vague basically infomercials for your vlog like you do.  </p>

<p>You personally profit from these videos and do so disrespecting the dead. Whatever you think of the WSJ and the NYT their reporters make a good faith effort to report what they see and not to shit on people&#39;s tragedies. </p>

<p>They are far from perfect. But you cynically post your own content to try to make money. It would the same if you were posting adds for some home made erectile dysfunction herbal mix you came up in your basement. </p>

<p>Also, I can&#39;t even tell what you believe have the time, you purposefully, leave it vague to get as many people to sign up as possible. </p>

<p>You are arrogant, disrespectful, callous, aggressive and a conman. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And when you pray, <strong>do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others</strong>. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.  But <strong>when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray</strong> to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a damned shame so many so-called &quot;Christians&quot; today ignore and abhor every word spoken by Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus said you and Trump are hypocrites.</p>

<p>There are 2 forms of prayer, personal ala Matthew 6:5-6 and group prayer or praying out loud with others in a group which does not infringe on the above verse.</p>

<p>If you are calling my a hypocrite, I dont care and I dont view you as anyone to judge me. God, if he exists, knows my heart and that it is ultimately good</p>

<p>The difference is, as an ex-leftie, is that the left has literraly gone insane with antifa, blm, anti-white, sjw, safespace, bathrooms, 56 genders, virtue signaling, anti-free speech, screeching, communist, just the whole movement went from something that was once about humanitarianism, equality, rights, etc to sheer and utter marxist batshit insanity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Donald 2.0?</p>

<p>But yeah, Trump is a straw man for corruption. Maybe he was only supposed to serve in that roll through the election cycle, but here we are. As it is he may have the effect in 3 more years that he was intended to have if he&#39;d lost. That we&#39;ll all sing &quot;ding dong the witch is dead&quot; and give a blank check to the next establishment democrat who sells us out to the war machine while balancing the budget, versus the Republicans who sell us out to the war machine while pandering to religion.</p>

<p>All of a sudden it&#39;s cool to be a conspiracy theorist... as long as you believe the conspiracy is Trump&#39;s Russia ties. And it&#39;s the only conspiracy! Would you look at that... this crooked outsider doing dirty treasonous deals.</p>

<p>The only reason he&#39;s getting fried is because he was stupid enough not to find friends in the bipartisan oligarchy to cover for him. This is of course amplified by his incredible hubris and atypically aggressive selling out of our people.</p>

<p>You&#39;re supposed to turn up the heat slow. He&#39;s turning it up too fast, and the frogs are starting to jump. Once we get rid of him, we won&#39;t be out of the kitchen. The new cook will just turn it up slow, buisness as usual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell me if Trump is bad then why are human traffickers being arrested in droves? A huge increase since Obama? Why is the economy improving? Why is every elite scared of him? I&#39;m sorry but there is no reason Trump would be a shill. If he&#39;s planted by the elites this is the most convoluted plan possible. Trump at the very least caused the culture to shift away from identity politics and PC culture, at the very least he saved the US from becoming a socialist shit hole. So why does it seem everyone here believes him to be awful?</p>

Why is it so inconceivable to you that others might have boarded the same train of thought as yourself? The MSM&#39;s apparent hate for Trump is simply a classic example of reverse psychology. Don&#39;t you think that he adheres a bit too closely to TPTB&#39;s wishes for a supposed outsider? Sure, he spreads some populist bullshit like a wall that&#39;s never going to manifest every now and then, but stuff like provoking unrest in the Middle-East, deregulating the banking sector, further expanding the recognition of and support for Israel and waging a war of words with NK to scare the populace into submission is one hundred percent cabal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be honest here: how many people do you know who still have a genuine faith in politics? Trump was specifically marketed to appeal to those who have been disenfranchised by globalisation; former miners and factory workers who saw their employers relocate to Whereveristan and are now unemployed, familymen who saw their town die out when the plant closed, etc. The kind of people who have been fucked over by the gubmint more times than they can count and have lost all trust in the system. A candidate that is supported by the mainstream news only arouses suspicion with then, so this time TPTB tried the opposite, just in case Clinton didn&#39;t make it. It worked like a charm.</p>

<p>I once again ask of you: how do you unite Trump&#39;s status as a crusader of the common  man with his policy, which makes the rich richer, the poor poorer and destroys the middle class? How do you explain the defender of the people enabling the banks to screw us over even more. I expect an actual answer this time instead of a repeat of the same argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah, &#39;no such thing as bad press.&#39;</p>

<p>If the general public believes he&#39;s a political outsider (most individuals I talk to believe so despite his political lobbying, anecdotal) and the MSM is talking shit about him, who would one trust? People in general don&#39;t like news sources that don&#39;t confirm to their beliefs, so when one labels the MSM as &#39;fake news&#39; it creates a divide, strengthening the tribalism expressed between parties. The MSM then responds with negative allegations (true or not is irrelevant) giving further credence to the &#39;fake news&#39; argument for those inclined to trust Trump. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my understanding of how he gained support through negative press. Just furthering the divide between the people, to goad them into a non-partisan illusion. YMMV</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s also true that the oligarchs are lining up behind Trump now.  Look at Lindsay Graham.  That dude is totally bought and paid for by the establishment, and though he said some nasty things about Trump, publicly, he&#39;s completely changed his tune ... once the tax cut got through.  Hmmm.  The establishment left, including Nancy Pelosi, just voted to help expand domestic surveillance powers.  </p>

<p>Trump was pissed that establishment figures would take his money, take his donations, but never really wanted him in their club.  So, he forced his way in.  Everything he&#39;s done economically has helped the oligarchs -- tax cuts, marijuana crackdown, de-regulation, talking big but zero actual movement on trade, increased military spending.</p>

<p>And because his social policies are so ass backwards, he&#39;s made the left so scared shitless that they will gladly run into the arms of any establishment hack (like Kamala Harris) that dares to run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They used to be able to dictate who becomes president. They weren&#39;t able this election. Yes, that is a loss of power. I agree Trump is basically toeing the line and not actively challenging the oligarchs or &quot;draining the swamp&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Diehard supporters, sure, but I don&#39;t think it is strange to still consider Trump a better choice than Hillary, many people claimed Trump would start concentration camps for LGBT and Muslims, work for the Russians against American interests, crash the economy and start WW3, all of that was lies and it certainly set the standard for expectations. If you thought that would happen you would be irrational if you didn&#39;t like him more now than when you believed that. This election it was not true that it didn&#39;t matter who won and both candidates were the same puppets who would do the same - which is why conspiracy theorists didn&#39;t act that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you vote based on what &quot;many people&quot; claim or based on your own evaluation of a candidate&#39;s words and record?  I personally felt both candidates had huge dealbreakers for me and had to analyze number of dealbreakers and what dealbreakers were more important to me.  Being a lefty, in the final analysis, I came up Hillary, but it wasn&#39;t easy for me, and I totally and completely understand why people, even other lefties, did their own calculations and came up Trump.  I get it.  I do.  </p>

<p>However, had Hillary won, eventhough I voted for her, I would be totally jumping her shit right now for every pro-establishment, pro-plutocracy, move she&#39;d be making now.  I&#39;d be on her ass from Day One.  I don&#39;t see that on the part of people who voted Trump when Trump makes those types of moves.  It seems like they feel invested in him and are unwilling to admit a loss, and cut ties, like they&#39;re so happy that the threat of Clinton is behind us, that they&#39;re unwilling to look at the danger of Trump.  Hell, they&#39;re even willing to excuse the establishment of the at-large Republican Party as a whole doing establishment things, so long as they are deferential to Trump.</p>

<p>I was speaking about the electoral population, not me personally. I never believed any of that MSM propaganda in the first place. </p>

<p>I very much agree with the rest of your comment! And I recognize that there are many blind Trump supporters, although I would add that there are many blind Hillary supporters as well, many who swallowed the MSM lies and propaganda bait hook and sink, which is why I listed a few of them up. The big problem is the two party system created by the first past the post voting system. This polarizes our politics immensely, we should have 10 candidates to choose from for our highest office, not 2. The judicial branch has even said private parties may legally rig their own elections! Since the private parties are baught and paid for, oligarchs decide our candidates. I personally believe pretty much every republican candidate except Rand Paul and Trump were oligarchs&#39; picks. Now, that absolutely does not mean that he is infallible or shouldn&#39;t be criticised! It just makes him a regular politician from an actual democracy! But from what I have seen so far I find it hard to believe Hillary would be better, a clear, undisputable Soros/Rothschild puppet who rigged the election from Bernie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always go back to the fact that it was Roger Stone who convinced him to run in the first place.  His entire campaign was very much made of insider political operatives.  While the message may have been antiestablishment I think his policies and the people behind him are the epitome of the establishment.  Furthermore, when Trump won there was a slight downturn in the market that immediately recovered and hasn&#39;t looked back.  To me, that&#39;s the establishment confirming that Trump&#39;s policies would serve the upper class exclusively.  </p>

<p>This is what they&#39;re desperately trying to distract us from with these manufactured conspiracies.

    <div class="md"><p>I have never disagreed with this and I don’t now.  However, by logic one can surmise that some strategies to benefit the rich are worse for the poor than others.  At the moment, Trump’s strategy <em>is better</em> for the poor than Obama’s was or Hillary’s would have been.</p>

<p>That is one of the obvious lies about the economic boom under Trump.  “It only benefits the rich” and so on.  How does one manage to twist their mind into believing that something which improves conditions for some, even if not all, <em>is worse</em> than something that benefits <em>none</em>?</p>

<p>Essentially the options were:  Democrats want you to be poor, but they will give you just enough benefits to make people fully dependent upon the government and lull them into forgetting freedom entirely as it disappears.  Republicans want you to be poor but still work and think you can make it up, they will cut all benefits and eventually leave you totally on your own whilst making you believe it was all your own fault and that no one is entitled to help from the government.</p>

<p>Neither is <em>good</em> but of the two, one at least does not seek to destroy the <em>idea of freedom</em> or <em>value of work and self-determination</em>.  They may rig the game against you, but they don’t force you to surrender free will.  If society ever does collapse into revolt, I would rather be among people who were under Republican ideology when it did than Democrat for there would still be hope of building a good society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!  You really don&#39;t deserve downvotes for this, because you&#39;re right.  And it took me till the last election to realize exactly how terrible the democrats in particular were for the working class.  And if the people were actually in charge, our economy would look very, very different than it does today.  But, as a nation, we&#39;ve gone so off the deep end of our partisan pools, that we can&#39;t even sit down long enough to talk to each other and realize that, most of the time, we 100% agree on what the problems with the country are.  The issues we run into are what we believe the solutions to the problems are.  And this is where the MSM comes in to drive us further apart, by not just arguing against a point, but by making the other side Satan Incarnate.  The truth of the matter is, that when it comes to the economy, neither big political party is going to come up with a theory that helps the country, because both sides are protecting their own interests, which happens to coincide with protecting the interests of the donor class.  Both sides hate the donors - the democrats hate the koch brothers and mercers for their environmental and social policies, and the republicans hate people like george soros because of their economic and social policies.  But at the end of the day, both sides agree that we shouldn&#39;t have rich people buying off politicians.  If we weren&#39;t so distracted by the demonization, we could come together to start fixing the underlying problems that are hurting everyone, but we can&#39;t even talk to each other anymore.  </p>

<p>As one example that I see can attract bipartisan support, I saw an interview with one author or economist, who&#39;s name I can&#39;t remember right now, where he was calling for replacing our current corporate ownership model with an employee ownership model.  All the employees collectively own the company, all of the employees share in the profits of that company, and all of the employees are responsible for voting on things like wages, leadership, expansions, etc.  And, in order to encourage this, pass a law that states if a company in the US wants to offshore, they have to give a vote and a bid to the employees on whether they want to take it over as an employee-owned company first, and set up a loan system to allow the employees to actually buy out the company.  Then their efforts are properly rewarded, their work can be properly compensated, and they have control over their own work place.  Now, show me someone who isn&#39;t a bought politician or a member of the donor class who dislikes this idea.  Does it need refining?  Sure.  But we&#39;ve already seen it work in this very country, in places like CostCo.  </p>

<p>But this will actually help people, regardless of their political affiliation, so you don&#39;t see the media or government even mentioning it.  </p>

<p>Anyway, this is a super long agreement with you, but it is an agreement.  I just wish that more people would start waking up to what&#39;s really happening to them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of it has to do with that sub not yet reaching a certain Critical mass. </p>

<p>I think internet forums (subreddits, what have you) operate on a principle similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar&#39;s number</a>, which roughly says humans can only form meaningful relationships with about 150 people. You can still have stable communities past that point, and even stable online groups, but too much past that point, it loses any sense of community. You&#39;re not interacting with other humans whom to some extent you know a few things about; you&#39;re talking to completely faceless avatars, whose ideas you end up interpreting more through your own lens of whatever group you&#39;ve mentally assigned for that user (Trump-supporter, leftist, &quot;normie&quot;, etc.)</p>

<p>That other sub still works to an extent because enough of the people there know each other, at least as far as you can know anyone on a pseudo-anonymous platform. The group forms a shared history and an understanding of the others as individuals and not merely as labels or positions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It <em>is</em> possible to be non-partisan but still have an opinion or preference on politics.  Independent or non-partisan does not mean “I don’t care one way or the other” it simply means you base your opinions on your own judgements as opposed to party lines.</p>

<p>I don’t hide the fact that I support Trump, or that most of my opinions are more conservative than liberal, but I vote and support based on judgement not politics (this forced me to vote <em>for</em> Obama last time because Romney was such a piece of shit, they both serve the same masters but Romney literally made his fortune sending American jobs over seas and fucking over pensions of workers.  Even if they are both globalist scum, we are still entitled to dislike the person).   The uniparty establishment’s reaction to Trump was not a great farce, but the hopes to bring him around were and are true as well.  At worst, he is simply a typical uniparty conservative with a cocky attitude and a great sense of irony.  The other option was a <em>guaranteed</em> uniparty globalist.  As such, even if Trump is also one, at least he is one with a nationalistic bent and is more effectively working in America’s interest than previous administrations.  He <em>is</em> causing power shifts and changes around the world, what comes of it?  But, I will always choose the unknown with slight improvements over a clear March into slavery.</p>

<p>I more posted the article for this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Certain conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones cry out for the Republicanism of the founding fathers of the American constitution - intended to safeguard the individual rights of citizens from ever intrusive Government legislation. This is an obvious parallel with Liberalism and Anarchism yet not attributed as one due to the predisposed schema that Liberalism is a conspiratorial design. Then we have the utopian future of a collective society void of greed and ego to better mankind and society against the tide of corporatism and the concentration of power in Government as advocated by David Icke. This is an obvious appeal, whether subconscious or not, to Anarcho-Communism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago I coined the phrase</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its not Red versus Blue, its Purple versus People.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I still feel that way,  I support Trump because the establishment from both sides DIDN&#39;T want him.  Its the bipartisan establishment that is purple.  The power gobblers and dynastic families pushing people thru secret societies into the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the media, Local and State governments and finally to the Federal Govt.</p>

<p>I absolutely love that Trump is a loud mouth who doesn&#39;t play well with others, I love that his approval rating with the media is like 5%.  Look at all the fun he is causing! Jeb Bush was reduced to a fucking meme of a low energy dildo and Hillary Clinton was embarrassed internationally by losing to the candidate being painted as a ridiculous clown.</p>

<p>I fucking love it!  I love that he is appointing people into govt agencies have historically wanted to shut those agencies down.  And before anyone posts a laundry list of campaign promises that haven&#39;t been fulfilled yet... I don&#39;t fucking care! its been one year and the entire establishment is hell bent on stopping him from doing it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about anyone&#39;s feelings or how much blood is leaking from their loving heart.  The establishment can&#39;t keep the curtains up with Trump&#39;s (orange cheeto monster) loud mouth running 24/7.  Its fucking hilarious.  Build a fucking wall, lets see what happens.  Its better than doing nothing at all for another 4-8 years and listening to the chosen ones continually argue about what the answer to illegal immigration is.  Cut the fucking corporate taxes! lets see what happens instead of slowly watching our infrastructure crumble away while the chosen ones argue endlessly about what the solution is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of the &quot;chosen ones&quot; coming thru the usual channels being force fed to us year after year.  I swear to god there is a politician factory somewhere pooping these fuckers out like Ace Ventura slithering out of a robot rino&#39;s asshole.  They plop down onto the scene with just a brush of grey at their sideburns and the perfectly rehearsed politically correct yammering where they NEVER answer a fucking question and NEVER give you a real opinion.  FUCK IT!  I love Trump&#39;s twitter! dudes taking a shit and something is pissing him off he blasts it all over twitter.  Its fucking hilarious.</p>

<p>Sure he is a billionaire and he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth but he is a real dude.  Some middle class guy who would probably do a great job without being so arrogant or offensive simply NEVER will have the connections or the cash to fuck around in the kind game that lands you in the POTUS chair.</p>

<p>So unless you&#39;re talking about staging the 2nd American Revolution, with guns drawn and fields ready to water... Trump is our best shot at shaking these fucking parasites loose from the Government we DO have, the government that EXISTS right now.</p>

<p>So many people seem to have forgotten this. The GOP even tried to steal the nomination from him in Colorado. </p>

<p>Trump is not GOP anymore than Sanders was DNC (independent since 1979).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typically when a sub bans you and you haven&#39;t been an absolute bastard, the sub is not worth much. Especially a sub that should be about conspiracies.</p>

<p>Considering the loss of quality of this sub I&#39;d be surprised if there wasn&#39;t at least a reasonably well-funded effort into propagandising all &quot;conspiracy&quot; content. Either through direct censorship or by trying to lead users into other conctrolled subs. In fact I know these things are happening in other subs, so it&#39;s a really safe bet to think they&#39;re going on here as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To a point I think going with &quot;the left and right are two sides of the same coin&quot; is too simple to accurately reflect something as all-encompassing and massive as the federal government, much less the differences between how parties operate in the states. There are absolutely areas where both parties march in step. One is foreign policy, but foreign policy requires experts in specialized areas of the world. There aren&#39;t as many people that have such specialized knowledge so they are repeatedly rehired by Democrats and Republicans.</p>

<p>But I think it&#39;s foolish to ignore how Congress votes, or the actions of each administration. The different attitudes towards federal prosecution of marijuana laws is pretty blatant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The true problem is our system of values, the majority of the world is hopelessly enslaved by the monetary system and none are more helplessly enslaved than those who believe they are free.  In America the people who control society are the people who control the money aka the Fed reserve, global bankers, and the corporatocracy.  In the last century we have been dominated by a plutocratic system in which the rich get richer and more powerful and the poor get poorer and weaker.  We need a revolution towards what we value,  the plutocrats want to keep an ignorant, unaware public that focus on our differences rather than our similarities.  If the people of the world ever developed the insight that there is no value in money besides our belief in its value then we could create a brand new global resource based economy in which science and technological innovations are created to maintain global abundance on earth for all resources which would make money irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, anyone who identifies as Republican or Democrat but also claims to be a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;(a term I don&#39;t use because it&#39;s a bullshit buzzword created by the cia) tells me that they haven&#39;t really done enough research, that they don&#39;t want to believe that the system they&#39;ve been living their whole lives in is a complete farce, or that they are just very guilllible.</p>

<p>There are two things I&#39;ve been thinking about that are mind boggling to me.
1. How can people still believe after all that has happened with the elections and the decisions that our &quot;representatives&quot; make, that this is a democracy and the average person has the power to effect the political process? This is really a rhetorical question because I already know how, but it still amazes me nevertheless that people can be so blind.</p>

<ol>
<li>Among the &quot;Truther&quot; community and the alternative media there are people who believe that Trump is in some sort of secret alliance and that he is an enemy of the establishment. For those who know how politics works at the upper level, the belief that Trump is some anti-establishment hero is ridiculous.  Presidents are selected, not elected. Politics is theater with an element of meaningless interaction for the masses.
Right from the very start of the elections, it was clear to me that Trump was not anti-establisment. He&#39;s playing his part, they all are. You don&#39;t get to be president through honest work and passion to change America for the better. You get selected to president because you&#39;re in the same or a similar to club with the rest of the occultist pedophiles or because you can be controlled in some way. Even George Washington was a freemason.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, one has been a conspiracy favorite for decades with <em>pages upon pages</em> of unanswered questions about every form of corruption.  Then there is Trump who has recently been accused of conspiring with Russia to win the election (to the best I can keep up, the exact manner of this conspiracy is not clear and has changed a good deal, exactly what did he do with Russia?  Have business dealings and accept some intel?  Didn’t they actually hack polling machines at one point?). </p>

<p>Even aside from political endorsement, this is a lopsided comparison.  The accusations against Trump are new and not earth-shatteringly egregious (considering what most people here think about what the government does regularly) and there is not much proof beyond conjecture.  The accusations against the Clintons go back decades, are very terrible and include murder (child rape according to some) human trafficking, massive embezzlement, outright corruption, compromising of national security to hostile nations, drug running, proven obstruction of justice by destroying evidence, etc.</p>

<p>They <em>could</em> be equally corrupt, but Trump would have a fuck ton of catching up to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a poster on his subreddit since it opened. </p>

<p>This subreddit has been calling for an Independent, who wasn&#39;t part of the Two Party paradigm forever. That&#39;s why it overwhelmingly supported Ron Paul. He attacked the Democrats for being Statist, and attacking the Republicans for being deficit-spending war-mongers.</p>

<p>That ability to tell truth to power exemplifies &quot;transcending the left-right paradigm&quot;.</p>

<p>The reason why the subreddit also overwhelmingly supported Trump over Hillary Clinton was that Trump [like Ron Paul] didn&#39;t fit the convenient narrative. Like us, he was accused of liking conspiracies. He would openly question 9/11, openly point out the lies that led to the Iraq War, openly connect the CIA to the JFK assassination, etc.</p>

<p>As members of this subreddit, we found it refreshing when Republican Establishment figures said that he wasn&#39;t a &quot;real Republican,&quot; because for most of his adult life he held Kennedy Democrat views from 1960. We also liked it when he attacked both the Clinton and Bush dynasties.</p>

<p>Everyone on here knows of the George Soros &quot;ShareBlue&quot; brigades on this subreddit, trying to pimp the &quot;evil Republican&quot; narrative with Trump. It doesn&#39;t work because he&#39;s not a real Republican.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I (and many others like me on this subreddit) voted for him.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not a Republican or a Democrat. He&#39;s an Independent populist, who gamed the system and scammed his way in in the only way possible: manipulating the system.</p>

<p>I always liked this comment from a critic who was reacting to the neocon attacks on Trump: &quot;He did something amazing. He didn&#39;t run as a conservative or a liberal. He ran as an--American.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like CNN.</p>

<p>Turn off your TV.</p>

<p>Trump a . . . racist?</p>

<p>Even on the front page today you have Floyd Mayweather saying &quot;No one ever considered Trump racist before he ran for President.&quot;</p>

<p>They did the whole &quot;racist&quot; thing to Ron Paul, too.</p>

<p>They do it to every Republican. Bar none. </p>

<p>(Surely you&#39;re smart enough to notice the pattern.)</p>

<p>So even though Trump was given awards for helping African-Americans by Jesse Jackson, suddenly we&#39;re supposed to think he&#39;s a Klansman, right? </p>

<p>The people on this sub reddit are smarter than that.</p>

<p>And by the way, you&#39;re speaking to a Hispanic. If your whole basis for &quot;Trump&#39;s racism&quot; is his calling Mexican coyotes rapists (the same week that a report came out saying that 87% of Mexican women were raped being smuggled over) you&#39;re not going to convince me to be scandalized. As a Hispanic, pay attention to this: I, too, want a wall. I, too want illegal aliens deported. And I, too, have no interest in Mexican drug cartels or human traffickers in my country.</p>

<p>Guess I&#39;m a &quot;racist&quot; now, too--like everyone who disagrees with CNN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should know that yes, people accused Trump of being racist well before he was president, due to his response to the Central Park Five. </p>

<p>As for the &quot;but he dated a black woman&quot; thing, come on. How many slaveowners had kids with their slaves? You can want to fuck someone and still think they&#39;re lesser. It&#39;s kinda common, actually, even if the reason you think they&#39;re lesser isn&#39;t generally about the color of their skin. :P </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like calling everything racist, and I don&#39;t think Trump is KKK-racist or a neo-Nazi. He&#39;s just the casual kind of racist my grandma is. The &quot;oh, he&#39;s so well spoken!&quot; kind of racist. Which a lot of people are, to be fair. </p>

<p>I worked the graveyard shift at a gas station for a while, and we had plenty of neo-Nazi customers. Some wore their swastika tattoos proud, some hid it under their sleeves until they thought they were okay showing them off - because hey, I was a white guy, I&#39;d understand being proud of my race, right? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t dislike Trump because he&#39;s racist. I dislike him because he&#39;s a moron. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Trump is donating-millions-of-dollars-to-help-black-kids racist.</p>

<p>Or helping-sick-orthodox-Jewish-kids racist.</p>

<p>Wow! You&#39;re right! He IS just like pre-Civil War slave owners. Thanks for pointing that out.</p>

<p>One question, though: Why does EVERY Republican turn out to be a pre-Civil War slave-owning racist. Like Ron Paul. He seemed so nice. Or Reagan. Or Romney. Or Bob Dole. Or . . . well, EVERY ONE?</p>

<p>Never mind.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have amnesia next election cycle when a new Republican runs and feign surprise when CNN tells me that he&#39;s a secret Klansman, too.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of non-racist Republicans. I don&#39;t think Romney&#39;s racist. </p>

<p>And no, it&#39;s a cute strawman (along with saying I was calling him the equivalent of a rapist slave owner from the pre-Civil War south), but I didn&#39;t say - or even imply - that dating a black woman somehow proves he&#39;s a racist. All I actually said was that it&#39;s just not proof he isn&#39;t. Surely you can see how the two are distinguished?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, a straw man argument is confusing regional symbols with racism. Southerners waved Confederate flags because it was a regional symbol.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton used the confederate flag. See here: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2015/06/Capture18.gif&amp;amp;w=1484&amp;amp;op=resize&amp;amp;opt=1&amp;amp;filter=antialias&amp;amp;t=20170517">https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2015/06/Capture18.gif&amp;amp;w=1484&amp;amp;op=resize&amp;amp;opt=1&amp;amp;filter=antialias&amp;amp;t=20170517</a></p>

<p>The TV show the &quot;Dukes of Hazard&quot; had a Confederate flag. And no one considered the show or the characters racist.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 40 years-old. For most of my life, no one considered it racist.</p>

<p>(If it had been, then Clinton would have been canny enough to ditch it. But even in the 1990s, a politician as talented as he was felt comfortable enough to use it.)</p>

<p>This new CNN formulation of &quot;Confederate Flag&quot; = racism is hilarious.</p>

<p>Likewise your bizarre belief that Northern Republicans go around wasting Confederate flags.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never in my life seen Northern Republicans waving Confederate flags.</p>

<p>What I HAVE seen are <em>Southerners</em> with the flag . . . as a regional symbol.</p>

<p>Not every Southerner with the flag was a racist. (Turn off CNN.)</p>

<p>Guess Bill Clinton was a racist for his Confederate Flag. (That&#39;s what he was trying to convey with it, right? It was a CNN-style &#39;dog-whistle,&#39; correct?)</p>

<p>Or Democratic President Lyndon Johnson with HIS Confederate flag: <a href="https://dickatlee.com/issues/mississippi/mississippi_eyewitness/images/24_confederate_flag_lbj_hh_300.jpg">https://dickatlee.com/issues/mississippi/mississippi_eyewitness/images/24_confederate_flag_lbj_hh_300.jpg</a></p>

<p>Or Democratic President Jimmy Carter with HIS Confederate Flag: <a href="http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/staceydash/files/2015/06/CIE2HBhUcAAt22e.jpg">http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/staceydash/files/2015/06/CIE2HBhUcAAt22e.jpg</a></p>

<p>Gee, Funny. Republicans didn&#39;t seem to run with this flag.</p>

<p>Oh, but I&#39;m sorry: CNN taught you that Northern Republicans = Confederate Flag.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: As to your Romney not being a racist . . . the mainstream media disagrees. Being that all Republicans are cotton baron Southern plantation owning confederates (from non-slave states), Romney was not exempt from the propaganda. <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/07/romney-accused-of-racism-following-naacp-speech.html">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/07/romney-accused-of-racism-following-naacp-speech.html</a></li>

<p>You post anti-Semitic memes, you complain about immigrants (legal immigrants which is actually worse than Trump) because of their failure to integrate, but still you consider yourself qualified to pass judgement on Trump because he&#39;s been framed as a racist by political opponents who are well known to use identity politics to defame their opponents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to keep on beating this dead horse when we know full well that Trump is a racist. This isn&#39;t about a meme clearly labelled anti-semite nor a conversation regarding marginalizing racists because guess what happens when you do that, racists like Trump get voted in. This is about Trump being a racist, sexist bigot and why don&#39;t you go through the comment history on that cause I tell I&#39;m clearly saying so fucked up shit on there as per the username which is the whole standard character it&#39;s meant to be. So lemme get it through ya head for ya. Trump is a piece of shit, and you think you&#39;re not voting for the status quo changes things when he is establishment. But I have no problem with Trump being president, cause hopefully he fucks up America so much that you stupid fucks realise that you&#39;re right wing conservative piece of shit views that think the rest of the world is just there to serve you changes and you stop with raping countries and your own people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most of the real people get that here. There are some shills posting unmarked ads for their political party of choice, but people calling attention to the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; political theater tend to get upvoted and agreed with. Even fans of Trump and Sanders usually recognize the bullshit behind partisan politics. For example, before Trump chose his cabinet, there were rumors he might give Secretary of State to a Democrat, Tulsi Gabbard. She is noteworthy for resigning from the DNC to endorse Sanders, she is also noteworthy for being perhaps the only politician to visit Syria and talk honestly about what has been going on there. And what did Trump fans think? They like her and we&#39;re excited at the prospect. Bernie supporters, even ones like me who absolutely hate the Democratic Party, like her too. Of course, Trump picked that oil CEO instead, but my point is that Trump fans liked the policies of this Democrat who endorsed Bernie. Because it&#39;s not about partisanship for the people who lined up behind Bernie and Donald. Bernie is an independent, and Trump is a former Democrat who also ran for president in 2000 as a third party candidate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has become embroiled in a turf war between the &quot;two&quot; sides because it&#39;s the only sub of any real size left which isn&#39;t firmly encamped on one side or the other. T_D bans all criticism of their leader (their right to do, it&#39;s always been a rally sub) and r/politics skews heavily Democratic though not really &quot;leftist&quot; in the traditional sense (partly to do with moderation, but I&#39;d wager more to do with the demographics of reddit as a whole.) The major news subs are less clear cut, but are still firmly anti-Trump and Democratic leaning.</p>

<p>It was somewhat inevitable that this would happen to a degree, especially as <em>candidate</em> Trump took the campaign into many conspiratorial waters. The Trump supporters (both real and paid) came here to cheer on any conspiracy that cast Clinton in a negative light, and the Clinton supporters (both real and paid), came here to defend her, and then after the election to push the Russian collusion narrative. &quot;Conspiracy theories,&quot; though not often by that term, have gone completely mainstream at this point. I would defy anyone to find more than a handful of Americans not on ventilators who don&#39;t believe in at least one major conspiracy theory today (Trump-Russia or take-your-pick-Clinton-conspiracy probably takes care of 95% of Americans). Even without bots and shills, we&#39;d be facing a similar situation.</p>

<p>I certainly prefer r/conspiracy of 4 or even 3 or 2 years ago to what we have now, but the toothpaste is out of the tube. Not just this sub, but reddit, social media, and even society at large. &quot;<em>They</em>&quot; used to keep conspiracy theories out of the public mind by ignoring, suppressing, ridiculing, and mocking us; now, they&#39;ve opened the floodgates, drowning us in information and sending us false prophets of every stripe. </p>

<p>This used to be a club no one wanted to be in (not just this sub, but the label in general). Those who endured the mockery and the insults did so because we cared about the truth and had seen and read too much to buy in to the lies society had fed us since infancy. Now, every Tom, Dick, and Harry want to &quot;expose&quot; the chosen &quot;bad guys&quot; of whatever team they and their friends happen to root for. I don&#39;t think these are bad people or lost causes, though. They&#39;re just like most of us were in some ways before we each went through many realizations (and probably more than a few false realizations) before getting to the point we&#39;re at now, which is <em>still</em> a place of incomplete information and imperfect understanding. (Except for <em>you</em>, one person on this sub who has it all figured out. You know who you are.)</p>

<p>We could ban all politics posts, or even just all Trump or Hillary posts, but the issue with that is that politics (even though it largely exists as theater) is the one of biggest if not the prime example of the powerful conspiring against the people. How do you get rid of the partisan bickering without gutting one of the major pillars of this sub: governmental conspiracies? This isn&#39;t rhetorical.</p>

<p>I could write more on this, but I&#39;m not sure if anyone&#39;s even still reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should all Thank the Trump movement for conspiracies being brought to the mainstream. We would be living in a socialist, pedophilic hell hole right now without him. Sorry but if he&#39;s a shill, he&#39;s really fucking bad at his job. As someone who grew up under Obama I can tell you that the elites have the minds and hearts of children across the country. Trump being elected caused more human traffickers to be arrested, it caused a cultural shift away from sexualizing children and enacting communism. If Trump is a shill he has done more for the coming generation than anyone else I can think of. Certainly he has done more to help young Americans than any conspiracy theorist screaming &quot;zIoNiSt!!1!!!&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. This sub shouldn&#39;t shy away from the fact that it&#39;s gaining subscribers everyday. At the very least that means every day more people are coming here willing to get a primer on &quot;waking up&quot;. Some are finally coming with an open mind to really learn more, which is positive, even if it means they&#39;ll get caught up in negativity and disinformation along the way. That&#39;s all part of the process.</p>

<p>If we straight up abandon ship, we miss out on a great opportunity to reach new users. Even &quot;3 or 2 years ago&quot; this was my nexus for waking up, and still it was littered with disinfo, but the truth <em>still</em> came though. Ultimately it&#39;s up to the users discretion to sort it out, do research on their own, and keep pushing. Even if 100 users come here and 10 make it though all the bullshit to finally see behind the curtain then it&#39;s a victory imo. And if we repeat that process every day then this sub is accomplishing its goal. That&#39;s why I personally think this sub should stay devoted to users freedom of speech, for better or worse. It has been that way and this sub is <em>still</em> gaining subscribers every single day.</p>

<p>Anyway I&#39;d like to know what you think</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if I quite agree, depending on what you mean by &quot;more acceptable  to believe.&quot; Being a conspiracy theorist is inherently a creative <em>and</em> skeptical endeavor. Creativity without skepticism means you&#39;ll fall for anything, and skepticism without creativity means you will accomplish nothing. </p>

<p>The 9/11 truth movement is predicated on debunking the &quot;chosen conspiracy&quot; that a man dying on dialysis in the caves of Afghanistan orchestrated the most successful attack on the strongest military power the world has ever known. We <em>need</em> skepticism and critical thought, but I&#39;d agree that there is a way to do this without bickering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree with this. I&#39;m very open to hearing any conspiracy theories regarding Trump such as Russia collusion and his financial past, but it&#39;s so blatantly obvious that the establishment along with the deep state hate Trump and want him gone, it&#39;s basically proof positive for me that what you&#39;re saying is correct. The media will just straight up lie about the guy - take for example the rants about his mental health and fitness to be President that is based on absolutely nothing more than &quot;we don&#39;t like his tone.&quot; The news outlets seem to be coordinating a message to undermine the President. I know people don&#39;t like his style or his blunt political messaging, but in my opinion having a news media that is so openly partisan coordinating their messaging to engage in favoritism with their preferred party/narrative, that&#39;s a big problem. The average voter cannot be informed in an environment like that.</p>

Not believing the right/left system is a wide thing to do, but to toss out all capability to make the world better for the children is exactly what the elites want, and exactly what most theorists do. They rely on theorists being overwhelmed and apathetic and most of you play right into their hands. When was the last time we discussed how to make society better for the next generation? When&#39;s the last time anyone here shut up about trump being a Zionist or anti Semite long enough to accomplish something? We can discard beliefs that are pousonous, but we can&#39;t believe in nothing. We can&#39;t accept our situation and take it lying down, </p>

<p>But by all means keep typing on Reddit about how President Trump is TOTALLY a shill for Israel but also an anti Semite.</p>

<p>Now, even though I don&#39;t really like Trump on a personal level, I support him. He must be doing something right to generate all this hate from the elites. </p>

That is a very divisive difference regardless of what you believe outside of it. Thinking 911 was a conspiracy doesnt have anything to do with how you think the federal gov should solve socio-economic issues. Its just plain divisive. Whats not divisive is that it is seen that both parties have been hijacked by special interests and neither one will get the candidate that represents the values of the public.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t any place where we can go and have an authentic discussion. Every forum, every place, it&#39;s all been corrupted and hijacked. I can enjoy internet niches dedicated to hobbies to some extent, but once people try to discuss <em>ideas</em>, a wave of negativity and derailment is inevitable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s frustrating. There aren&#39;t people in real life that I can talk to about politics and society and other things I find meaningful. And now, even the internet won&#39;t let that happen. I don&#39;t know where we can go.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all done on purpose, so that those of us with similar values and desires can&#39;t discuss, and more importantly, organize.</p>

<p>This is true, but it doesn&#39;t make you a collectivist at heart.  True collectivism doesn&#39;t mean supporting aggression toward redistributing the resources of everyone above one&#39;s own level of wealth and resources.  It means internalizing putting the well-being of society above one&#39;s own well-being, which you&#39;ve described as &quot;stupid&quot;. </p>

<p>That is not the case, at least in America.  In America, a centrist is merely someone who is ideologically between where the Overton window of &quot;acceptable&quot; political discourse is at any given time.  Communism isn&#39;t acceptable to advocate for if you want to be taken seriously in America, though libertarianism is acceptable.  </p>

<p>The far left side of the Overton window is people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who are basically social Democrats.  The right side of acceptable political discourse are libertarians (Koch Bros) and nationalists like Trump and Sessions. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why neoliberals and neoconservatives are seen as the centrists in America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you change a system that is corrupt from the inside?
Lets say that I run, and I get voted in (for some reason).<br/>
If I ran on a platform of equality and fairness for all, how would the elite and their political puppets take that? Especially if I won the vote.<br/>
Well in their power lays the ability to decide my future. Since I want equality for all I think that if someone born anywhere on the globe should have an equal chance at a fair life as someone born anywhere else. This applies to Palestine. Which would mean I would have to go against the ideals of Israel, and say I don&#39;t support them. Anti-Semite is probably a label that would get tossed around while the media twists words I&#39;ve said.<br/>
Now not supporting Israel would be my first mistake. Because that is used as a sort of barrier in American politics. If you support them, then you support inequality and you support the idea that some humans should always be of higher class and wealth than others. The system won&#39;t change.<br/>
Personally, I think the only way to change the system as it is now, is with the use of the internet. But the government is trying it&#39;s best to get a stranglehold on it.<br/>
In essence, we are more powerful together than they are, but that&#39;s why they have to keep us divided.<br/>
Back to me being a candidate myself, lets pretend I play ball and I say I support Israel, and I take my time perfectly planning my political moves and eventually can run for president. What happens next is once I decide I want to run for president, I have to go behind the scenes and show somehow all of my loyalties to the system. Let&#39;s pretend I do just that and I pass, I get the green light to be a candidate and get tons of air time on the MSM and all of my ideas that I run on for presidency are portrayed in a way that the masses soak up. I get voted as president.<br/>
Well, now I&#39;m the big man, I have to take my directions and work hand in hand with big business, while trying to appear to appeal to the masses. Profits come first, war and keeping the economy afloat so the system is a top priority.<br/>
But I&#39;ve lied the whole time, I really just care about the common man, I care about equality, I know, ill expose the system on air and see how that goes.<br/>
Impeachment, now I&#39;m not doing what the elites wanted me to be president for, I&#39;m doing something counter productive to what they wanted.<br/>
Do you think I would stay alive long? What about stay president? How long until a narrative that is concocted from nothing is being  pushed into the mainstream media narrative for the masses to consume?  </p>

<p>Sorry, I don&#39;t personally think change from this system will come from the inside, it&#39;s all too interconnected. Maybe i&#39;m speculating way to much, maybe not.</p>
