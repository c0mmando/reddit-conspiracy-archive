       I work 100 hour weeks. I am streamlined and ruthlessly efficient. I have no time for trivialities like friends or dating. When the time comes I will pass on my seed artificially to an Aryan goddess who will be selected through a string of rigorous physical and mental tests. I have a selection of fine silk ties and I own a custom gold plated pen. I am a god. Cower before me liberal weaklings.

       What you're witnessing is the depopulation agenda. That's like entry level Conspiracy Theory topic. You're right, I can't imagine it either. But don't worry about the future, because you never truly live in the future. You only ever live in the present. You can either do something to make the world a better place, start making phone calls. Or you can just focus on yourself and make the most out of your own life and be a righteous man and try to avoid the evil of the world. You can go exercise, go talk to some girls, go have fun, go invent something, go to church.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry about the future too much, you'll deal with it then, worry about now. Also I hope your spiritual because it's a dangerous way to live if you do everything in your power to protect your physical body on this Earth. I hope you believe you have a soul that goes beyond this realm and I hope you aren't scared of death. We can't be

       I've noticed many conspiracy theorists care more about being right than making the world a better place. Of course we should all be open to the idea of Flat Earth or the idea that nuclear weapons don't exist, or any ideas to be quite honest. But even if they are proven right, nothing changes. There will still be suffering, pain, inequality in the world. So even if nuclear weapons don't exist it's best to act like they do for the sake of humanity

       M.A.D (mutually assured destruction) despite the damage nuclear weapons can cause they’re actually the one reason we aren’t in a nuclear war right now ironically. take the U.S and north korea for example neither country will nuke the other because if one launches nukes the other will too and nobody will come out of that a winner. nuclear arsenals  are used more as a buffer for war than a weapon.

       Aw, thank you :)

       I am a skeptical person. I am skeptical of official stories AND I am skeptical of conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I do not believe anybody died or got hurt on 9/11.

       Interesting food for thought. 9/11 definitely started my trip down the rabbit hole. This is not something I have seriously considered before, but what about all the people jumping out of the windows when the towers were on fire?

       Interesting theory I have never heard before. When the forum page mentioned Todd Beamer though I did get a rise of emotions because I have spoken with his wife on two separate occasions. However I had to stop myself and take a step back and really think about how much do I truly know? Because what I think I know could be completely false, a foundation of beliefs that have taken years to form could very well be beliefs and nothing more. Sorry for the rant I’m still trying to learn that when it comes to conspiracies i have to accept that things are not always as they seem. Thanks for the link.

       This shows that you are able to think for yourself and to self-reflect.

       These are good signs.

       There are not many of us who can do this: admit to ourselves that things we thought we knew, we really don't have much evidence for.

       I imagine our kids and especially our grand kids will be very comfortable with the transhumanist agenda by that point, if we fail to stop it now. RFID implants and brain-internet meshes won't be seen as weird, but we will be "old and out of touch" because at most we prefer wearable smart glasses and watches to implants.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will also probably live a bit longer, with average age of death in the 80's and 90's by that point, so we will get to see most of the 21st century and die either right as things start getting good (if we succeed now) or right as the real singularity approaches and we should be happy to be peacing out.

       I don't believe most our generation will live that long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody seems to believe the 'we are living longer' meme but who has taken the time to look at the primary evidence for themselves? See

       Consider what they eat and drink, how little exercise most of them do (especially after marriage/settling down), and even the untested toxins in their tattoos.

       I'm well aware most people's diets are shit and they do not exercise. But the data still says we generally are still living longer.

       Show me how it is that we are not living longer. I am not trying to sound combative, I'm actually extremely curious.

       This user does not engage in intellectually honest discussion. Their primary goal here is sell-promotion for profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       A common tactic they use is to make a claim with no or faulty evidence, and then require you to disprove their unsubstantiated claim. They will then continually shift the goal posts in an effort to make you give up, so they can later claim that they have never been proven wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       My recommendation is to tag in order to keep your guard up, and to report his self-promotion for the spam that it is.

       Step2thejep is john le bonn who made that video, he only links to his own videos which direct you to his site witch is member only for the low low price of $5/week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who disagrees with him is a “conspiritard” or a noob. He tried to post his videos directly but they got no upvotes so he now does this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of his videos don’t have any evidence, it can be hard to tell what he actually believes and they promise to blow your mind... if you pay for his site and read/ watch his vlogs that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       His content is best described as a mixture of the attitude r/iamreallysmart or r/iam14andthisisdeep and r/insanepeoplefacebook and a misunderstanding of basic physics, chemistry, geology, plantary science etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know what he actually believes other than looking to make a buck.

       I never saw it that way. Got my first tattoo at 15. I have asked my shop why sometimes it looks like I'm having an allergic reaction even 6 years after getting it when the ink lines go really raised/swollen and itchy. They said the ink is safe and has been tested but couldn't tell me why mine do that... I do regret them all now

       Tattoo ink doesn’t even go deep enough into the skin to do any real damage, even if it were somehow toxic, which 9.5/10 it’s not. Stop going around spewing bullshit to people.

       Many of the inks used in modern tattoos are chemically different from those used decades ago. This is addressed in the article cited, which you clearly didn't read.

       Your link has Pepe the Frog at the top of it. You’re a joke who goes around reddit shit-stirring. You don’t really believe tattoo ink is dangerous, you just like to go against what you consider to be “the popular idea” because it gives you some kind of satisfaction when people get annoyed with you. You’re a troll. And not even a very good one.

       <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/articles/the-tattoo-tragedy/">
        Here is an article
       </a>
       which cites primary sources on the potential health risks of tattoos.
      </p>
      <p>
       the tl;dr is this: the bright and exotic inks which have become popular over the past decade or so are
       <em>
        chemically different
       </em>
       to the inks used previously and
       <strong>
        have not been tested
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, people assume that because the old-fashioned 'anchor' tattoos on old people today don't seem to have killed the, the tattoos today must be safe, too.
      </p>

       Agreed. I'm 21 and I know a load of people in their 20s who aren't just successful in wealth, but happiness and have their own family/house. I actually find its the people who've gone/are in uni are the ones in deep shit!

       Well, the ones I know all went to college/university and are happy and well adjusted. Some I know are around 23, and others I know are late 20s. I'm particularly thinking of 3 married couples in the 20s that I know. They are all homeowners and happily married (no children yet).

       My son is almost 21. He lives at home while attending our local college. He also has a part-time job and is saving that money. Yes, Dad and I are helping with the cost of college, but it really isn't that much. My son attended local community college for the first 2 years (which was really inexpensive). He transferred to a local well known college for his Junior and Senior years (which is costing a bit more).
      </p>

       My son is majoring in political science and is optimistic about changing the US government for the better.

       Simply track the cost of healthcare. The ramp from 1960's onward. If the greedy bastards are not contained, you'll more than likely be looking at euthanasia but it won't be medically assisted because you won't be able to afford that either.

       It's still no planet for us to live on regardless if it exists or not if we hurt it enough that we can't survive here anymore. I care about the earth but I also want somewhere I can live and well, you know, not die too young. But at this rate it's not looking promising.

       Hopefully your generation will have access to great advancements in medical technology.

       What us more likely is that by the time we have medical technology of the sci-fi kind, Agenda 21 will be functioning as intended and most of us/you will be dead, allowing the remaining 500,000 elites to inhabit the earth, void of us mere peasants.

       Here’s something fun to think about... Ever go to an old folks home? If you do you can tell they are basically set up to mimic the 1940’s. Kind of the way the decor is and they play like Tommy Dorsey on the radio in the background. Reason is because that’s what was popular when old people in there were young.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... what’s it going to be like in the old folks’ home when your generation is in there? Will there be Call of Duty emulators set up with The Weeknd playing in the background?

       Well OP, hopefully, i have less than 15 years left and in the way that this is going, i hope for a quick WWIII, which hopefully purge this miserable planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully, the population left will recuperate and learn from the current mess and shot on the spot, any motherfucker that tries to recreate the current political ecosystem, that allows unlimited corruption at the expense of us mere mortals.
      </p>

       And i also hope that they also shot any bastard that tries to make the survivors worship rich, celebrities and corporations as they do now.

       Nobody else has mentioned it yet:
       <strong>
        everything
       </strong>
       will be a monthly payment. If you look around, you'll notice we are almost at that point now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people nowadays have monthly payments for
       <em>
        the services
       </em>
       they need to survive:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        credit cards for food (groceries + restaurants)
       </li>
       <li>
        mortgage/rent (+ utility bills) for shelter
       </li>
       <li>
        insurance for health
       </li>
       <li>
        student loans for education
       </li>
       <li>
        net/phone bill for communication
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       But now more people are starting to pay monthly for
       <em>
        the things
       </em>
       they want and need:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Volvo announced a new EV they plan on -- not leasing -- but renting out. You take it to them for maintenance. They want it back after your 'lease' expires. You never own it.
       </li>
       <li>
        Cell companies already want you to pay monthly for the high-end smartphones instead of one large payment up front. You don't own it until payments are done.
       </li>
       <li>
        Houses used to be built with local materials, help from the community, and on family land that had been passed down for generations before you were born. Now 30% of American adults are living with roommates. The rest of us probably have a mortgage or hefty rent. Either way, you most likely don't own the house you sleep in every night.
       </li>
       <li>
        Rent-A-Centers - the worst of it all. Pay $18 a month for the next 15 years for an over-valued sofa. The late fee? $25 plus interest! How much interest? Like 24%! So that $3,400 (worth maybe a grand) sofa easily ends up costing (the people that fall for this trap, AKA poor people that might miss many payments) upwards of $8-12K.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And this is just how it is NOW. 2018. I haven't even really brainstormed that long. I'm sure there's a longer list (hell, maybe a whole thread) we could do on this one subject alone:
       <strong>
        destruction of 'ownership'
       </strong>
       -- look up the right-to-repair issue to continue down the rabbit hole... (Ownership laws don't apply if you ain't the owner!)

       What's up with the cry baby generational posts? I know plenty of social successful 21-30 year olds. I and many high school friends just graduated college, my buddy makes $28/hr as a union mason, band members, politicians, community leaders. A few of us are engaged or married. You're probably projecting your own issues onto your generation.

       Cry me a river. Our generation will probably be one of the most educated, civically minded and peaceful generations the world has seen. Our grandparents' generation was killing people by the millions, our parents' generation are indoctrinated by divisive propaganda, our generation grew up with a free flow of information and is able to see ideas and information our parents couldn't even think of. Open your eyes up and quit being so negative.
