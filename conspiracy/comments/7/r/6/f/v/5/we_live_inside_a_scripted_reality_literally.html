       (An ‚Äúupvote‚Äù, tho silly sounding, can help these words reach the Others of Us, our Friends, the awake ones.  A sign we are strong &amp;  many. If you downvote this, think about why. If you‚Äôre getting paid to, I guess that‚Äôs another issue altogether.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The public figures are actors. Politicians to mainstream documentary subjects to most major CEOs to the big names in non profits to medical research to science to ‚Äî‚Äî-. - hell, ACTORS are actors! Even they play a part to play a part. This isn‚Äôt metaphorically speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       üíó I want to add- this isn‚Äôt hopeless or desperate of a situation- the opposite! It‚Äôs wonderful because all this means is that if, over time, people can begin to see the truth, the corrupt system loses its power structure and perhaps something truly democratic and just can be created in its place.  We have the power, most of us just don‚Äôt know it... üíó
      </p>
      <p>
       I know how this sounds. But I‚Äôm not the one fabricating the news and politics and using one actor to play multiple roles. And using multiple actors to play one role. Next time u watch a movie - watch a show- look.... closely... don‚Äôt think male vs female... Bc something shown as NOW could have been filmed 2-3 years ago. Look into their eyes and you will see some people are playing roles playing roles playing roles...
      </p>
      <p>
       Really LOOK AT THEM. Look. Look at Trump. Then Comey. Then Lindsey Graham. Not their Wikipedia pictures - but all of them. What do you see? Look at everyone and think friends, think. Does something feel wrong? This is because IT IS.
      </p>
      <p>
       &lt;example: Mike Pompeo ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è¬©Ô∏è being played by Alex Jones ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è¬©Ô∏è. Like Austin Powers and Dr Evil.... same man playing fake opposing roles.

      </p>
      <p>
       &lt;example: Dr. Susan Love ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è¬©Ô∏è and Al Franken ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è¬©Ô∏è played by same actor.

      <p>
       Am I sure? No. I haven‚Äôt seen DNA tests. But if you choose to believe people, you should think about why you choose to believe them despite a lot of evidence that they are lying. (There are other facts that I know that I wish I could share here that would help people understand but I can‚Äôt..)
      </p>
      <p>
       You name it, they‚Äôve written it. If it‚Äôs big enough to be news or common knowledge or accepted truth, they‚Äôve written it. The entire game is written except for the very low levels- the base of the pyramid. We have all the power and use almost none of it due to our deep Stockholm syndrome. We have been so convinced that we are weak and scared and too poor, too fat, too incompetent to do anything about it. We live looking for the leader, who to follow, who will tell us to move left or right, to stay or go, when to work and play and sleep and eat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The joke is on us because we allow them to write our story. It isn‚Äôt their story to write but as long as we just allow them to do it, they will because Hey, free story!
      </p>
      <p>
       It‚Äôs OURstory. It is YOURstory. Write it. I‚Äôm not sure how exactly but I don‚Äôt think we can know until more of us wake up and the answer is NOT TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO SEE THAT 9/11 was a lie and that chemtrails exist or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It‚Äôs to take those we already have and help them go DEEPER.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don‚Äôt force change - don‚Äôt force the asleep to look at Sandy Hook or vaccines. All you do is look foolish and make them mad or annoyed. Take the open minds- INCLUDING YOUR OWN- and allow them to go deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at everything with open eyes and you will start to see that ....
      </p>
      <p>
       Al Franken plays the role of Dr. Susan Love.... that Alex Jones played Mike Pompeo... that the left is he right and the actors are politicians and every public figure is a character in the play who can be played by ANYONE from the guild. They are the lollipop guild. WE are the COURAGEOUS LIONS. Not to fight or rebel with rage and violence but to ROAR with the pride- roar because you won‚Äôt believe the lies and therefore- you are free.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the story. Look without fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don‚Äôt be scared to see the lies. Don‚Äôt think that just because you can‚Äôt imagine WHY someone would do something that then it cannot or would not be done. That is illogical. (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see WHY that man would rob that bank, he‚Äôs so wealthy! It couldn‚Äôt have been him!‚Äù) we aren‚Äôt working with all the facts and information so we must look with eyes wide open. See all the false narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they didn‚Äôt want us to know about Wikileaks, we wouldn‚Äôt know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything we are told is part of a massive story.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can take it back by going deeper inside of YOURSELF.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crazy thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       They want you to. They want you to see that YOU are the HERO of your story. Because until then... you‚Äôre forcing them to do all this work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Write your own script.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don‚Äôt mock me if you disagree, move along. I‚Äôm not here for a fight or to try to prove my ideas. I won‚Äôt engage. I just had to share this in case a few of you are ready to go to the next level.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like a bat signal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like in Travelers or Glitch where the minds are connected in single purpose and they are greater than the sum of their parts. So too are we. You know deep inside you - YOU KNOW THIS. You KNOW it. Listen to yourself. You have left breadcrumbs for yourself- pick them up and look at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a breadcrumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       (If it helps, remember someone like Trump for example... is played by several people over the years. Like The Dread Pirate Roberts... remember how he was ‚Äúcreated‚Äù? There is no ‚Äî-fill in public figure‚Äî. They are IDEAS. Characters. Like Garfield and Pikachu. No more real than Scooby Doo. Jokes on you.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you‚Äôre with me, if you‚Äôre with us, roar.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Edit- I know how some of this sounds, a year ago I would have said it‚Äôs too crazy to be true too but it is what it is and I felt like I had to share it since I haven‚Äôt found anyone saying it)

       (it's all an act) The part you are auditioning for. What part who cares. You get to decide. Seriously if you doubt it, just look at yourself and see all the mask you wear. The roles you step into. I'm a brother. I'm a son. What does that mean, well I guess it is up to me what that means and how I fill those roles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not my name, but I have one. I take on the role of enok, when I speak in the online domain. To me enok stroth is one that isn't afraid. He is the light. He is a character and apart of me but not the full embodiment of me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person I am, is the person I want to be. I was shaped by my environment, by circumstance. Until I saw that I could shape myself.  I've had enough playing the role of a poor man with so little power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am now a man that has all that he needs, and my power knows no bounds. You can't extinguish this flame. I'll flicker in the dark for all to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though my light might be dim to you it is blinding to me.

       There is no you,there is no me. We are also not our ego.We are just an expression of energy in a physical form expressing "ourselves" in different ways we can not control. Everybody plays their part and it couldnt go any different than how everything is right now. There is no free will.

       That is very deep. I agree. Most things cannot be known because we are relying at SOME point on another person to tell us something. I‚Äôve never been to Australia but I think I‚Äôll believe the maps and Australians and all the pictures. Some things are common knowledge but still that means relying on what other people say to tell you. I don‚Äôt like that. I do not like trusting for truth. Instead, I use my own eyes and ears and then I listen to my heart. Of course if a few million people also believe it I take that into consideration- HOWEVER I don‚Äôt let that be my only means of proof because there are many examples of large numbers of people sharing common and deluded ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you- but would only add.... SINCE we cannot know anything much for certain, we must listen to our heart to guide us about what is real and true in order to make decisions about living and how we feel and such. Thank you for your feedback- very good point!!

       Who is the "I" in us? Thats our ego. Where in our brain can we point out our ego? We cant,because our ego is a thought. And thoughts are illusion. Lets say than that we are the physical brain and that brain is programmed to act a certain way because of the thoughts it produces. And we (our ego/thoughts) can not control that. "We" must embrace/except everything that comes on our pad,good and bad.only then we will be free...thats a nice thought,but CAN we?who knows..if not,we have to embrace/except that,because our brain is programmed that way.

       Yes and no. "You" and "me" exist within their own rights, but we aren't
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       "you" and "me". We are much more than that - but only if you realise it. If you fall into the trap of believing you are just "you", the human ego, then that's all you'll be, and there is no free will. But if you can change your perspective and see the bigger picture - that, ultimately, we are everything - then that's what you'll be. The potential to create entire universes exists within that body the ego calls "self". You just gotta recognise that.

       You're tNo,the human ego THINKS they have a free will,thats the whole thing. All things just HAPPEN. When you say:"I am going to get a drink because I am thirsty". Who is I? our BODY is thirsty and walking to the kitchen to poor in a drink and take a zip is all going automatically. Our ego THINKS it has decided all that by himself.
You're also not saying: "I am letting my heart beat or my food digest".It goes automatically. And THAT is what "we" have to realize in this duality. What we are is ENERGY/LOVE,expressing itself in a human body with no control whatsoever.We are merely moving puppets with a very strange and selfdestructive illusion in our brain:the ego. We as humans,especially in the western world,think we are all seperate induviduals with free will.But we are all one force of energy/love that controls our body/mind.

       I don't know that I believe it's all that scripted but I definitely believe we've been enlightened enough. We need to stop batting around conspiracies and looking off planet and fix what we need to fix here. There's a real conspiracy afoot and it has nothing to do with aliens or actors or any of that stuff. It's the real basic stuff, like you said. We buy what they sell so they don't stop. If we stop buying it stops.

       I don‚Äôt believe in aliens right now either. But it wasn‚Äôt until I started to see actors playing other actors playing roles right there in the same movies that I looked and couldn‚Äôt help but see the obviousness of (I use this example Bc it is the Dr Evil vs Austin Powers one) Alex Jones playing Mike Pompeo. It‚Äôs absurd but it‚Äôs happening and I could sense it in his eyes and nuances like when you see an old friend from far or you recognize your brother from the way he is walking from behind him 100 yards away... and that means that if that is true.... and I thought honestly about what the implications of that are. Not frivolous little ideas here I‚Äôm talking big ideas that tell us the thing is a play. Sometimes a comedy sometimes a horror film. The so called predictive programming is just foreshadowing in this Orwellian, Shakespearean, PKDickian (dickie lol), Dahlian, CSLewisian, KingJamesian production that we are INSIDE.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don‚Äôt see the lies not because they are too big but because... they put us IN IT.

       It's not even that I don't believe in aliens but if we don't have a planet to live on because we destroy it I mean we kill ourselves. Why worry about something we don't know for sure is happening and fix what we do know is. I definitely think the media is fucked up and that there is a reason we have violent movies and movies that deal with the topics we like to theorize about on Reddit. I don't think it's a good thing but I don't think it affirms conspiracies, either. I think we give them the info to use on us, you know. They use what'll work to meet whatever the real agenda is and there is one for sure.

       Oh you‚Äôre so welcome dear. We are the strong and powerful. We aren‚Äôt rough or cruel or violent but we are fierce. We have been trained to believe that power means aggression- but it doesn‚Äôt at all.

       When you woke up, you jumped on a radio signal the same one I am on and we communicated even when you didn‚Äôt feel it overtly.

       Maybe the goal of enlightenment is to master your own body/mind complex so well, that you release neurotransmitters + hormones at the perfect ratios that enable you to function at your highest potential. The "master" molecule IMO is DMT, which gets steadily released by the pineal gland (which gets calcified by fluoride), to create the enlightened state known as Samadhi

       Kerry and McCain. They knew the Vietnam issue would be quite big in politics and it's resonance. They needed their man on the left and right. They say different things, but they're both on the same committees, and both work together to shutdown POW/MIA investigations.

       i very recently did some deep research and came to the same realization as you. "president trump" is played by multiple actors--one of them being the same person who does the role of joe biden. if you look at these two and compare their faces you can see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       also discovered that "keanu reeves" entire face is prosthetic, and he was used to play the role of "obama" and also  "melania trump". it is also very obvious that "jerry seinfeld" has played "obama" more than once.
      </p>
      <p>
       "melania trump" is not an actual person but rather an idea. there are multiple actors/actresses who take on the role but it is important to note that "melania" is primarily played by transgendered male-to-female individuals and occasionally true females.

       (I know where you got the Seinfeld reeves stuff. I found the Seinfeld thing THEN about 4 months later saw that on YT so was a little affirmed.) I have an elaborate Explanation about Keanu tho, well sort of elaborate. Melanie is clearly a CGI + played by tons of people.

       a while back when i first discovered this whole thing. i learned that "elvis presley" never died but instead killed the elvis persona and transformed himself into "rene angelil" later on, posing as the husband of transgendered pop icon "celine dion" although in reality, this individual is actually "celine dion's" father, not her husband.
      </p>
      <p>
       honestly researching this stuff freaks me right the hell out. it makes me sick. so a lot of times i have to stop and research a lighter topic. recently most of my time has been spent researching the transgender agenda. through that research i've discovered that transgenders are everywhere. the a-list is packed full of them. it's kind of impossible to achieve super stardom without being trans and being part of the deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       can you point me in the right direction for some more research on these actors playing dual roles? it's easier for me to read up on this stuff when it's day time. less creepy.

       educate yourself on face prosthetics, stage makeup, costume art, etc. then take a look at all these people and ask yourself why their skin looks like latex.
      </p>
      <p>
       learn how to spot prosthetics on a human face and i guarantee you will at least open your mind a bit on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reality is all of these people are wearing masks &amp; prosthetics. once you're educated on that and have trained your eye to spot tell-tale signs, your mind will open up.
      </p>
      <p>
       example: there are many photos of president trump where you can literally see his "skin" rising and slightly bubbling around his nose. that is a characteristic of a
       <em>
        latex mask
       </em>
       , not real human skin. also, they don't even try to hide the fact that his eyes are consistently a different color. sometimes they are crystal blue and sometimes they are so dark you can't even really tell what color they are. i know some people's eye color can change, but i don't think it can be as drastic as that.

       I was about to argue with you about the holographic universe and all that stuff.... Then realized that's what keeps us divided. Like why stay polarized over facts that no one can prove right now? We'll figure all of it out eventually. No point in "told ya so" except to bring someone down.

       So nice to see respectful and friendly discourse; how you know when you‚Äôre among civilized, kind, strong people. Only a weak person says things to tear someone down, even if they disagree. üòä

       Thank you for sharing that! While I wish I could use the word ‚Äúachieve‚Äù I hardly feel that way.  Experience is probably closer but still doesn‚Äôt quite do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Waking up has ripped me from society and disconnected me from everyone around me like cutting out the part of my brain that can know language . It has left me exploring any truth and coming to realizations in my own, while no one I know lives in the same reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self actualization really can‚Äôt occur because you cannot be close enough to someone for them to learn to speak with you and you have to act fake to get by in conversations. You don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre better or more intelligent just that you happen to be in this place.
      </p>
      <p>
       You feel lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Work is harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you left your job. The motivations you had before are all out of whack.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I agree that this shouldn‚Äôt really hurt Bc we don‚Äôt live in a fully solid place, and yet even that you still feel and can‚Äôt I feel and things hurt and people are mean and you get sad and people die and it sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is hard and you see no justice and cruelty and no end in sight and everyone you love doesn‚Äôt even think they are in the same reality and all the things that excite you and motivate you to talk about are also the things that nobody wants to talk about. ‚ÄúStop with that crazy stuff‚Äù and ‚Äúugh that again?!‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       You learn to not share and you accept you won‚Äôt wake people up.
      </p>
      <p>
       You eat, sleep, and still work since just because YOU see it all differently doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt still have a light bill and a mortgage and tuition and insurance and TAXES oh taxes and gas for your car and a cell phone..
      </p>
      <p>
       But....but.... I think if we are doing it right.... we LOVE differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love with all my heart and thought I did before but now? Oh hoh hoh.... NOW I love my kids and love my husband and love the hot sunny days and love the feeling of a sweaty 2 mile jog and love that I have food to cook.... and I appreciate. And the love I have with my husband is a deep bond that is so strong.... the way I feel about him has no words it is different than when I was asleep and thought that things I saw were real.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see the truth you feel more- of everything. Alone, sadness, frustration, anger, fleeting futility, everything EXCEPT for fear - if you‚Äôre doing it right. If you‚Äôre doing it right you feel more love first, and then when fear tries to get in, it can‚Äôt. Because love is already taking its place. Love, love, love.  Which means that when trolls come talking about ‚Äúyou need meds‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a nut job‚Äù feel sorry that the job they‚Äôve chosen has an evil master. Even if they don‚Äôt get paid and they talk like that, they‚Äôre still working for the wrong team.
      </p>
      <p>
       God Bless you all- the awake ones- I love you.

       No me neither.... and your piece of the puzzle with mine and his and hers and theirs and ours and all the pieces together..... we could create a beautiful research project of truth if We could join without the infiltrators, which is why I‚Äôm going to make a post that is a suggestion, speculation, about how in fact all of Us already are on a frequency acting together as the Loving Collective, out of the Hive, without knowing it consciously we all communicate every day, all the time. We have met and spoken and we will again. On some level we are all there working together and these bodies are our amnesiac avatars.

       4th level I call bullshit. Holographic universe where nothing can hurt us? Absolute bullshit. We, well maybe I, can be physically harmed and emotionally hurt. I have had physical injuries in the past which were absolutely real (pro-tip, a pick-up basketball game is just a game. don't be a fuckwad) and relationships crumble and my heart hurt for a while (another pro-tip. time heals all. even if you're bummed, you will get over it). I don't understand how that level would "work"

       All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
       <br/>
       They have their exits and their entrances,
       <br/>
       And one man in his time plays many parts,
       <br/>
       His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
       <br/>
       Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
       <br/>
       Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
       <br/>
       And shining morning face, creeping like snail
       <br/>
       Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
       <br/>
       Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
       <br/>
       Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
       <br/>
       Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
       <br/>
       Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
       <br/>
       Seeking the bubble reputation
       <br/>
       Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
       <br/>
       In fair round belly with good capon lined,
       <br/>
       With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
       <br/>
       Full of wise saws and modern instances;
       <br/>
       And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
       <br/>
       Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
       <br/>
       His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
       <br/>
       For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
       <br/>
       Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
       <br/>
       And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
       <br/>
       That ends this strange eventful history,
       <br/>
       Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
       <br/>
       Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

       "You" are God. "They" are God. We are all one Mind orchestrating our UNIverse collaboratively, yet it is all done by a singular intelligence. We are coming back together. We are remembering our responsibilities to each other. We are remembering compassion. This process is accelerating, and will only grow faster. The acceleration will accelerate. It will be exponential. This is what the prophets have called the "end of time". Literally. We are being absorbed into the Eternal present moment, free of the mental construct of time. I do not know exactly what this will be like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be ready for a new type of experience. Be in peace. Be in joy. Be the qualities you would like to see reflected in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the "deep state" is, I feel like they are catalyzing this now. Whatever corruption occurred in the past is now being reconciled and transmuted, so we can be free to choose our new code of conduct. Forgive all for nothing is truly anyone's fault. We are all just acting how we've been created to act out. This reality is a DVD. YOU (as a "Soul"/"sole" spark of the singularity...God) choose the type of movie you watch. YOU choose your timeline. YOU choose your conduct towards the universe, towards the rest of your Self. YOU choose your avatar for this video game. Do you want a complainy one or a compassionate one?
      </p>
      <p>
       Choose wisely. It's inevitable, but we can speed up the enlightenment of humanity by making higher choices, embodying higher traits of consciousness. The journey never ends, appreciate every moment you have the gift of existence.

       For the curious who ask and the other moms and dads:  regarding children‚Äî- I don‚Äôt treat them like little experiments or projects and to wake up - Bc I don‚Äôt want them to have bad experiences in the world, in school, with teachers.... I let them be taught by norms and other people and the facts that are wrong and know that I‚Äôve given them the right tools to look at things with a discerning eye.

       The whole 'fake news' phenomenon is actually a blessing in disguise because it allows you to legitimately ask the question of whether or not they think something is real. 5-10 years ago, you would be considered 'fringe' for asking your kids if they thought a news story was real. 10-20 years ago you would be considered a lunatic because 'of course it's real! it's the news!'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with the blessing in disguise of fake news, you can teach your kids to think critically about something without fear of being labelled a conspiracy theorist.

       Re: Hollywood stars... The idea that they are a fiction is not that far off. Every celebrity is actually pretty much a production company that employs many, sometimes hundreds of people that you don't see.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we are conditioned to see the front man, the CEO if you will. Brad Pitt, Michael Douglas, Brittany Spears, you name it... these are all production companies with tons of people behind them to do the work that results in the Brad Pitt/Michael Douglas/Brittany Spears that you see on TV or movies or a Vegas show or what have you.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't conspiracy theory-- it its verifiable simply by looking up their production companies on the web. Those 5 second logos you see before and after every movie or TV show are the logos of the production companies. There is nothing odd about it-- this is simply how Hollywood is able to routinize the delivery of massive projects year in and year out in an impressively small amount of time. It's all project management.

       An interesting side effect of this is that if you look at who works on which project in IMDB, and click to see what else other people have been in, you often see actors grouping together to be in the same shows and whatnot. This extends to the cast and crew too. Again, this is completely normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is interesting to think about though, is if this is a completely normal thing that happens in Hollywood, why can't it also be true of corporations and politics, as the OP says? Is the CEO of a big company like GM or Goldman Sachs really just a 'front man'? Is Donald Trump or Barack Obama a self contained, fully actualized human being with their own agency and rules, running the show? Or are they dependent on the entourage that enables them to act like they have agency and run the show?

       Right, no I see what you mean. I use Trump as the example too just Bc he‚Äôs the president now. I can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs a sentence I can type and it‚Äôs true. What a time to be alive. Crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the notion that powerful people would allow one person or even 5 people to have so much decision making power is silly. This is to satisfy our human need for a leader but it‚Äôs just the illusion. It‚Äôs not like Trump decides anything- Bc like I said.... look at Trump‚Ñ¢Ô∏è¬©Ô∏è over the years.... it‚Äôs not even always the same person playing the role.

       They are often gender neutral looking because they often play gender swap; play a female politician and then a male scientist. Play a male actor and then a female CEO...
      </p>
      <p>
       The worlds highest paid CEO (Sirius satellite radio etc) is Martine Rothblatt- a MTF transgender. This tells us a LOT about what‚Äôs going on. Part of the script. If they wanted us to think the brothers turned sisters who made the Matrix movies (Wachowskis) were just sisters they could have made them look more feminine and never showed them to us as brothers. But they didn‚Äôt. We met them as intelli-grunge brothers of the 90s turned 2000s androgynous turned 2015 transgender. It‚Äôs a microcosm if the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we see what we have been trained to call Predictive Programming we are just seeing foreshadowing as it would exist in Catcher in the Rye or The Giver or Hunger Games or any Stephen King novel... or any Hollywood movie. Foreshadowing in books exists for the same reason it exists in this reality because this reality is a script.

       Interesting you should bring up Martine Rothblatt... She is obsessed with downloading consciousness into an AI robot and has been attempting to do that with her partner who was dying or had died from a terminal disease. The end result was a terrifying semi-human torso-thing that basically wanted Martine to end it's 'life' because it was some monstrous semi-human-torso-thing but still human on some level and couldn't do basic things it desired to do like walk in the garden while holding Martine's hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a keynote of Martine at a conference somewhere a few years ago and she spoke about this freely, seemingly unaware of the basic monstrosity of it all.

       Horse shit. "They" are fucking incompetent. The idea it's all a well oiled machine where they control everything flies in direct opposition to everything I have ever seen from TPB. They can't do anything right, if a disaster hits tomorrow we are all going to die because they will fuck it up. They don't even learn, like the response to hurricanes last year was even more incompetent to how Katrina was handled. The government is incompetent and stupid.

       Nothing is scripted besides TV shows and people reading teleprompters, though believing everyone is an actor is most definitely a symptom of mental illness. Classic symptom.

       Personally, I think you should just be naturally more open to opposing beliefs than you come across as in your reply. You don‚Äôt know what goes on behind the veil. OP doesn‚Äôt know, either. We‚Äôre all working together to find out. They
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be actors. My logic says so, at least. When you understand the depths to which we‚Äôve been lied about the nature of things, it becomes obvious that the agenda being run behind the veil is ludicrously self serving. Who knows what those billionaire psychopaths do to our puppet politicians and Hollywood mind slaves. Truth is stranger than fiction.

       Politicians are actually making the decisions, not the CEOs of large corporations. They are not puppets, they are actual monarchs.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They are just actors" is an false excuse / disinfo to shift the blame to the shadow figure CEOs, while e.g. Trump is right there in the middle.

       FWIW ‚Äî this video is incredible at bringing seekers into a deep existential realization about the nature of our existence, which often leads the seeker to questioning the workings of the external world and how it can be what it currently is if
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       create our reality as a collective. My own mom had to turn this video off after 6 minutes because of fear. Her ego jumped in and attacked her, because her mind was absorbing information about what fear literally is (and how it is a controllable illusion, so long as the subject understands what fear is).

       Hmm... that is not a philosophy I would ever support but it is interesting to read about with a critical eye and an open mind and to see where it fits in the bigger picture. Thanks for the feedback.

       Maybe the goal of enlightenment is to master your own body/mind complex so well, that you release neurotransmitters + hormones at the perfect ratios that enable you to function at your highest potential. The "master" molecule IMO is DMT, which gets steadily released by the pineal gland (which gets calcified by fluoride), to create the enlightened state known as Samadhi
