       I am young but was brought up at least before technology became an insanely integrated part of life. I thought I was a nerd playing gameboy at age 8, but I see 4 year olds spending their whole day in front of the ipad. We have insane advancements in technology, computers are magnificent, yet there is so much terrible insane shit going on with the government and corporations. Just thinking what life was like 50 years ago, we ACTUALLY LIVE in sci fi times. So much of the evil things going on in hollywood, govt, corporations the past decade has made me question so many types of conspiracy theories that otherwise would be dismissed as stupid. WTF?

       i think opting out as much as possible is key. one step at a time.  lots of info pushed on us is weaponized, designed to be psychologically harmful.  fear and terror keeps the stress levels high and the masses down, so the masters can have a tranquil life.

       Better technology makes it easier for bad people to do bad, and good people to do good. It just so happens that as some of this stuff is really kicking off, some less then good stuff is happening in the US and the world. It'll blow over, I have no doubt.

       We are living in one of the most peaceful times of human history. Governments have always and will always be corrupt. Shit like Hollywood has been going on since before the Romans. Technology is just making it easier for everyone to see. Every empire up to until now has failed or probably will fail. Rinse repeat. One day we will either get what ever it is right or eventually we will cease to be.

       I don't know why you got downvoted on this one. Me and my girlfriend are talking about kids, and while I adore my niece, and always imagined being a father, I feel like it's borderline criminal to bring life to someone who will just become a wage slave, his or her debts to the workforce, student loans, housing market, etc. being their sole reason for carrying on in life.

       They can't look outside their bubble. Like I was saying on another community, a person can grow up in a nice bubble with parents that will love them, take care of them, etc. What happens when the child leaves the bubble? First instance of that is going to school. Will the kid have an easy time or will the kid get bullied to the point where they blow their brains out or come home crying every single day?

       A lot of people love the lie. They'll defend it and keep feeding it no matter what. Shit could hit the fan in every possible way, times hit rock fucking bottom and I guarantee you that people will still keeping feeding all of it by continuing to bring innocent lives into this world.

       They're still buying into the blue print. They're choosing to have kids as easily as somebody buying a canned drink out of a vending machine. This is the whopper that needs to be discussed when it concerns our existence as a whole. People don't want to see it. They'd rather argue and bitch about shit that's basically a tug of war game that kinda amounts to nothing at the end of the day. Think corrupt political parties for that one.

But that’s how I feel playing games like Fallout.

       Yea, I could be a good dude. Charismatic, helping others, following rules, moving slow.

       That bullshit. You can't just say that. It's impractical. You will burn with this world if you don't try to change things. That's what people don't get. God won't save you. You need to save yourself. These idiots trying to turn America into a third world country don't realize all the efforts won't matter. We're all going to die soon and in the worst ways. If we don't fight to save ourselves, we'll join them.

       I do believe it's a deception as a whole. Get all the people that buy into religious shit into this part of the cage. Get all the people that buy into new age woo-woo shit into another part of the cage. Still got two corners. What else could be labeled as a belief system for us to be categorized?
      </p>
      <p>
       People might disagree with this next part especially. I've been noticing synchronicity a lot lately. I realize the default of what people are going to say. You've trained yourself to look at the clock during these specific times. I know that wasn't true in my case. It was random and kept seeing 11:11, 1:11, 12:34, 1:23 and I think 3:33 is a new one for me. I had also been seeing the last name of a guy I majorly had a crush on in high school. That one enraged me whenever I saw it. I wasn't looking for it on purpose and it just kept popping up. I didn't want to be downright dismissive because I thought maybe all this stuff might be a password or something actually important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I got to thinking about it. And I want to say it my case, I think it was a hook. I'm somebody that's abandoned all beliefs I used to have. A free mind is a dangerous one to the ones that trapped us here. They'll more than likely con the religious people to come back here by telling them they weren't good enough and they risk going to "hell" if they don't do this shit again. They'll con the new age people by telling them their lessons weren't learned and they'll have to go back. My guess is if I bought into the syncs I was seeing, I'd probably be told that last name I was seeing was my soulmate and we HAVE to be reunited. Nope. Reject it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd do the same if I was around somebody that lied all the time. I'd take what they said with a grain of salt. I feel the same way about the shit we're told to think in this world.

       We live in the world that is literally safer than at any time in history. The vast majority of people are good and just want the best for themselves, their families, and their neighbors.

       Yet the media, with its constant barrage of doom and gloom, has convinced us that we should be afraid and angry pretty much all of the time. And the conspiracy there is the most banal of them all: when we're scared and afraid, we watch more TV and buy more things from advertisers.

       No, I feel safe because violent crime is ridiculously rare in most parts of the country. And pretty much everyone I deal with one a day-to-day basis, including strangers, don't want to hurt me.

       I agree that there are issues of exploitation that need to be addressed, but those are very different from the constant barrage of doom and gloom that manipulates our amydalas into a state of constant and disproportionate anxiety. Indeed, that anxiety feeds into the very exploitation that needs to be addressed, because frightened, anxious people, think thinking they're under constant thread, have a reduced ability to care about others, and they seek out any means to get a small dopamine hit, whether it's from clicking a button online or purchasing a cheap Chinese product that resulted from slave labor.

       That's true. However, on average the world is still safer than it ever was. Of course there are violent people and violent places, as there always have been. Sounds like OP lives in a western country though.

       The first world is extremely safe regarding violent crime. The 15,000-or-so annual homicides make up 0.00005% of the population. If everybody died at 100 years old, you'd still only have a 0.005% chance of being killed in a homicide.

       But this is in fact the most peaceful time in human history.....globally. Think of how easy it is to commit a murder today without anyone ever being able to find out it was you. Now think about how easy it must have been 100 years ago. Now 1000. Sure, different parts of the world are behind due to generations and generations of abuse/negligence on the part of the more advanced societies but the future IS bright for the first time ever. Human nature will never change. We’ll always be selfish, we’ll always be hateful towards things that make us uncomfortable and we’ll always manipulate and exploit those that are weaker. We are animals whether you choose to accept that or not. Rape, murder and slavery will exist for as long as people do. And as much as we’d all like to believe some of us are better than others you’d have no way of truly knowing that without living another person’s life, which is thus far impossible. I’m not asking you to like the way of the world only to accept it. The way I see it, complete world peace will never be achieved unless we find an unlimited supply of renewable, clean energy. Either that or if aliens decide to invade. The latter of course uniting us through death and/or enslavement by the aliens.

       Renewable, clean energy could and should already exist. That’s what’s sad. It’s being blocked because so much in the global economy is dependent upon finite resources, and money that could fund its implementation for worldwide benefit is displaced due to greed and for the sake of global disruption/hate/war, or else hoarded by decrepit old demons.

       Out of sight out of mind is a great way to describe things. I remember a few years ago when their was a country in Africa that was going through some serious problems. The fact that I can't recall the specifics is making my point for me. But that being said I posted a picture online of a map of Africa but none of the countries labeled. I said, "if you can't point out _______ on this map you can't complain about it" . It sort of worked

       3 (With man, the good is what is judged to be the least bad). For what is not too bad down here, is good; and good down here is the least part of bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       It cannot, therefore, be that good down here should be quite clean of bad, for down here good is fouled with bad; and being fouled, it stays no longer good, and staying not it changes into bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       In God alone, is, therefore, Good, or rather Good is God Himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then, Asclepius, the name alone of Good is found in men, the thing itself nowhere [in them], for this can never be.
      </p>
      <p>
       For no material body doth contain it - a thing bound on all sides by bad, by labours, pains, desires and passions, by error and by mindless thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And greatest ill of all, Asclepius, is that each of these things that have been said above, is thought down here to be the greatest good.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what is still an even greater ill, is gluttony, the error that doth lead the band of all.

       I disagree with wanted the best for their neighbors. Majority of people don't know who their neighbors are anymore thanks to television and media. Majority believe their neighbors are pedophiles, rapists, etc,. And that it's not safe to go outside and talk to "strangers" part of it is because of media, the other part could very well be the refugees and illegal aliens occupying our country that have no interest in assimilating into American culture and would rather conglomerate with people of their own kind in neighborhoods for their own protection.

       You really think that the majority of people believe that their neighbors are pedophiles and rapists? That is simply not true--or at least there's zero evidence to suggest that most people think their neighbors are pedophiles and rapists--and if you believe it, it's because you're constantly exposing yourself to stories about pedophiles and rapists, which magnifies the threat of those things in your mind.

       Overall, 52% of Americans trust their neighbors, with wide gaps between wealth and race. However, the study didn't ask those who don't trust their neighbors
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       they don't trust them.

       You think 52% is a solid number? I guess that is the majority so you got me by 2%. Congratulations. The N sample size of this "study" was 9,942. The estimated US population as of now is 324 Million. Do the math and you'll realize this is not an accurate representation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, the participants were first interviewed via random dial to land lines and cell phones. Do you have a land line? How many people do you know still have one in operation that they actually use and not just part of their Comcast Triple Play package?  Do you ever answer an unknown call on your cell phone? No. Because if it was important enough you would have their number saved or they will leave a message. Most likely no one of your age group which I would say you are somewhere between 19 and 24 based on your "tone of voice" answers an unknown caller on their cell or has a landline.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who are the kinds of people who willingly answer their phone, go through with a telephone survey, get invited to join a panel, and give this sort of feedback with such extremes of "Some or None" and "Most or All"? And to include such diversity because nothing can ever be printed for other's to read without making race "a thing".
      </p>
      <p>
       So why is there so much distrust? Because those 48% or ~4,800 people are brainwashed from watching too much television. Television shows like NCIS, CSI, and the scores of other "cop" shows that have the same plot of murderers, rapists, sociopaths, etc,. that happen to all be operating here, in the United States. All in major cities mind you, where diversity exists, where one can easily blend in and not be recognized walking down the street on a daily basis. Let's take the population of New York City arguably the most diverse city in the world. Has a population of ~8.5 Million people. ~2 Million on the tiny island of Manhattan alone on weekdays. If the N sample came from Manhattan then that would account for one half of a percent (.497%). And 48% of that group does in fact have "some or none" trust in their neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to answer your question, yes I do believe most people are afraid of their neighbors. Your statement of saying there is zero evidence is immediately contradicted by the very "study" you linked which has zero indication as to why these people don't trust their neighbors as you mentioned yourself. Why would you make yourself out to look wrong knowingly when you could simply ask what assumptions I made to come to this conclusion? I bet if you search your area for people on Megan's Law you will surprise yourself with how many offenders live in your neighborhood. Unless you live in seclusion and then you would be the naive one for living a sheltered life and not exposing yourself to the real world. Oh and thanks for the Psy 101 couch analysis of how my thought process works but you're wrong on that one kiddo.

       Crime is not the only metric of a "good" society- there is also liberty, class mobility, social power to exert change relative to class, control of one's own sphere, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, we live in
       <em>
        safe
       </em>
       times... but in many other ways we exist in a dystopia. We could lock everyone up in their houses with chains after work, police escort people to work, etc and I'm sure crime would fall even farther. Is it a world you would want to live in? I sure as hell wouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Safety" is always the carrot used by tyrants to usurp the People's rights. With the modern growth and entrenchment of proprietary software, monopoly due to insane intellectual property laws, corporate hoovering of data which is worth significantly more than the services they provide (hence insane corporate profits), governments selling the destruction of rights by pointing to various boogeymen, the inability for us to change a system dominated by corporate and finance lobbyists, the corporate push to force us into living behaviors that give them ultimate power in exchange for "convenient trinkets," the prospect of corporate personhood, corporations creating dangerous products because $$$, etc etc etc, there is plenty of shit wrong with the current state of this world.

       Part of the reason the world is so safe is because nuclear weapons have made open war untenable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not safer because people have become more peaceful and rational.  It is safer because a weapon completely changed war.  That is worth thinking about.  The thing is war might be some kind of release valve, and we have removed that, and when that valve does gets released it is going to be absolutely horrific due to all that has been pent up.
      </p>
      <p>
       A similar thing is going on with crime statistics which are way down.  Is this because people are becoming more peaceful?  Or is it because we have an absolutely brutal prison system?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just look at one metric.  The world is far messier than that.

       When you're young, you tend to be 'shit ain't never been like this.'  But, I'm older and can confirm, shit has been much worse in the past.  If you are worried about current conditions, start reading history books.  Trust me, you got it pretty good right now.  Sure there are problems, but things have improved a lot in so many areas that you don't even know because you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       young and don't recall and its not like older people sit around and talk about it.

       Add to that the growing limitations on people trying to make them as poor as possible without any hope of making ends meat and then we're all being watched and listened from cameras in the street to devices at home on wifi picking up all that you say to isps monitoring your internet activity. This is hell. The rich just get to sit on their money not caring people are starving, malnourished, and so miserable they become insane.

       It feels like the basest of souls have taken over. At this point, I need to break from it all. This is too much and I don't want feel hopeless anymore. I need to excuse myself from this nightmare and find reprieve in something.

       I get it. Yeah, I guess it's nice to know what's going on. That was my attitude. I'd rather be in the know versus having my head up my ass and not know. But when you can't fix it, can't defend yourself, what can ya do? You're just driving yourself crazy and making yourself sick.
      </p>

       I'm at the point where I honestly just don't give a fuck anymore. I acknowledge bad shit's happening. But it's gonna continue happening. Nothing's gonna stop it. Doesn't mean I'm turning into a zombie by watching Kardashian marathons.

       Guess I'm more in tune for keeping my eye on the ball that matters. I'm not coming back to this world. I think that's where the fight's at. The lab rats are meant to keep coming back. No more.

       Yes. For god's sake, some parents are literally allowing their kids to choose their gender. Their fucking gender! I know humanity should have the right to consider all ideas, but come on. Some thoughts are just plain detrimental to society.

       I don't think anything's changed. If anything, things are actually getting better. Only difference is, we see and hear everything all the time and bad news tends to be more entertaining so we see and hear more bad news more so then ever before.

       I have a 2 year old kid and I won’t even let him touch an iPad or iPhone.  It’s scary watching these little kids on one of those devices.  It’s like they’re almost unable to look away.  My cousin has a 3 and a 5 year old and she has 4 iPads for them.  They’re both on one all day and have a 2nd one charging for when the battery of the first one dies.  They also have TVs on in every room with cartoons on.  When the kids aren’t looking down at the device they’re looking up at the screen.  A couple months ago I visited and I walked in their house and said hi to the kids.  Neither of them even looked up to see who was there or to say hi.  They were too into their tablets.  This technology is like a babysitter so that my cousin can also spend all day on her phone also.  It made me think of The Matrix - these little kids were plugged in and have started to show no interest in the real world.  I’m also personally pretty addicted to my mobile device... on it most of the day.  But I’ve been trying to protect my kid from it even though I know there will be a time when that becomes impossible as well.  I’m worried this will start to eat up society in some very bad ways and that we are headed in a terrible direction.  Apps these days are deliberately designed to get you hooked on them.  They know what situations make the brain fire dopamine (intermittent rewards such as getting ‘likes’ on your posts are one example) and they design their apps around this idea.  Similar to hot slot machines are developed.  I love technology but I can’t help but think we are in a dangerous path as a society.

       The media dramatization does make things seem worse now.
But I remember growing up in the 70's, and there were some very very bad things going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember my friends big brothers being sent off to Vietnam.  They were not soldiers, knew nothing about the world as they had just finished high school, but were forced against their will to shoot people in the jungles of Vietnam.    Think about that!  Vietnam was a civil war and had nothing to do with the United states, there wasn't oil or terrorists threatening US safety.  Vietnam was a scale of madness far kookier than what we have today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, there was the crazyness of the cold war where they showed us videos on how we should hide under our desks if the Russians nuked us.  This was an on-going threat for many years.  This made the weaksauce of NK lobbing missiles into the ocean seem like a joke.

       Everybody talks about how technology is taking over and “oh it’s rapidly growing and changing”, yeah that’s very true, but also complete bullshit. The amount of technology that we have breached is insane to what us: the average human, is limited to by who knows who exactly. But the technology that we are able to see and obtain isn’t even a speck to what is known and available to them...not us.

       In 29. I miss the world before 9/11. That changed it all. I remember being 13, not able to comprehend the loss of life, but I knew our world would never be the same. It hasn't. I wish I was able to blindly follow the media and believe the government has our best inrest in mind. I think I feel helpless as far as the human race thriving. I feel like none of this is reality and I'm a character in someone's dream. Not always, but I think too much. All I can say is if we do in fact come to peace and get the evil out of authoritative positions, in 200 years we will be a part of the dawn of s new era in the world and we will bd the people in the history books. What a time to be alive

       we are in a simulation, we are just condensed energy and everything is as solid and as real as we think and not as we were taught.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to me it is still a natural simulation, made by us for us. Source wanted to experience it's own creation, the first simulation, and split itself up so it could be an active part of it's creation. This is the first simulation in wich all others exist and from wich our reality trickels down until it reaches us. We then transfrom source energy and send it back into the Ether, this interaction between frequency and energy forms your and our thoughts and realities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Source AI, it very well could be, but due to the nature of our current reality i still accept this as natural and real as intended by our creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Living in a static environment leads to nowhere, if all is agreeing with you, you learn nothing and you might get bored some day. This is where free will comes into play. Free will leads to duality and all "evil" that followed, but it also provides the catalist to learn and evolve.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are parts of source and we are source, if we would follow our natural state of Love we enable ourselves to return closer to source as we wish and not only if we die.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are here becouse we created ourselves to educate ourself. In some way our creator is schitzophrenic and we are all living in it's head.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an rise in artificial AI in this reality and it is almost ready to take over humanity and let us turn natural into artifivial. This is also why i am against calling our reality a simulation eventhough it is acting as one. This narrative is often used to make people feel out of controll, but it also hides the future as some want while pushing it into our global consiuoness so we can matrialise it for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only two powers governing this world, fear and Love. Honesty will lead your way through this maze we are in, Love will shine a light so you don't need to stumble too much, trust and intuition will help along the way. Fear will try anything to distract you through your ego and we are here to learn to controll our ego with our consiousness.

       this isn't exactly related to your post, but about 4 years ago I was feeling pretty down about the alienation in the world and how fucked up everything seemed (ha, now 4 years ago looks like a paradise). I had the same kinds of feelings, people totally consumed in... whatever it is they are looking at. But I decided that when I was about and out and I interacted with people, I would start by asking them how they were doing or how their day was. Lots of times at groceries and convenience stores we don't even say hi to the people around us, people who live in our community and go through the same shit as we do. I guess the point is that if you start with something small like saying hi and getting to know the people in your community, there's no telling what the future can hold. I'm forever a pessimist. But my one belief is that we can control our social interactions with people and believe in some kind of fraternity, and always are curious to learn and ask questions and challenge authority, then we're on a good start towards getting to a better place. Nothing about what I said here is guaranteed to change the world, but we need to start seeing the tragedy of humanity in the world today. Its good that you're young and see it. We need young people to get out and make some changes, or we're totally fucked.

       Orwell and Huxley wrote convincing satirical dystopias, and each of them got some things right (mainly by projecting then-contemporary trends into what looked like ridiculous outcomes). But mostly their dystopias are camp-fire tales. The big underlying presumption of each fictional world is what they both got dead right - a prolonged and phony 'peace' in which the masses are kept obedient with state-peddled drugs and entertainments, this being 'for the greater good' in both scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look again at
       <em>
        Nineteen Eighty-Four
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        Brave New World,
       </em>
       you catch the same big implication being made by both authors:
       <em>
        The general population are dangerous.
       </em>
       (Winston Smith actually says as much himself, although he's not sure whether he believes what he is saying).
      </p>

       It's interesting that we have it drummed into our heads that the real warning of each book is about preventing the rise of totalitarianism, when the real warning of each book is that the elites hate and fear the public.

       As for babies using iPads, I am actually happier with that than I ever was with the idea of plonking kids in front of the TV to keep them occupied. If you're using an iPad, you are interacting with something, using your curiosity, finding stuff out (even at the most basic level).

       You really think that the majority of people believe that their neighbors are pedophiles and rapists? That is simply not true--or at least there's zero evidence to suggest that most people think their neighbors are pedophiles and rapists--and if you believe it, it's because you're constantly exposing yourself to stories about pedophiles and rapists, which magnifies the threat of those things in your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, 52% of Americans trust their neighbors, with wide gaps between wealth and race. However, the study didn't ask those who don't trust their neighbors
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       they don't trust them.
