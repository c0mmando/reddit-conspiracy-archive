    <div class="md"><p>Trump is part of a different faction. He is still an Elite but he&#39;s not part of &quot;their&quot; Elite. It&#39;s like &quot;popular kids&quot; in HS fighting for class president. They may hate each other bitterly, but they are both still popular and sit at the popular kids lunch table. Trump just represents a different set of Elite interests, none of which are good for the People. But it is different than those of HRC and her ilk, and thus they are fighting among themselves for control. </p>

<p>This is possible but why destroy the MSMs since they are all control by the same people? If they didn&#39;t want him to win they would have brought down the hammer. If he won by accident, he would have sabotaged himself for their agenda. It would be very unlikely he would OUT all the fake news to put a spotlight on all the fake news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you state are surface issues my friend. The Economy is heading for a reckoning the likes of which hasn&#39;t been seen since the 30&#39;s. Immigration and deportations are distractions from the root causes of the economic crisis in the first place. And the DOJ investigations aren&#39;t going to go anywhere- time will tell but I can guarantee you they won&#39;t. </p>

<p>Trump is going to be blamed for the massive economic shitstorm that is going to strike before 2020. Here are some fundamental statistics that betray the &quot;confidence&quot; and &quot;gains&quot; of the economy&quot;</p>

<p><strong>copypasta from old comment of mine</strong></p>

<p>If you look at the underlying fundamentals, the economy is not on solid footing, and hasn&#39;t been since &#39;08.</p>

<p>For example- 41% of jobs lost in 08 were High Wage jobs, but only 30% of jobs created since then are High Wage. 37% of jobs lost in the Recession were Middle-Wage jobs, but only 26% of jobs created since then are Middle Wage. And 21% of all jobs lost in &#39;08 were low wage, service sector jobs...yet a staggering 44% of all jobs created since &#39;08 are low wage, service sector. This means millions of Americans are literally locked out of the Middle Class.</p>

<p>US Credit Card debt has reached record highs as of Q4 2017, at $1.023 Trillion. This is higher than in &#39;08. Student Loan debt is at 1.2 Trillion, and rising. Auto Debt is up to $1.2 Trillion, and delinquencies jumped in Q3 and Q4 from 6.5% to 7.2%. Mortgage debt is up, and the average new home price in the US is higher than in &#39;08, at $250,000. The economy isn&#39;t doing good. The US Middle Class is drowning in debt, and when &#39;08 part two hits, sooner rather than later, it is going to be a shit show of epic proportions. QE 1-3 only postponed the pain, so enjoy these times now, because the reckoning is coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ISIS is being replaced with Iran as the next bogeyman. I mentioned my skepticism to the DOJ investigations but I admit only time will tell. I think immigration is a red herring. And I am someone who believes in taxes that actually fund things- I want to see national college and healthcare. Regulations aren&#39;t a bad thing if they are used to break up monopolies and ensure free markets, and not just let Corporations grow ever larger and banks fuck us over all over again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about globalism vs. everyone else. It&#39;s about power. Some Elites derive their power from Globalism, others from Nationalism. It doesn&#39;t matter what &quot;system&quot; they advocate. None of them are for transferring power to the People.  Trump has appointed the former Goldman Sachs CFO Mnunchin as his Sec. Treasury and former Goldman CEO Gary Cohn as his Chief Economic Adviser. Obama had a cabinet approved by Citibank.  Trump is a different faction, it doesn&#39;t matter if they believe in globalism. They still believe in getting rich at the expense of the &quot;plebs&quot; of their own countries. None of them are your friend. They are all raping the Republic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law">In political science, Duverger&#39;s law holds that plurality-rule elections (such as first past the post) structured within single-member districts tend to favor a two-party system, whereas &quot;the double ballot majority system and proportional representation tend to favor multipartism&quot;.[1][2] The discovery of this tendency is attributed to Maurice Duverger, a French sociologist who observed the effect and recorded it in several papers published in the 1950s and 1960s. In the course of further research, other political scientists began calling the effect a &quot;law&quot; or principle.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok here&#39;s my take:</p>

<p>Ive had a running theory for quite some time, and like all (good ones anyways) theories, mine has evolved given new evidence. For brevity, I&#39;ll paraphrase an old saying, Its not he devil you see, but the devil you dont see. In this case, its the aforementioned companies of which we have so little insight. Why put Trump in charge? Because he&#39;s tearing the nation apart, little by little, and eventually it will lead to civil unrest, if not war.</p>

<p>Terrible, I know...but it makes sense.</p>

<p>If they goal is to &quot;thin the heard&quot; (which from my knowledge, is the ultimate goal) so to speak, then nuclear war or civil &quot;incidents&quot; is a starting point. You think they allowed this circus against their wishes? It was planned because they knew that while HRC would have done shitty things, Trump would do shitty thing too, only faster.</p>

<p>The Country is divided in so many ways, laws are beyond petty, greed and power are granted to those who abuse it openly, etiquette and civility are all but lost, and instead of looking at one another in the face we see each other via thumbnails and text. Small issues are enormous for a week, then forgotten or drowned out from ANOTHER scandal keeping us all distracted from the man (men/women) behind the curtain to care about the fact that while we do vote, the issues we vote on are what they tell us what we can vote on. We cant vote on whether or not we go to war, or how we impact the environment, or even what plant we want to smoke for christs sake!</p>

<p>Point is, we&#39;ve been divided, Trump is only widening those gaps tremendously and at an insane rate. Which, if my theory is right, is exactly what the powers that be want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama divided the country.  I am not sure why that isn&#39;t discussed.  The race division intensified so much during his reign.  Black vs white, rich vs poor, working class vs elites, etc.  Soros worked hard to flame the civil unrest.  Hillary&#39;s campaign was blatantly Soros funded in cash and ideas.  I thought the Bernie supporters were the violent group attacking Trump supporters.  Sadly, it was Soros/Clinton/DNC.  So, continue the narrative for me please with Trump&#39;s win.  (No sarcasm here, just trying to follow.). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the reply.</p>

<p>Racial divides have ALWAYS been part of this country, from the beginning, lets not kid one another about that. Saying Obama did it is fundamentally false, but you&#39;re entitled to your views. He may have shined a light on it, but what I mentioned before still holds true, Trump is doing more damage and faster. Sure, you can make the argument that Obama did some damage, and I may even agree with that, but the core point here is that Trump (may be) a pawn in the overarching theme.</p>

<p>The RNC vs. DNC is a distraction, members of both parties are shitty and they should all be subject to investigation. I was/am part of the Bernie supporters, I saw no violence but I did see frustration which COULD have lead to violence if provoked. You&#39;re right about the DNC and Clinton, though.</p>

<p>Trump supporters were tired of the same promises with zero follow through, Trump pandered to those people with no real intention of following through, the evidence supporting that is enormous so I&#39;ll let you fill in those gaps. That being said, they&#39;re now seeing that his mouth is exactly like all politicians, if its moving he&#39;s lying.</p>

<p>Yes, Blue and Ind voters were shat on by the DNC and DWS as they literally handed control of the DNC to HRC, but somehow claim they were still fair...gimme a break. This entire system is crumbling, red and blue, black and white, good and bad, horizontal and vertical.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll all lead to something bigger, the question is Who&#39;s pulling these strings? Cuz it sure as shit isnt the ones we think. end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, thats what was so frustrating about supporting Bernie. The odds, media, money, etc, were all mounted against it. Why? Cuz Bernies movement WAS actually against their (elites) wishes. You think they want an actual democracy? lol. theyd lose control within days. So blame the &quot;Berners&quot; for violence and muddy the waters.</p>

<p>Why are they so sure? Cuz theyve been doing this longer than most of us have been alive. Think about their funding, its literally infinite. They can put that money toward anything. Predictive programming, mass manipulation, you name it, Im sure they&#39;re pouring money into it.</p>

<p>Think of it this way, if you&#39;re playing a video game, you have two choices: 1. Play the game as intended, by the rules, see how far you get, take it for what it is. 2. Manipulate the game to your benefit at every opportunity because winning is fun, its just a game anyways, no harm no foul.</p>

<p>These people game the system much in the same way. Only they dont care that its not a game to us, it IS to them. Regardless of how the game ends, just like (for example) GTA 5, if you lose/die/jailed/fail mission who cares. Turn the game off or start over. You, as yourself, the person playing the game, are unharmed in any way. THAT&#39;s how they see this world. A game. They believe they are untouchable, and for all intents and purposes, they&#39;re right.</p>

Time Warner (CNN) crashed significantly losing about 10% of stock value around the time Trump coined the term Fake News, and Comcast (NBC)  crashed almost 20% but they rebounded in December. However the credibility of these institutions is forever tarnished, and the rise in the popularity of alternative media attests to such.<br/>
If Trump were part of the cabal, why would he be exposing the corruption of the Obama admin and the Clintons?  Why would he expose the corruption in the FBI?  Why would he be cutting ties with globalist elite at every turn?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think you assume too many things.</p>

<p>the propaganda network is not destroyed. far from it. its transforming, getting modernized.  they are augmenting it with online shills, ai bots, and propaganda units all the time.  the shift from the traditional media to internet also shifts the &#39;theater of operations&#39; so to speak.  think of q anon for example. thats a psyop not part of the traditional msm, but oh so successful.</p>

<p>also, i dont think the &#39;cabal&#39; has a problem with trump.  trump is connected to the mob and vatican, connected to zionists, to european nobility and other global elites (chinese, russians, saudis).  there is no rule you must be bleak as jeb to be liked by the cabal.  it seems trump was groomed from early on for a public office, by always maintaining a public profile through his life.  most billionaires seek privacy,  why not trump?</p>

<p>it seems to me like you believe in american  democracy, but me, not so much.</p>

<p>i do think that given the choice between trump and hillary, the americans picked the better candidate tho.</p>
