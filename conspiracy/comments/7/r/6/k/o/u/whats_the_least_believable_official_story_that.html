This could be anything from things from the early 1800s to 2018, i&#39;m really interested to hear what you guys have to say. Basically this a &quot;<strong>what are some common misconceptions about the world that are simply not true</strong>&quot;, kind of post.

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, it really does change your whole reality tho. This particular case was my first really introduction to conspiracies (about 11 years or so ago).

<p>This is true for some of us, but not for most.</p>

<p>The majority of &#39;conspiracy&#39; people get stuck pretty early on in their trip down the rabbit hole, which is why so few of them ever look into things like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6oTXmt4w70">History Hoax</a>.</p>

<p>If the authorities could get away with 9/11, and most people will remain willfully ignorant about even the blatant problems with the official story, why would it be so difficult for the authorities to lie about history as well (and get away with it)?</p>

<p>The ones that REALLY crack me up though are the ones that blame shrapnel from the planes hitting the first two buildings demolishing a fucking skyscraper! The planes that vaporized on impact somehow managed to fling enough shrapnel across the street with enough force to destroy a building. Yet we&#39;re the crazy ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to expose myself as an incorrigible nut with this one...</p>

<p>The official &quot;unidentified lone maniac&quot; version of the Jack the Ripper killings. I think Stephen Knight was definitely onto something, and got some major bits of his theory absolutely correct.</p>

<p>The striking thing that convinced me was his demonstration that, far from being unrelated killings, all the &#39;canonical&#39; Ripper victims lived in very close proximity to each other (even by inner London standards of the day) and the last two victims <em>went by the same name.</em></p>

<p>But if you read any of the various fan sites about Jack the Ripper theories, they all write off Knight&#39;s work as discredited. Many years later, I am still searching for the work that &#39;discredited&#39; Knight&#39;s theory. It&#39;s been a decade now, and I&#39;ve still not found it or found anyone who can tell me where to look for it.</p>
