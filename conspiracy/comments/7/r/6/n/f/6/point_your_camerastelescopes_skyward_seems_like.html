       If there really is something to all the recent mysterious launches, meteors, booms, false missile alarms i think its time that people accelerate their efforts to not only watch the skies but capture and catalog anything of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       If several people, miles apart can capture the same thing in high quality, that would help get rid of the hoax noise. Most peoples phones record at least 1080p with HDR and image stabilization now, so make sure whatever you record with is set up correctly for capturing stuff in varying lighting conditions at high quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously i dont mean for people to go driving and recording with a phone or anything stupid or dangerous though. More like, if you live in a rural area without all the light pollution i have where i live, or if you're already a satellite watcher or astronomer or something, keep your eyes peeled. If youre able to go out in your yard and see stars(cant where i live) see if anything weird flies by.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you record the night sky usually, make sure you check the recordings fotr anything interesting. Even peoples' security cameras have been getting interesting flashes and meteors, so if you live in those areas, check your security DVR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, plane watchers should keep an eye on atypical military plane activity. Speaking of that, i have a friend in California who heard what he thought were sonic booms at 2AM a couple nights ago. Anyone in California know what thats about?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully with enough people watching we can get a better idea of what's really going on, be it aliens, missiles, false flags etc.

       Not much going on right now. Currently figuring out an exact orbit for the recent top secret launch of NROL-47.
      </p>
      <p>
       ZUMA has failed to show up as expected, so it is looking very likely that it's sitting somewhere at the bottom of the Indian Ocean right now.

       Based on initial estimate of its orbit taken from the launch inclination and when S2 was spotted, it should have shown up in the sky at certain locations and times. It didn't. It has yet to be spotted by anyone as far as I know.

       Do you think its gone?  The fact that a spy satellite would be claimed to have been lost almost seems too obvious as a conspiracy. I believe that everything up until the satellite's separation from stage 2 is documented as having happened successfully, so the question of whether Northrup Grummans satellite really failed to separate and burned up on re-entry has been in doubt with me.

       I know this means nothing  but I had a dream of meteors blasting through the skies like five days ago, so when I was saw the news from Michigan the other day I was kind of shook. I don't want anything terrible to happen but it's interesting to have some weird phenomena going that is more "worldly" than human intereference.

       Here's how I understand it:
       <br/>
       Time doesn't separate things and events. All events and all things are inherently connected over time. It's just that from a solely 3 dimensional, physical perspective it appears that every thing and every event is isolated from one another. Consciousness/the conscious field (aka: the inherent, multidimensional connection between all things, which therefore gives rise to perspective relativity) exists on all dimensions, connecting all things and events to each other. Connecting every thing and event in this universe from "beginning" to "end", and every other thing and event from every other possible universe from beginning to end etc etc etc, and as it funnels down through dimensions and universes to our universe (aka: our relative conscious interference pattern), it forms nodes at all "things". And where it funnels down into life - and specifically human life - since the brain is wired in such the way that it is, it gives rise to self awareness at each of those respective nodes. Human consciousness is just a node in the universal conscious interference pattern. A collapsing of the absolute wave function. Wherein "the absolute" wave function is the ground state of
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       : Brahman/the absolute/God.
       <br/>
       We can immediately see each surrounding node (each other person, animal, plant, object etc: every physical "thing") due to them all existing, respectively, at the same physical dimension that we do, but it takes a change in perspective to view the nodes in non-physical events (Like how nodes on a vibrating string can "see" those immediately next to it, but it would require a change in perspective - like seeing the string from above - to see the whole string and how all its individual nodes are just parts of the whole). It also takes a change in perspective to view the connection between respective "isolated" nodes in our universe, and we can do this from a 3d perspective by viewing things
       <em>
        over the course of time
       </em>
       , or alternatively by utilising transcendental states: states in which we can project our relative human consciousness back up the funnel and view things from higher dimensions. We can directly access these states through meditation, dreaming, psychedelics, or astral projection. But aspects of these higher dimensional perspectives naturally "leak" into our lives on occasion anyway, either through dreams, synchronicities, or intuition etc. To an individual uneducated/inexperienced in the topic these things can be explained away by "coincidence", but that's just an interpretation/misrepresentation based on ignorance to the bigger picture. Those educated and experienced (yogis, gurus, quantum physicists, astral projectors, psychonauts) may recognise these as a artifacts of higher dimensional connection, and if they act accordingly they may utilise these artifacts to the advantage of either themselves or others.

       Once, while sleeping, I woke from my dream but I couldn't see anything. It was like I was standing in an empty black void, but I could hear children screaming and general chaos happening around me. Someone yelled, "there's one over here!" And I felt someone sort of lifting me up and cradling my head. I experienced this all with the same level of consciousness as being awake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I "woke up". I found out a few hours later that a major earthquake had hit Nepal at the time I'd been having that experience.

       SoCal resident here, yes we heard a distinct “boom-boom” at 2A a few nights ago. I thought someone was pounding on the front door. Reminiscent of the shuttle landing at Edwards back in the 80’s/90’s.

       The day before yesterday before the snow storm another redditor noted heavier than normal chem trailing happening in his area. I also noticed it as well in my area. Interestingly there was a winter storm on the way. That day it occurred to me is something going on that “they”need cover for? Coincidentally the local news kept telling the public stay inside, stay off the roads, it’s Not safe! I think there definitely is something they don’t want us to notice and I wonder if chem trails are somehow involved.
