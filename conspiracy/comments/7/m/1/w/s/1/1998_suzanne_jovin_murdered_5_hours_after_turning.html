       The M.O. sounds totally opposite of CIA assassin though.  Stabbed 17 times with part of the knife still stuck in her head?

       murder by knife is its own M.O. makes it look more random and personal than a gun. i have not read the CIA assassin handbook though, so cannot say for sure.

       Not to be crass, but my first question is “was the victim personally close or romantic to the professor ?”.  The answer to that question sets up: Did the professor share classified information with the victim ? Or, did the professor attempt to leak information via the victim’s thesis?

       I think he was attempting to leak something from her thesis. I doubt they were romantically involved, that seemed like a smear planted in the media. I couldn't find any source who had a name that told that story of them being romantically linked.

       I had a Top Secret clearance with the Marine Corps after I conducted a lateral move from infantry to Explosive Ordinance Disposal and I didn't have a perfect background or finances. They really aren't hard to get as long as you're honest with the investigators and they determine that you dont pose a threat to national security.

       Five levels above top secret lol. There is only one "classification" higher than TS and that's SAP programs. Of SAP programs, there are two sub categories - acknowledged and unacknowledged. SAP isn't really even considered a higher classification - just more restrictions on that TS/SCI classified info.

       The poster above you is correct.   All a civilian needs to know ,is that this sort of thing  works on a Need to know basis.  Even if someone had clearance above any level known ,or unknown does NOT mean they can just be read in on everything
       <strong>
        or so a little bird told me -
       </strong>
       It’s not something I personally need to discuss on an open forum.   But point being is that not everyone knows everything about clearances and what not.
       <br/>
       Once SAP was starting to become common in the media ,well ,let’s just say only a few ppl know beyond that. :)

       Lol the us government only has 3 levels of classification. Confidential. Secret. Top secret. We have modifiers at each level. Even unclassified has modifiers that precent it's disclosure. For instance my criminal intelligence case file that my CID office had when I did that in the army was marked for official use only - law enforcement sensitive and thus while not classified was still prevented from disclosure under foia
      </p>
      <p>
       Secret and top secret have code word that you would need to have an official need to know. Bot everyone with a secret can see every secret document, same with TS. There is a modifier that grants you access to special compartmented information and to special access projects but those are still top secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had a top secret / sci that doesn't mean I can read anything that's secret.

       Was it an undergrad thesis? 21 pages is pretty short for a thesis and if it's undergrad it's highly unlikely that it was of a quality that many people would see it.

       Theses are usually 60 pages, in my experience and I don't think anyone outside of advisors reads them. Murder seems a little extreme but who knows

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2012, former Yale University students posited a deceased acquaintance as the likely murderer. He's only been identified as Billy, but a brief internet search using the available info reveals his real name fairly quickly (which I will not reveal here, because fuck off). Their claim is based on a number of factors. Billy had a number of mental problems, and was cited by multiple sources to have severe anger issues when it came to women, screaming loudly at one who rejected his advances. He drove women nuts at his job due to his bizarre behavior. A woman reached the end of her rope with incessant pursuit of her, and a police officer had to tell him that he was not behaving appropriately. Billy confided to a friend that he was obsessed with the murder, convinced that he was about to be arrested at the time of his suicide. He believed that this obsession prevented him from having a healthy relationship with a woman. On the night of the murder, he told his roommate that "they'll never catch me", which his roommate ignored as an inappropriate joke. When one of the student investigators contacted his parents upon Billy's death, they instantly knew he was inquiring about Jovin and were wiping his computers. He, like Jovin, spoke German and was a regular at the Yale campus, as he was enrolled as a graduate architectural student. His training as an architect means that he regularly carried X-ACTO knives, which could potentially be the source of the broken tip found in Jovin's skull. He owned a green jacket that might serve as a match to the one on the fleeing suspect. Prior to his very sudden (presumed) suicide, he called a lawyer to inquire about transferring assets to his niece, as "they're out to get me, they're closing in." Conversely, he e-mailed a friend in March 2012 stating that he had nothing to do with the murder. Police have declined to investigate Billy thus far.

       He may only have read no more than her introductory hypothesis about who OBL was and was actually working for which she intended to prove by some convincing research and connections she had discovered that others had missed that were contained in the rest of her paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since he was in a position to know the truth about that as well as being charged with keeping it a secret at any and all costs both she and her paper had to disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The paper could always be altered to cover-up the truth in it, but what Jovin obviously knew and was convinced by and wrote to convince others, would have necessitated silencing her before she told too many others about it. So yes, you could build a plausible scenario for that.

       Nothing says "professional hit" like stabbing someone 17 times in the skull, then slitting their throat. Only an expert would know that's fatal.

       So where is the evidence of the OBL connection? There isn’t a # 
Citation for that part on the Wiki page and the first two sources don’t say anything about OBL despite it being the first sentence on the Wiki page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: it appears the kiloton blog attributes the OBL connection to Yale Hearld (12/06/02). So 6 years before she was murdered? Or wrong date of publication? Either way, the lack of traceability for the OBL link is concerning

       I have a theory I'm very confident in:
      </p>
      <p>
       Van de Velde was Naval intelligence, and he/ONI had an axe to grind with the CIA. He was helping Jovin write a paper on Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda's links to the CIA, Saudi, Pakistan, Israel, etc. In this paper, by proxy he was trying to publish information on behalf of the Office of Naval Intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fearing for his career and not trying to start an inter-agency conflict, Van de Velde chose to publish it through a student.
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA operatives got wind of this through one of their spies in the Yale faculty. Thus, they hatched a plan to make contact with Jovin through an agent who could pass for a Yale student. This "student" befriended Jovin and was able to steal a draft of the paper. After examination by CIA operatives, they determined the paper was potentially harmful to the CIA and "national security."
      </p>
      <p>
       So this triggered the CIA's threat elimination mechanism, and they carried out the murder of Jovin. The "student" asked to borrow the books so that they could set up a safe place execute Jovin. When Jovin asked for the books back, the "student" asked if she could meet him in an area that would be dark and quiet that time of night.
      </p>
      <p>
       The van lurked in the area where they were supposed to meet. When Jovin was spotted, the killer (likely not the "student") exited the van and began stalking her. The van drove down the street ahead of Jovin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The killer caught up to her at the corner of Edge Hill and East Rock, where he stabbed her 17 times and cut her throat. The killer then sprinted down the street and hopped in the tan getaway van.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly after the murder, a CIA operative leaked Van de Velde's name to a contact at the New Haven Register. The Register goes on to publish information directly from the CIA falsely suggesting an affair was going on between Jovin and Va de Velde and establishing James Van de Velde as the prime suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other media outlets pick up these smears and Van de Velde's academic career is destroyed, he disappears from the public eye, and the message to the Office of Naval Intelligence is sent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA further drove home their message to the Navy a couple of years later:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Jovin, friends say, began the semester like many students, enthralled with Van de Velde. Indeed, she was impressed enough that she decided to do her senior essay with him as her adviser—actually, she had taken the unusual step of writing two senior essays, the other in international studies. She chose a subject in Van de Velde’s area of expertise: the international terrorist Osama bin Laden, who is believed to have masterminded the bombing of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Van de Velde appeared equally taken with Jovin. “I think he liked Suzanne’s enthusiasm. It was flattering that a student would be so deeply involved in his topic,” says a student who was in the class.
       </p>
       <p>
        At some point in the semester, however, Jovin’s enthusiasm seemed to falter. She didn’t go on either of the two field trips. “She thought they were a waste of her time,” says a friend of hers. She also had reservations about a project on terrorism. The project, which was optional but which the class had voted to pursue, involved using the Internet to show how easy it would be for a terrorist to get information to create a weapon of mass destruction. “We decided to plan to use chemicals in a plane that we’d fly over the Super Bowl in Miami,” says one student. “We figured everything out except how much water to put in the chemical to make it fall from the plane—no one would give us the proportions for that.”

       The British media agency disclosed that the arrests have been followed by ‘interrogations’ which a source said were being carried out by ‘American mercenaries’ brought in to work for the 32-year-old crown prince, who is now the kingdom’s most powerful figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘They are beating them, torturing them, slapping them, insulting them. They want to break them down,’ the source shared.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to sources quoted by Dailymail, ‘Blackwater’ has been named as the firm involved, and the claim of its presence in Saudi Arabia has also been made on Arabic social media, and by Lebanon’s president.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Lebanese authorities have unconfirmed information that the Blackwater firm is guarding Hariri and his family – not official Saudi security forces,” tweeted Michel Aoun, the President of Lebanon, last Wednesday.
      </p>
      <p>
       A high-profile Saudi whistleblower, one who is said to have inside information, also claimed Salman has brought in at least 150 ‘Blackwater’ guards. “The first group of Blackwater mercenaries arrived in Saudi Arabia a week after the toppling of bin Nayef [Salman’s predecessor as crown prince]”, he tweeted.
      </p>
      <p>
       “One of the most important tasks of these aggregates are escorting and guarding bin Salman (especially confidential visits) and implementation of important and sensitive commands in addition to guarding the Princes and officials cut the ways their communication with the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The firm’s successor, Academi, strongly denies even being in Saudi Arabia and says it does not engage in torture, illegal for any US citizen to commit anywhere in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Saudi crown prince, according to the source, has also confiscated more than $194 billion from the bank accounts and seized assets of those arrested. The source further shared that in the shaky atmosphere in the kingdom, Prince Mohammed has bypassed the normal security forces in keeping the princes and other billionaires at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh.
      </p>
      <p>
       “All the guards in charge are private security because MBS (Mohammed Bin Salman) doesn’t want Saudi officers there who have been saluting those detainees all their lives,’ said the source.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Outside the hotels where they are being detained you see the armoured vehicles of the Saudi special forces. But inside, it’s a private security company. They’ve transferred all the guys from Abu Dhabi. Now they are in charge of everything.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The source continues that Salman, often referred to by his initials MBS, is conducting some of the interrogations himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       “When it’s something big he asks them questions, he speaks to them very nicely in the interrogation, and then he leaves the room, and the mercenaries go in. The prisoners are slapped, insulted, hung up, tortured.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The source says the crown prince is desperate to assert his authority through fear and wants to uncover an alleged network of foreign officials who have taken bribes from the Saudi princes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The source confirmed that the name ‘Blackwater’ is being circulated as the company providing the mercenaries; the controversial private security company, however, no longer exists under that name and is now known as Academi.
      </p>
      <p>
       A spokesperson for Constellis, Academi’s parent company, denied the claims. The spokesperson told Dailymail that it has no presence in Saudi Arabia and does not carry out interrogations. “Constellis through Academi does not now or have we ever provided interrogative services,’ they said.
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘We do not provide security services in KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), we have no contact or connection with any government official or private party regarding this allegation.’
      </p>
      <p>
       When asked if Academi workers were involved in any kind of violence during these interrogations, the spokesperson said: ‘No. Academi has no presence in KSA. We do not have interrogators, nor do we provide any interrogators, advisors or other similar services.’
      </p>
      <p>
       They added: ‘Academi does not participate in interrogative services for any government or private customer. Academi has a zero tolerance policy for violence. We operate legally, morally, ethically and in compliance with local and US laws.’
      </p>
      <p>
       The name Blackwater, however, has previously surfaced in the Middle East in the wake of the round-up.

      <p>
       The Lebanese President tweeted that the country’s former prime minister Saad Hariri was being detained in Riyadh by Blackwater guards, but later deleted the tweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘Lebanese authorities have unconfirmed information that the Blackwater firm is guarding Hariri and his family – not official Saudi security forces,’ Michel Aoun, the President of Lebanon, tweeted last Wednesday.
      </p>
      <p>
       A high-profile Saudi twitter account, @ Ahdjadid, which posts what is said to be inside information, also claimed Salman has brought in at least 150 ‘Blackwater’ guards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saudi whistleblower Ahdjadid tweeted saying, ‘The first group of Blackwater mercenaries arrived in Saudi Arabia a week after the toppling of bin Nayef [Salman’s predecessor as crown prince].
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘They were around 150 fighters. Bin Salman sent some of them to secure bin Nayef’s place of detention and the rest he used for his own protection.’
