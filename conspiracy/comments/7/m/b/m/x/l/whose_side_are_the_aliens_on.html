    <div class="md"><p>Wow you took a big leap there. Im sorry i just can’t get on board with beings that promote oneness are dojng so to decieve us and are actually evil demons.
You speak about drugs and interdimensional beings, the drug youre talking about is DMT which i have studied a lot. Dmt is natually occuring in every living thing including plants and the human brain, a huge surge is released at birth and at death and during orgasm and through deliberate consumption of this molecule we can see these beings. For me this points to them actually being our creators, gods, angels whatever you’d like to call them.
When seeing these beings people also describe a feeling of all encompasing love, peace and light. 
I recomend watching DMT the spirit molecule if you havent already, its on netflix</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into the story Enki and Enlil. The Sumerian story says there is a power struggle between them, they are half brothers. Enki aka Lucifer (and several other names) is the creator of man through DNA manipulation and his clan including Thoth his son, has tried to help humans. Enlil aka Yahweh (goes by several other names as well depending on the culture) tried destroy humans several times. So to answer your question, it depends which ones you are talking about. All this information comes directly from the Sumerians. It&#39;s fascinating to me and answers a bunch of questions that the Bible fails to address. Look into Gerald Clark, he&#39;s incredibly knowledgeable about this topic.</p>
