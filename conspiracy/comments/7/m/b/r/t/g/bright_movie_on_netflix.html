<p>Have you all seen Bright on Netflix. A new movie with Will Smith just dropped about New World Order, Classism, Power Structures the Second Coming. </p>

<p>It just feels like weird timing.</p>

<p>Why does it seem like this movie comes out now of all times with everything going on the world.</p>

<p>On a different note, the Critics gave it horrible raitings calling it the worst movie of the year, but Audiences love it giving it a 90% positive. </p>

<p>Basically it’s because Netflix making their movies bypasses the theater sham the studios have money in </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but bad is bad. There are people who like bad things, for sure. But that doesn&#39;t empirically make the bad thing good. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s why &quot;Bright&quot; is bad:</p>

<p>a. Totally unoriginal other than the shoehorned fantasy elements, which aren&#39;t even nearly played up enough. </p>

<p>b. Terrible script with lame dialog.</p>

<p>c. Relentless &quot;fuck&quot;s in the script are both off-putting and used to make the story seem &quot;edgy&quot; and &quot;adult&quot; when actually it&#39;s just wallpapering how lame the script is and how adolescent the writer.</p>

<p>d. Loaded with Deep State social programming, from supernatural acceptance to overplaying inter-racial and inter-species relationships to relentless profanity presented as normalized conversation. </p>

<p>e. Netflix is the new Hollywood. This may be true, actually, but in the worst possible way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dog the part where the wheel chair crew showed up in the strip club I fucking lost it. It was so random like we all know the street gang isn&#39;t going to be doing shit and they just kept showing up it was ridiculous.

    <div class="md"><p>Because explaining yourself helps to better understand the person&#39;s point of view. Your only opinion is illuminati illuminati, yet you don&#39;t explain anything else you like about the movie.</p>

<p>So how can we understand your reason for enjoying this if you aren&#39;t willing to perform the same level of critical thinking that the person who responded with their reasons did.</p>

<p>Instead you attack him for expressing why he didn&#39;t like the film even though that&#39;s exactly how you learn to understand someones point of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anybody remember &quot;Alien Nation&quot;? It was a mediocre movie, then a shitty TV show. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Nation_(film)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Nation_(film)</a></p>

<p>I watched an hour of &quot;Bright,&quot; shut it off before finishing, it sucked so bad. It was like a lame TV series pilot that tosses Orcs and Elves into the story to make it seem fresh.</p>

<p>The guy who wrote it, Max Landis, is like a piece of shit poster boy for everything that&#39;s wrong with Hollywood. A talentless hack who&#39;s made it only through nepotism (his dad is John Landis), recently outed as a serial predator of young women. </p>

<p>Skip the movie. It sucks. I&#39;m on the verge of canceling Netflix anyway, the programming has gotten to be such obvious....&quot;programming.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To much going on, saying everything rather than showing. It was poorly written. The whole racism towards the Orc could of easily been done without hammering it into the audience like we&#39;re idiots.</p>

<p>Seriously they spend the whole First scene expressing just how racist Will Smith is not only to Orcs but all &quot;Mythological&quot; creatures. Such a likeable guy, he kills a pixie in cold blood. . . a pixie that looks more like a rabid dog, and don&#39;t even get me started on that stupid ass &quot;jump scare&quot; with the pixie again.</p>

<p>Movie would of gained some points had they actually let the partner die, that would of been a kill dark turn for the story but no, asspull to save them.</p>

Ayer&#39;s movies bore the shit out of me or are so fucking intellectually retarded they make me angry. Suicide Squad fucking raked in the dough because it somehow captured the hearts and minds of some degenerate focus group. This group is huge and they seem to be the same people that pack theaters for the fast and furious movies. To me Ayer is just an edgy tattooier Michael Bay at this point.</p>
