<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRxiYfLjogs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRxiYfLjogs</a>
The Simpsons predicted Trump being president, and they have predicted him being assassinated. And the video is dated July 21!</p>

<p>Tecumseh’s curse: Every president elected in the year divisible by 20 dies in office. Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush actually did not die, but there was an attempted assassination on them.</p>

<p>Donald Trump looked at the Solar Eclipse without glasses on August 21, 2017 at the age of 71. 71 months later is July 21, 2023. July 21 is 7/21. 7 years after 2017 is 2024, and 21 years after 2024 is 2045, and 2024 and 2045 are the dates of the next solar eclipses.</p>

<p>-Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 15, 1865. (Aries) John Wilkes Booth was assassinated on April 26, 1865 (Taurus) 
-John Wilkes Booth was age 26 on April 26, 1965
-John F Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Lee Harvey Oswald was assassinated on November 24, 1963 (Sagittarius)
 -Lee Harvey Oswald was age 24 on November 24, 1963
-Donald Trump will be assassinated on July 21, 2023. (Cancer) His assassin will be killed on July 25, 2023 (Leo) 
-Trump’s assassin will be age 25 on July 25, 2023</p>

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald was killed on 11/24. 11 days after Abraham Lincoln was killed, his assassin was, 2 days after JFK was killed, his assassin was, and 4 days after trump was killed, his assassin will be.</p>

<p>Takes note that in each situation, The assassin is killed in the next zodiac sign. Kennedy is 8-9, Trump is 4-5, so that points toward the 8/9/45 or August 9, 2045 Alien Invasion</p>

<p>John Wilkes Booth bwas born in 1838. Lee Harvey Oswald was born in 1939
38 + 39 = 77. 18 + 19 = 37. Trump will be 77 years old and 37 days old on July 21, 2023</p>

<p>Kennedy was assassinated in the year of the rabbit. Trump will also be assassinated in the year of the rabbit. There is a common joke in the “coincidences” between Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy, which is that Abraham Lincoln was in Monroe, Maryland, and John F Kennedy was in Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn Monroe was in playboy, which is represented by a bunny, or rabbit! Also, Hugh Hefner died 4 days after  September 23rd, 2017, the revelation 12 sign, and 4 days before October 1st, the Las Vegas Shooting. The Rabbit is the 4th sign in the Chinese Zodiac. More importantly, Hugh Hefner died 37 days after the August 21, 2017 solar eclipse! And, Donald Trump was featured on the playboy cover in 1990, which is 33 years before 2023!</p>

<p>In Shadow the hedgehog, there is a level called “Air Fleet” In which you must kill the president.  It is the 14th level of the game, (Trump is born on June 14th) and it is either the 29th or 35th mission in the game, depending if you count the boss fights (Kennedy born May 29, 35th president.) The other mission, FYI, has you killing the aliens, and there are 35 of them. Anyway, in the very beginning, the character “Tails” is telling you all about the threat the president. Tails is very golden, like Donald Trump’s hair. Also “Tails” and “Trump” start with the letter “T”. Lastly, Tails is a Fox, and a common story is of the Fox and the Hare! A Hare is a rabbit!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ1zO3Tm6ME">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ1zO3Tm6ME</a></p>

<p>Also, in Shadow the Hedgehog, there are a total of 326 story endings you can get, depending on the missions you go through. Kennedy was killed on November 22nd, the 326th day of the year! </p>

<p>In Pokémon, the 721st Pokémon is Volcanion, who is a water and fire type. Cancer is a water sign and Leo is a fire sign. Trump will be assassinated on July 21, 2023 (Cancer/Water Sign) and his assassin will be killed on July 25, 2023. (Leo/Fire Sign)</p>

<p>Kennedy is killed on 11/22, and 11 + 22 = 33. Trump is killed on 7/21, which is 7 + 21 = 28
33 and 28 have the correlation with 2012 and 2017.</p>

<p>Midpoint of July 21st and November 22nd is September 21st, which is the date of Ronald Reagan’s alien speech at the UN. Ronald Reagan was the 40th president, right between 35th president Kennedy and 45th president Trump.</p>

<p>John Hinckley Jr., Reagan’s assassin, was born on May 29, 1955, which is the same birthday as JFK!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be the smart ass here, but the Simpsons never predicted that Donald Trump was elected president nor predicted that he will be dead.</p>

<p>Also, this video is pure bullshit:
-Computer generated voice;
-Scary/distressing background music;
-Image edited in such a way to show the world this is a raw and genuine find.
And honestly, I don&#39;t know why should I trust such a propaganda.</p>
