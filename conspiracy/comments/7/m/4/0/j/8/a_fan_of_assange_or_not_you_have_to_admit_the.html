    <div class="md"><p>I agree totally but its been odd since October.  Its hard to discuss because unless you are like us who follow this stuff no one knows or follows it at all in the mainstream world.  How many people in the mainstream know about Q or the Awans or even Seth Rich.  Its hard to discuss in that manner because everyone that is talking about it, us, have no idea what happened.  </p>

<p>Theres speculation from people now that Trump gave him a pardon or that he&#39;s in protective custody and gave Trump all his info on the leak and Hillary.  </p>

<p>Theres speculation he&#39;s preparing for a huge leak of info.  But who knows.  Even deciding which twitter is his or is real is impossible to do.  </p>

<p>I agree with you that what happened in October was beyond bizarre and the fact it hasnt been addressed only reinforces that.  But then why would Pilger, Amy Goodman, Hannity and others play along with the game if he was captured?<br/>
Or the stuff about how he&#39;s unwilling or unable to confirm if Seth Rich was the leaker.  </p>

<p>He could have ended the Trump Russia lies before the election even happened, yet he hasnt given us or authorities evidence.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve long felt he had the 33,000 emails or all of the contents of the Wiener laptop or absolute proof of Seth Rich, or even pizzagate, yet he&#39;s held on to it for some reason  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody probably tried searching for Assange and accidently tweeted it.</p>

<p>The Navy Twitter account isn&#39;t run by some top secret Naval unit. It&#39;s some 28 year old Navy Lieutenant who doesn&#39;t have access to very much information. The military is compartmentalized and the last guy you&#39;d tell top secret info to is the one who has access to twitter.</p>

<p>His Twitter shutting down is much more interesting and is also probably why some Naval officer who is probably in the dog house tried searching him.</p>

<p>Precommitment hashes that didn&#39;t match the files which followed and converted into vanity bitcoin addresses containing the words keys, fatal and hell.</p>

<p>Not to mention the codes &quot;Help him&quot; message inserted into misspelled tweets.</p>

<p>Oh ye they also made the websites file-list public for the first time and changed all the dates to 1984.</p>

<p>Oh ye, they took down their onion site and revoked their PGP keys.</p>

<p>So... If you still think that account is Julian or think anything after October isn&#39;t a psyop you&#39;re just plain stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange has always been in a weird state for me since seeing questionable footage of him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sbT3_9dJY4&amp;amp;t=908s">RT</a> (multiple times there are weird glitches that simply unexplainable without video manipulation) and also on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV_dJaLpFJc">Hannity</a>.  I think since at least the power cut Assange has been (forced) collaborating with some group to further their agenda.  Does this discount him or WikiLeaks as a whole?  Of course not--if you want to know the truth about yourself, ask your enemy.  It&#39;s still unclear, to me, what the whole timeline is for Assange, who he&#39;s being coerced to collaborate with, why, and how this most recent development fits in.  I personally think some Russian group has at the very least coerced Assange into allowing them to create &quot;puppet&quot; videos of him, as evidenced by the RT interviews he&#39;s never personally outed as at least tampered with.  If you want to really question everything, maybe Assange has been dead since late 2016 and his name and image have been used as a tool by many parties to further their geopolitical agendas.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think drawing conclusions at this point is wise, but it&#39;s possible that the U.S. just made a counter-move against the russians through Assange, whether that&#39;s to bully Twitter into closing his account, physically extracting him from wherever he&#39;s hiding these days (last I heard it was the Ecuadorian embassy), maybe even taking him out.</p>

<p>How the hell do you accidentally type a message on the official Navy twitter? You don’t. Somebody with access to that account just got hammered with disciplinary action or the account was hacked by who knows who.</p>

<p>9/11 and Julian has been discussed here ad nauseam. Maybe he got frustrated because he wanted us to focus on the docs and proof in front of us of a verifiable conspiracy that we could and should hold our gvmt&#39;s feet to the fire?</p>
