       So I'd just finished watching September 11 the new pearl harbor. As a scientist I'm quite impressed with the level of their detail. The documentary was thorough, convincing and disturbing if it is true, even partially. The fact that I'm left with less questions at the end is a testament to their attention to detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I have one burning question. If the planes were in fact replaced with drones, as the documentary states, what are the theories for the fate of the passengers and the crew?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: There is the obvious answer which sends chills up my spine.

       If it is anything like Operation Northwoods either the passengers were redirected and forced to land and never knew they were supposed to be that specific flight, or they were in on it under aliases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a screengrab from the Northwoods file details a similar drone swap.

       Part of stage props? I'm a pilot (and shouldn't say this) but have made (passenger) cell phone calls if fly -low and slow- enough to tag (horizontal) cell phone tower lock. Not 30,000 feet, not 400mph. Not 2001?

       Given that the US government had the ability to modify those aircraft to become remotely piloted drones (see:
       <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_02/textonly/fo02txt.html">
        Boeing Future Air Navigation System
       </a>
       , fitted to 757 and 767 aircraft) that seems rather redundant.
      </p>
      <p>
       By simply hot swapping a module in the Flight Management Computer System as part of "routine maintenance"
(
       <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_05/textonly/ps02txt.html">
        an ability built into 757 and 767 aircraft
       </a>
       ) the aircraft used on Sept 11 could be turned into remotely piloted drones commanded from the ground by disabling the ability for the pilots to override course instructions sent from outside the aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that ability, wouldn't it be easier and safer to simply remotely hijack actual commercial flights (passengers and all) and crash them into the buildings?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could the reason Flight 93 crashed be less to do with the passengers fighting hijackers on the aircraft, and more to do with the conspirators making sure that no one discovered there weren't any, or if there were, they didn't have actual control of the aircraft?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more importantly... the evidence that these aircraft had been hijacked remotely would be destroyed in the crashes, and there would be plenty of human remains to "legitimise" the official story.

      <p>
       Not at all. The Boeing 757 and 767 are very similar on a mechanical level. They use servomechanisms instead of fly-by-wire (FBW), which makes it difficult to over-ride control by the pilots.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to set up a 757 or 767 for remote control, the aircraft would need to be extensively modified. These alterations could be detected by the ground crew at Logan airport. So that requires more people to be 'in on it.'

       Look up the stewardess who said, "It's a frame" but only when you are ready for those chills and more.  I'm fairly convinced of their fate.  People who are naive enough to say they were paid off need to step back and think about what this was accomplishing for the NWO and the MIC.  Human life means nothing to those that played a part in this.  Certainly not of ordinary citizens, anyway.  This meant unending wars (which we still have), huge industries making bank into the future.  Oligarchs love war, it's good for their bottom line.

       People refuse to understand what psychopaths (or a group of them) would be capable of if given blank checks.  It's so naive to think they would pay them off and just say, "now you be quiet, or we'll kill you."  As if the chance would be worth it for them?  Do they have any idea of the sort of people that run the military?  These are people who wait their entire careers to fuck shit up with fancy toys.

       Christopher Bollyn says that it was a simple matter of having two remote planes ready, and swapped them out.  He showed there was time and reason to believe it with flight paths and times.

       I am not saying remote planes are implausible.  There were always large holes in the theory of these amateurs being able to steer those planes into the towers.  But wouldn’t prerigging the real planes be even simpler?

       Sure, but I'm not sure how that fits into various theories.  I believe most believe the system used to pilot the plane remotely, makes a bulge along the fuselage, as seen in some of the photos.  If it had that system in place, it would be too noticeable to the public perhaps (necessitating a switch)? Christopher Bollyn goes into this stuff at length.

       Look into the military base under where both of the hijacked planes crossed over. It's late and I can't think of the name.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were either gassed/murdered or the people on those planes were sleeper agents/ Undercover spooks or whatever you want to call them and they were reassigned with new identities. That one particular military base has a strange history, killing me I can't think of the name.

       With all that has been coming to light recently, whether true or not, North Korea doesn't seem too far fetched.  I'd wager some crazy experiments go on there.  If you're hellbent on world domination, and 9/11 is your kickoff show, picking up a couple hundred healthy sane passengers to conduct experiments on seems like a difficult thing to come by.  All the passengers on the plane and, if true, a lot of people who are listed as having died in the towers/pentagon etc.

       Likely the original planes had been redirected the theory I think is reasonable is select people forced to make phone calls (how the phones worked while the planes should've been in the air).
      </p>
      <p>
       After the people made the calls, all people on the flight been sealed inside the plane and gassed.

       If it was a type of Northwood operation they would have had killed them. To many people. To keep surveillance of that many persons to maintain and guarantee silence (and risk some might have the brains to use things like deadmans switches which would complicate there removal and create a financial dilemma  if money was required to keep a passenger silent) would be an operation that would have greater chance of exposure then the original operation.

       The planes were not replaced with drones.

      <p>
       Two of the planes were not even scheduled to be in the air that day and the other two were not decommissioned until 2005.

       Well, let me backpedal a bit. There could have been drones involved if only to give the unsuspecting people working for NORAD the appearance of tracking a real aircraft for a while. Maybe. But no drones hit any buildings.

       There weren't "thousands of eyewitnesses" or even hundreds. That's one of the biggest myths about 9/11.

       I hypothesize that there were at least some aircraft - maybe drones - in the sky at the time to give people something to say they saw. But none hit the buildings, imo.

       Yes, all of the footage of the planes is fake. When viewed objectively they are just CGI composites. If something hit the buildings, it would have to be well-hidden or covered up with this video editing, but no kind of aircraft could have penetrated all the way into one of the twin towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       For them to have been drones, it would have had to look enough like a plane to serve the purpose of fooling people on the ground, but also make it in the buildings without spilling its parts down the sides of the towers on impact.  That just seems as improbable to me as holograms, and the truth is if something is shown on television that's enough to fool enough people. Or at least it was at the time.

       . The very fact that an observer cannot prove (to an arbitrary degree) the authenticity of the videos and photographs taken at the WTC complex or Pentagon is, by itself, considered sufficient grounds for NPT to decry the evidence as 'fake'.

       Any conspiracy theory can be dismissed as unfalsifiable. It's not a matter of Talmudic verbiage to confirm the government's narrative by a technicality. It's a simple matter that the concept of a Boeing passenger jet penetrating all the way into a steel and concrete skyscraper designed specifically to prevent this from happening is physically impossible on the most basic level.

       So if I'm being specific, I'll call it "no Boeing passenger jet theory."

       No plane theory is unfalsifiable by its very definition. Its central tenet is that every single photograph or video taken at the WTC complex is fake.

       If I'm wrong, then answer a simple question: Would it be possible for anyone to convince you that the pictures or videos of planes are real? What steps would they need to follow to convince you? What is your criteria for accepting or dismissing evidence?

       The twin towers were built to survive the impact of a jumbo jet. NOT to prevent a jumbo jet from penetrating its outer frame. These two things are not identical.

       If someone showed you a video of an 80 foot tall unicorn pooping a Yeti into existence, could they do anything to convince you it was authentic? No, because it is a fantastical and impossible scenario that has yet to be replicated since. Such is the case with the Hezarkhani footage (for example).

       If someone could recreate the fear of penetrating a 100 ton hollow aluminum passenger jet seamlessly all the way into a 500,000 ton steel and concrete reinforced skyscraper, without slowing down nor spilling any wreckage or luggage down the side of the building, which has never been done before or since 9/11, in defiance of Newton's 3rd Law, all the work would still be ahead of one to explain why the 9/11 plane strike clips are so manifestly fabricated and not even internally consistent with one another.

       And I could link to multiple no-plane sites, papers, or videos, and simply say "your claim that the plane impacts violated Newton's 3rd Law have already been disproven has been disproven." This is where an actual understanding of Newton's Laws will serve you better than your academic pilpul. Never mind the fact that you don't bother addressing the double standard of what it would take to "prove" NPT, you just opt to let others do the lifting for you.

       Simon Shack's theory that all of the footage is faked has been debunked, that analysis also debunks alot of what Shack has said,
The idea that all of the footage was faked is the least plausible to me imo, thats just my opinion

       Sorry, but if you can't at least summarize why or how something has been debunked (as I have explained why real aircraft cannot have hit the towers) you can't really assert that "it is debunked."
