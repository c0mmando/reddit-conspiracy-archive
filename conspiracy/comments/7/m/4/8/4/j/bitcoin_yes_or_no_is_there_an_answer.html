Since the narrative has been so against it for so long makes me intrigued ;) And I get the feeling it is starting to hit the banks and they are starting to push BC through them, but the whole point is to break free from the banking system.</p>

<p>On the other hand (I still know very little of this) it seems to become very hard to not get entangled with some company &quot;helping&quot; you out, while they kind of screw you over in the end. Any pro tips from a free thinker to another?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not organic.  Its contrived and its value is determined in USD.  Its part hyperinflation and part ponzi scheme.  It also doesn&#39;t work - If you bought a $1000 USD TV with a coin when that coin was worth $1000 USD, just a short time later you&#39;ve paid over $20,000 USD for a TV, while you&#39;d be lucky to sell said TV for $500 at the same time.  There&#39;s a reason currencies have inflation/deflation and interest rates to balance them all while they are backed by the economic output of the country.  Grifto-currency is illusory. </p>

Essentially it is like Yelp for cryptocurrencies as well as blockchain apps and services. You don&#39;t have to just invest in Bitcoin. There are plenty of other cryptocoins out there if you think Bitcoin could be compromised. Blockchain is here to stay and it is the next big evolution in tech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think the most powerful nation on earth is going to let one of their most valuable tools (the dollar) be thwarted by a digital currency without a fight? In my experience, they don’t lose many fights lately. Their thinking is multiple steps ahead and they have more weapons at their disposal than a group of crypto nerds can muster.</p>

<p>They are gonna shake the rug, bring it high and low, and pepper it with shots up and down the curve to erode confidence until it’s worthless. As nice as it sounds to say that crypto is here to stay, this will not be the case until some next level shit is conceived and NATO has been rendered a 2nd or 3rd class world power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bought 0.003 btc last year (which is about 21M btc divided by the world population), because I figure the founder of btc will hold on to his 1M; which now leaves 20M for the world population (or about 0.0026). Now anyone who owns any significant amount will continue to drain from the average. In my opinion, I think a 30-50 dollar investment wouldn&#39;t be too bad to hold a portion of the pie. If anything it&#39;s just a 50 dollar risk(that theoretically would never go to zero), compared to a stock that could go bankrupt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin use to be a smart investment because most people didn&#39;t even know what it was and any time anyone in finance was asked about it they would ridicule it and dismiss it...</p>

<p>Millions of dollars worth of coins were changing hands every day, prices were steadily rising and demand for coins was growing bigger every day. This was because of the &quot;market places&quot; on the deep web. People used Bitcoin as a currency, not as an investment, and the value reflected it. </p>

<p>Then the Wall Street/financial scum got on board, suddenly people with the ability to buy up enough Bitcoins were they can manipulate the market, you have all these amateur investors with no actual understanding of how any of this actually works acting like there the wolf of wall street cos they have been making easy money...  </p>

<p>Now, Bitcoin has recently become obsolete in the one place that there was always a demand because coins are no longer anonymous, quantum computers will see a shift to a more secure currency for illegal activities. </p>

<p>Governments are going to start making examples of Bitcoin traders who dont report their earnings which will see an exodus of investors move to other currencies. </p>

<p>All you will be left with is a market that is being manipulated by huge brokers who have already rigged the game, you will see a huge dump and Bitcoin will bottom out, there will certainly be a replacement but who knows what  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/bitcoin is not stupid, but they believe many things that are not grounded in reality.</p>

<p>They lack knowledge of economic reality. They believe BTC is a store of value. But medium of exchange precedes store of value. Otherwise <strong>there is nothing to store.</strong> The <em>store</em> part of SoV <em>is</em> the MoE. <strong>The utility of the coin is the value itself.</strong> Bitcoin is both a payment system and a currency.</p>

<p>$50 fees today, $100 fees in two months. Core devs openly advocate $1000 fees. If you think this is going to work when BCH has $0,003 fees and is otherwise technically highly similar, you hold retarded beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BTC did not become highly similar to a ponzi until the blocks became effectively full.</p>

<p>Right now BTC has a very limited utility. It is impossible to actually use it as a payment system, because the fees have become too high. $12-50 to send even $1. </p>

<p>It only retains its current USD-value if more people are willing to buy into it. This is a ponzi.</p>

<p>The situation was different before 2016. Before Core devs, backed by AXA bank / Mastercard money, messed up the code and essentially crippled BTC.</p>

<p>BCH is the Bitcoin that was from 2009-2015.</p>

<p>The people who are buying BTC today are either useful idiots or people riding the ponzi-wave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin Cash is a scam allowing the biggest mining pool (Bitmain) operator Jihan Wu to utilize Asiicboost which allows him to mine 20% more efficiently than everyone else. The Segwit soft fork on Bitcoin eliminated this cheap advantage but Bitcoin Cash, or Bcash for short, still allows it. You&#39;ll notice Jihan Wu was a big advocate of Bitcoin Unlimited which also allowed Asiicboost.<br/>
Sadly, a lot of smart people are being duped into believing Bcash is a good coin because fees are lower when in reality you&#39;re better off using Litecoin or Vertcoin.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have enough information, you are able to make accurate guesses about the future.</p>

<p>The only certainty is time when it comes to one form of cryptocurrency completely replacing the current monetary system. All other systems will optimise: social order, well-being of all people. It&#39;s not like we will all of a sudden stop caring.</p>

<p>But it could be two years, ten years, twenty years. I&#39;d wager more money on the short-term, simply because things have been speeding up these last couple of years.</p>

<p>You must realise that no cryptocurrency that costs multiple dollars to send any amount of money has a future. Also Lightning Network is mathematically impossible to be censorship-resistant. These hubs will have KYC, they will be the new banks. They will be state controlled.</p>

<p>This last century every grass-roots coalition has been infiltrated and subverted by individuals and organisations who benefit from its destruction. Of course the Bitcoin community would have to deal with these circumstances.</p>

<p>Central banking is a ponzi-scheme. It is the biggest scam humanity has ever had pulled on it. It <strong>must</strong> end one day. Fiat is ticking time-bomb. Except no one knows exactly how long it will take for it to implode.</p>

<p>For context and a full understanding of this ponzi-scheme: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0</a></p>

<p>Bitcoin BTC today is on the same path to be considered a ponzi-scheme. There is no utility in the system when people don&#39;t use it to send money. The people currently behind BTC do not care about creating a system that allows for everyone to use it. They openly advocate $1000 fees.</p>

<p>In similar ways that individuals in governMENTs have made gold and silver illegal as currency, they have succesfully crippled BTC.</p>

<p>Some people want to control and cripple others, some want to help others rise. Uneducated men and women destroy themselves. You must educate yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jihan right now could crush the price of both btc and bch. That&#39;s just the way it is. This is Bitmain: <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/19hZx234vNtLazfx5J2bxHsiWEmeYE8a7k">https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/19hZx234vNtLazfx5J2bxHsiWEmeYE8a7k</a>.</p>

<p>He has a lot of skin in the game. This is how Bitcoin works. Economic incentives is the security model of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Yes, probably Jihan was the main driving force behind BCH. If I was in his shoes, I&#39;d have done the same thing. Except years earlier. If BCH hadn&#39;t forked, the Bitcoin project would fail somewhere in the coming months years and some other project like Dash would take number one. </p>

<p>Yes Bitmain makes all the specialized asic hardware. But anyone can buy it. So where is the censorship-threat? There is none when anyone can buy the gear.</p>

<p>Mining centralisation: BCH is more censorship-resistant today (this is the goal of decentralisation) than BTC was for most of its lifetime. There is a lot of mining power coming from China, but a lot of it is also coming from other places in the world.</p>

<p>Do you want to pay $100 to move $200? This is what the people currenly running BTC openly advocate. This is absolute madness. If you look at what the Greg Maxwell and Adam Back have to say, they know nothing about economics. Back recently said people and merchants should open tabs to reduce fees. Tabs. Might as well re-introduce carrier pigeons instead of the internet.</p>

<p>On Roger Ver... I <strong>really</strong> don&#39;t understand any of the hate. He comes across as a voluntaryist. He was imprisoned for selling agricultural fireworks via eBay that scare away birds. In a time when automatic weapons and ammunition were purchasable on eBay. I don&#39;t understand any of the hate.</p>

<p>He supports BCH. BCH was launched with the intention of competing with BTC by introducing low fees and fast confirmations. That&#39;s exactly what BCH is doing. </p>

<p>Bottom line is BTC has to compete with everything on the market and BCH is better in every single way to BCH except it doesn&#39;t have the same level of market effect yet. From my perspective I do not in the slightest value BTC so highly. The people buying in right now mostly do not know how economics work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t swayed me to your side, but you have a lot of good points and definitely a well-thought out position. But, I don&#39;t see it playing out the way you describe. I don&#39;t think the developers of BCH are as capable, I do think Jihan&#39;s monopoly over mining hardware will be a huge problem in the future, and I don&#39;t think that by consecutive block size increases that the scaling problem is solved. </p>

<p>Blockstream does scare me, and you&#39;re right, transaction fees are unacceptable in this competitive of a space and BTC can only maintain its lead for so long if these fees continue. As more people become educated about the advantages of each coin, they&#39;ll start to support one or the other and expensive or unusable coins will fade out over time.</p>

<p>I believe the people behind BTC will continue to strengthen it&#39;s long-term viability through well-tested and careful approach to development. I do think BCH rushed a quick-fix solution that doesn&#39;t solve the long-term problems it purports to, and this leaves a door open for Jihan and Roger to have almost complete control of the future. I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing both succeed, I do still have my airdropped BCH, but I&#39;m definitely rooting for BTC to stay on track as the dominant coin. We&#39;ll see, thanks for your perspective though, definitely more informative and less combative, which is rare these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can however point to 7 years of empirical evidence. Any layman can see that Bitcoin worked extraordinarily well as a payment system from 2010-2015. Until the blocks became <strong>effectively</strong> full.</p>

<p>Blockstream devs did not increase the blocksize. If you read any of Satoshi&#39;s writings, it was <strong>always supposed to be increased</strong>. Even Core devs, as little as 12-36 months ago advocated 2mb, 4mb, 8mb and 100mb blocks. Adam Back, Peter Wieulle, Wladymir Van Der Laan can all be quoted for saying this. Not that this is essential, but still. The narrative is ever-changing. </p>

<p>Words currently fail me to describe the amount of cognitive dissonance I have witnessed first-hand from Coreys. It&#39;s like they have a bifurcated mind when it comes to economics.</p>

<p>The whole Cash vs. Core story currently has many similarities to voluntaryists / liberalists vs. statists. Both are a belief system. Except, for the life of me, I can no longer see a world without states being better anymore. Control yourself. A man has as many masters as he has vices. Give not an inch of freedom. If you let strangers decide for you, how is this morally acceptable? It is not.</p>

<p>Core promises to have LN ready 18 months from now. This is like the politician making empty promises during his campaign. LN is a Know-your-customer, state-run hub-system. This is madness. This is not Bitcoin. <strong>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital cash system.</strong> The people behind Core now openly want to change the whitepaper. Theymos, lead mod of r/bitcoin, says so. This is some 1984 stuff. Like war is peace and 2+2=5. The cognitive dissonance astounds me. It&#39;s like these people don&#39;t want freedom. They have become too dependent on the system. </p>

<p>Bitcoin is like Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave and the movie The Matrix. Most people do not realise the mentality-shift that Bitcoin will bring to the world. It is but a matter of time. The genie is out of the bottle. There is no stopping this. But much time can be lost. Don&#39;t lose time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, you should do your own search, for materials and topics and learn about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in bitcoin since long time, and if there is one thing I know, do your own search, take all news from the media with a grain of salt, as most of them still have no idea what they talk about.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t want to offend anyone, but quite a big population of this sub, is driven by fear of unkown and they don&#39;t do their search when it comes to bitcoin.</p>

<p>The two main subs are r/bitcoin and r/btc .</p>

<p>The original bitcoin chain is on r/bitcoin.
Bcash is being promoted on r/btc. </p>

<p>I for one, I trust the original chain, but feel free to make up your mind.</p>

<p>Also, this is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop/playlists">GREAT</a> place to start your journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe true. But one of my pet peeves is someone telling someone that is asking a question to &quot;do your research.&quot; What do you think they&#39;re doing!?</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to people telling those asking a question to just Google it instead of answering them. It&#39;s like some people don&#39;t realize the info on Google has to come from somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin Cash is a scam allowing the biggest mining pool (Bitmain) operator Jihan Wu to utilize Asiicboost which allows him to mine 20% more efficiently than everyone else. The Segwit soft fork on Bitcoin eliminated this cheap advantage but Bitcoin Cash, or Bcash for short, still allows it. You&#39;ll notice Jihan Wu was a big advocate of Bitcoin Unlimited which also allowed Asiicboost.<br/>
Sadly, a lot of smart people are being duped into believing Bcash is a good coin because fees are lower when in reality you&#39;re better off using Litecoin or Vertcoin.<br/>
Stay away from Bcash and be wary of the Bcash sock puppets.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I can however point to 7 years of empirical evidence. Any layman can see that Bitcoin worked extraordinarily well as a payment system from 2010-2015. Until the blocks became <strong>effectively</strong> full.</p>

<p>Blockstream devs did not increase the blocksize. If you read any of Satoshi&#39;s writings, it was <strong>always supposed to be increased</strong>. Even Core devs, as little as 12-36 months ago advocated 2mb, 4mb, 8mb and 100mb blocks. Adam Back, Peter Wieulle, Wladymir Van Der Laan can all be quoted for saying this. Not that this is essential, but still. The narrative is ever-changing. </p>

<p>Words currently fail me to describe the amount of cognitive dissonance I have witnessed first-hand from Coreys. It&#39;s like they have a bifurcated mind when it comes to economics.</p>

<p>The whole Cash vs. Core story currently has many similarities to voluntaryists / liberalists vs. statists. Both are a belief system. Except, for the life of me, I can no longer see a world without states being better anymore. Control yourself. A man has as many masters as he has vices. Give not an inch of freedom. If you let strangers decide for you, how is this morally acceptable? It is not.</p>

<p>Core promises to have LN ready 18 months from now. This is like the politician making empty promises during his campaign. LN is a Know-your-customer, state-run hub-system. This is madness. This is not Bitcoin. <strong>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital cash system.</strong> The people behind Core now openly want to change the whitepaper. Theymos, lead mod of r/bitcoin, says so. This is some 1984 stuff. Like war is peace and 2+2=5. The cognitive dissonance astounds me. It&#39;s like these people don&#39;t want freedom. They have become too dependent on the system. </p>

<p>Bitcoin is like Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave and the movie The Matrix. Most people do not realise the mentality-shift that Bitcoin will bring to the world. It is but a matter of time. The genie is out of the bottle. There is no stopping this. But much time can be lost. Don&#39;t lose time.</p>
