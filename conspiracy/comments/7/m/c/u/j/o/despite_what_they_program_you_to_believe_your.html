<p>Many years ago, I wrote a post on here (now deleted) about how there were so many suicides in my community, on the lonely railroad tracks, that the media finally just stopped reporting them in local news sources. These suicides continue to this day.</p>

<p>What is interesting to me is that many of my conspiracy posts center around kindness, and is that not very telling of where our society is at? In some ways, it is a literally a conspiracy to talk about kindness or the value of human life (and I’ll explain that in this post).</p>

<p>Before anybody says that these types of posts are useless, I would like to remind you of “A Modest Proposal”, a satirical piece written in the 1700s. In this writing, Jonathon Swift proposes killing poor babies to give to the rich for food. It caused outrage, but it also caused changed:</p>

<p><a href="http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html">http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html</a></p>

<p>We must be constantly reflecting on our society. In fact, I would argue that the loss of the art of reflection is what has been breeding a lack of self-awareness and narcissism in our society (though that could be a whole other post).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/fashion/internet-technology-phones-introspection.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/fashion/internet-technology-phones-introspection.html</a></p>

<p>When I look at our modern society (USA), I see a denial of the value of human life. Maybe people are too comfortable. Maybe they are not aware of the suffering. Maybe they do not value themselves, so it is difficult to value others. There are likely many reasons behind this, and I would like to explore that in this post. Ultimately, when we devalue human life, our world will suffer great consequences - and moreover, so will our souls. </p>

<p><strong>Modern Comfort and Modern Suffering</strong></p>

<p>The world is at our fingertips, yet most of us are not watching videos like this (trigger warning!):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3337cj4sJQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3337cj4sJQ</a></p>

<p>In this video, kids in Haiti eat mud cookies just so their stomachs feel full. My friend asked me why I would watch such a video, and I told him that it keeps me grounded. I remind myself daily of the true suffering in the world so that I remember what I have, and so that I can give back.</p>

<p>Yet, on a conspiracy forum like this, I rarely see any talk about the poor. Sure, I see the typical, “They just need to work harder” posts, but ultimately I see no discussion of those truly suffering in the world (or very little anyway). </p>

<p>I have a theory that people either need to suffer themselves or attempt to understand suffering that exists in order to “wake up.” I also have a theory that they keep us very &quot;comfortable&quot; in the United States so that we do not think about those who are suffering.</p>

<p>Look, I am not claiming that there are those who are not suffering here, and there are many types of suffering. I would argue, though, that most in this country suffer from excess, not limitations. However, it is extremely important to note that there are third-world-like conditions in the United States that nobody wants to talk about. In other words, I absolutely believe there is suffering here, but I believe that we are “suffering through modern comfort” – an oxymoron perhaps, but let me explain.</p>

<p>In America, many are simply living very comfortable lives:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hailey-yook/the-american-experience-c_b_1540788.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hailey-yook/the-american-experience-c_b_1540788.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/20/opinion/wake-up-america-apathy-can-be-dangerous.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/20/opinion/wake-up-america-apathy-can-be-dangerous.html</a></p>

<p>There is this strange mix of comfort and apathy in our country, even amongst those who do not have much. For those who have, it is easy to feel content and apathetic. For those who do not have, it is easy to seek comfort while remaining apathetic about larger issues. What is strange, though, is even our poor ‘have’ things, but &quot;these things&quot; may simply bring more suffering in the end. Let me expand here.</p>

<p><em>Comfort?</em></p>

<p>Food: More have access to food, but nutritional deficiencies are still a real thing:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/1987049/boy-nearly-eats-himself-blind-before-mum-discovers-his-poor-diet-was-responsible-for-his-declining-vision/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/1987049/boy-nearly-eats-himself-blind-before-mum-discovers-his-poor-diet-was-responsible-for-his-declining-vision/</a></p>

<p>I cannot tell you how many of my students eat cheetos for lunch, breakfast, and dinner, and we are all aware of the obesity epidemic.</p>

<p>Money: Many feel like they have money, even the poor, but most are drowning in debt:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/money/4709270/americans-die-in-debt/">http://time.com/money/4709270/americans-die-in-debt/</a></p>

<p>Shelter: Many do not even own houses or property anymore (like me!), but rather they are paying monthly for something they will never really have:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/13/harvard-study-heres-how-many-americans-cant-afford-housing.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/13/harvard-study-heres-how-many-americans-cant-afford-housing.html</a></p>

<p>Land, homes, and property are becoming things of the past. That is scary if you ever have experienced not having enough rent money.</p>

<p>I would argue that there is this illusion of comfort in our country, and many are eating, buying, and consuming in excess in an effort to feel comfortable. Ultimately, though, they still suffer.</p>

<p>Still, this illusion of comfort stops people from thinking about others in the world who are suffering from NOT having enough.
When people feel this comfort, they can become apathetic to those in need outside of themselves, and this is <em>the</em> conspiracy. It is not that people are not suffering in America, rather, it is that they think they are not suffering, and do not seem to care if others are experiencing suffering.</p>

<p><strong>Dogma and Extremism</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, dogmatic and extremist views in our society are promoting hatred rather than kindness. Wherever you lean politically, I am sure you have seen examples of this. People value their beliefs over love and kindness, and they will do anything for their beliefs.</p>

<p>I want to give a true example of this as a Christian. I am sure many (like I used to be) dislike Christians because they seem to be hypocritical in their teachings. What many Christians refuse to accept is that even Jesus broke the rules when it meant doing what is right and what is loving. In other words, there were times when he undermined the belief systems of the times to promote what was right and good!</p>

<p>The Pharisees often set Jesus up (what a conspiracy), and they invited him to heal a sick man on the Sabbath, thinking he would not because of the traditions of the time.</p>

<p>This is what happened:</p>

<p>“3 Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. 2 Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath. 3 Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand up in front of everyone.”</p>

<p><strong>4 Then Jesus asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent.</strong></p>

<p>5 He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored. 6 Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+3:1-6">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+3:1-6</a></p>

<p>There are many, many times Jesus “broke the rules” to do what was right and loving.</p>

<p>In our society today, many have become so dogmatic and extreme, that they refuse to look at the individual. I can offer many examples of this.</p>

<p>For one, many group people in categories (which has its necessity at times) rather than looking at individuals themselves. This includes racism, for example. Many look at a person’s race before even considering them as an individual. This is often based on extremism.</p>

<p>We can look at this in another way. Modern feminists (at least SJW/Third/Fourth Wave Feminists) may group all men into a category, before looking at them as an individual. The rules, again, are more important than love.</p>

<p>Or, maybe, we can look at groups like MGTOW or similar ones, who group all women as heathens, rather than looking at them as individuals. Again, even when a woman may break their conceptions, their rules and beliefs may be more important.</p>

<p>I can do this all day. Think about the echo chambers online. People value their rules, their narratives, their traditions, over what is ‘right’ often. This is true in real life as well. </p>

<p>The point is that people’s dogmas, beliefs, paradigms, and stigmas are what hold them back. I am NOT saying that at times grouping, stereotyping, or categorizing may not serve a purpose. As humans, we must do this daily.</p>

<p>However, when our beliefs overpower doing what is good or right, then our beliefs become our own cage. This is the definition of a paradigm or pattern in our thoughts.</p>

<p>We must have these to function and survive, but we must not forget that our paradigms can be broken.</p>

<p>**The Problem with New Age Beliefs (Just a note!)</p>

<p>When I write about this, I am NOT saying that we should just love everyone and pretend nothing is bad with the world. That seems to be the current problem with the world, actually. </p>

<p>There are three problems with modern new age beliefs:</p>

<p>1)  They deny the existence of evil.
2)  They twist good and bad (bad can be good or good can be bad).
3)  They state that everything is ‘one’ and there is no distinction.</p>

<p>Though this post is about aliens, I wrote more about this “one love” conspiracy here if you are interested:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=aliens+one+world+deception&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=aliens+one+world+deception&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all</a></p>

<p>Evil does exist, and moral relativism is a farce. There is good and bad, and we must not deny that. However, we must do what we can to be kind and make the world a better place, or at least our souls better…</p>

<p><strong>Abortion? Eugenics?</strong></p>

<p>This post is about the value of human life, after all, and this is essential to this topic.</p>

<p>Growing up, I bought into third wave feminism, and I literally believed that abortion was empowerment for women. Now, before anybody freaks out, I would never judge a person who has decided to have an abortion for whatever reason. I am not them, and I have no right to judge them, ultimately. Having a baby in today’s society is more difficult than ever.</p>

<p>Still, I am allowed to have morality, and I realize now that abortion is not empowerment. There are thousands of debate resources on abortion, so I am not here to do that. What I am here to do is ask you to question the narrative. Why is abortion viewed as “empowerment?”</p>

<p><a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1498-y">https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1498-y</a></p>

<p>Still, I think abortion is a reflection of something wrong with society, not necessarily the individual. Why do people want to have abortions in an unkind society?</p>

<p>1)  There are more single parents than before:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-mysterious-and-alarming-rise-of-single-parenthood-in-america/279203/">https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-mysterious-and-alarming-rise-of-single-parenthood-in-america/279203/</a></p>

<p>2)  The cost of raising a child has risen 40% in the past decade:</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/21/pf/cost_raising_child/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/21/pf/cost_raising_child/index.htm</a></p>

<p>3)  Children are seen as burdens:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/16/why-american-women-are-having-fewer-babies-than-ever/?utm_term=.691600aefc71">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/16/why-american-women-are-having-fewer-babies-than-ever/?utm_term=.691600aefc71</a></p>

<p>And much more. Our society is sick. It is difficult to value human life when people are so burdened with other issues. Having a child is not a ‘normal’ thing anymore – it is a difficult thing to consider. Further, how can people value a human life when they do not even value their own lives? By the way, keep eugenics in mind for a little later.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Esteem/Narcissism</strong></p>

<p>I often write about narcissism, but I wanted to veer in a different direction for this post. There is no doubt that narcissism is on the rise in this society, but could it be that, ultimately, a low-self esteem is what contributes to narcissism in the first place?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/16/why-american-women-are-having-fewer-babies-than-ever/?utm_term=.691600aefc71">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/16/why-american-women-are-having-fewer-babies-than-ever/?utm_term=.691600aefc71</a></p>

<p>In our society, we are told we are NEVER good enough, and we must be constantly comparing ourselves to others. ‘Keeping up with the Joneses’ is nothing new:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses</a></p>

<p>Whatever the cause of narcissism, there is no doubt that many are feeling lonelier and more disconnected than ever, despite advances in technology. From the article above,</p>

<p>“Along with increased narcissism are also increased levels of loneliness and depression. This makes sense: mature relationships require mutuality, where neither partner is more important than the other. There can be no reciprocal relationship when one partner is self-centered. Egoism pushes others away, thereby leading to loneliness. And being disconnected from others in a meaningful way is a road to depression.”</p>

<p>In fact, youth suicide rates are on the rise:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/05/30/youth-suicide-rates-rising-school-and-internet-may-blame/356539001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/05/30/youth-suicide-rates-rising-school-and-internet-may-blame/356539001/</a></p>

<p>and in general, they are on the rise:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/03/20/suicide-rates-on-the-rise-in-us-especially-in-rural-areas-cdc/21903238/">https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/03/20/suicide-rates-on-the-rise-in-us-especially-in-rural-areas-cdc/21903238/</a></p>

<p>And there are many studies on why Americans are so unhappy:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-changing-culture/201511/why-adults-are-less-happy-they-used-be">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-changing-culture/201511/why-adults-are-less-happy-they-used-be</a></p>

<p>The point is that people have lost the ability to value their own lives because they are constantly being told they do no matter or that they are not important. Usually, they are programmed with these reasons.</p>

<p>Before you dismiss this, just know that all of my students, especially my girls, have no problem telling me how ugly, lonely, fat, desperate, sad, unhappy (insert sad adjective here) they are. They smile on their social media, but they feel so empty. This is anecdotal, I know, but it breaks my heart.</p>

<p><strong>Eugenics?</strong></p>

<p>We hear more about ‘diversity’ than ever, but we also hear, more than ever, about the burden of those who are different, whether they have down syndrome, disabilities, or something else.</p>

<p>In a society that values pseudo-intellectualism and scientism, we often dismiss those who are not ‘as smart as we think we are.’</p>

<p>In this video, this man with down syndrome explains to Congress why his life matters:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTbe-u-n0T4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTbe-u-n0T4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>I have written entire posts on eugenics, but I am not going to link them here (unless you ask in the comments). Rather, I want people to think about the distinction between “valuable” life and “invaluable” life. Are only those with a high IQ more valuable? Or are only those who are rich and well-off and well-dressed valuable? Further, are only those “perceived” as smart, or pretty, or handsome, or attractive, or powerful…valuable?</p>

<p>If somebody is born in a world or life that is more difficult than yours, are they any less valuable than you?</p>

<p>To me, we have to remember the importance of the individual and their unique experiences. I believe that everyone has value, and the conspiracy is that &#39;they&#39; want you to think that only certain people have value (mostly the rich and powerful, and sometimes their “token” feel good stories). Further, they want you to think that only those rich and powerful people can change things (not the guy mentioned earlier with down syndrome).</p>

<p>If we start changing the way we think about the value of human life, and if we even just start thinking of other human lives besides our own, wouldn’t our world be a slightly better place?</p>

<p>I love to subscribe to all types of subreddits, and I rarely comment on others beside conspiracy-related ones. However, the underlying theme, for the most part, is that anybody who might be born with severe disabilities should just be killed before they are born. Yet, these same people preach about diversity and equality. There is something really wrong here.</p>

<p>When I write these types of posts, I never want to undermine anybody’s suffering. We all suffer uniquely, and as the Buddha said,</p>

<p><strong>“Have compassion for all beings, rich and poor alike; each has their suffering. Some suffer too much, others too little.”</strong></p>

<p>Further, there many of you taking care of a suffering family member (or you are suffering yourself). The point is, I am not saying that we should not express the true hardship of the suffering that is real, but we should not undervalue lives that may contribute to suffering.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>You are valuable, and you matter. We all matter.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that they want you to believe that we are all equal, but some are more equal than others:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm</a></p>

<p>What if we changed the word &#39;equal&#39; to &#39;valuable&#39;? We are all valuable, and not one soul is more valuable than another soul.
I firmly believe that.</p>

<p>We tend to forget that we are all born as children, and we are molded and shaped by the world around us. I am not dismissing that some become evil, but I want you to think about ‘why’ some become evil.</p>

<p>To end with a quote:</p>

<p>• A government cannot be truly just without affirming the intrinsic value of human life.
Charles Colson </p>

<p>And maybe that is the problem. If our world leaders do not think we all have intrinsic human value, then how can anything be better? And if you buy into this belief, that only some have value, then how can this world be better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, you take the time and effort to write a post about how everyone has worth, and how apathetic the world is becoming. And then I read the comments, and your point is proven. I wonder if some of the people being assholes on this thread realize they just proved your point? </p>

<p>Anyway, thank you for this post. It&#39;s something I think about often. Is there any hope for a society that has lost the ability to value life? I think it&#39;s one of the last and most severe symptoms before a society collapses. After all, if no one values anyone in their society, not even themselves, who&#39;s going to bother doing anything to change it? Hence why most people are just keyboard warriors using social media as an outlet for their vitriol and hatred, never even bothering to stop and think that there are real people behind the screenname/picture/avatar, and not caring if they happen to have enough cognizance long enough to realize it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Charles Colson was anti-abortion, anti-contraception, and anti-gay. Out of all the people to quote to cement your anti-abortion beliefs, that&#39;s a funny one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p> President Obama told a pro-gay-rights group, “Every single American—gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, transgender—every single American deserves to be treated equally before the law.” Does that include marriage? Well, the President’s secretary for Housing and Urban Development, Shaun Donovan, has just said that he “absolutely” supports same-sex marriage. The Administration has already refused to defend the Defense of Marriage Act. And before the EEOC, officials have said in a contest “between religious liberty and sexual liberty,” sexual liberty triumphs.</p>

<p>Can you see where all this is headed?</p>

<p>Friends, I wish I could tell you that gay rights were the only front in this threat to religious liberty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. My life has no value. I find more comfort in non-existence than existence. I&#39;m thankful for who and what I have in my life. I just realize this toxic world is a piece of shit and the pain&#39;s just not worth it anymore.</p>

<p>And I feel it&#39;s a person&#39;s worst mistake bringing kids into this shithole. You can disagree with me, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;ve said on other communities that I refuse to have kids for many reasons. </p>

<ol>
<li>I flat out don&#39;t like kids to start with.</li>
<li>I refuse to pass down any health problems I have (stomach problems, depression, anxiety, any damage I&#39;ve done to myself because of sweetener usage)</li>
<li>I refuse to  bring kids into a world that I despise more and more with each passing day. THAT would be the worst abuse a person can do to a kid. &quot;Gee, I saw what a shithole this world is and thought I&#39;d bring you here so you can experience the same shit! Thank me!&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>I have no use for gods, religions, spiritual new age bullshit. I refuse to use some garbage for a crutch. Those same crutches might be the same ones that will con you back into this lab rat experiment.</p>

<p>So there it is. I lay it out calmly. Not bitter, not angry. Just calling it what it is. Maybe one day the ones that feel like I do will finally get our freedom. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be found here or you can turn this place into freedom paradise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I refuse to use some garbage for a crutch&quot;<br/>
Mate, so long as you exist in a human body you&#39;re always using crutches. We aren&#39;t - at least not in this human form - infinite universal database of consciousness. We&#39;re brought into an limited world into bodies limited by their senses in what of the infinite universe it can perceive. Our own senses mark the general limitations of human perception. They are conscious crutches to anchor us to some perceived, yet ultimately illusory, &quot;base&quot; that we call reality. That reality changes as our perceptions of it change - whether that be changes in our ability to perceive it, or changes in reality that have occurred via action from us. So from this we learn that reality is not rigid. It&#39;s not absolute. It&#39;s not toxic, but it&#39;s not loving... Depending on your perspective.<br/>
Religion, science, spirituality, philosophy, maths, language... These are all crutches. They&#39;re all lenses through which we can look to view reality from different perspectives.<br/>
There are a lot of perspectives with which you can view the world that harm the perceiver, depending on their aims/goals in this limited life. There are a lot which benefit the perceiver. And there are a lot which pose neither no obvious benefit nor harm. Life shouldn&#39;t be about sticking with toxic perspectives in spite of ones available to you that may benefit you, simply because the toxic perspective is one that&#39;s been ingrained into you (whether that be through either environment or social conditioning). It should be about recognising both the limitations and potentials of this limited life and the world it exists within, and then exploring perspectives to best fit to your life at given points throughout it to make it the most worth-while that you can. It&#39;s about learning to find value in your current circumstances, instead of waiting for your circumstances to become something else until you look for value.<br/>
Putting yourself before the lenses through which we view reality is putting the cart before the horse. You&#39;re not gonna get anywhere. You handicap yourself. Permit yourself some crutches that most suit you in your current circumstances.<br/>
I used to be the angry, nihilistic, staunch-atheist type... Until I discovered Buddhism. That taught me some philosophies that really helped to positively change my life, and since then I&#39;ve been on an ongoing journey of conscious discovery that&#39;s been much more fulfilling than the life I lived before I encountered those perspectives. Read the Tao Te Ching. Try and find something that works for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to thank the people that saw where I was coming from. I appreciate your posts. Same goes for anybody that respectfully disagreed.</p>

<p>As for you, I feel YOU&#39;RE wrong. What&#39;s your reasons for bringing kids into this world? Is it to impact your life? &quot;You just feel more whole with kids!&quot; &quot;You won&#39;t feel like a woman until you&#39;ve fulfilled that maternal instinct and became a mom.&quot; Isn&#39;t that selfish? You&#39;re playing Russian Roulette with somebody else&#39;s life. That&#39;s what it is, wouldn&#39;t you say? I look at the story from the original post about kids eating mud pies. No, I&#39;m not judging them for not working hard or whatever. All I want to do is ask if those kids were made on purpose and why. If you&#39;re struggling day to day with finding enough to eat for yourselves, why are you bringing kids into this world so they can suffer right next to you? </p>

<p>And talking about my attitude, I have every right to think and feel the way I do. I don&#39;t view this existence with rose color glasses. I see the shit for what it is. I can look outside of myself and see the suffering and bullshit in this world. I can identify with it. Since this is a huge story these days for kids, how many stories have we had lately of bullied kids committing suicide? As somebody that was bullied and definitely suicidal about it, I see what life is like in a hopeless situation where people weren&#39;t raised with good manners. They&#39;re not raised to leave people alone if they don&#39;t like them. Can I blame the victims for thinking that death was the only way out? Not really. The human species is a particularly cruel one. I&#39;d rather be fed to wolves than go through life again. Instant death is better than the one that drags around, no matter the circumstance.</p>

<p>Our whole existence can be summed up like this to describe all the bad things in our world. I know I only referenced bullying in this post. Everybody else can fill in the blanks on their own. I don&#39;t want to write a book about it. Anyway, it&#39;s so small but it describes so many problems in our world. We have to depend on people to do the right and honorable thing and we don&#39;t have that. Across all levels we don&#39;t have that. Each day is a new low somewhere in the world with the shit people can do to others. It&#39;s sickening.</p>

<p>As for the issues I named in my original post, I&#39;ve had a lifetime of dealing with this shit. Would you intentionally get a young child drunk? Would you light up a cigarette and blow the smoke into the child&#39;s face? Would you take that cigarette and burn the child? How is any of that different than somebody KNOWING they have health problems that could easily be passed down and make their child suffer?  Doing that to somebody I would supposedly love? Yeah, that&#39;d be beyond fucked up and cruel. And that&#39;s why even if I LIKED kids and wanted them, I&#39;d still choose to avoid having them. I would love them too much to see them suffer day in and day out. I realize no good comes from it. There&#39;s certainly no lessons learned from it. There&#39;s no reason to bring them here for them to be fed off. They won&#39;t be a food source here. </p>

<p>Save your scorn for the assholes that created this lab rat experiment, the ones that do their part in making sure that this place is as miserable as possible. Don&#39;t use your scorn on somebody boycotting in their own way. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m not going to sit here and reason this away or make excuses for it. Not gonna sugarcoat it and say &quot;Awww, this existence wasn&#39;t that bad. I&#39;d probably do it again if I could.&quot; This is me standing up and saying &quot;NO MORE&quot;. End of the day I realize I&#39;m wasting my time writing all this because I doubt you and I will see eye to eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I appreciate the time you took to make this long and passionate response. </p>

<p>Personally, I could take kids or leave them until I had one. It was my (now ex-)wife who wanted children, so I was okay with it. But THEN, after we had our first child, my attitude changed completely. I was TOTALLY into this little person. Than we had another, and it got even better. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to have children, okay. I&#39;m sorry to have come off in a way that seemed callous and deserving of the impassioned riposte you&#39;ve taken the time to deliver. </p>

<p>Best to you and Happy New Year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will value your life while you say and feel you refuse to value it.  Because at a minimum if you had no value or worth, you wouldn&#39;t have posted such a quality post describing the nothingness.  Many of us here have felt the same about all your points brought up.  </p>

<p>I would counter, if you feel the illusion of life has no net value - then maybe just going along with that illusion and living it out YOUR way brings it value.  Living it and generating enjoyment and love - increases its value.  Raising good kids that live on love and good - increases its value.</p>

<p>I respect your desire to bring neutrality to it.  I was you not too long ago.  If this reality is real or if it is not, I now choose to bring a bit of good to it, offsetting a bit of someone else&#39;s evil.</p>

<p>Someday, maybe, consider changing your neutrality to something a bit more purposeful.  It may warm your spirit in a way that feels natural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I share your frustration. I still seek understanding of this situation, without limiting myself to orthodoxy or other&#39;s limitations. </p>

<p>You express a review of what many say is going on with earth right now. We are being used to vicariously experience toxic beings for other parasitic intelligences. It&#39;s in the rhetoric of many in the new age if you listen. They expose us to Draconian trash who enjoy tormenting and enslaving conscious. They get high on it. We are being used to create spectacles for calloused third person observers in this galaxy. They love us like gladiators. </p>

<p>They want us to perform spectacular expressions of freedom and overcoming evil. Yet, they do not accept how awful their spiritual special ed &quot;partners in contrast&quot; make life to be. Instead, they just blame us for seeing it as it actually is, insisting we just adjust our perceptions. They would blame us for seeing evil as evil and wish us to see it as stepping stones for spiritual advancement. They apparently don&#39;t place very much value on the actual value and anti-value we experience from their friends. They want our heads in the clouds it seems. </p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;ve become fed up with this state of engineered affairs. I wish with all my heart and soul that ALL of this spiritual slave seekers would experience themselves in reflection, the hidden teeth of the gentle golden rule request of beings aligned with balance. May everything to of balance they put out for us to experience be forced back upon them if they don&#39;t cease and desist. If they can&#39;t pass their own spiritual test, do they deserve freedom? Why? Let&#39;s put them to the test I say, if they won&#39;t end this. Let their inequitable standards become their own limitations. Perhaps they&#39;ll have compassion for experiencing their spiritual special ed friends and no longer support it. Such experiences work on us. All one would have to do is co-locate them with their spiritual special ed friends. </p>

<p>If self-described light does not balance its own self-interests with those of others, it doesn&#39;t follow the golden rule nor is the term light very appropriate. That fruit tastes too much like evil for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is very well written.</p>

<p>I think that for gender, the government is doing a Divide and Conquer. The media generally writes news articles differently. The government also prioritizes females more then men now in a lot of ways (at least in the Western world). If a female does a stabbing, they go to a mental hospital and get out easily while men end up in jail for example. Then plenty of men get accused of rape and they may even go jail. </p>

<p>I know that sometimes even males do get away, but now there has been a rise in males  being falsely accused of rape or raped but unable to get support. </p>

<p>The feminism has movement has really stopped gender equality because it proiritizes females over males. This keeps males going MGTOW, although MGTOW is not a bad thing, I do feae that the community may end up becoming toxic if they don&#39;t be careful.</p>

<p>For example, feminists think negatively of men with an attitude of &quot;All men are rapists&quot;</p>

<p>The MGTOW community (not the idea) seems to be heading towards the attitude also where &quot;All females are evil&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why abortion is good. It&#39;s not good but it is done for several reasons (especially the ones that you mentioned). Abortion can and should be prevented by the usage of contraception. Still, parts of America oppose contraception mainly due to religious beliefs. </p>

<p>One more thing about abortion is that there should be financial abortion for men. The reason being that, females can decide to keep or abort, and male&#39;s don&#39;t get to choose whether or not they have to pay child support or not. A lot of men end up trapped like this and have to pay child support for a kid they didn&#39;t want to raise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I feel the same about abortion. It&#39;s bad but we need it so that the parent could continue his/her life and the child wouldn&#39;t have to suffer with a parent that can&#39;t raise the kid.</p>

<p>The divide and conquer is getting worse I feel day by day about Gender. What is actually happening is that, instead of solving the problem (gender equality, females and males unite to fight. Regardless of the gender everyone gets prosecuted equally), it&#39;s the females and males going against each other while the criminals (female rapists, male rapists, etc etc) get away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll chime in here. I don&#39;t believe the gender divide was manufactured. What we saw was the oppression of women through religion and government, treating them as second-class citizens. Through the rise of social media, dating apps, and equal rights movements (and yes, women should have equal rights, I&#39;m not arguing that), we are seeing a correction back to the way nature intended. Women do have the reproductive power and are the more valuable of the two sexes in terms of long-term success of our species. Studies have shown that in the past, not every man reproduced. Religion, shaming sex, and governmental policies artificially attempted to pair one man with one woman. Now we are correcting that restrictive barrier, and some men are being left in the cold as nature intended. So they go their own way, not wanting to waste energy on a game that they were never designed to win. I wrote a huge paper on dating and game theory in college and I had a lot of support to continue my research further.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s illogical.  If anything, it&#39;s toxic to the concept of a psyop because MGTOWs will immediately sense someone trying to manipulate them and avoid them like a plague.  A psyop requires someone to be controlling and manipulating other people to do whatever the manipulator wants.  MGTOW is, by definition, about &quot;men going [their] own way.&quot;</p>

<p>The entire core premise of MGTOW is that men are free.  One reason it talks about women so much is that women, through their use of sexuality, are often guilty of manipulating men and &quot;being manipulated&quot; is something that MGTOW abhors.  The entire reason is to teach men that they do not need to look to women for self-worth.  Nor should they allow themselves to be manipulated by society or even other men.  MGTOW validate their own lives by whatever means they find worthwhile and make their own choices toward those ends.  So, if a MGTOW wants to help others, they will.  If they don&#39;t, they won&#39;t.  But the choice is theirs.</p>

<p>The society often works by shaming men into obedience and slavery.  If MGTOW really is a psyop, it&#39;s the most ironic psyop ever because it&#39;s basically created the most pure form of anarchy imaginable.  There are no leaders in MGTOW.  The very idea of defending your own dignity and freedom is the <em>antithesis</em> of a psyop and if any government did attempt it as one it was the stupidest move imaginable.</p>

<p>A MGTOW &quot;thinks for himself&quot; because you have to do that when you are &quot;going your own way.&quot;  You acknowledge no leaders except those whom you choose to respect.  Therefore, nobody tells a MGTOW to do anything he doesn&#39;t wish to do.</p>

<p>You seem to think that &quot;uniting to help each other&quot; is the correct response to a machine.  But what if I told you the machine is what&#39;s telling you to &quot;help others&quot; at the cost of yourself?  In that case, the machine isn&#39;t worth saving.  So why bother saving the machine?</p>

<p>But guess which group exploits both men and women for their own benefit?  The global elites.  And guess what MGTOW will eventually bring down, if it succeeds...  There&#39;s only one reason the media fears MGTOW and it ain&#39;t because MGTOW is tyrannical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was saying some the same things for 30 years before others caught on, but I have observed MGTOW for 18 months now, and what you describe is only about 10% of what I observed. It reminds me of how feminists describe feminism as equal rights, but that is one of the things they least support.</p>

<p>MGTOW (based on the comments of its supporters) is exactly what the name implies. It is about men not getting entangled in any way with women because government and media (supposedly at the request of women) have weaponized relationships between men and women and thus made relationships toxic for men because we are now so commonly and easily victimized by atrocities perpetrated by government, the media and women.</p>

<p>Although that is all true, creating lots of single moms makes the problem worse because single moms can be depended on to vote for exactly what you claim MGTOW opposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My perspective is that of a neutral observer.  I have points about it that I agree with and points I don’t.  But I do think it deserves an honest hearing.  At least in terms of its ideals.  I suppose that it’s possible that not all adherents are as rigorous or versatile in separating its utility from its cruft.</p>

<p>But what I do think is worth noting is that a government is not likely to do well without talented men.  And the talented men will be the first to go.  The results are more likely collapsing than viable oppression.</p>

<p>Also I don’t really think that marriage is understood properly.  The principle is fine if people were not susceptible to sins.  But they are and marriage is built on a principle from God that doesn’t work as well once such beliefs are rejected by society at large.  But in terms of the evolutionary process it’s spot on to recognize marriage as corrupt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  I didn&#39;t say that &quot;evolution contradicts marriage.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m <em>agreeing</em> that these evolutionary forces of hypergamy exist and evopsych and MGTOWs are identifying their causes correctly.  But what I&#39;m saying is that these are excesses and there exists a point of balance when these excesses are curbed on both sides which is not being taken into account.  It&#39;s a careful and precarious balance, but anything that is homeostatic is like that.</p>

<p>When female hypergamy is kept in check by the threat of divorce and male hypergamy is kept in check by the obligation to provide for the resulting offspring, the result is that both parties are required to act in terms of long-term benefit.  This balance is part of what is inherent in the institution of marriage as I believe God designed it.</p>

<p>The fact that it&#39;s unstable or that most of the time humans totally ruin it is not being challenged, though.  It&#39;s something of a <em>miracle</em> if we ever observe it working at all.  That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Porn is why? How about the fact that we are wage slaves swimming in mass amounts of debt, with little to no help to actually better our lives. No ability to pursue our true dreams. Drugs. Alcohol. Dude porn is pretty far fucking down there lol. Anyone with half a logical brain, understands that porn IS NOT REAL. That&#39;s not how sex really is. That&#39;s not how relationships work. That&#39;s now how you treat the opposite sex. Everything else I&#39;ve mentioned is out of your hands. Unless you have money. Which most people do not. Poverty is the main reason for substance abuse and suicide rates. Not porn. That&#39;s ridiculous as hell man. </p>

<p>As far as no fap goes, I&#39;m not really sure. For every study that shows pros, there is another study that shows there is no difference. So which is the right one? Basically the same with every issue that is around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, it&#39;s hard to tell which facts to believe today because so many agendas are being pushed. </p>

<p>One of the most misleading studies so far is the one where it shows a testosterone spike at the end of 7 days of abstaining but shows the testosterone once again dips to normal levels the day after.</p>

<p>This study has been used to show that abstaining from PMO doesn&#39;t affect your overall test levels but if you look into it, the free testosterone that is measured in the blood is absorbed into the body after 7 days, actually giving you a boost. </p>

I mean, if you have that sort of problem with pornography or anything else for that matter, you should seek help. That&#39;s unhealthy... I&#39;m not saying porn is ok, but moderation exists.

<p>But we have to ask ourselves, how did we get to this point...? Some may say it&#39;s the ambitions of evil people giving in to there need for power and money. But I see it as entropy...the breaking down of all systems of all scales...if you are rooted only in your human perspective, you will see the world as black and white, tho vs you think are evil and tho vs you think are not... but to truly realize why things are the way they are you have to first understand that,objectively, human life doesn&#39;t matter (to the universe or to any god), and realize that our human perspective makes us self-important, we are biological organisms on a Rock....is that reason to hate and neglect and disregard each other, NO, ABSOULTLY NOT....but it does explain suffering, it does not matter that humans suffer, no matter how we try to control life on this little rock we enhabit, there will always be suffering, because it&#39;s only subectivly suffering, outside our human perspective, it&#39;s just life....nature... any separation of humans and nature is an illusion...we are the pure embodiment of nature....</p>

<p>My main point is that is does not matter if we matter or not. We are here, we exist, that should be good enough...</p>

<p>we really don&#39;t matter, our species could be gone tomorrow and it wouldn&#39;t matter...ojectivly we have no purpose and our lives have no meaning and i don&#39;t see why everyone wouldn&#39;t want to look at it that way... stop seeking objective validation for your existence, you don&#39;t need it, and will never find it.

<p>Because once a woman is pregnant she is tied down for many many years. So the ability to just abort the child means she can escape her chains. </p>

<p>I don’t support abortion morally either. I kept my baby. But I also had to stay in a place I didn’t really like because her dad and family were there. A child ties you to people and places. So if I chose to abort I’d be “empowering” myself and would be free to go wherever I wanted. </p>

<p>If you think about it, there is enough money and technological advancements for there to be none of the problems that exist in this realm. Someone somewhere doesn&#39;t want that to happen though. Maybe this place was never meant to be equal for everyone? Maybe it truly is a middle ground where we are being tested as individuals? Sort of a karma type deal.

    <div class="md"><p>While it is paramount that we treat everyone with dignity, maximizing population is not a moral imperative. You seem to conflate life and soul. Which is more valuable, the life or the soul?</p>

<p>A large part of what makes people poor is that they believe what they want to believe. For example, they believe their government is legitimate, but government is what makes people poor, and freedom is what makes people wealthy. Some even choose to champion overtly evil leaders like Marx, Lenin, Castro, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Chavez, etc. </p>

<p>Instead of taking the fruits of some men&#39;s labor and giving it to others, why not help the poor to overcome those beliefs that are hobbling them ... like how you are helping the middle class to overcome their lack of respect for the dignity of others and for the health of the environment.</p>

<p>We live in a cronyist system, and to become rich is a cronyist system is a disgrace.</p>

<p>Awareness is indeed the solution. Notice how politicians compete fiercely to be America&#39;s Next Top Frontman, but they will never threaten the illusion of legitimacy because without the illusion of legitimacy, the conspirators are finished.</p>

Maybe I missed your point here- but that doesn&#39;t make any sense.
Especially when you realize that we aren&#39;t really free anymore. We are all enslaved to an extent. 
I&#39;ll wait for your clarification before I continue because maybe I missed what you were trying to say. </p>

<p>If we as a society never face up to the hard facts then we&#39;ll never move forward.  Religion is a form of mental illness.  It makes a large section of society act in ways that are neither rational nor logical.  How will we ever get these people the help they need if we as a society can&#39;t even face the fact that they&#39;re sick?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wrong you spent your whole life making decisions because of a false belief system.  You&#39;ve harmed yourself and those around you because of your irrational beliefs, and wasted a good portion of your life that could have been used to better yourself instead.  You&#39;ve infected others with your illness, and you go through life unwilling - probably even unable - to consider that you might be wrong.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re right, well, then you&#39;re the luckiest being in the history of the universe.  If your set of arbitrary beliefs, by pure blind chance, happen to mirror the underlying truths of the universe then you&#39;ve won a lottery with odds that make winning the 6/49 one hundred times in a row look like a sure bet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s the modern evangelical christian-lite interpretation in any case.  The Catholics and the Anglicans do not agree, nor do most of the fundamentalist factions. But whatever mental gymnastics you need to do do justify your behavior, by all means perform them :)  </p>

<p>It&#39;s in the context of a school, or a teacher / student relationship.  A man can teach a woman, but never should a woman instruct a man.  Which makes this whole conversation a bit of satire, dontcha think?  And that&#39;s hardly the only time Paul said a woman should submit to a man.  If I remember correctly there are 5 other times in Paul&#39;s letters, each in a different context.  And that&#39;s ignoring the Old Testament entirely, because apparently the rules written by JHVH himself don&#39;t apply to you.</p>

<p>This is what I mean by irrational.  You ignore the clear, easy to understand instructions actually written in your book, and make up this whole cloud of justifications and rationalizations about why those instructions don&#39;t apply to you.  You make up your beliefs as you go along, and if the instructions in your book contradict how you act you ignore them.  I mean, if you want to devote your life to your religion then by all means do so, but stop being a hypocrite and obey your book.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad that you came to such a conclusion, you do know that the elite of the elite, those in real power calling the shots, above the international bankers want you to think that way. You&#39;re preaching solipsism than nothing around you matters. What&#39;s funny is that solipsism is a (satanic sin)[<a href="http://www.churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-sins.php">http://www.churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-sins.php</a>]. My point is the more you think that everything around you doesn&#39;t matter and is insignificant the more easy it is for you to be controlled and manipulated because you can care less for all the evil and bullshit happening in the world causing people people to suffer. That kind of thinking can cause you to not care about your own well being iforced your not there yet. I&#39;m not as nice as polkadotgirl because she&#39;s actually trying to help more than I can say. Because I don&#39;t care if you agree with me or not Im just saying it how it is I dont got time to care for anyone who doesn&#39;t give a shit about anything even themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So because you feel that because the Universe is so grand anything that humanity does is insignificant. Even though humanity has the capacity to understand the Universe in its grand scheme. What exactly do you feel is insignificant about humanity its pretty vague what your implying. In that kind of thinking do you see yourself as insignificant and if so why do you decide to keep on living if you feel life is insignificant? I&#39;am curious to what you think and where you&#39;re worldview comes from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are hundreds of billions of star systems in the universe that could feasibly support life like ours.  If even the tiniest fraction of them actually do then we&#39;re talking about <em>at the very least</em> millions, if not billions of other alien cultures of comparable significance to ours.  We are nothing.  </p>

<p>Anyways, you should maybe read more carefully.  I said that the only value we have is that which we arbitrarily define.  I value my life, my family, my friends, my job, my country.  I&#39;m just not so arrogant as to suppose I mean anything at all in the larger picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre looking at life in a grand scale but relative to life in other parts of the Universe which makes you feel that your life and culture is insignifcant yet you value your life, family, friends, and country. Yes you can say we arbitrarily define our value but we do have value as human beings and that is the capacity to understand our reality for its truth. We all have that potential we dont just make that up. Aliens evolving to a state of consciousness in a galaxy we never heard about is irrelevant because you yourself are creating this arbitrary value of your value as a human being relative to life in the Universe yet you have never met but only wonder evolution in other planets or galaxies. Is that what you mean if not correct me if I&#39;am wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do I have to suffer so much? I totally understand what you&#39;re saying about this &#39;false comfort&#39;. But there&#39;s also something else. I can hear their cries at night. I can feel their pain. I feel like I have eyes on me at all times and I get feelings of despair even when I&#39;m trying to block them out. Do you feel the connection that I feel to others? Are people just ghosts in the machine at this point, not realizing what influences their thoughts and actions? There&#39;s a reason why we are suffering and it&#39;s not just to wake up. </p>

<p>We are limited by this society, by the rules of this world. Those limitations are killing us! I try to be kind and I try to have hope that someday soon we won&#39;t just be broken records; that we can play beautiful music at will. I&#39;m going to keep hoping and working bit by bit towards it. But we all have to work together eliminate what confines us. For a society free of most restrictions can be a society that is whole and unified.</p>

<p>We are bits of lives pieced together and we have to, no matter what, try to remember and finally deal with what has plagued are very DNA for millennia.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>However, when our beliefs overpower doing what is good or right, then our beliefs become our own cage. This is the definition of a paradigm or pattern in our thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah the power of programming.  Being a programmer, it is quite obvious that although we havent yet established a supreme understanding of consciousness, some in power have learned ways to exploit it&#39;s common language.  Not the linguistic one necessarily, but the moreiimportant universal one. </p>

<p>How do we go about combatting this in people we know?  How do we combat against the programmed belief of relativism.  I argue for absolutism and many of my coworkers have someone come to the conclusion that everything is relative and evil is only a label etc.   I once was programmed with this materialistic, &quot;Einstein-ian&quot; world view (where even time and space is relative, beyond all human logic!).  But, fortunately, I was able to emerge from this thick shell ... no a cage like the one you begin to explain above.  The weird thing is, the cage is only a mental one.  We can&#39;t look around and see it or feel it.  I don&#39;t even remember the time or series of events which allowed me to see this for what it was/is.  Would appreciate someone else opinions, giving the subject of this thread.  I think it&#39;s entirely relevent to this dialogue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the sentiment, but believing that you matter when the universe uniformly agrees you don&#39;t, is to me akin to recovering alcoholics finding god.</p>

<p>Make a real argument for why we matter, and why we should think that we do, outside of the chemical ergonomics of existing as a human. </p>

<p>To me if you think so much of yourself and your situation you will never risk yourself for fear of what you value. </p>

<p>Maybe we are supposed to be reacting with narcissism and a lack of self esteem when to the stimuli our society shoves upon us clearly communicates that those calling the shots DON&#39;T value us. </p>

<p>If we never risk our lives, that we might have to undervalue to risk, in order to change the world for the better then we are essentially just finding excuses to adapt to being powerless and domestic instead of removing the dissonance of our rulers by risking our lives.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t matter more than the thousands of species we wipe out yearly by &quot;innocently&quot; existing. Abortion is cool, and it is also killing a living thing, and that&#39;s okay, we aren&#39;t that important if our existence just breeds people who have no hope of self actualization, and whose existence wipes out the true innocent victims, the destruction of the nature that evolved our intelligence to begin with.</p>

It takes the power to change from outside yourself and puts it in your hands. It makes it seem so clear to me that so many religions were corrupted or designed to keep us from doing this. People unfortunately bring inappropriate assumptions and illusions to this arena. It&#39;s a place where they are to be questioned, dissected and dismissed if they are not true. Dogma is what keeps us from knowing amgod. </p>

<p>How can you be free of imposters of God while you still believe God is outside you? </p>

<p>Should we fall to the wills of the wielders of magic tricks based on knowledge or technology unknown to us at the present moment?</p>

<p>However, I cannot and will not love every soul, personality or being. That is wrong. That is not functional. Some beings chose to be evil. Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. Everything else is just unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance.</p>

<p>Evil personalities don&#39;t deserve love, because they gobble it all up, without appreciation, and then resume their evil ways. They see it as weakness to exploit. This inevitable betrayal experience discourages those who give them love or forgiveness. It makes them less likely to repeat those helpful behaviors for others in the future, corrupting them, possibly fooling others that the evil is being chosen no more in the process, making them available to more evil experiences.</p>

<p>I too find fault in what some new age thinkers assert. Forgiving parasitic intentioned beings is simply submission to slavery to them, nothing more. It looks very similar to how slaves are broken. They get abused until they submit to their oppressors. Sympathy for the devil, stockholm syndrome, forgiving repeated abuse all are ways to describe an intent for our choices from the evil forces in this place. </p>

<p>They want to own our souls, our multi-lifetime experience and personality units that universal consciousness wears. They can own our souls if they trick us that ownership of others is acceptable. For as we embrace their way of life, we join their great crab bucket vortex of value and enslave others WHILE WE TOO ARE ENSLAVED. This is their pyramid scheme of damnation they play on races in many places in the cosmos. It&#39;s way beyond Christianity or any other religious belief system here. They set us up to be in need of external restraint, because we will lack self-restraint. They plan to impose themselves as that restraint. They fool so many so well. </p>

<p>I find that the wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing here are quite adept and they hide in the places we expect benevolence, because we place a lot of trust in those places. Evil beings are hackers, manipulators of others to serve themselves, like parasites or diseases. They know they can easily hijack our faith, our trust of God, angels, benevolent ETs, religion, the new age, science, etc. They abuse that trust to achieve greater personal profits. To expect them not to is to expect a hungry dog not to go for an unguarded steak. We need to grow up and start expecting opportunistic parasites to feed on whatever they can.</p>

<p>The real face of religion is that of a foul draconian spiritual parasite, taking awareness of God from God and making God bow before the below worthless, themselves of course. They want the power we possess, but refuse to fully admit or acknowledge that it comes from alignment with the processes of God and evaporates as we defy them as they do. They modify their own DNA and other&#39;s DNA in order to overcome this barrier and they never will. It makes them so jealous of us. They fucked themselves and won&#39;t admit it. When we emulate them, we become them and disconnect from the awareness and power of God. Why?</p>

<p>God is the ultimate systems administrator. Systems administrators are concerned with the wellbeing of the systems they administer. Except, God knows he is one with all that is under his care. He can grant special rights to some users if he finds them worthy of responsibility. If not, he won&#39;t, because it would cause problems for the systems he administers. This is all discernable from the practice knowing yourself and using your empathy. This is why God denies them reconnection, they just want more power to abuse against God&#39;s other selves. God doesn&#39;t want them to wreck this immense, causal, contiguous reality that spans billions of light years and billions of years of time.</p>

<p>Why does God allow them? The excuse that I find compelling is that they are an inevitable expression of this experience of perceiving ourselves as separate from God. The choice to be evil is so much more appealing if you don&#39;t know you are those you hurt. It comes with this, unavoidably. They also facilitate a deeper expression of this perception of separation. It has mixed reviews. It&#39;s what Earth is experiencing now. They play God and torment us with some limitations. They are required to allow us avenues to overcome them by God. </p>

<p>If we never take personal responsibility, insisting to act as children and demand others take responsibility for us, we remain under their parasitic rule. Let&#39;s face it, petulant, stagnant children are not manageable for even the most gifted benevolent beings. The evil ones make us this way deliberately using fear, especially of God. The suffering we endure is an incentive to kick them out of our minds. As we cling to religion, we choose to submit to them and continue the illusion. As we seek God on our own as individuals, we develop ourselves as unique, interesting personalities, and that process creates a lot of value for our consciousness, our many selves, in interacting with each other. </p>

<p>God doesn&#39;t want slaves. The imposters of God do. And so, they all are slaves as they create their lives to be. They combine into a oneness of evil we know as many names, which also include all the names of God. You can know these evil beings by their fruit, slavery, deception, coercion. They get us to blame others for what we do, God, the devil, angels and demons. They get us to place our power outside of us so they can command it for us. They get high on our fear and pain. They want to keep us alive to feed on us, like golden geese. As parasites they require deception or coercion to maintain their imbalanced value exchange relationships. We shed them as we erode those two avenues of control. To do this, we seek and respect the actual truth and we protect each other&#39;s rights, each other&#39;s free will. </p>

<p>If we beg God to do it, the devil and his minions continue to rape us by God&#39;s will and I explained why. To reconnect with God, you can&#39;t be a slave, a follower or a mind appendage of another. You have to be yourself. How could you really fill those shoes as a bitch of bullshitters? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Narcissism is a static &gt;1%, and is not mere &quot;self-absorption.&quot; The criteria is interesting, because the government and the private entities that attempt to exert rule over people is, by nature, narcissistic and fits the definition to a &quot;T&quot;.</p>

<p>The defense mechanism they preach is to &quot;control your own emotional reaction&quot; rather than seek to control the narcissist&#39;s behavior.</p>

<p>This is a useless defense mechanism.</p>

<p>Telegraphing, transparency and reverse triangulation is how you deal with a narcissist on a personal level. Not with the goal to make them realize they are a narcissist, as that is impossible, but with the goal to tricking the narcissist into managing their own behavior.</p>

<p>It is also appropriate to deal with non-person entities, like governments, in this manner. In fact, it is the only defense against these entities.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever wondered if &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; was not satire, but still political criticism? &quot;Telegraphing&quot; the practices of the ruling class is the first step to protecting your fellow man.</p>

<p>&quot;In August 2008, he told Southern California megachurch Pastor Rick Warren his definition of marriage: &quot;I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it is also a sacred union. God&#39;s in the mix.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad that you came to such a conclusion, you do know that the elite of the elite, those in real power calling the shots, above the international bankers want you to think that way. You&#39;re preaching solipsism than nothing around you matters. What&#39;s funny is that solipsism is a (satanic sin)[<a href="http://www.churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-sins.php">http://www.churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-sins.php</a>]. My point is the more you think that everything around you doesn&#39;t matter and is insignificant the more easy it is for you to be controlled and manipulated because you can care less for all the evil and bullshit happening in the world causing people people to suffer. That kind of thinking can cause you to not care about your own well being iforced your not there yet. I&#39;m not as nice as polkadotgirl because she&#39;s actually trying to help more than I can say. Because I don&#39;t care if you agree with me or not Im just saying it how it is I dont got time to care for anyone who doesn&#39;t give a shit about anything even themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to thank the people that saw where I was coming from. I appreciate your posts. Same goes for anybody that respectfully disagreed.</p>

<p>As for you, I feel YOU&#39;RE wrong. What&#39;s your reasons for bringing kids into this world? Is it to impact your life? &quot;You just feel more whole with kids!&quot; &quot;You won&#39;t feel like a woman until you&#39;ve fulfilled that maternal instinct and became a mom.&quot; Isn&#39;t that selfish? You&#39;re playing Russian Roulette with somebody else&#39;s life. That&#39;s what it is, wouldn&#39;t you say? I look at the story from the original post about kids eating mud pies. No, I&#39;m not judging them for not working hard or whatever. All I want to do is ask if those kids were made on purpose and why. If you&#39;re struggling day to day with finding enough to eat for yourselves, why are you bringing kids into this world so they can suffer right next to you? </p>

<p>And talking about my attitude, I have every right to think and feel the way I do. I don&#39;t view this existence with rose color glasses. I see the shit for what it is. I can look outside of myself and see the suffering and bullshit in this world. I can identify with it. Since this is a huge story these days for kids, how many stories have we had lately of bullied kids committing suicide? As somebody that was bullied and definitely suicidal about it, I see what life is like in a hopeless situation where people weren&#39;t raised with good manners. They&#39;re not raised to leave people alone if they don&#39;t like them. Can I blame the victims for thinking that death was the only way out? Not really. The human species is a particularly cruel one. I&#39;d rather be fed to wolves than go through life again. Instant death is better than the one that drags around, no matter the circumstance.</p>

<p>Our whole existence can be summed up like this to describe all the bad things in our world. I know I only referenced bullying in this post. Everybody else can fill in the blanks on their own. I don&#39;t want to write a book about it. Anyway, it&#39;s so small but it describes so many problems in our world. We have to depend on people to do the right and honorable thing and we don&#39;t have that. Across all levels we don&#39;t have that. Each day is a new low somewhere in the world with the shit people can do to others. It&#39;s sickening.</p>

<p>As for the issues I named in my original post, I&#39;ve had a lifetime of dealing with this shit. Would you intentionally get a young child drunk? Would you light up a cigarette and blow the smoke into the child&#39;s face? Would you take that cigarette and burn the child? How is any of that different than somebody KNOWING they have health problems that could easily be passed down and make their child suffer?  Doing that to somebody I would supposedly love? Yeah, that&#39;d be beyond fucked up and cruel. And that&#39;s why even if I LIKED kids and wanted them, I&#39;d still choose to avoid having them. I would love them too much to see them suffer day in and day out. I realize no good comes from it. There&#39;s certainly no lessons learned from it. There&#39;s no reason to bring them here for them to be fed off. They won&#39;t be a food source here. </p>

<p>Save your scorn for the assholes that created this lab rat experiment, the ones that do their part in making sure that this place is as miserable as possible. Don&#39;t use your scorn on somebody boycotting in their own way. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m not going to sit here and reason this away or make excuses for it. Not gonna sugarcoat it and say &quot;Awww, this existence wasn&#39;t that bad. I&#39;d probably do it again if I could.&quot; This is me standing up and saying &quot;NO MORE&quot;. End of the day I realize I&#39;m wasting my time writing all this because I doubt you and I will see eye to eye.</p>
