    <div class="md"><p>Can we stop saying &quot;Jewish&quot; influence? I&#39;m sure you&#39;re talking about some Jewish family like the Rothschilds or something. Just because one Jewish family basically controls the world, that doesn&#39;t mean that there is some sort of <em>Jewish</em> conspiracy. They&#39;re not powerful because they&#39;re Jewish, they&#39;re powerful because they&#39;re rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IM not saying that they only deal in rape. They control everything. How is that even being argued against. Who knows if they are all in cahoots with one another? I dont. I dont know what they allegedly may have done in order to meet the scope of whats been necessary for the meteoric rise of television and entertainment. </p>

<p>Kevin Spacey was abused as a child. His father was a horrible person. </p>

<p>Bill Cosby is a psychopath who&#39;s bizarre behavior has been covered up for <em>years</em>. Cosby is a serial rapist, and if there was more documentation would be on the list for top predators of all time.</p>

<p>Who covered all those tracks for both of those guys all these years?</p>

<p>If your next point is &quot;Then why are they caught&quot; Then I&#39;ll answer it by saying that they are the trickle-truth personified. Cosby was outed by Hannibal, a comedian friend of several well-known Jews. Spacey on the other hand was a bomb waiting to drop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The “conspiracy” is really just hypocrisy. They advocate for making America a multicultural open-borders consumerist shopping center... while Israel remains essentially an ethno-state, regulating who can gain citizenship, deporting Ethiopian Jews, etc. There isn’t anything wrong with what Israel is or does. What’s annoying is when dual-citizenship Jews in America advocate to make America a place that welcomes all the dregs of the world. </p>

<p>And I swear they had Alex Jones on JRE&#39;s 911th episode to fuck with search algorithms so if you&#39;re looking for &quot;Joe rogan on Alex Jones on 9/11&quot; you&#39;ll get the 911th show of JRE. Brilliant!!!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be a huge Rogan fan. Then he changed when he moved to Vegas and started hanging out with Penn and Teller, the Amazing Randi and the &quot;professional skeptic circuit&quot;. It&#39;s then that he turned into a &quot;conventionalist&quot;. Instead of questioning things, he started attacking people who questioned things.</p>

<p>I remember on his short-lived TV show &quot;Joe Rogan Questions Everything,&quot; he denied that chem trails existed. Then oops: Old podcasts on Youtube demonstrated that he had high-level knowledge of them years ago. Yet on his show, he acted like he didn&#39;t know about a lot of the documentation and played dumb.</p>

<p>It shocked me. So yeah: He became a shill.</p>

<p>As I said: I trace it to the time when he started hanging out what the Penn and Teller/Amazing Randi crowd. Randi in particular has all sorts of CIA ties. His skeptic organization even shared a building with a CIA office. He&#39;s also on the Board of the &quot;False Memory Foundation,&quot; which is a pedophile front group that goes around trying to discredit victims in trials: an organization that has been linked to the CIA&#39;s Project Monarch [where they use children to blackmail politicians].</p>

<p>So Joe&#39;s acquired a lot of creepy friends once he made the move to Vegas and started hanging out with these creeps.</p>

<p>Then his podcast started to change and morph.</p>

<p>I think a forensic analysis of his bank account would answer a lot of questions for why his tone and methodology changed. And why he went from a questioner to a Defender of the Orthodoxy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, those influences have been terrible on Rogan, but he&#39;s had some really good influences too, such as Graham Hancock and the MAPS crowd, his friends Aubrey Marcus and Duncan Trussell. Rogan is split, but at this point I still like the guy and think there&#39;s hope. I believe hes honest, just confused, but so are most people. At least Rogan is trying to find the truth. Check out his interview debate between Graham Hancock and Michael Shermer.</p>

<p>And Rogan has done more than perhaps anyone in history other than Terence McKenna to bring the bizarre DMT story to public consciousness. If you&#39;ve never done it- try DMT someday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just think about it. Joe has 2 million subscribers on YouTube alone, nevermind all the other platforms. If he went against the establishment and started creating dissent, he&#39;d be scooped up and taken to the MK Ultra lab so fast, just like they did with Kanye West. He has way too much influence over people and the people in charge know it.</p>

<p>FWIW, Alex Jones admitted that the CIA paid Rogan a visit and told him to shut his mouth. You can see a sharp stance change with Joe Rogan, almost as if he&#39;s undoing all the damage he already caused with his moon hoax talk. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because they wouldn&#39;t email him LMFAO. That wouldn&#39;t get the message across. They&#39;d knock on his door and day stfu or your finished. End of story. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but that doesn&#39;t make any sense.  He used to be &quot;open minded&quot; but at some point a few years ago he flipped and now is &quot;too stupid&quot; to know anything for himself and all of the sudden he preaches the status quo.  In his very first episode of &#39;Joe Rogan Questions Everything&#39;  He &quot;debunked&quot; chemtrails by teaming up with mega shill Mick West.  It was over the top ridicules as they had no evidence and Joe is an over the top obvious shill (regardless of the reasons why he is a has made the decision to sell out)</p>

<p>His views have evolved since he started the pod. That’s expected when you have the chance to sit down and converse with a variety of different people who process and articulate vast amounts of information differently.</p>

<p>I believe he’s evolved to the point of wanting to be more fact based and scientific when conspiracy theories are discussed. He’s still a comedian, so it’s not like he has all the answers. At the end of the day he’s entitled to his own opinion. But he’s definitely had some ex abc guys on his show. Maybe they’ve swayed his opinions by giving him insider breadcrumbs and he believes it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he started out as a dude who was curious about things and that’s why if you listen to the first episodes you hear him talk about all various out there subjects.  I think as time went on and he started having guests on that the whole world is indoctrinated to feel are “legit” he then started to gain more popularity and now he knows he can’t play mr smart comedian know it all so if you notice when he has a guest on like Neil the grass Tyson’s he plays the submissive and curious role but when when he has someone who is not an expert in their field he feels more confidence and has a very much more dominant and snarky tone.  And then of course there is the Cali lip smack he does when he thinks your about to be blown away by his “unique” view about something.  Also as many others have said he seems to be one of those people who hold out what they really feel about certain subjects because it’s eventually going to be viewed as anti pc by someone and just tip toes the middle line in the name of downloads.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what he portrays, however, a couple of years ago he was a full on conspiracy theorist. His moon hoax debates were legendary but he&#39;s since done a 180 on that and nearly every other conspiracy. He used to question WT7 but now he pushes the mainstream narrative.  </p>

He talked so much shit on the moon landings and when Neil D Tyson came, he throatfuck-swallowed the official narrative. He talks about the Gulf of Tonkin these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure. I like Rogan too, even tho he tends to mirror his guests a lot of the time. I dunno if he is a shill tho, if I had to guess he prob got wrapped up in some conspiracy theories that were proven false, and being a public figure got a lot of hate and trolling for it so now he is more careful about what he talks about. As for Deep state, there may be some security risk or loss of advertisers compared to aliens and stuff like that. </p>

<p>He does get some werid guests on tho... I think there was an ex CIA dude who seemed like he was trying to put his spin on things, and I think a &quot;professional debunker&quot; who did similar stuff like calling Tom crazy lol, tho at the time I wouldn&#39;t blame him as most people did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been listening to the JRE podcast for about 4-5 months now. I firmly believe that he KNOWS a lot of shit. The GOOD stuff. That being said, I believe that because he is the show runner of one of the most widely listened to podcasts in the world, he must be careful about what he puts out there. </p>

<p>I used to believe that podcasts were the last form of media that remained completely out of the dirty hands of censorship. The more I listen, the less I am inclined to believe this. </p>

<p>As someone mentioned earlier, in the interest of seeing his daughters grow up happily, I believe JR  has no choice but to talk about what he can and save the savory stuff for his private convos that aren’t being listened to (or monitored by) millions of people. </p>

<p>I personally believe that Rogan’s most raw and unfiltered podcast was #911 featuring Eddie Bravo and Alex Jones. Though Alex Jones may SEEM incoherent and absolutely ‘shilly’, I really understood a lot of the points he was making. They sounded goofy and strange upon first listen, but after a couple more listens, it dawned on me that AJ was saying 95% of what I hold to be true in terms of what he refers to as “offworld technology” and “psychic vampires”. Though I may very well be wrong, these are my personal beliefs on the subject. </p>

<p>Onward! </p>
