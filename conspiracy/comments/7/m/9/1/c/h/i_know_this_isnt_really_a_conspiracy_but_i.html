<p>This is literally the worst example. The law doesn&#39;t prevent people from turning down photographing a pig roast because a pig roast is not a protected class of people. Just like the law doesn&#39;t prevent restaurants from turning away patrons who aren&#39;t wearing shirts or shoes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that when a place is consider a &quot;place of public accommodation&quot;, as virtually all open-to-the-public businesses are, they have agreed by virtue of opening said business to not discriminate against customers.  No, you don&#39;t get a religious exemption.  If it isn&#39;t acceptable to discrimination against blacks, for instance, based on your religion (hint: it&#39;s not) then it&#39;s isn&#39;t acceptable to discriminate against gays.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the extent of my answer.  I&#39;ve had many, many people bring up the &quot;what if....&quot; in order to argue the point with me, and so far, I have seen no &quot;what if...&quot; that has swayed me even a little.</p>

<p>It would be one thing if the customer just wanted to buy a product &quot;off the rack,&quot; but asking the baker to participate in creating a unique piece of art (to the extent that something made from frosting can be considered art) to me is the dividing line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve been told by a few gay friends, the couple involved were dickish and have been waging a bit of a crusade against this baker for years. Quite an asinine thing to do, which I believe (if true) could turn around and bite them in the ass. Meaning the baker could get the ruling in his favor because of it.</p>

<p>For my opinion? If you are a creator (baker, artist...etc), you should have the right to deny any request. Honestly, I can&#39;t see some &quot;boss&quot; level individual going &quot;No gays!&quot; simply due to the fact that they&#39;re paying for the individuals  (their workers) to do them a service in exchange for cash, not take their money to make them something.</p>

<p>Plus, plenty of supposedly bigoted people are out there already and exist. They&#39;ll find different ways to remove someone from their work roster in a totally legal way. They could make up some obscure-as-hell rule that prays upon an individual&#39;s weakness or fears, thus canning them for not doing their job because of it. </p>

<p>However I&#39;m not a lawyer, so how this ruling could comes about is up in the air for me. So I can&#39;t really voice any real opinion outside of the fact that creators should be given the right to deny a job. If that upsets people, vote with your wallet by going to a creator that&#39;ll make whatever it is you want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Refusing service is way different then being fired. Slippery slope is a logical fallacy. In a free market a business has the right to refuse service to anyone, when the customers of said business finds out about the refusal of service if they disagree they can boycott the bakery and the bakery will have to change its ways or fail and make room for a better one. There are dozens of other bakeries that would love to make a cake for a gay wedding. As i understand it the gay couple went out of their way to find a christian bakery that would refuse service. Muslim bakeries have been caught on camera refusing service for the exact reason but don’t ever get reprimanded. Government intervention ALWAYS makes things worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Muslim photographer can decline to photograph any host of events. But if it is because the PEOPLE running it are from a protected class, then they should not be able to decline it.</p>

<p>So again, having a pig roast is not a protected class and anyone can decline it regardless of their religion. Your example would be relevant if you just stuck to &quot;refuse to photograph a same-sex wedding&quot;</p>

<p>The reason the baker is refusing is because the couple is gay. not because the food is against their religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not understanding the distinction here. The supreme court ruled that same sex marriage is allowable under law.

    <div class="md"><p>You missed the point. Using your example, you said &quot;equal protection under the law.&quot; And your other example was &quot;forcing states to honor their marriage &quot;</p>

<p>So states are required to recognize same sex marriage because it is law. </p>

<p>The baker in this case would be comparable to the individual priest that refuses to officiate a gay marriage, not the state recognizing the marriage. Because the business is not allowed to refuse a customer from buying their products or entering their store based on law, however, they are not obliged to participate in a practice that violates their religious beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wedding cakes are long existing. Never go into a business that contains elements that directly contradict your spiritual or moral beliefs unless you are willing to lose that business, recieve the societal backlash or compromise.</p>

<p>Biblically, mark 12:17 tells us pretty much that adhire to the social standards and laws, but dont compromise your own morality. Similarly I hear &quot;christians&quot; say they wont give money to the homeless for fear they will buy alcohol or something maybe i guess they dont want to be a party to the sin?</p>

<p>Bible tells us when you give, give on secret and know that what another person does after your act of love is on them. Matthew 6:1-5 or so tells you to be private about it.</p>

<p>Although the bible doesnt tell you exactly how to run a shop that potentially caters to someone whose morality contlicts with your own, we can gather from Jesus&#39; instructions a way to approach it.</p>

<p>I personally respect religious obligations and wouldnt make it poitical by trying to force my opinion on another human being.</p>

<p>I wouldnt even give a fastfood drive-thru employee a hard time for fear of having my food sabotaged, how much worse can be done to a cake?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Muslim photographer can decline to photograph any host of events. But if it is because the PEOPLE running it are from a protected class, then they should not be able to decline it.</p>

<p>So again, having a pig roast is not a protected class and anyone can decline it regardless of their religion. Your example would be relevant if you just stuck to &quot;refuse to photograph a same-sex wedding&quot;</p>

<p>The reason the baker is refusing is because the couple is gay. not because the food is against their religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the retort doesn&#39;t follow logically. The example given was a Muslim saying no to photographing a pig roast. The case in question is about Christians saying no to baking a cake for a gay wedding. Not that they are saying no to baking a cake. Saying no because the couple is gay is against the law. saying no because a Muslim doesn&#39;t want to photograph a pig roast (which has nothing to do with a protected class of humans) is not against the law.</p>
