       The technology to see through the eyes of a cat was public in 99. They say tech behind the scenes is 50 years ahead, and technological improvements scale exponentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speculation:
Currently, technology exists to decode not only vision but hearing, thoughts and visualizations as well. This can be performed wirelessly. Input is also possible, meaning thoughts, visualizations, sounds and sights can be wirelessly inserted into a subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       This technology is known and utilized by all major governments and NGO's. The implications of the existence of such a technology are overwhelming. This is the brave new world.
      </p>

       Edit: Clip taken from a documentary technocalyps. Only watched a little so far but very interesting, discusses the trans-humanism.

       I find the suggestion at the end even more impressive. It would appear as though the cat perceives the human's face as cat-like. If true (proven perhaps by doing the same experiments with dogs) perhaps this the animal-version of anthropomorphization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Establishing clearer images of this supposed phenomenon could shine a light on all kinds of questions about the nature of consciousness. Incredible stuff.

       This is where hallucinogens or sleep deprivation can funk with that process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I experienced a miss communication with my brain after pulling an all nighter and being 24 hours sleep deprived. While the body felt awake enough to function off of adrenaline, my reaction time and cognitive ability was reduced to a point I almost ran a red light because I kept thinking in my head when the city replaced the red light bulbs with those bouncy red kickballs.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mind said red, said round, just couldn't make the connection to a traffic light or what to do at one.

       Our brains act like computer lookup tables and uses limited raw data clues that later become assembled and interpreted.

       yep i remember reading that alot of what we see daily are composite images of what seen/experienced before + expected outcomes. So when we are looking at something our brain fills in much of what we see with new information and old information and makes it all make sense for that particular moment.

       The can of worms that would be opened if this technology ever became public knowledge is what is holding it back. Also those that control it would some influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it will become public when some other technology has surpassed it making the influence it provides negligible.

       Well rather than reading what people see they could instead inject artificial sensations while using brainwaves as input for movement. And weapons aren't really something that big tech companies do so there's no need to worry about that.

       If a device is released publicly that can cause someone to experience false sensations, there's no way to prevent someone from using it to inflict involuntary false sensations on another.

       Someone could alter the device and use it to insert visuals into unwilling subjects.

       With that thinking, if someone was determined enough they could possibly make someone did whatever they wanted. Maybe not directly, but over a period of time asking with other factors you could change someone's perception of things.

       There's a ton of stories/movies of people going through a hard time, losing their families, their jobs, houses, etc. With the power some people have, things like that could be easily arranged.

       You could probably just do it by making things unenjoyable. Favorite show, game, music, friends, etc.. that could drive someone crazy. Then you would just have to plant certain data in front of them to change their views...

       This is certainly next generation creation of an entire platform of biomechanical systems. Consider a future based system where your AI assistant is your cat. Using this on humans is fraught with complications. Technologies like these are Pandoras boxes. When you open enough you start using the contents the boxes the magnitudes of potential for service to others, service to self, and service to the creator/destroyer become evident. It's a large thought most will have problems contextualizing.

       I am aware that it if fully possible to reach  depersonalization through traditional means. It just takes time desire and focus. The knowledge of that presents a wider array of potential if you are already in that state when presented with those who are induced. The subtle difference is the act of free will on this journey. As people do. They sign up for things they know virtually nothing about. Immediate enlightenment without preparation managed by a neurological system. That's a lot of free will you are giving up.

       That's an interesting point. One who has applied themselves to reach a heightened state would react very differently to what lies beyond the veil when compared to one who has had the experience induced.

       In the paper you linked, this concept of depersonalization seems to be linked with anxiety, depression, and trauma. Is it a desirable outcome? Why would anyone seek it out deliberately? It seems like a complex way of describing emotional numbness that results from bad experiences or physiological inclination to depression. I watched some of the YouTube videos, they are a bit tough to follow without any context. It isn't exactly clear in the doc or these videos whether or not 'depersonalization' is a good thing, you're associating it with some form of enlightenment?

       The context is changing that response by intervening.  take for example helping a person who has recently been technologically augmented deal with whatever emotions come from that. It's uses are so vast just in terms of memory in dealing with these traumas. Depersonalization is not either good or bad. It just is.  It's a way trauma can be dealt with. It is also how so called enlightenment can be explored. It depends on what you are depersonalizing. At least that's how I'm thinking now. I have to read a lot more around this. If I can find time.

       I think I get what you're saying. It's basically a way to shift perspective, and also an important field of research to consider with trends like transhumanism emerging, there are outcomes that need to be predicted and addressed before people start accepting microchip implants or things like the

        scene in Ghost in the Shell
       </a>
       where they have to deal with a brain-hack victim responding to the reality that all of his family memories are false. It would be best to get ahead of these types of problems and understand how technology affects consciousness, but like you said a lot of the research happens in the dark. At the consumer/citizen end we are getting a comically naive presentation of these technologies, like that business in Texas pitching their offer to microchip employees alongside a

       I know the question wasn't directed at me, however I'll try to answer. Depersonalization would be considered negative when experienced involuntarily, however has utility (such as the management of pain) and so may be desirable to experience voluntarily.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of depersonalization doesn't seem consistent. It can mean something similar to dysmorphia, eg looking in the mirror and not perceiving the reflection to be yourself. The definition closest to enlightenment would be similar to out of body experiences and ego death, a state of existing solely as consciousness,  free from a body. This is the state sought in transcendental meditation.

       Thanks for the response, it makes a bit more sense now. The name 'Depersonalization' seems similar to Dissassiociation, which appears to be the desired outcome of fear and trauma based research programs like MKultra, that's why I was skeptical of it being a desired outcome. The comparison to Transcendental Meditation makes sense though as far as being something worth pursuing, is the implication of the research being done that there's a possibility to simply implant a device that causes depersonalization to occur? If so, that seems like it would be a huge system-shock, Oliver Sacks had a variation of dysmorphia, but he was highly functional, its hard to imagine that total depersonalization would be anything but devastating, it's one thing to not be able to recognize faces, but how could a person live in a world without an identity? That seems like an automaton.

       This may be simplifying it, but depersonalization is conscious disassociation.  Disassociation involves no presence of mind. A period of disassociation will yield no memories. Whereas a period of  depersonalization can be remembered and consciously affected.

       Depersonalisation or disassociation as it is usually meant is the exact opposite of TM's effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deepest point of TM —
       <em>
        samadhi
       </em>
       — is described thusly: "
       <em>
        The state of Being is one of pure consciousness, completely out of the ﬁeld of relativity; there is no world of the senses or of objects, no trace of sensory activity, no trace of mental activity. There is no trinity of thinker, thinking process and thought; doer, process of doing and action; experiencer, process of experiencing and object of experience. The state of transcendental Unity of life, or pure consciousness, is completely free from all trace of duality.
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly "out of body" is the antithesis of this state as it is the ultimate state of
       <em>
        Yoga
       </em>
       —
       <em>
        union
       </em>

       I was of the opinion the point of TM was to achieve a state similar to a lucid dream. However it's clear from your post that's not the desired state.

       Well, technically there is no "desired state" during TM as any kind of goal will detract from effortless practice. TM is done for changes found outside of meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long-term TM practice results in a situation where a "pure" sense-of-self — a sense of "
       <strong>
        I am
       </strong>
       " not associated with perceptual or intellectual or emotional "stuff" — starts to emerge and eventually becomes permanent:
       <strong>
        I am
       </strong>
       is present at all times, whether one is awake, dreaming or even in deep sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long, long term (16,000 hours practice, on average) TMers who reported having such a pure sense-of-self 24/7 continuously for at least one year were asked to "describe yourself" and these were some of their responses:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          We ordinarily think my self as this age; this color of hair; these hobbies . . . my experience is that my Self is a lot larger than that. It's immeasurably vast. . . on a physical level. It is not just restricted to this physical environment

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>

          When I say ’’I’’ that's the Self. There's a quality that is so pervasive about the Self that I'm quite sure that the ‘‘I’’ is the same ‘‘I’’ as everyone else's ‘‘I.’’ Not in terms of what follows right after. I am tall, I am short, I am fat, I am this, I am that. But the ‘‘I’’ part. The ‘‘I am’’ part is the same ‘‘I am’’ for you and me

       The above descriptions apply during "witnessing dreaming" (not to be confused with
       <em>
        lucid

       dreaming). "Witnessing sleep" is can be described thusly:

         . . . there’s a continuum there. It’s not like I go away and come back. It’s a subtle thing. It’s not like I’m awake waiting for the body to wake- up or whatever. It’s me there. I don’t feel like I’m lost in the experience. That’s what I mean by a continuum. You know it’s like the fizzing on top of a soda when you’ve poured it. It’s there and becomes active so there’s something to identify with. When I’m sleeping, it’s like the fizzing goes down.

       Very insightful, thanks again. I remember reading a theory about the benefits of this continued state of consciousness; it proposed that after death you could retain consciousness, rather than entering a vague unconscious state where your soul could become lost and misguided. Similar to how sometimes we fall asleep and act strangely in our dreams with no memory of waking life; compared to (as described in your post) retaining memory and consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an interesting theory. I'd be very interested in whether these people are able to be hypnotized, or fall into a trance. Id assume not due to their persistent consciousness, how ever they may be able to relax and allow it.

       This is my thought. If they want a true test one of them should volunteer. First of all there is no way to know if there is any validity to the test and it's unethical besides. We're seeing a fuzzy version of the exact same thing so it doesn't really look like any processing is happening, just that the cat's brain acts as a filter that adds noise to the signal. Since the cat can't be questioned there is really no value to this test.

       Back in the early 00s I saw a video on PBS regarding brain waves and a monkey.  They gave the monkey a joystick and when he moved a dot on a monitor to a certain point, he was given food.  While he did this, they read his brain waves.  Eventually, they took the joystick away and the monkey mentally moved the dot with his mind.

       Its a super cool idea, decoding the brainwaves, but posts about this type of stuff seem to turn into targeted individual circle jerks - I apologize if I jumped the gun trying to derail a schizoid-type convention, didn't mean to be an ass.
