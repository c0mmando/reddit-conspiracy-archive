       This originally happened in ancient Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anubis would weigh your heart against a feather, if it was too heavy you were a sinner and would be sent to Apep - if it was too light, you were unimportant and you would be sent to Apep lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually the priests began to sell special items you could purchase and put on Anubis' scale in the afterlife to change the weight...
      </p>

       Nothing has changed to this day... money = freedom from the rules and norms of society, science, rationality and belief.

       Except major Hollywood figures with power keep being accused publicly of very serious misbehavior. So the theory of Weinstein as sacrificial lamb to end the revelations is the opposite of the truth.

       They used him as a scapegoat less than a week after the Vegas incident I believe to distract and take the story off that. Then more celebrities started coming out about this sort of stuff. Either coordinated or they knew other celebs would come out and say things furthering their distraction methods. Notice the Vegas story was dying by the day to almost like it never happened.

       How do you know the Vegas murders (it wasn't an incident dammit) weren't a coverup for the revelations about Weinstein?

       If so, they didn't work. Most people are capable of following more than one news story at a time. But of course most /conspiracy commenters don't believe that.

       So they threw us Weinstein, spacey, and a few others, and shifted the focus from satanic pedophilia, to a "people magazine" type of ratings boost series of sacrificial lambs.

       PG was not gaining traction. Despite it being pushed for over a year now, no victims or witnesses have come forward and no credible evidence has been presented. Even the Voat pizzagate forum is a shadow of its previous self. And pizzagaters were the ones who tried to shift the focus – once they realised no evidence was forthcoming and no arrests, they tried to rebrand it as "pedogate", so that they could claim any child abuse arrest as evidence of the conspiracy. Remember when David Seaman promised that dozens of elites would be arrested within a week and he claimed vindication when Jeffrey Sandusky was arrested?

       There are many, many powerful people in politics that rape children and never go to prison because everyone in politics keeps the mouths shut. Same thing with entertainment, the church (obivously), etc. This is a conspiracy. A fucking huge conspiracy. You can define PG as whatever you want but the fact is, is that John Podesta used language that the FBI has confirmed to be codewords for pedophilia and that should be enough to investigate it.

       It was not a "hot tub party" with children as the entertainment. Have you even read the emails yourself or have you just accepted the bullshit that's been pushed? A woman sent out an email to friends and family inviting them to a get together. She said that a friend and her grandchildren would be there, so they would have some further entertainment and that they'd be heating the swimming pool if people wanted to swim. She also noted that the kids would be swimming.

      <p>
       Asu/Lukerules noted, the FBI never confirmed the "code words". They came from 4chan. And John Podesta didn't even write most of the emails cited.

       Sure, and Corey Feldman's accusations. But it's overwhelmingly about the sexual harassment of women and it wasn't an organised conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you're saying that you'll find child abusers and sexual harassers in every sector of life (including business and politics), I would agree with that. And, if you're also saying that victims have kept quiet because of reasons such as embarrassment or shame or because they feared damaging their careers or because of the gruelling legal process or because they thought they might not be believed (or even because they'd come to private settlements with the abuser), then I'd agree with that, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you're saying that there is a conspiracy both to protect organised groups of child abusers and to enable them to continue to abuse, then I'd need to see some evidence for that.

       When I say “harbor an protect” I’m talking about the rapist’s peers knowing about it and not saying anything. That’s a conspiracy. NBC installing buttons in executive’s offices that lock the door so they can rape people is a conspiracy.

       Well if you arent talking about alefantis/podesta, should say pedogate, but nonetheless, I don't think if he was part of a global sex slavery ring we'd have him on tape begging a woman for sex. Not every sex crime committed by a powerful person has to be connected to every other one in the world.

       Can we retire the term pizzagate? It doesn't even remotely do justice to the international sex trafficking pedophile rings that are being uncovered. There's hard evidence on people like Jeffrey Epstein, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Bryan Singer, David Geffen... and many more to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       The narrow focus on Podesta and Comet Ping Pong and codewords is a distraction from the broader issue. I'm fine with something as bland as Pedogate until something else sticks. But Pizzagate sounds so ridiculous that when you mention it to anyone who isn't very online it elicits immediate eye rolls.

       PG was gaining traction, and the elites had to "throw those conspiracy theorists a bone", so they'll hopefully back off.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they threw us Weinstein, spacey, and a few others, and shifted the focus from satanic pedophilia, to a "people magazine" type of ratings boost series of sacrificial lambs.
