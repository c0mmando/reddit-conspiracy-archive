    <div class="md"><p>This originally happened in ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>Anubis would weigh your heart against a feather, if it was too heavy you were a sinner and would be sent to Apep - if it was too light, you were unimportant and you would be sent to Apep lol.</p>

<p>Eventually the priests began to sell special items you could purchase and put on Anubis&#39; scale in the afterlife to change the weight...</p>

<p>Nothing has changed to this day... money = freedom from the rules and norms of society, science, rationality and belief.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>PG was not gaining traction. Despite it being pushed for over a year now, no victims or witnesses have come forward and no credible evidence has been presented. Even the Voat pizzagate forum is a shadow of its previous self. And pizzagaters were the ones who tried to shift the focus – once they realised no evidence was forthcoming and no arrests, they tried to rebrand it as &quot;pedogate&quot;, so that they could claim any child abuse arrest as evidence of the conspiracy. Remember when David Seaman promised that dozens of elites would be arrested within a week and he claimed vindication when Jeffrey Sandusky was arrested?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was not a &quot;hot tub party&quot; with children as the entertainment. Have you even read the emails yourself or have you just accepted the bullshit that&#39;s been pushed? A woman sent out an email to friends and family inviting them to a get together. She said that a friend and her grandchildren would be there, so they would have some further entertainment and that they&#39;d be heating the swimming pool if people wanted to swim. She also noted that the kids would be swimming.</p>

<p>Asu/Lukerules noted, the FBI never confirmed the &quot;code words&quot;. They came from 4chan. And John Podesta didn&#39;t even write most of the emails cited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, and Corey Feldman&#39;s accusations. But it&#39;s overwhelmingly about the sexual harassment of women and it wasn&#39;t an organised conspiracy.</p>

<p>Now, if you&#39;re saying that you&#39;ll find child abusers and sexual harassers in every sector of life (including business and politics), I would agree with that. And, if you&#39;re also saying that victims have kept quiet because of reasons such as embarrassment or shame or because they feared damaging their careers or because of the gruelling legal process or because they thought they might not be believed (or even because they&#39;d come to private settlements with the abuser), then I&#39;d agree with that, too.</p>

<p>But if you&#39;re saying that there is a conspiracy both to protect organised groups of child abusers and to enable them to continue to abuse, then I&#39;d need to see some evidence for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we retire the term pizzagate? It doesn&#39;t even remotely do justice to the international sex trafficking pedophile rings that are being uncovered. There&#39;s hard evidence on people like Jeffrey Epstein, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Bryan Singer, David Geffen... and many more to come.</p>

<p>The narrow focus on Podesta and Comet Ping Pong and codewords is a distraction from the broader issue. I&#39;m fine with something as bland as Pedogate until something else sticks. But Pizzagate sounds so ridiculous that when you mention it to anyone who isn&#39;t very online it elicits immediate eye rolls.</p>
