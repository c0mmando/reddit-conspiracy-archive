       The list goes on. Yournewswire only exists for one reason: Money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time someone posts a link to that repugnant website, they make money. They make an unimaginable amount of money every day. It's truly astounding just how much they're taking advantage of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       People of r/conspiracy, this would truly be a great first step in cleaning up this subreddit. Look at the state of this place. Half the people only post here so they can get clicks on their crappy clickbait websites and Youtube videos. Let's clean this place up. This is not an act of censorship. They had this coming. No more yournewswire, your time is up.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can really make this happen. If you disagree with the ban, give your reason(s) why in the comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       BAN YOURNEWSWIRE

       <strong>
        Edit [3:03PM]
       </strong>
       - How does the community/mods feel about an Archive.is requirements for sites such as Yournewswire and Neonnettle; the same action used against CNN 5 months ago. Reasonable? No harm done, except to the owners of these clickbait sites.

       I know you're just exagerating for effect, but these websites and even Such A Fail report correct things sometimes. I would be all for banning them completely from the sub if I thought there would be no slippery slope. Convince me. You'd need extremely detailed lines drawn between "fake news" and independent media that gets things wrong sometimes. Even the mainstream media gets things wrong sometimes.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/media_criticism/comments/7j6bto/huge_list_with_examples_of_false_reporting_coming/">
        Huge list with examples of false reporting coming from the major media networks. CNN, Washington Post, Fox News, New York Times, Guardian, NBC, ABC, etc.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What is an "unimaginable amount of money?" A million dollars a day? Couldn't they provide a source? Why leave it out? If there's no source, then this post is fake news.

       This sub never used to be like this. There are users in here saying they totally trust CNN. Somehow "they" convinced half of this sub to distrust alternative media just because some specific websites are "fake news." Some alternative media is fake news, therefore all alternative media is fake news. In the meantime, they dont like being told that false stories routinely happen on mainstream media.

       I totally trust CNN more than the random alternative news site these days. On the vast majority of alt news, I see no drive to maintain a good reputation or correct their errors...just to lure in suckers who want a story they can feel good about.

       You're looking at the wrong alternative media. You can start off with these first:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Intercept

      <p>
       The Real News Network

       You're one of the better trolls out there. Almost had me. You claim to trust CNN more than alternative news, and to prove your claim that the Real News isn't the best, you use an alternative media outlet's article on the drama they have with the Real News. 9/10

       Sorcha faal is the ONLY website that showed Obama's love child, and the mother getting shit by the secret service while trying to confront him. She was a dental assistant that worked on Obama's teeth. This one certainly was real. The kid is in limbo and the ladies family wants him.

       They had her pics linked directly from the dentist's website. Same lady. She has the connection to the president. That's confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dentist was a navy guy. Confirmed that he is the go-to dentist for the president, when the president is in the area. They have military dentist's in each region on standby for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Linked to news showing Obama went in for tooth work there at the right time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lady went to the white House and tried to breach it for unknown reasons. Dental assistant just flips one day and tried to contact Obama forcefully and brings her kid with her?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was some analysis of the car chase, shooting, that argued that they wanted to kill her and couldve handled it differently. This is not too convincing, ymmv.
      </p>
      <p>
       The day she did it was significant but I can't remember why sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kid was taken from her. Linked to news interviews of her family wanting to know why they are not being given the kid. This is very very odd. Kid should obviously have been given to gmother or sister within days. There's no explanation for this that makes sense. Kid fell into a gov. Black hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       She told someone that the baby's daddy was a vip i think. (,I haven't read the article in years, not sure of every detail sorry. I'll find a link and post it in edit )
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole timeline fits. (meet at dental visit, sex, 9 months for baby, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If sorchas source really is FSB. I'd imagine they'd be watching Obama, maybe caught him in a secret tryst, maybe one if thier spies heard Washington whispers about it. And they fed it to sorcha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think it was 100% fabricated? How would you explain her behavior? How did sorcha put it all together if it was fiction? It seems like that would be a hard fit to come in with a story that matches reality like this. Like, why did she do it? Why won't they give up the kid? Lucky for sorcha that he uncovered the Navy dentist isn't it? Is it odd that she worked on the president, then later tries to the point of dying to get into the white house like a psycho with something to prove?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, maybe Obama's CIA handlers made this up to perpetuate the cover story that Obama is straight!

       That leap, that speculation, is the thing that all the other bullet points come together to tie it into that narrative to make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, make some sense of it without it. Give me another explanation. You can't. The idea that she had his love child explains everyone's behavior, and the 'coincidental' events as well, such as the lawyers arrest and the custody of the baby issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would it take to establish that? It would have to be a DNA test. Well, family is now asking for one. In absence of that, all we have is circumstantial evidence. But it's an awful lot we have to go on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did she say to police she was being followed by intelligence agents? Why did she later say it was at the behest of Obama? Why did she get in the car chase that ended her life? She was just crazy? All her supposedly irrational behavior makes perfect sense if you just believe her. When someone is accused of crazy irrational behavior, but then you are given a key to the lock so to speak, that crucial single bit of info, and it ties all the crazy behavior together so that it makes sense and is reasonable and rational after all, doesn't that make you consider that that info could be true?
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA agent (ever heard of a "handler"?) with a front company, that's only business was throwing Obama an inauguration party, with her name in this email account directory.  The agent slanders her in the media, ruing her credibility. He is inexplicably given the child, instead of the mother or sister. That didn't phase you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama did go to her office, where she was a dental assistant. She is pictured in thier website. Her meeting Obama isn't outside the realm of possibility. Neither is the concept of a powerful man having a love child and covering it up. Obama already had that other babe they sent to an island so she wouldn't talk during the election. Anyway, the idea of the lady flipping out and showing up at baby's daddy's work to start drama isnt unusual either. Mistresses and side-hos do that regularly (I should know hehe,) None of this is unbelievable. When the family played along with the whole crazy lady narrative, things were fine. When they started demanding the kid, played hardball and had thier lawyer start talking real shit, he was promptly arrested. Could be unrelated, but in the context of CIA shenanigans, and the love child theory, your telling me that didn't raise your eyebrow? What the hell would then? It rarely gets this juicy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's more and more but I'll stop here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what to tell you. It's an extremely solid story, as far as conspiracy theories go. It warrants further investigation by mainstream journalists, with all thier resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder what you could possibly believe on this forum, as nothing posted here ever has this much meat on the bone.

       Right, and it's completely unsubstantiated.  The timing of it, as presented by Faal anyway, is either coincidence, or completely fabricated, as are the rest of the stories from that source.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've looked at the article you cite.  There is a LOT of information there that you'll just have to take their word for.  No citing, no explanation of sources, and a presented timeline that has no other bearing on reality other than 'Sorcha says so'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, it's a great story.  It's almost Dan Brown-level creative.  But unsubstantiated is unsubstantiated, especially from a notoriously bad source.  All of this stuff, the 'handler', the company, etc., is combined to push a single narrative that all relies on information impossible to prove, and ambiguous enough to disprove.  This is how people get so badly duped.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're free to believe what you'd like, but if I were you I'd spend some time trying to verify where Faal got the information.  If you can't do it, chances are it's all crap, like every other story from the source.

       This stuff is why this sub has zero credibility. Too many people posting fantastic stories with little or no evidence, and no critical thinking skills. It’s become a place for mentally ill people to try and rope others into their constructs. C’mon folks, if you want people to take you seriously, do a little bit of homework. You are being used as a TOOL by news sites that just make shit up out of thin air to make money off your gullibility.

       Thin air? Sorchas articles linked to plenty of mainstream news reports, which oddly, for a conspiracy sub, seem to hold a lot of weight for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet I'm the one that failed to do homework? Ok I'll bite. You didn't read Sorcha, but what's the "homework" that I should have done to debunk this? You didn't do it either, your just running your mouth.

      </p>
      <p>
       Until very recently, admission into CIA was initiated by personal recommendation. Which means a lot of family gets brought in.  That's why CIA is dominated by Jews and Mormons too.

       I'd rather have CNN articles here than stuff from yournewswire... there are about a half dozen commonly posted fake news sites that show up on a pretty regular basis. I don't know if I'd want them full-on banned... but maybe some sort of flair to let the newcomers know that people need to be leery of anything coming out of that outlet...

       The community does a pretty good job policing yournewswire links to make sure none of the shitpostery gets out of control... but a flair/disclaimer would probably help discourage it from getting posted in the first place... I'm fine with any Conspiracy Theory that might get posted here... but when they try to push it as a fact is when I get annoyed.

       Sure, but the trick here is consensus. We were able to get consensus on the CNN thing because everyone was pissed off at the same time. But doing anything else that gets in the way of the flow of information just isn't easy to sell back there, and it shouldn't be.

       The CNN banning thing always rubbed me the wrong way, since the reasons why people would post CNN links would either be partisan or legitimate discussion... but the only reasons I could think of for people posting yournewswire would be trolling, spamming  or massive ignorance... In a sub like this I don't think CNN should be singled out cause every website is always peddling their version of the truth...

       You are very easily manipulated if all it takes to embrace censorship is posting a few stories lacking sources you deem credible.

       This goes beyond a few stories lacking credible sources... this is more like thousands of stories lacking any sources. I don't want them banned, but I also don't want people actually falling for that clickbaity horseshit that they pump out on a daily basis. Yournewswire doesn't do any good for anyone aside from yournewswire.

       That is true... even "real" news sites pump out horseshit with anonymous sources or just reformat some other outlet's news and repackage it as their own... those don't tend to be the type of articles that get posted here from yournewswire though. We always seem to get the horseshit tabloid nonsense that doesn't ever seem to lead to a constructive discussion.

       Having frequented this sub for years now, the sad reality is that I’ve learned to see some of the linked “sources” for what they are: complete and utter horseshit. I wish, as I know many others do, that people wouldn’t link to them. But some people are just dicks with non-helpful agendas and so.....we get yournewswire, etc.

       It's been something of a pattern. The approval a story gets on this sub seems to be dependent on how outlandish it is, and how closely it conforms to the posters' biases (Hillary is the devil, (((Soros))) is trying to destroy Western Civilization, lifelong Republican Bob Mueller is actually a DNC agent, etc.) rather than it actually being relevant or factual.

       Soros actually stated in interview that to derail nations for profit is just part of his job when he can see it as profitable.
Why would he wish to destroy, he only wants to profit as much as possible. If this leads to destruction, then that's other people job to save the day for some coin scraps.
And Hillary basically executed Libia Gheddafi gov which was quite loved and appreciated by his peers, and did that with joy, and i would have troubles find a better existing version of the devil. Plus all the rest, ofcourse.

       T_D is quite cultistic in nature, which means the narrative is one and done.
Conspiracy is based on a mindset which makes it a culture instead, hosting many narratives. Consensus achievement is out of the purpose since it's for debate.
I'm curious btw, what's your take on theredpill? i found it an interesting phenomena.

       Absolutely, but if you notice the "leaders" are pretty relaxed with their life and are the "newcomers" that have this revengey feeling in regard.
Feeding them some hate is a way to regain mindset after a too soft lifestart many of recent generations had, along the dependency from having women around.
As i usually look with sociologic perspective i think it's a good thing to happen. Both men and women have deteriorated and it's a game of mirrors.

       George Soros made his money as a currency trader. He is famously known as “the man who Broke the Bank of England” as he shorted pounds way back in 1992 when it was clear the UK government could not keep the UK in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). The ERM, in simple terms, sought to ease trade between then common market (present day EU) members with their own currencies. Central banks would manipulate interest rates to keep the value of a currency within a certain buffer relative to the then-king, the Deutsche Mark (DM). The treasury would be required to adjust interest rates and/or purchase pounds for the agreed rate so that the fixed exchange rate can stay in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       George looked at the market fundamentals of the UK and realized, quite sensibily, that the UK was not Germany. As such, the idea that the UK could shadow German interest rate policy and aim for German-style low inflation was absurd. He bet that the Bank of England would blink first and stop supporting the artificially high price of the pound rather than waste away the country’s treasury. He turned out to be correct in the end and made billions as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       His “job” (if you can call a non-productive activity like that a job in the first place) is to make money. If the poor decicions of the political decision makers are what led him make that money it says far more about who is controlling the show than it does about someone who saw an in and took it.

       I agree, that kind of "job" is a product of the times and of bad regulations, and can be useful to spot said regulations. For that alone he is like many people. But few of this people go ahead and use the problem-reaction-solution paradigm to enforce the kind of situation they can profit from - so things as lobbyism, arming of rebels, voicing - and to say it a la Chomsky - and actually manifacturing dissent.
While on Hillary it's easy to go hard - she flaunts her evil - Soros i can only lay out the level of implied bad regulations inside the system necessary for this man to run his business like he does.
But i would point to Soros and the controller both being part of a bigger traffic scheme.
We the people don't control the politics, so those "controllers" are more of maddened empowered particles with a lot of business potential and usually the will to capitalize on that.

       A lot of people trust CNN implicitly, even here.  I'm semi-regularly affronted with commenters citing CNN as authoritative information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, there are times CNN does report what appears to be factual information, but the spin is terrific.  Nevertheless, many people don't seem to see the spin or the deliberate manipulation of "facts" to tell a false story.

       The story from this summer that showed me it was a fake news site was when they were peddling a story about a massive elite government pedo ring and their source for the pedo ring was a story about the former mayor (2 year removed) of a town of like 5,000 in nowhere, Ohio who diddled a 14 year old girl. That is indeed sick, but the former mayor of a town of 5,000 is hardly an elite pedo ring.

       I can get behind that. The moderation shouldn't attempt decide which sources are good or bad. The best approach would be to take away the monetary incentive to post the articles here. If people still want to post an article for some other reason, then it would create more problems than it would solve to stop them.

       As soon as you start banning one website, you open the door for everyone to get a website banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when the mods don't ban x websites, the community gets into a big stink about it. The community divides into those that do and do not want a website banned. Shills could spam to get a website they don't like banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a rule coming into effect requiring each submission to have a comment explaining why it sad submitted. At least try this first and use the up vote and down vote buttons before starting to ban.

       To address your other comment, you're acting like I have some kind of agenda to create some kind of slippery slope. I don't. Obviously I have an "agenda" in this post, it's called an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have one reason why you don't support an archive.is rule for Yournewswire?
What's the harm in that? The site only exists to make money off of gullible people. They have no journalistic integrity. They are literally disinformation. An archive requirement would lower the amount of spambots posting links to this subreddit. No?

       An outright ban of these sites sets a bad precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       These sources are well-known by the
       <a href="/r/conspircy">
        /r/conspircy
       </a>
       community as fraudulent, and they routinely are downvoted to oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occasionally, some slip through and they are moderated aggressively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's a useful tool in spotting spam accounts, as they frequently post from these sites, making them very easy for the mods to spot.

       So how do some slip through? Could it be because these sites are designed to give the appearance of a factual news website, while making money off us at the same time?

       Wouldn't banning the website cut down on spam all together? Seems like it would eliminate the problem from the get-go.

       Did someone make a post about it? Your argument, or low effort comment, whatever it is, doesn't address my point. Has that user made a post like mine asking to ban those organizations? I'm not even sure you got the post of his comment. He wasn't asking to ban the sites. He was talking about the precedent. When have you
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       seen a post like mine requesting to ban a fake news website, or an actual reputable news website on top of that?

       I have, in the past year. Not as high effort so they didnt go far. And banning is the wrong answer, but your post generated ideas that I can get behind, flairs or automod, so the community can keep doing self-driven QC, with a boost.

       Will you discuss it with the mods? I think a lot of people would be in favor of this idea. I believe another mod in this thread said that would introduce the topic. I'd say this thread has a lot of support, enough to merit a discussion between the moderators of this subreddit.

       I disagree with this. I think requiring archive links would be a better alternative. Autoflairing

       Another proposal: How do you feel about requiring archive.is for "news" sites such as Yournewswire and Neonnettle, the sites that purely post here for ad revenue; the major move used against CNN 5 months ago. Unless that's what you are already proposing in the mod discussions. Would be a very nice move imho. No harm done, except to the website owners.

       I think at the very least an automod rule that points out sites like yournewswire and small blogs as first-hand, possibly misleading information would be a very good start.  Maybe Joe Shmoe with "25realtruthsaboutbigfoot.blogspot.com" really does have the truth about bigfoot, but I think a comment to remind redditors and commenters to keep their thinking caps on would serve us well.

       That has far more credibility and validity than fucking your news wire that doesn't source or link to ANYTHING. Just pure made up bullshit. Divine cosmos has some interesting stuff wether you believe in Corey Goode or not they put out some great material and recently had a whistleblower come forward about underground bases and ET specimens being worked on

       This is r/conspiracy right? Is this not the place where we discuss and decipher the bullshit? Banning sites for fake news is counter to what happens here. Sometimes, fake news opens a conversation that leads to real findings.

       Here's the thing about censorship...yes I agree with you on YNW.  I agree with a lot of posts against these click-bait websites.  You start censoring YNW, and UK tabloids?  Soon people will want to start censoring Alex Jones.  You start censoring Alex Jones, soon no Joe Rogan podcasts either.  No Joe Rogan?  No Delonge, no Greer, no bullshit; only "verifiable" websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of you are not understanding the gravity of the Information War.  There is a huge battle for hearts and minds raging everywhere, on every site, all over the fucking internet right now.  From social media, to Alex Jones.  From ShareBlue to [Insert Right-Wing Digital Team Here].
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides are spinning stories.  Both sides are flat out lying.  It's not just left, right, fake news in one spot.  There is "fake news" everywhere from both sides.  In the conspiracy world it is up to the reader to be informed, and to be able to put aside their partisan feelings and say "I think this article is bullshit."  I've done it on several occasions with right-wing articles.  I've done it a multitude of times with mainstream articles.  The truth often falls in the middle somewhere.

       Really?  So giving way to a bit of censorship won't open up the doors for additional censorship?

       I agree with you man, I hate the click-baity websites, but I'm not convinced that CNN/Fox/MSNBC/Politco don't use the same exact tactics that "alternative" sites use.  They all provide spin.  It's up to the reader to wade through the bullshit.  In this day and age, nobody should be trusting any information.

       Thanks for sharing this, I was actually looking to cite this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't even agree with the mods decision here, but I understand why they did it, especially given the Wikileaks revelations of collusion between campaign(s) and mass media.  I really think that any source should be allowed and it's up to the community, as a whole, to engage positively or negatively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously that's difficult, especially when the easiest website to write bots for is the facilitator of the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, yes I agree with you.  Archive.is links to circumvent ad revenue and click-thrus is ideal for these websites, and that'd be the most ideal solution.  It'd probably help curtail the various bots that post link throughs to these sites.  I wasn't trying to come off as an asshat, more of a devil's advocate to argue against censorship.

       So after YNW gets banned, you guarantee there won't be any more calls for censorship on other sites and you guarantee YNW will be the only site banned?

       Again, THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOUR NEWS WIRE AND NEVER WAS. This is only the start of getting all conspiracy sites banned, leaving only tptb's msm's megaphone.

       Nothing because the CNN ban was done to obey an incognito order of Donald Trump. If you want a site banned, you need to send an email to WikiLeaks, who will then pass a message along to Donald Trump Jr, who will then ask his father to declare the site "very fake news," and wala! It's banned.

       I find neonnettle wildly entertaining - some of their stuff is merely that though, entertaining, but some of it is actually based on interviews. What they decide to extract from the information doesn't always 'match', as it were and the writing is a bit rough at times(English as a 2nd language, I wonder??) but -sometimes- their source information is actually a bit striking.

       This is merely the beginning of the appeals for censorship. After all, just like how tptb care so much for us, as the OP suggested, it's in our best interests, right? /s

       Where have I seen this before?? Oh, yeah, this is the exact play of google/fb/twitter/msm to call others fake news and censor their competition and/or anything tptb don't want us to read/watch. Not surprised I'm seeing cries to censor the opposition being pushed here too by people w/the same exact agenda as tptb's state-run media that is actively doxxing, crushing and censoring those w/opinions outside the mainstream they don't like.

       If shills get their way, all "fringe," according the gatekeeper's definition, conspiracy sites will be banned and only MSM will be allowed and pushed, just like irl. What an ideal new r/politics this will be. I can't wait! /s

       In order to do this, some limits would need to be set with regards to the "Archive.is requirements" because many members would argue that mainstream media sources "intentionally distribute disinformation".

       I am not completely against doing this for the websites listed, but the precedent concerns me.  Rules would need to be established for this to work properly, and I think the consensus on these rules would be too politicized.

       I guess the real question is who would it harm more?
      </p>
      <p>
       The traffic of small, dedicated websites that research evidence-based conspiracies.  Some of these websites depend on the traffic in order to continue investigating these theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       or,
      </p>
      <p>
       The traffic of large mainstream media sites that do not specialize in conspiracies
      </p>
      <p>
       It may seem like having a default archive link has no unintended consequences, but there probably will be harm.  It hurts the small budget researchers much more than multi-billion dollar corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, I think it is easier to downvote the conspiracies that have zero evidence, or crappy sources.  You also have the option to not even click on the post after you see the source.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think your post is important.  It  increases the awareness of propaganda, and it helps users differentiate credible theories from shit posts.

       This isn't r/conspiracyFact or r/news. There is no proof for a lot of things that are posted - aliens, reptilians, giants, antarctic anomalies, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to think that this is a place where people come to discuss conspiracy theories wantonly and lead others to the conversation. You should not be writing a thesis on anything posted in r/conspiracy so when somebody posts something from a less-than-reputable site you have the option of disregarding it and allowing others to enjoy the buzz. You want to dictate what other people can share because you don't find it credible?! Hello...we're discussing conspiracy theories!
      </p>

       Brush off what you don't like and let us have it. If you find r/conspiracyFacts too boring you can spruce it up by adding some verified news reports from credible sources.

       There's a difference between less than reputable sites and pure disinfo sites that only post here to make money off of gullible people like you. Enjoying the buzz? Do you buy tabloids in the check out lines?

       Just because somebody posts something it doesn't mean they're gullible. I see r/conspiracy (actually, Reddit in general) as a bunch of people sitting around a bar going "Hey! Did you guys hear about George Soros?" then conversation stems from that. I don't necessarily believe it but that's why I say it. To see if anybody else knows anything to either prove or disprove it or to steer the conversation into something else interesting. In real life somebody would call bullshit and they would stay out of the conversation thinking everybody else was foolish. Can you imagine if that person appealed to authority to ban the conversation altogether? That's what you're trying to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I first read the article I wasn't sure if I believed it or not but after reading some comments I'm convinced it's BS. Thankfully r/conspiracy allowed that exchange to happen. (I also saw a big hole in the story that nobody else has mentioned yet.)
      </p>

       Read the posts you agree with, ignore or downvote the ones you don't. But why try to take things away from other users?

       Due to the core ethos of this subreddit being rooted in a deep respect for the free exchange of information, the only sites we have banned have been satire sites. Even CNN (an outlet which threatened to doxx users over their political views) is not banned and is allowed to be posted via archive links.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of a site doing what you describe in your OP, the best solution is always to use your downvote to ensure such information is rightfully hidden beneath the voting threshold.

       But it’s literal disinformation, it’s the kind of stuff the government puts out to confuse and obfuscate discussion. If you’re going to require cnn to have an archive requirement you definitely should apply the same to a cite that is made to farm clicks off of the people in this sub. Who knows, maybe the  writers are venue personally posting the articles here, literally shilling their own product

       That's something, imo, we should strive to correct by way of cogent comments and vigilance in the new section. We throw the baby out with the bath water, in my opinion, when, in the pursuit of informed discourse, we take steps (such as removing content) which limit that very discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize its a difficult situation, as the presence of manipulative and false information very much does threaten the very foundations of our modern civic and social spheres; however, there has to be a constructive solution which does not need entail the censorship of content.

       That would be better than what’s going on now. Although I’d argue there is value in censoring entirely false sites that undeniably do more harm than good by spread consistently falsified stories. And I mean totally fake, not just misleading or reporting errors.

       actually, I retract my earlier statement, because I realized that the mods aren’t actually censoring CNN. Articles from CNN are still allowed through archive.is. R/conspiracy is merely banning direct links to CNN, reducing the amount of revenue for CNN even just a little as a form of protest against the doxxing incident. The sub still allows CNN content, so it isn’t really censorship. In that case, there’s no comparison between banning CNN for doxxing and censoring a different website for fake news.

       Censorship is censorship, and in my opinion we shouldn't censor somebody even if they're demonstrably wrong. The fact people read and accept headlines without reading the article is unfortunate, but that doesn't mean we should censor all possible discussion around it, that's the first amendment. And I know the first amendment obviously doesn't apply to subreddits, but in my opinion the idea behind it is still strong and should.

       It stands pretty uncorrectable when groups of users use bots to mass upvote their unverified claims.  People are far less likely to blindly upvote things that don't start off with 5,000 upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the reason blind upvoting happens is we believe that previous upvotes are verification of the content.

       You realize that massive amounts of botting happens site wide on Reddit especially in regards to anything negative about a certain political party right? The amount of news articles I've seen reach front page that have been retracted or proven incorrect is laughable. Yet here we are saying ban an already laughable sub because they posted 1 fake article about the beloved political party puppet master Soros. And the one person that actually had a logical response

       The problem is if someone that already frequents a bias sub such as this one sees a post that has 20 upvotes automatically assumes it must be truthful. This is a reddit and social media problem in general but if your going to make rules to ban certain links from certain news because it's "fake" then you have to do the same with actual fake news. Or else you are hypocrites and are spreading propaganda to fit the subs narrative and shaping people's opinions. People are too gullible for that shit.

       I don't think we have time to re educate entire generations. Because that is the solution to this type of problem. We were literally raised during a time this stuff didn't really exist. So you're asking that all of reddit is better educated and can sift through all the misinformation accordingly. While your point is completely valid, I think it's too late.

       CNN engaged in the behavior of threatening to expose a user's identity, thus that decision was not related to the view point or content of CNN.

       Besides, it wasn't a "user's" identity, did the information not come purely from the individual's own publicly accessible social media accounts?

       Those have been posted here all the time, even side-barred if I recall the Pizzagate related events correctly. Remember, about some restaurant who's profile picture was of a statue of a historical figure tangentially related to pederasty?

       The decision as to CNN and the requirement for the use of archive links for that site had to do with the behavior of the site in regards to the threat of doxx against a user, when it comes to the content of articles such as the ones you point out, we recommend using your downvote and leaving a comment to inform others of why the story is false/incorrect/misleading.

       Look at the fake stories this site is posting - Soros, pedo rings, Antifa mass murderers - all anti left wing which furthers the narrative the mods here want to push.  Also wouldn’t be surprising to find out one of the mods has a hand in this site.  For a sub dedicated to outing conspiracies there sure is a lot of shady shit going on behind the scenes.

       Journalists write all sorts of articles about people and politics.  That's super old too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, that user you are talking about was a racist, hate-mongering, genocide-loving POS.  Most of his posts were vile comments and he BEGGED that CNN journalist not to publish his name(even though the practice is normal and expected).  Like I said, the journalist did him a huge favor and that was a huge mistake as you guys are twisting reality.

       and got """doxxed""" by a journalist.  I'm surprised people here didn't try to rewrite history on him too.  I can see it now, "

       I talking about it in several other comment chains, but I think that doxxing is only ok if the anonymous poster alludes to illegal activity, eg being a mod of r/jailbait. But people shouldn't be afraid to post political views and opinions for fear of being exposed. Sure, some liberals might think that the user CNN doxxed was a racist POS, but I'm sure some T_D users think pretty badly of those liberals, and wouldn't be afraid to tear those liberals apart if they were doxxed.

        Trump wrestling CNN gif
       </a>
       that Trump retweeted and so the post blew up.  That attracted the attention of a CNN journalist who decided to do some research on the person that posted it, which lead him to reddit.  From there it was very easy to find out who
       <a href="/u/HanAssholeSolo">
        /u/HanAssholeSolo
       </a>
       was as the guy doxxed himself.  Anyone that knew about google.com could have found him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while writing about
       <a href="/u/HanAssholeSolo">
        /u/HanAssholeSolo
       </a>
       , that CNN journalist looked at his very public reddit comments and found that this guy had horrific comments about black people and genocide, wanting to kill people, racist comments, bad stuff about Jewish people, and the works.  The guy also happened to be a Trump supporter, but the article wasn't about his "political" views unless you consider the above political.

       As others have pointed out, its pretty hypocritical to punish one source for doxxing when several other outlets and communities have openly doxxed people without repercussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your own subreddit has had issues with doxxing as well.

       How do you feel about an archive.is requirement. Nearly every post from Yournewswire is in violation of Rule 11. Can you give me one good reason why this wouldn't be a good idea? Yournewswire is basically satire at this point.

       With regards CNN, that decision was made due to the

       in relation to their doxx threat.

       We would not take the same approach as to the

       May I ask for your definition of a "satire site". Isn't banning satire sites a "direct threat to the free exchange of information." Can't users just use downvotes and comments as a way to counter any misleading information contained therein? How is an archive rule a "direct threat to the free exchange of information." The site is still 100% allowed, they just don't make money off our clicks. How exactly would that be preventing the free exchange of information?

      <p>
       Now this may be a meta theory but maybe the mods are making money from that site. They are saying to downvote instead of personally policing because even a topic that gets a downvote after your investigation still drives some traffic from your investigation.

       Definitely - YNW is satire at best. I cringe at the term, but it's the literal definition of fake news. It's never been more than that - they trawl
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for topics and then put a bunch of random related lies together to generate clickbait. There are other sites from YNW as well - I can't think of the names of the top of my head but there are several on the same network and it's been discussed here in the past.

       where in T_D were redditors doxxed? It looks like it was happening in 4Chan and discord. I mean that “technicality” is the whole point. CNN threatened to doxx a redditor, T_D didn’t

       Obama was called a Socialist, words mean nothing when team politics are at stake.  I don't know when conspiracies became synonymous with the American right, but the community has closed its eyes to any wrongdoing by the US government under this administration.

       Obama is considered, on the global political spectrum, to be Authoritarian Right. Perhaps by U.S. politics, he can be considered left. Source:

       Additionally, and I know you're not asserting to the contrary, but I want to state that the U.S. practices socialism in a variety of ways that the average American utilizes everyday. The military, for example, is one of the largest examples. The public roads we use, the infrastructure, public transportation. All of these are inherently socialist by design.

       Out of curiosity I read the 2016 compass.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump supported a decent minimum wage from the start, wants free education in state universities, has supported universal health care, consistently opposed the Transpacific Partnership Agreement and wants more bank regulation. Considering the cosy relationship that the Clintons and Trump have enjoyed until almost yesterday (reflected by Trump’s generous support for both Hillary’s senatorial campaigns and the Clinton Foundation) the mercurial Donald's differences may be less than they presently appear. Is it beyond all possibility that a Trump 'bi-partisan' presidency might include a role for his old friend Hillary?

       There's about 2 consistently truthful things in that paragraph. The rest is a mix of hope and delusion. Political compass consistently labels Stein as a centrist though. I imagine most Stein supporters would find that bizarre.

       The answer is Cambridge Analytica, they have a search algorithm that is able to categories personality traits and political beliefs using a database with info on almost every adult American filled with data from their social media activities. They worked out conspiracy theorists are easy to manipulate when you push the right buttons for an individual, their algorithm automatically found them and worked out their buttons and sent them fake news stories that confirmed their conspiracy beliefs and were also pro-trump, anti-Hillary.

       Totally agree. I would go as far as to say there never has really been any room in American politics for a true Left. The Centrists are painted as batshit liberal hippies so that the conversation never actually moves left of that position because that is just "unrealistic" or "a pipe dream". What happened with Bernie is the perfect example of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is a war machine after all, hard to continue to sell a shit ton of weapons if there is no one fighting. The thing that really sucks about this is that the propaganda has been doled out for so long that now a slip into far right fascism seems normal for some.

       so what if two people who both say they are on the right disagree with each other?  are they both leftists?  meaning now they can be on the right again, since a leftist is disagreeing,  so now they are on the right they are now on the left for disagreeing with each other...

       This is almost correct. I have seen people attack others for being "Librul" when that person came back being pretty far on the right, they just had a weird stand on an issue.

       This is true in the same way anyone who doesn't agree with the far left is a nazi. Same kind of stupid on opposite sides of the spectrum. Both are cultist in reasoning and reliably dishonest.

      <p>
       A more practical definition for a leftist could be someone who believes in total equality of outcome. When total equality doesn't exist, it's because of hidden power structures and oppression. They are also obsessed with gender and race. This all somehow ties in with Palestine because that's the big cherry on top: Unwavering support of Palestine and hatred of Israel.

       are nazis. problem is, a lot of far right folks seem to have a hard time speaking against naziism or condemning them at all so it makes us think, ya know? I always thought it was easy to call neo-nazis unamerican, evil, traitorous scumbags, but a select number on the GOP and their supporters are reluctant to agree

       I love how the current alt-right, who is obsessed with pretending gender identity doesn't exist, is always desperately trying to confuse themselves into believing every else is obsessed with what they are obsessed with because whenever they talk about it someone says "Shut up you bigoted asshole."  Why is the alt-rights only defense to who they are some game in which they pretend everyone else is more at fault for whatever they're criticized for?  It's so obviously "I know you are but what am I?" BS whenever they do it, and even if the imaginary people really were as bad as they are in their imagination, that doesn't excuse all the bigotry they stand for anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's mind-boggling how purposefully dumb you have to be to convince yourself you're not a shitty person because you rally for inequality.  It's oddly the more intelligent ones that just say "Yup, I'm a bigot/racist/whatever", the others are just as guilty but are dumb enough to believe they're patriots.

        Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda.

       Doxxing, blackmail, whatever, it’s all semantics. The point is that CNN threatened to ruin someone’s life because of a shitpost which pokes fun at the network. 
However, I have since read that the poster wasn’t 15 and I removed that from my comment.

       All I’m saying is that CNN crossed the line. Imagine Fox acquiring something stupid you said online and threatening to share it with the public if you don’t apologize. It’s pretty fucked up. 
I feel like I’m holding a moderate stance on this issue, but I’m getting downvoted to hell. I guess some people don’t want to see issues with people they agree with ¯_(ツ)_/¯

       Shrug all you want. You flat-out “boldfaced” lied about CNN doxxing someone and asserted that THEY crossed a line, while the anti-Semitic user calling for violence is excused by you as “shitposting”. Sympathizing and enabling this stupid as shit behavior is the reason you’re being downvoted, not your not-so-subtle hints at how moderate or rational you are

       They threatened to reveal the identity of a pathetic, middle-aged loser who spent all his time on reddit advocating genocide and pushing Nazi rhetoric. That piece of shit deserved to be exposed. I wish someone from CNN had just decided to say fuck you and released his information to the public. I like my Nazis with labels on them. A Swastika carved into their foreheads would be a perfect step forward.

       Of course not. u/AwJebus and u/AssuredlyAThrowAway never read the actual story regarding CNN and the neo-Nazi memer, they just bought into the t_D narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time something is shared by POTUS people want to know what and who was behind it. In this case, CNN found out and also found that the guy had a history of extolling the virtues of murdering minorities and the homeless. So the guy apologized preemptively out of embarrassment and thus CNN decided for leniency whereas normally everything available would have been reported. The problem was that CNN phrased it as "don't fall back into old ways or we won't be so kind next time" and people flipped shit to defend a literal Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking disgrace. You heard me u/AssuredlyAThrowAway. You're a huge part of the reason this sub is a toxic off-shoot of t_D. You don't even educate yourself on the actual conspiracy at play when it goes against your narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm eagerly awaiting your t_D style censorship. Try to come up with a better ban reason than their "Suspected Muslim" line.

       I disagree with your analysis, as CNN's actions fundamentally threatened the free exchange of ideas on the internet. It was a lot more than doing someone a favor. They attempted to dictate the individual's political views under threat of doxx. It was an abhorrent and disgusting act, and we stand by our decision to prohibit direct links to CNN's domain. Cheers.

       You don’t seem to have an understanding of how reporting works. CNN is under no obligation to keep that dumbshit’s identity a secret; they are doing so cause the idiot owned up to making comments—with veiws that he doesn’t want people to know he has, even “ironically”—and CNN wanted to move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       What CNN basically said was “we’lol hold up our promise, of you hold up yours”. That isn’t censorship or doxxing, it’s an agreement.

       It sure does seem like rules are being twisted and scewed to fit a very pro-trump agenda. The first defence of the banning was that CNN doxxed. Now you are admitting that CNN did not dox and have come up with a 100% pure arbitrary rule that seems to have been made for this one occasion to justify banning a site for disagreeing with the established narrative here.

       It seems like we have a real conspiracy with mods being compromised by t_d or Russia.  You're still spreading complete lies, he was never doxxed.  He was called for a quote and he asked to remain anonymous which is basic journalism.  You argument is exactly what a heavily biased t_d user would make.  Or even worse, a Russian.

       T_D would have been banned by the admins months or years ago if they took part in doxxing, you’d know that if you weren’t just spewing crap out of your mouth.

       How mods run their sub is different than how admins run the entire site.  Some mods ban people automatically for posting in certain subs, admins don’t ban you based on whether you visited racist websites or stuff like that.

       HAHA thats hilarious, posts on T_D get 60% of every vote counted towards them. literally mitigated so that every upvote gets a little more than half a point. that way its too hard to tell if your upvotes are not being counted since the % rounds to the nearest whole #.
      </p>
      <p>
       You honestly think that every sub who posted during the NN thing didnt have bots? or a manipulated algorithm i garuntee you it did. and tons of the users just went along with it and upvoted everything or downvoted everything to remove the nonsense off of their /all, yet there was almost no posts other than those related to NN despite plenty posts being above the threshhold of upvotes needed to make /all
      </p>
      <p>
       or when every post was about a senators vote for a day. that nonsense was definitely manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       if anything T_D is being unfairly squelched by the top of Reddit. the only reason they have not to ban the sub is to keep them in the corner with their subs votes mitigated. thats why their crossposts do so well, because their votes actually get full credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell there are even lists of people who belong to T_D and rated based on their upvotes in the sub. honestly its completely insane how much T_D is censored.

       Not sure where youre getting the 60% thing, thats pretty... Out there. Im guessing that you upvote it, refresh the page, and the number didnt change to what you thought it should. Is that correct?

       i will say, it seems that i have full credit for my posts as of right now. but during the time when i was getting upvotes it seemed as though i wasnt getting full credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       everything i post seems to be controversial to some degree so its possible that i was getting influx of downvotes and upvotes simutaneously, but it is also possible that the algorithm was temporarily set that way and then changed back once someone brought it to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       The % i got at the time was based on the math i did during my posts credit i was getting vs the amount of upvotes i got.
      </p>
      <p>
       "it would seem that at 296 upvotes, i have 228 Post karma - 59 base post karma. so this post has given me 169 post karma
      </p>
      <p>
       296 maths 169 which is roughly 60% of the credit"
      </p>
      <p>
       that is how i came to that conclusion. perhaps it takes a few days for my account info to catch up to the data on the actual post or something since has been changed. either way it resolved itself when i wasnt looking.

       God damn, Ive stated this in many threads in this sub but never have I been downvoted this much. There has to be some sort of brigading going in. Because ussually this sub is something like 40/60 pro trump anti trump. Which is enough to get plenty of posts to the front page of the sub even if it's nowhere close to the reddit front page.

       The Donald is NOT popular. You're under the illusion that when you post there, your posts are voted up by like minded folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you visit ANY other subreddit, those posts don't get voted up by bots, and actual people bury your shit ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were actually a bunch of people upvoting TD posts and comments, you comment wouldn't be downvoted to Oblivion, because other real people would obviously back up your point if those same real people actually voted.

       To be fair, the Top Minds subreddit linked here, so there is a bit of brigading going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, you are correct that TD and their trash-posting get lots of assistance from bots. While many of the users are aware of that, but it's a low-information / low-intellect subculture, so the vast majority of their users don't know what's going on and likely never will.

       Just look at the total average income for both voting groups. You can win new york and not get a single vote from a millionaire or billionaire to make this example extreme. Yes trump won pretty much the vast majority of America land wise, and only a handful of counties actually went to Clinton, but that doesn't mean she won the middle class vote. Every poll and study other there shows trump won middle class, Hillary won lower class, and upper class was relatively split.

       Supreme Court is evenly split between constitutional conservatives and judicial activist, just like it was before scalia death. Trump isn't in charge regardless of that or congress. Congress is 51 seat majority I'm senate. Many many things can not be passed because 60 votes are required, and even with the 51 seats, it takes only 1 or 2 of the more liberal Republicans to not want it for the bill to go down.

       Your bias proves you are unable to discuss this point intellectually, because you've proven you can't examine this point intellectually. Balance is not a requirement of the court, your opinion on the beliefs of each member is clearly uninformed and unresearched, and you failed to address the point that this seat was considered valuable to maintain control of the court, and it did just that.youre just attempting and failing to move the goalposts into a discussion around balance and potential swing votes in the court.

       So again I ask who are the 5 conservative judges. 4 are easy to name, and I know exactly who you would claim is the 5th, but that judge agrees with Ginsburg more than Thomas so clearly they lean to the activist side more than conservative.

       None of that was opinion. My opinion is that Thomas is the best Justice, and that Ginsburg is a senile crazy person who doesn't respect the constitution. You can't even talk about the facts, so our discussion will never advance to the opinions.

       was taken right after Charlottesville in a post with a picture of a woman holding a Nazi flag.  She was protesting with the alt right Nazis.  They claimed that since the flag had creases it must have been bought off Amazon recently, therefore she's a Soros plant.  Apparently there's no way a nazi could buy a new nazi flag on Amazon.

       So that first user says "certain individuals should track down the identities of these people."  Just straight up trying to doxx them and it gets upvoted.  They love it because they think they're paid by Soros to make them look bad.

       Sounds like you're confused.  You should reread because I said I had screenshots of people calling for doxxing which is exactly what I provided.  So you just try to downplay that with "Noone doxxed."  You said it was removed, do you have any evidence of this?  I would love to see a source.

      <p>
       Is there any evidence to believe they are bots?  This is a very irrational and convenient way of thinking.  If t_D does something bad and upvote doxxing then they must be bots, even though you have 0 evidence for this.  In reality it's upvoted and there are several comments obviously not from bots in support of it.  But it's amazing seeing you try to rationalize this.

       Oh so you don't have any evidence and you just made that all up. You can see from the screenshot that those posts were several hours old with up to 155 points.  There was no rush to remove them at all. The reason why I'm not providing a link is because this screen shot was taken in August and I didn't save the link.  Also I'm not going to give out real names of people who are calling for doxxing in case anybody tries to doxx them.  I, unlike people from t_d, actually give a shit about people's privacy and removed their names for their own safety.  Even when they are calling for doxxing people.

       155 points is nothing in the Donald. You have never looked to see the activity. A top thread usually has many many 500+ posts

       The diversion and subterfuge are so strong in the USA. Mindless peons still caught in the distraction their politicians created to keep the populace fighting amongst themselves while the politicians laugh and count their money together.  I guess I can't blame them for being so warped by it.

       I really can’t tell if you’re a troll account or not. So hats off to you on that one. But if you can’t see that CNN and Fox News are two sides of the same coin you’re pretty dense. Partisan networks that present news and information differently in order to fit their respected party’s agenda. I would argue that CNN at least tries to appear unbiased, but obviously they lean left. Fox News on the other hand... I don’t see any effort.

       I think he’s a troll to be honest but I can’t tell. He comments in r/the_Donald and r/conservative only but he also has a post asking about a dog collar so something tells me he’s serious.

       That's not how reddit is set up at all though.  It was designed from the beginning to be fairly hands-off.  The idea is that if mods are really running something to the ground, then we can just start a competing sub and the 'free-market' of reddit users will migrate to whichever one is better.  It has happened numerous times in reddit's history.  r/trees is one of the more famous early examples.

       r/trees was the migration.  The original was r/marijuana.  Way back when, there were just two mods and they implemented some heavy-handed rules on what was and wasn't okay to talk about.  In the uproar that followed, one of the mods quit and the one that remained turned the assholery up to 11, banning people left and right.  It also came to light that he was a racist douche.  So everyone up and left and formed r/trees as an alternate, which thrived.  Later on, someone wanted to make a tree-oriented subreddit but r/trees was taken so they formed r/marijuanaenthusiasts as a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/marijuana today is run by a completely different team and seems like a thriving enough subreddit, but r/trees is the main pot subreddit that everyone knows.

       If this site is Pro-Trump, I am against banning it.  Conspiracy users are smart enough tell the difference between real and fake news.  We should not be in the business of banning websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, on the other hand, the site is critical of Trump, it should definitely be banned.  Conspiracy users need to know when websites, like fake news CNN, are trying to trick them into being against Trump.  Banning* CNN was a great achievement and has made conspiracy great again.

       I hear you. I propose that the unintended consequence of banning of this garbage is pushing it elsewhere, rather than shining light on it and allowing further exposure of the lies therein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider "hate groups". Rather than banning their speech, we all benefit from letting them freely spew their filth, so it can be rationally addressed and then eventually die under the weight of its own fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I understand the overt sensibility of your plea, I must say that censorship has a history of being counterproductive.

       The continuation of allowance for this site and ones exactly like it are a prime reason why we're a fucking joke of a sub and I'm ashamed to be here. Let's address the elephant in the room and do some connecting of the dots in regards to sites like this and other outlandish, straight up fucking stupid ideas that get tossed around here by uneducated dumbfucks with the gullibility of an autistic newborn. We face a political threat of silence at all times, especially on this medium of information flow. However, the lack of accountability for establishing FACTS before discussing theories will continue to allow this sub to eventually be gotten rid of (just like with many of the other subs associated with these fringe retards). To those saying "the educated readers will sift through the BS"...the problem is we have straight up illiterate, non-critical thinking tards and they often become louder than actual plausible conspiracies. And fuck you if you think the downvotes here matter, that's a smoke screen.

       There's a clear, absolutely distinct difference between alternative media sites and these 100% fake, 100% of the time misleading fake sites Your News Wire and Neon Nettle. They are in a league of fakeness far outside sites like the Free Thought Project, Activist Post, ect.. I have worked with the real alt media sites for almost 5 years now and I promise you, every single necessary source is cited as evidence as hyperlinks in the articles, and bullshit doesn't make it through.

This is a problematic statement. I'm not going to get all philosophical, but this subreddit (reddit in general) are media outlets run by the people, for the people; not some group (there are mods but that is beside the point). People hating that retarded website is good, but the website should not be banned, for minimal censorship.

       I think we're pretty good at calling out the fake shit on this sub.  When sites become blacklisted it will cause repercussions. The sites listed are bullshit (yournewswire, neonettle, etc) and I've gotten aggravated and called for their banning in the past.  But I think we'd be better calling it out ourselves, as a whole.  Downvote and most people wont take the post seriously.

       I say that I've never heard of it, but I don't think we should ban anything, ever. It should be up to the community and voting system to decide visibility.

       Raising awareness that YNW is trash is fine. But don't outright ban them. Perhaps linking an archive of a story they're peddling helps outline a globalist conspiracy being pushed through Internet media?

       I'll let Noam Chomsky answer:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum – even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there’s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Noam Chomsky,
       <em>
        The Common Good
       </em>
       , 1998
      </p>
      <p>
       Spaces in which to discuss that which is outside of the spectrum of generally acceptable discussion are vitally important in a free society. "Conspiracies" can be and often are ideas which simply exist outside of the spectrum of acceptable opinion, whether they end up being true or legitimate or not. I find many conspiracy theories to be absurd, offensive, dishonest, or simply insane, but conspiracy-spaces matter because some of those absurd, offensive, dishonest, or even insane ideas sometimes end up being right. How many times has that which was initially dismissed been proved true later?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why it's time that the current moderators of this subreddit be removed from their positions, for allowing such an important space to become another arm of a political movement, for banning and limiting the expression of uncomfortable or unpopular ideas, and most importantly in
       <strong>
        being wholly biased in their implementation of the rules
       </strong>
       . It would be one thing if CNN was banned and YourNewsWire was banned, but the fact that the rules apply to one source which is critical of the President and not to another source which is supportive is a clear indication that this is not /conspiracy, it's simply another wing of the alt-right and supporters of the current US administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of them need to be removed now. No more chances to do the right thing. No more waiting. No more compromise. Remove them, all of them, immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until that happens, this subreddit does not deserve it's name, and meta threads like this will keep appearing day in and day out as the hypocrisy and bias of the moderators continues.

       Maybe the mods are making money off these fake news sites. The mods here keep making the claim that we should be using the downvote system to take them down. Instead of doing due diligence they want us to investigate every one of these known fraudsters and drive traffic whether we downvote or not. It is specifically noted in the rules that removal of fabricated sources are subject to removal. If this were really about public discourse, then we should have to sort through the trash to get real content.

       I can get behind that. The moderation shouldn't attempt decide which sources are good or bad. The best approach would be to take away the monetary incentive to post the articles here. If people still want to post an article for some other reason, then it would create more problems than it would solve to stop them.

       God damn, Ive stated this in many threads in this sub but never have I been downvoted this much. There has to be some sort of brigading going in. Because ussually this sub is something like 40/60 pro trump anti trump. Which is enough to get plenty of posts to the front page of the sub even if it's nowhere close to the reddit front page.

       Journalists "doxx" people all the time in their articles, it's a normal practice and has been for hundreds of years.  This time, a CNN journalist decided not to publish a name as a fucking favor to the guy and ya'll flip out about it.
