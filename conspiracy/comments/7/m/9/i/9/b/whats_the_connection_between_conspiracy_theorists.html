       I think it has to do with zionism rather the hatred of jews. Of course there are a few anti-simites who jump on that ship.

       Has nothing to do with Judaism and everything to do with Zionism, the Ashkenazi, and the Kabbalistic Mystery Babylon flavor of judaism that has infected their leadership.

      <p>
       Not saying we don't have some old fashioned "jew hater" fuckwagons, but I think those have become fairly rare. But the people I have respect for around here know the difference, and have no problem at all with regular Jewish people.

       because jews are the problem. their entire existence is bleeding a region dry, and moving to the next one. they have zero morals because they united under perceived persecution instead of nature. their religion requires a slave class.

       I can't really speculate as to why exactly, I would say that is a generalization and not so much a connection. I have no animosity towards Jewish people. I can only speculate but some people may see that Jewish individuals are over represented in the government and places of power and that may lead to them thinking that, as a coping mechanism for their perceived failure of those that represent them in those positions of power.

       also trickery, for example jew is a religeon, not a race of people.  they were expelled from over 100 countries in there history for robbing the populace via immoral practises.
      </p>
      <p>
       try to mention this and they will call you anti semetic.   they will brand you racists yet (((THEY))) are the supreme racists they think all other than jew are goyim.

      <p>
       don't get me wrong i'm sue your average jew is ok... but they do not do themseslves any favours by not speaking out.

       that 'Jew' was a race, which to any logical person would imply you don't believe the Jews are a race, and there that they cannot be a subgroup of another race, the Semites (according to you they are a race, not to anyone else, to my knowledge).
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, if you'd like to lump Jews and Arabs as one race, of course that's up to you, but the rest of the world will go on using the words as they always have, as I laid out in

       'Caucasian' for 'white' was a term made up by some American crackpot that generally isn't used outside the USA. And you should just ask an Englishman is he considers himself the same race as a Pole, or a Chinaman if he considers himself the same race as a Mongol, and see what responses you get.

       Jew is not a race.

      <p>
       Like many other nationalities in Arabia and most of the middle east (not including Egypt) are classified as Caucasians

       Similarily, Hispanic is not a race, but rather part of the Caucasian race.

       As a sidenote, a great number of modern jews originated from Eastern Europe (near the Caucasus Mountains, of which the term Caucasian is derived from) which are definitively classified as Caucasian.

       Bing and Google both define it as a derogatory term for non-jews. I'm not sure of its etymology though, and wasn't really able to find anything either. The Wikipedia discussion on it has a few mentions of goy as another term for cattle, but it seems that's mostly relegated to disputed works. Feel free to check my 5 minutes of research, or drop me a line if I missed anything. I've already spent 5 minutes more on the origins of the word "goy" than I care ;)

goy (gɔɪ)

      <p>
       n., pl. goy•im (ˈgɔɪ ɪm)
goys.
usage: This term is usually used with disparaging intent, implying a mild contempt for the attitudes, traits, and customs of non-Jews. Although it may be used in a neutral, even positive way to refer to a Christian, it almost always connotes a degree of condescension. Usually the context, such as the use of a qualifying adjective, will show the intent of the speaker.
—n. Usually Disparaging.
(a term used to refer to a gentile or non-Jewish person.)
      </p>

       also if you see how they use the term in the talmund   they refer to us as lower than beasts and no more than slaves.

       I think the correct question to ask is conspiracy and hatred of Zionism aka globalists. I don’t hate Jews per say but I will hate on the Jews who call me goyim because that word itself is derogatory. I have humanistic view but I see the globalists are trying to bleed the world dry and are truly a cancer on humanity.

       It’s because the Talmudic Zionist “jews” have painted a target on the non-jews aka “goyim”. To them we’re open season for hunting and raping. Also, these self-entitled “jews” feel that nearly all of the Middle East belongs to them. And with this, they’re running the Yinon plan, the greater Israel project. This entails the destruction and destabilization of the Middle East so that Israel may expand its borders and control over the area. To get away with all this, they control the US gov’t who is a willing accomplice. If this wasn’t enough, the zionists decided long ago to destroy Europe for their benefit so that they could rule over it. This evil plot is known as Kalergi. Right now, there’s no greater evil in the history of human civilization than that of the rabid Kalergi lovin’ Zionist whose very aim is to destroy all of Europe’s cultural heritage &amp; her people by literally breeding them out through weaponized migration. And if one dares speak up, they get called anti-semitic or racist. We need real jews and Israelis to call out their colleagues and compatriots on this. Certain Israelis must reform and pay for her crimes against humanity.

       To add, in Islam, the antichrist (called Dajjal) will only come once Israel rules the world from Jerusalem. This is also when Muslims believe that Jesus will return to Earth and spear the antichrist to death (in one blow). This is why most Jews happen to worship Satan. Satan has also tricked the vast majority of non-Satanic Jews into being racist vile cowards frothing for Israel so that he (Satan) may summon the Dajjal (who will spread sin across the Earth like no other trial in history of our species). It is said in Islam that every single prophet (of the 120,000) before Muhammed warned his people about the antichrist, and that we are the last of the people, and Muhammad was the last of the prophets. Many Muslims are anticipating in their lifetime the arrival of the Dajjal and the second coming of Christ.

       Look how often people invoke the "jews have been kicked out of _____ countries" as if that's their doing, and not the result of equally lazy, ignorant people.  Funny how skeptical some people are of the ills that powerful people can do, up until those things happen to target their favorite (((enemy))) and then it's all statist boot licking.

       simple, Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for "Jewish citizens" i assume you mean israeli's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionism is a destructive, racist warmongering ideology and has been committing atrocities for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       these Zionist almost always try to spin criticism as antisemitism, they use their religion and race as a shield from legitimate criticism. they try to claim that all the hate they get is based on their religion or their race, not their actual actions. (

       most of us don't care about your race or religion, its actions. 
i have a bunch of jewish friends but i hate israeli's, most of them are worse than neo-nazis when it comes to their ideas of racial superiority and purity.

       People that question and criticizes the use and abuse of power do not generally direct their discontent towards a citizenry or race.  The discontent is directed at those in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance:
      </p>
      <p>
       A great number of people are critical of the US and its policies, but the initated understand that this is not directly a reflection of the citzens, it is a reflection of those in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Jewish people, "conspiracy theorist" are not critical of jewish people in general, they are critical of Zionism, Israeli influnce over the west, the banking system,  Palestine, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the reason you see a more passionate reaction to Zionist issues is because once you peek through the propaganda, spin and lies used to hide their hand of influence,  you can't help be to feel incensed by understanding how prevasive the lies are.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of which, have nothing to do with everyday people who happen to be jewish.

       I'd argue that it's the non Catholic Christians that are the bigger proponents of Zionism than the Catholics. Don't forget that Evangelicals have mostly taken over where the Catholic church left off in many parts of the United States and that non-catholic Christians are no strangers to all of the same sexual deviant problems that the Catholic clergy are. I've been seeing a lot of Catholic rage in this sub ever since the pope had bad things to say about Trump while defending non-catholic Christians. It's time to stop the bullshit and call them all out. They all build their billion dollar multimedia cathedrals while disregarding their scriptures and neglecting the most needy in their communities.

       The Anglo-Judaic ruling class essentially operates under the an ancient Roman law and custom called
       <em>
        Lex Scantinia
       </em>
       which codifies sexual mores between various categories of people.  They regard themselves as Roman
       <em>
        Freemen
       </em>
       who aren't subject to the same moral standards as ordinary folk, indeed they mandate that commoners be sex slaves.
