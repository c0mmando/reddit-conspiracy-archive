       This has happened a few times to me but I brushed it off. But this really got me thinking something is up.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few weeks ago, I was on a flight and I just so happen to sit next to a pilot who was flying home. I asked him about what it takes to become a pilot and how he did it etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just general small talk about his profession, it's not everyday you can talk to a pilot like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I get off the plane and go to my destination.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few hours later I'm on Facebook and start seeing ads for flight lessons on my newsfeed. I know Facebook will look into your search history and will provide ads based on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never looked up anything flight realited. I even went back in my search history to check.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has happened before but with smaller things like vitimin water for example so I could easily brush it off as a coinsidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this was a bit too specific. I've talked about this to other people and they thought the same thing and said similar things happened to them with things that are a bit too specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think guys? Has anyone noticed this too? I noticed it will also suggest things a little too well on Google search.

       Noticed a lot of phones are now also suggesting to add dates to planners when you get a text with either times/dates/places ect. Suggests heavily that the phone is reading the text as it processes and doing tasks based off keywords it sees.

       I know mine does, but it's on, in sleep mode.  I was talking to my son about a new pizza place in town as we drove past, and next day, saw video ads for that place on Facebook.  Never searched for it.  Never saw ads before or since for it.  Also, I was talking to my wife and said something about "he better learn how to drive that truck better" or something like that, referring to her father and his new pickup.  The next day ALL my facebook ads were for truck driving schools.

       On the first one, you said the place was new so maybe they were just putting a lot of ads out to people in your area. But the second one doesn't seem to have a good explanation. Isn't anybody working on something to help us block this shit?

       The significance of your story is the location at which you mentioned the pizza place. I'm pretty sure that the GPS tracker works in conjunction with the microphone for ad research somehow. I walked through a Home Depot not long ago and joked with my wife that I needed to get a tool belt for all the crap I'd been buying for projects lately. Within about 8 hours I think I had ads for toolbelts on Facebook. I have other similar stories as well. It's way too common at this point to be coincidence. The question now is, are we as a society okay with this?

       And you still have Facebook on your phone why?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to poke you in the eye here.  Just frustrated that this is the third thread this week where folks have shared similar stories to yours and there's been zero level of pissed offedness about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried Facebook about 10 years ago and felt it was too invasive so deleted and didn't miss a thing.  Now I see all these anecdotes of spying and uber-targeted ads with no public outrage and calls for boycotts.  Why do we roll over and take this kind of crap?

       So weird. It's never happened to me, and when I've tried to trick it into doing it, nothing happens. I keep hearing other people's anecdotes, but i have never experienced once and I've been in the ecosystem a long long time.

       Turn off the mic access to Facebook and that will stop. Also turn off camera access for good measure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never have let them have access to either and I have never had targeted ads based off of audio information (I have had targeted ads based off clicks within Facebook). My friends started getting a lot of this for a while now but they all had mic permission turned on.

       Go into your app settings and turn off the permission. I’m not sure how it’s done on Android, but I think it’s the same for iPhone, which is going into the settings by clicking the gear icon, and you can go to the Facebook setting there. You can also use the search bar at the top to find these settings.

       Happened to me christmas eve. I was begging my boyfriend to take me to get a waffle for Christmas. Minutes later I received an ad on FB for something called "Waffle Blocks" (a kid's toy). I don't have kids so I don't have anything in my search history for toys. Nor did I search anything about waffles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had a similar thing happen with my amazon fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have screenshots of these ads as evidence.

       Just shut off the mic setting (if possible) and unplug when not in use. I cannot actually prove that the advertisement happened because the fire was in my room. The device was the more expensive fire TV. (Not the TV Stick). It could have been a coincidence. 
 For the record I now use a fire TV stick and have not seen any correlations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can say for certain that the FB/Waffle Block ad happened because my phone was near me.  It happened within minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO I seriously don't know how to feel. It feels like this has been part of my whole life. I don't have anything to hide. If somebody wants to sell me something I'm going to use, whatever. At this point I'm jaded and I don't care. It's not like I'm trying to buy meth pipes or traffick small children, so I really don't give a fuck. What am I going to do? Give into worry and panic because I'm always being watched? I would surely go crazy giving into that anxiety. &lt;/End rant&gt;

       Most people seem to not care either. They say, "it's not like I'm doing anything illegal"... My fear is that if there ever comes a time where freedoms are stripped away from us, and what your doing does become illegal one day... There's already going to be a file with all your personal information, all of your children's personal information, and everyone you communicate with. You won't have a choice in fighting for your rights and if you try they will know. This sounds extremely paranoid and I get made fun of all the time for mentioning it when talking about being spied on - but it could happen. Why are "we" ok with having no privacy whatsoever.

       Well what is more of a concern are these health care insurance companies that offer incentives to use fitbit devices and upload your information. What if you have tachycardia or something? At what point will they use this information against you?
      </p>
      <p>
       The way things are looking, healthcare isn't going to be safe. Health care rates are either going to hike up, or ya all won't be able to get health care at all. This favors the rich who can afford to focus on their nutrition and health by paying for gym memberships, and fresh food. Also the rich are able to have more PTO and free time during the day. (This isn't always the case but I wouldn't know bc I ain't rich)

       This system would completely fuck the low/middle class American working 1 to 2 jobs AND/OR going to school AND/OR raising a child. When you have that much going on nutrition and exercise aren't your first priorities. (Not to mention the cheap S.A.D. food that is advertised to us daily)

       When I come home, my wife and I have our phone batteries out (or in a box in the drawer in the other area).  If people need to reach us they use email or Steam.  We check every few hours just in case.

       I tried to test this in 2013. I turned off my Galaxy S3 and put in a Faraday cage overnight. The next morning it was still at 100%. Of course, it may not have really been at 100% just because it said it was.

       I have a firewall installed on my phone, so I can monitor the data traffic. It's impressive how often all these f****** apps by Google send data away to their servers. Like every 2 secs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disabled all these apps by Google (there is a long list of them), and now, I can let my phone on the table, come back after a day, and 1% of battery life only will be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before that, just leaving the phone on the table without even using it for a day, and like, 30% of the battery life would be gone. WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING THE PHONE!!
      </p>
      <p>
       The counterpart is that the phone is now difficult to use, because all these apps by google are connected to one another somehow. Like, you cannot open the play store if you have the google play music app disabled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google has basically designed android so that you cannot escape their surveillance of your activity.

       It would have to use battery life to transmit a significant amount or information or to transmit anything more than a few feet, but it could not transmit successfully while in the Faraday cage, so in addition to any battery use while trying to communicate while turned off, it would have to boost power to try to get a signal. however, it apparently did not use any power.

       Thing is most people don't give a shit as long as they can still get on Facebook or play Flappy Birds with Friends or whatever these people do now. If you point it out to them, they give you that "if you don't have anything to hide" bullshit they've been brainwashed to believe. Society is fucked.

       How are these targeted advertisements actually hurting us though? I'm not endorsing it, and I understand the greater issue that is our privacy, but how does that harm us? If it's just the invasion of our privacy than say no more but I'm curious to see if targeted ads could have some kind of negative effect otherwise.

       Good question. For me, it's the invasion of privacy. It's also a little jarring to see firsthand what they can do and imagine what else they could do. This is the kind of tech that fuels the police state. It's scary as hell.

       Word, I guess the greater implications are pretty scary. It just seems like this is more about money than anything else to me right now though. When I bought an Alexa everyone was like omg they know you listen to you all time right? I'm like yeah but it's just me in here I just talk to my dog and friends on Xbox live when we play call of duty lol. Idk what crazy fucking information they're going to get on me from that other than how often I ask what the weather will be and what time I want to wake up from a nap.

       Well not everybody is just talking to the dog though. You've got people making drug deals or planning anything else illegal. The feds are gonna want to eavesdrop on that. If the political climate gets tighter, they may listen to "subversives" or anybody else they don't like. It's always about money but there's more at stake than that.

       I don’t know, every person I know or have met who had this happen were deeply bothered by it. It actually seemed to wake many of them out of their ‘digital haze’ and made them very leery of apps and what might be monitoring them without their knowledge.

       If all this recording was used to show you targeted ads on your facebook, I would not be too worried. It's invasive, but I mean, they are just showing you ads for cupcakes/shoes.

       Now, you can start to imagine how much further they can go with this. Say, you start talking to your partner about some nasty health issues the doctor found out. Like cancer or something. You can see how this is worth gold to the insurance company, and how the insurance company is then going to screw you. Same thing with personal finance related discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, IDK, say you have an affair, and your tech devices at home (webcams you have on the smartphone, tablet, laptop, even TV now) record the audio (or even video without you knowing). They could keep a record for an indefinite period of time, and this could be used against you one way or another someday.

I was talking to my brother yesterday morning about getting a x sport membership. Couple hours later I'm on safari on my phone and was bombarded with xsport promos.  I'm used to it by now. If I have conversations I put my phone in a different room. I was the crazy one in the family. Now everyone puts their phones away during dinner etc.

       I was giving my coworker a quick rundown on types of whiskey and the specific rules for making scotch.  Mid conversation he gets some kind of "science break: video" on his iPhone and it's a video about making scotch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bring this up in a Reddit post and people ask if I looked anything up while talking about it, which I did.  They were happy to dismiss it at that point because obviously they used the recent search history on my Verizon android phone to post a video that might interest him since he's obviously located right near me due to the GPS in his iPhone on an at&amp;t network.  They were cool with this.

       I have had this happen as well, I think. Here’s an experiment; download the Facebook app and continually talk about something not directly related to you. For example if you don’t own a dog, talk to your SO about needing dog food a lot who the your phone around. See if you get ads for dog food

       I believe they are. Your phone is listening and recording you at all times. I had a teacher that worked for NASA who refused to tell us anything about what goes on there. But I remember we asked him if aliens existed and he pointed to the computer, his cell phone and the projector and said that they were listening and watching and didn’t say another word

       I'm familiar with what a projector is. I'm curious how it would be in the same company as a computer or phone when it comes to listening in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if projectors have had hidden mics that have gone undetected for decades, they have no way of transmitting that audio data.

       If you have any voice assistant on your phone then yes. How else would your phone know when you say "Ok google"? It's always listening for voice commands, whether it's relaying information is another question. Imho facebook listens for keywords around the environment that are related to items they can sell and then sends this info back to their ai overlord servers who then analyze and sell the data to the highest bidders /tinfoil.

       Well... you did use your phone in some way to maybe get the information for your airplane flight, right? It's a similar realm. Maybe you bought your ticket online and your Facebook caught onto that. I get that it's for lessons to fly a plane but I mean it's not a far reach. Just saying. Maybe a possibility.

       I was visiting my mum just before Christmas, and she asked my brother and I if we wanted beer. She comes back with some, and I started seeing adverts for the brand of beer on Facebook. We hadn't even mentioned which brand we were drinking, nor have I ever searched for it online.

       I can definitely confirm this for myself now. I have been taking language classes in an attempt to learn Spanish. Ever since I've started, I've received nothing but Spanish advertisements for restaurants and services through Spotify. They've also been coming through my computer, which is logged into the same spotify account. So I'd consider Spotify as a service is compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I spend very little time talking aloud outside of school, and if I do, my phone is in another room. As much of an invasion of privacy as this is, they're gleaning no useful information from me. They're only picking up the words of another person, the instructor in that class. And when I talk, I typically avoid discussing things like companies, restaurants, and services. There's bigger battles to face in regards to privacy, internet safety, and other things currently in my opinion. I'd rather fight to end this than spend time worrying about it myself. If you can't figure out how to control this, then do your best to mitigate risks.

       Snowden says it's an open-source tool designed for human rights activists and other people at risk and it uses an Android phone's sensors to detect changes in a room.
      </p>
      <p>
       The software was developed with the Freedom of Press Foundation and the Guardian Project. It has been greeted with mixed social media reactions, with some people celebrating its security capabilities and others saying they don't trust Snowden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden has lived in Russia since 2013, when the country gave him asylum, resisting U.S. pressure to extradite him.

       Re iPhones, if you have hands free Siri switched on, you are literally allowing Siri to listen to anything it can hear, analyse your words etc as it waits to hear your commands. 
I don’t know whether your voice is recorded as audio or as text-to-speech but I guarantee that data has got to bounce to an Apple server and be stored, even if only momentarily. I’d say each dataset would have some kind of identifier to prevent crossed streams of data (ie differentiating your “hey Siri” request from mine) and that must mean that it is also ‘read’ or analysed.
I’m sure in the not too distant future, when our ubiquitous phones and their recordings are accepted as monitoring devices, we may see things like preemptive law enforcement based on captured data from our phones, such as stoner conspiracy conversations on the couch.

       Wouldn't need to listen to audio to figure this out. It would just see your profile moved from one location to another rapidly and think that you are probably into travel.

       I do think electronics do/can listen, but there is way to get info beyond that. You'd be frightened how many breadcrumbs you leave.

       Yes, years ago I worked for a company listening to snippets of a "voice to text" feature to rate the quality, and maybe 8-10% of the clips the people being recorded clearly didn't know they were being recorded. When I started seeing ads and Google suggestions for things I'd only said out loud I immediately knew why.

       I have found this to be the case in many conversations that I have had. Earlier this year I broke up with someone. I didn’t post it on Facebook or anywhere else for that matter, just private discussions between the two of us. However, dating app ads started to appear on my Facebook timeline. I have found this to be the case when discussing purchases as well, I say something and an amazon ad appears. This does not apply to the word umbrella, I assume because of the song.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I have a stalker that I am positive uses the camera and the mic on my phone to spy on me. Also, he has disabled the phone function so that I may not call anyone, and I cannot receive calls. When I get a call and answer it, it continues to make the ring tone while the screen appears to have answered the call. When I make a call there is no sound on either end. I have checked my settings, and everything is proper. Additionally, I do not always receive text messages, just the notification but when I go to see the text there isn’t one. He has also blocked my Facebook messenger app. I have an iPhone 7+. After the most recent update my phone returned to full functionality for approximately two hours. I have taken my phone to the Verizon store and it went to the boot screen and would not unlock, when I got home I was allowed the limited phone functions that I have back, which is the internet browser basically and texts he wants me to receive. My phone messages work fine, and I can replay and hear those, the phone also displays the phone message text fine. He often uses all my data within the first couple of days of the cycle rendering my phone useless for most of the month unless I have wi-fi.

       Phones and stuff with camera's/microphones, generally yes - but if it makes you feel any better that stuff can't get used against you in court generally speaking... It's just disturbing and voyeuristic spying. It's easy to prove if something someone has recorded was picked up by a stingray using a zero day exploit, or that a phone was not on for a recording and thus it was acquired illegally, etc. (Taps apply to electronic communications, you weren't communicating and didn't agree to it if your phone was off, you disabled certain apps, etc.)

      <p>
       A similar story happened to me, about something very specific too. So, I got this friend outside who told me about a fruit I never ever heard about. It's called "finger lime", and it is a native fruit of Australia. I think pretty much only Australia grows it, and Australia doesn't grow much of it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this friend gave me a few to bring home, and back home, I go to the kitchen and tell my wife "hey, today I was introduced to a fruit I never heard about before. It does taste good. Try it. It's called finger lime".
      </p>
      <p>
       So she tries and all, and like, 10 minutes later, she moves on to another activity, she goes and grab the ipad, which was in the bedroom, charging. The ipad was in plane mode, and the bedroom door was shut. She opens the gumtree app (a marketplace to exchange 2nd hand stuff) to browse new ads, and first thing that shows in big when she open the app : a paid advertisement for finger limes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We both bugged for a minute. There is absolutely no way such a coincidence is possible. As I said, I never ever heard about that fruit before that day, so obviously, I never searched for it on the Internet before. Plus she never browse those health/nutrition content websites on her ipad. So, there is no way she recently stumbled upon an article talking about the health benefits of finger lime or something like that. Plus, we are not talking about apples, or oranges here. We are talking about a fruit that is grown in Australia only, in small quantities, and during a relatively short season.

       I've had a couple similar experiences with the first I noticed while on a photo shoot at Chicago Open Air in 2016. Our last night in town we took our AirBnB hosts out to a small Mexican restaurant for beers and tacos. While we were eating, I noticed that ESPN was showing people playing video games competitively and made mention of how odd that was. We get home from Chicago the next day and I notice several news stories pertaining to video games on ESPN on my FB news feed. I messaged my photo partner and our hosts, all of them experienced the same thing. I no longer use FB.

       I don't own an unwise smart phone but you can try LineageOS / Copperhead for Android devices, as well as fDroid, to remove most of the well documented spying shit from Google/Facebook etc.

       Maybe some kind of firewall that blocks all incoming and outgoing connections so you can create rules on what accesses the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also disable wifi and bluetooth in public/whenever you don't use it and enable it when you actually use it.

       Better experiment - out Spanish/other language TV on and set your phone nearby, watch the ads on your phone start appearing in Spanish.

       Go into your app settings and turn off the permission. I’m not sure how it’s done on Android, but I think it’s the same for iPhone, which is going into the settings by clicking the gear icon, and you can go to the Facebook setting there. You can also use the search bar at the top to find these settings.
