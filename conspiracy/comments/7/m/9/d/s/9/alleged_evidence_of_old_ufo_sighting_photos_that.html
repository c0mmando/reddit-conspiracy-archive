        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a repost of my comments on a different thread that is generating buzz regarding these &#39;old&#39; photos. Here are the links to the articles with the pics, pasted from one of other threads (thank you, original Op) that I wanted to focus on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was photographed at Christmas time 1937 in Vancouver and reported a UFO incident</p>

<p><a href="http://vancouverisawesome.com/2012/02/08/vancouver-was-awesome-ufo-over-city-hall-1937/">http://vancouverisawesome.com/2012/02/08/vancouver-was-awesome-ufo-over-city-hall-1937/</a></p>

<p>40 years later in 1977 Petrozavodsk, Russia it was photographed and also reported as a UFO incident</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fern-flower.org/en/articles/petrozavodsk-phenomenon">https://www.fern-flower.org/en/articles/petrozavodsk-phenomenon</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll be the buzz-kill devil&#39;s advocate here. Feel free to throw spears but please show your work (have more than a 5th-grade counter to my argument, please).</p>

<p>The Norwegian spiral launch was in 2009, but the first of only a few sighted phenomena that had since took this specific shape seemed to occur next in June of 2010 from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yo8f7fQFO8">Kyrgyzstan launch.</a></p>

<p>With that said, please look for a preponderance of pre-2009 articles that relate to the UFO examples from the original Op&#39;s links from above (I&#39;ve also posted a link to the original thread at the bottom).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll help. There wasn&#39;t much of any. For the Vancouver UFO, at least, all post 2009 links come back to one 2009 source, a British Columbia UFO website.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091121083118/http://www.ufobc.ca/History/Early/cityhall_v2.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20091121083118/http://www.ufobc.ca/History/Early/cityhall_v2.htm</a></p>

<p>At best, most other links are to crap SEO&#39;d sites and had cut and pasted the same narrative, crediting the above source. Here&#39;s the heart-breaking piece: the only pre-2009 version of the cut-and-paste narrative that I could find was the following link from 2005. The problem is that the narrative goes with a totally different picture.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050403234534/http://www.burlingtonnews.net/ufofiles.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20050403234534/http://www.burlingtonnews.net/ufofiles.html</a></p>

<p>So, with this last point especially, one could take any old narrative, and then rehash it with a newer &#39;old&#39; photo. This narrative was convenient because it mentions a &quot;bright blue light (dropping) straight down from the sky&quot;. Never mind that the Spacex launch sighting didn&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>With that said, for all of you Project Bluebeam lovers out there, I&#39;ve got some more ammo for you. Here&#39;s a scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Step 1: Create the physical tech - rocket-launched aerial phenomena and concurrently plant an &#39;old&#39; photograph that corroborates your phenomena. Hypothetically, according to what I&#39;ve posited here, this could be done with low effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Step 2: Create a disclosure buzz.</p></li>
<li><p>Step 3: Profit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#39;s one last thought experiment: If &#39;they&#39; could have been a little more careful about not having their R&amp;D launches observed, and if they could have successfully removed all of the evidence of the launch contrail, how much easier would it have been to sell this phenomena to you right out of the gate?</p>

<p>It, of course, then begs the question, why were they so sloppy with revealing their hands before they were ready to present the big shoe, if this were all the case. I couldn&#39;t presume to know, but it&#39;s hard to account for failures in R&amp;D planning, execution, and desperation stemming from a potentially accelerated timeline, caused by concurrent geo-political events.</p>

<p>Regardless, I ask you to apply some rigor to your enthusiasm about this, and to what I&#39;m positing here. And...go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that post. I find it interesting there are similarities in the pics (which i believe is all that is being said,  people are having fun with their theories)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read your post a couple more times to try to understand.  Are you saying the articles linked were released post Norwegian spiral so it might be some sort of propaganda?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m not making the argument that I know it was some deliberate ploy, associated with the Norwegian spiral and other launches, per se. I did offer a scenario for those that wanted to make that argument, based on what I discovered, as there are plenty out there that are suspect of &#39;UFO disclosure&#39;, in regard to its relationship to Project Bluebeam.</p>

<p>I <em>am</em> saying that there is no novel proof that the photos in question have any authenticity to them (in regard to their date of origin), but rather, the opposite, as it is highly suspect because of what I presented. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I am also saying that these photos doesn&#39;t constitute as even anecdotal evidence that this phenomena had been observed prior to 2009 or 2010, which is the premise for all of the buzz in that post.</p>

<p>Thanks for asking for clarification.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, I get kinda academic in my approach, so it doesn&#39;t make for good reading, and I could definitely be better at presenting my claims, for sure. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, I&#39;m arguing that the photos and accompanying stories that go with the can&#39;t be verified to be authentic. More so, there&#39;s specific things that raise concern that the photos may not only be not as old as they say, but I don&#39;t believe that they could be proven to be older than 2009, generally speaking. </p>

<p>So, if that was the case, which I am arguing that it seems to be (that nothing can show that these photos were older than from 2009), then the idea that these photos show something that they couldn&#39;t have known to exist in the future, not only looks less incredible, but shows deception in its attempt to being passed off as a legitimate photo.</p>

<p>That may be the best I can do to summarize it. The post includes the argument that attempts to back my claim. To be sure, whether or not one believes my conclusion, the lack of evidence of the photo&#39;s authenticity <em>from within the UFO community</em>, seems to speak for itself, if one does the work to try and prove or disprove it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The crazy part for me personally about all of this and the videos released from the Pentagon and acknowledging the have UFO search program and it now being reported in the main stream media is that my father is starting to believe in UFOs and telling me that I might be right. It make&#39;s me happy that he is taking an interest in some of my beliefs so I don&#39;t even want to try to explain to him that smells like Project Blue Beam and a false invasion could be on the horizon.

It got to the point where I didn&#39;t want to bring that stuff up with him to avoid argument, I have plenty of friends and also reddit to discuss it with. But now it is different.

<p>Word, that would be wonderful, indeed. I&#39;m trying to remember to be supportive, myself, with people I know that have started to become curious about some thing, <em>any thing</em>, that could indicate to them that the institutions that they were raised to trust have been deceiving them, for better or worse. It all starts there, it <em>is</em> what will connect me to them, in my opinion. </p>

<p>Back in the day, before we were taught to use the term &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; (unwittingly, and towards our own demise), people used to talk about &#39;cover-ups&#39;, as that concept was typically <em>the</em> conspiracy that drew their interest, regardless of the subject matter, i.e. &quot;Look at what the government is not telling us (about something)!&quot;. Again, it&#39;s about waking up to the deception, for many, whether or not that thought is conscious in their minds at the time - that&#39;s what a lot of this exploration is about, as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

<p>Again, good luck to you and yours!</p>
