      <p>
       The below got me banned with no explanation in 2 hours by the snowflakes at The_Donald.  I wonder if you all are interested in my opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO Obama is a natural born citizen because his mother was a US citizen at the time of his birth and she was in the US at the time and had been for over a year. Spoiler, Obama was not born in Hawaii.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that Ann graduated high school in 1960 and we know that Barry's first schooling was in Indonesia when his father was Soetoro. What isn't clear is why and when Ann went from Washington state to Indonesia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was never interested in the whole BIRTHER thing because honestly I feared Hillary more and Obama was the lesser of 2 evil. (there was no way a republican was going to win in 2008)
      </p>
      <p>
       Even as a conservative I tried to cover for POTUS Obama but all the evidence was complete crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as it pained me I had to learn more about Obama...
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        That said
       </strong>
       I have not investigated Any of the above personally. I do find it odd that we have nude photos of Ann but no photos of her newborn son in Hawaii or Washington or where ever she had him. We know addresses in Indonesia where they lived but few other details about where they lived before that. So much information is missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        My Theory
       </strong>
       Barry's biological father was Frank Marshall Davis who supported Ann for a time until she moved to Hawaii.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to think Ann's parents were embarrassed their unwed suburban daughter got knocked and was going to have a black baby. Lets face it, it was the 60s. This would explain them moving to Hawaii of all places where a mixed race child wouldn't be an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Barry was born in a doctors office, or hospital or mid wife... Who knows. I also think Ann's parents put a notice in the Hawaiian paper, because come on, no proof is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to wonder if Ann was rebelling against her parents, or didn't want to leave her friends, or was in love with Frank or had complications that kept her from flying. But for some reason she had Barry in Washington, waited till he was safe to fly and moved to Hawaii and then fabricated the story with Kenyan Obama as cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears Ann Truly cared about Lolo, Maya, Indonesia, education and socialism, but not Barry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if there was some sort of resentment from Lolo and thus Ann because Barry was a bastard child that would have been offensive to muslims in Indonesia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Barry's secret father is the reason why so much information is missing or contradictory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think Barry Knows who his father is and had some connections with him, maybe learning his radical leftist, anti-america, racist ways from Frank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frank Marshall Davis looks just like Barry and Ann was in Seattle with a newborn baby. Why would Ann Fly from Hawaii to Seattle with a newborn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama looks nothing like his Kenyan Obama family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think the Hawaiian Birth Certificate is fraudulent and who ever produced it should be prosecuted. What if the next Radical, Anti American Candidate isn't really a natural born citizenship. We certainly don't want people forging documents to subvert the constitutional requirements to be president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly its highly unlikely that anyone knows the truth, Perhaps the FBI has information but that won't come out, or will it... MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess we could test the DNA of some Obama's and Frank Marshall Davis's relatives and see what matches.
I do think anyone who honestly believes the official story that Barry was born in Hawaii is a moron. 10 seconds of searching makes it fairly obvious Ann was not getting jiggy in Hawaii with a random exchange student 9 months before Barry's birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also respect all the Birther that knew something wasn't right. Don't get me wrong in polite company I will reply that Obama was not born in Kenya and he was born in the USA. But I will never lie and say he was born in Hawaii.
Sorry for all the typos and horrible grammar. If anyone shows interest I will spend some time fixing them

       Read the OP. I believe she was in Washington going to school.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't believe is she went to Hawaii, enrolled in college, met,  impregnated by and then marries a stranger. Then leave your family, college and new husband to goto a different school alone in Seattle with a 2 month old... All in 16 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it more likely she stayed in Seattle having an affair with a married man who had naked pictures of Ann and looks Barry.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then later Ann moves to Hawaii to be with her parents?

       Isn't it more likely that the birth certificate released by the Hawaii department of health is

       As I said before the lack of an authentic Hawaiian birth certificate is a clue.  I can't make you look into it, nor do I want to distract from the main point of the thread.  The man that took and shared naked pictures of Ann, also looks very much like Obama and was actually in the city where Ann was actually seen with her newborn baby.  Sure its possible Frank is still the father but an went to Hawaii had Barry then flew immediately back to Washington.  I concluded she was in Washington the whole time because it is the most plausible explanation. If you genuinely wonder if the Hawaiian Birth certificate is real, then I suggest you look into it, thousand of experienced people have researched it and found many abnormalities that have never been explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't wonder if the Hawaiian birth certificate is real... Then you already believe he is naturally born so I have to ask why are you posting?

       Based on all the people who have investigated it..... NO.... Again it doesn't really matter.  If you care about the fake Birth Certificate go to a thread about that.  This thread is not disputing the fakeness of the birth certificate. It is only giving a reasonale conclusion based on what we are told and what actual evicence exists.  Mind you I first researched all this in 2008 and researched it more in 2010. Since that time a DVD has been made "Dreams of my real father" I guess you could watch that.  I might buy it and watch it on an old laptop that has a DVD drive.

       I've seen this before and its pretty convincing that something odd is going on. Either Obama's certificate was edited with the other one, or the other way around. Is there any good arguments against this video and evidence presented? Genuinely curious about this topic but I generally stay away from it because I don't care to argue about the birther crap that usually comes along with it.

       I think anyone who spent a second looking into where Obama was born knows the official story defies logic. Agreed it doesn't really matter but anti-Trumpers keep bringing it up. I just offer up what I found and what it means to me. Maybe others can add to or modify things I got wrong. In the end lots of people are interested weather they admit it or not

       None of it is logical.

       Perhaps the naked photos Ann taken by a man who looks like Barry leads to the logical conclusion that frank is the father.

       Let me ask you what is logical of Ann graduating HS, goes to Hawaii goto college in Hawaii, become pregnant, get married, have kids... Just leave your husband, school and parents to goto school in Washington? All 16 months?

       Do you know many people?  People aren't logical.  I know people who proposed on a second date (and they're still married years later). I know people who just dropped out of good schools or quit good jobs for no good reason.  People move across the world because they met someone on an online game.

       I have clues that lead to a logical conclusion.  When did I ever say I had proof?  By all means if you have DNA Of Barry or his kids, i am sure we can find a relative of Kenyan Obama that would glady give a DNA sample.
      </p>

       you would have to ask the person who forged it.  The cover ups is usually greater then the initial lie.  The logical thing would be for Obama to admit everything he was told and told others was a lie.... But the easier thing is to do a really bad job forging a document that in theory should not have existed and then upload it to the world.
