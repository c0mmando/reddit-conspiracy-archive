       THIS. I think he's rogue too.

      <p>
       Do I think he's innocent? Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think he's discusted with some shit he's seen? Yep. All day. And that's what we need, but this finger-pointing bullshit gets all the press, all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't like that he's flown with Epstein, but he has - he didn't like it - and he says he wants to stop it. Idgaf about the hashtag metoo movement. Don't care about grabbed pussies. Can't stand all this whining and baiting &amp; anger.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want the trafficking to end. Maybe he can do that &amp; maybe he'll fail miserably. Either way, someone seems to be fucking trying &amp; that's a damn good start.

       And it is such a half-assed, lazy argument, too. I mean, they are here arguing because their candidate didn't win. If their candidate did win, would they be screaming at themselves for "supporting the government"? The dishonest, passive aggressiveness would be funny if it wasn't so annoying.

       The post is actually about the ad-hom argument that paints anyone that doesn't trash Trump as "pro-government" and the disingenuous merit of that talking point.

       Which is exactly painting Trump supporters with a broad brush, I agree with you. Just like it's disingenuous to conflate attacks on Trump as somehow being pro-Clinton. A large number of people didn't want either of them in office.

       I wasn't sliding anything so don't accuse me of it, I just was talking to you. I also never denied the existence of shills. Reddit is just a liberal/libertarian leaning site and always has been. All I doubted really was that hilldog supporters actually exist, because I can't fathom anyone actually liked that witch.

       OP's point stands, though, that if you aren't actively trying to impeach the current President, you are somehow "pro-establishment or pro-government" and I think that is crap. It is full on, carefully crafted gaslighting by the people that
       <em>

       Yeah I agree, I think a lot of people just like Trump while being apathetic to the rest of the federal government. I think the chaos he causes is hilarious and is actually working to erode people's faith in the government, which I support.

       To take it a little further, I think a lot of the crap he does is purposely to show the people what we've become as a society- the tweeting in particular. I think it is hilarious when I see people sounding off about Trump's tweets on Twitter- it is so ironic to me! It is supposed to be a representative government and this guy is just doing what the people he represents do.

       The life of a person anxiously awaiting his next tweet to be the first to respond is a sad thing indeed. I don't know if he's aware of what he's doing or not, but the country and world will definitely be different when he's out of office. Living in interesting times for sure!
