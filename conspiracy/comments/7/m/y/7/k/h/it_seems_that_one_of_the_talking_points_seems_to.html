<p>Personally, I don&#39;t like that he&#39;s flown with Epstein, but he has - he didn&#39;t like it - and he says he wants to stop it. Idgaf about the hashtag metoo movement. Don&#39;t care about grabbed pussies. Can&#39;t stand all this whining and baiting &amp; anger. </p>

<p>I want the trafficking to end. Maybe he can do that &amp; maybe he&#39;ll fail miserably. Either way, someone seems to be fucking trying &amp; that&#39;s a damn good start. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or Bernie. I voted for Gary because I&#39;m a firm believer in <em>less</em> government and better election debates, but I&#39;m pleased with the current shake up right now <em>in both parties and the establishment-controlled media</em>. You would have to be genuinely dishonest to act like the establishment that has controlled politics for decades isn&#39;t feeling really uncomfy right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To take it a little further, I think a lot of the crap he does is purposely to show the people what we&#39;ve become as a society- the tweeting in particular. I think it is hilarious when I see people sounding off about Trump&#39;s tweets on Twitter- it is so ironic to me! It is supposed to be a representative government and this guy is just doing what the people he represents do. </p>
