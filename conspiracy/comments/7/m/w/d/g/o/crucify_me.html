        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don’t care. You people need to hear this. At least you are aware or interested in the occult, science, politics, and philosophy; so maybe a fraction of you will understand. </p>

<p>The only way we win this battle, and by we I mean humanity, is if we kill or suppress a whole lot of stupid people. I’m not going to play judge, jury, and executioner but part of me certainly wished someone would. </p>

<p>If you came to me, from the future and said “Quetzalcoatl, if you didn’t exist, the world would be a better place, in fact your existence is holding humanity back” and you had any measurable proof of that, I would gladly jump off a bridge or blow my brains out for the species. </p>

<p>That kind of objective loyalty is what we need; a hive mind, a group consensus. </p>

<p>It’s what they had back in tribal times. The group didn’t have different minority’s that wasted time because they felt disserviced in some way. Those people understood that they needed to adapt for the <em>greater good</em></p>

<p>The Greater Good. A concept that our generation has forgotten. It’s shameful. </p>

<p>We should be bullding space elevators and cracking time travel and conversing with aliens by now, yet here the world is just sitting on its rear end. “Oh look, another super bowl.” “Who won American Idol this year?”</p>

<p>Other countries, don’t act like your so much better! You’re just as weak and stupid as Americans. </p>

<p>It’s a global problem. </p>

<p>The elite <em>are</em> conversing with other forces, whether they be demonic or extraterrsitrial. They are making group decisions for us that we cannot even comprehend <em>because we allow them to sodomize our children without repercussions</em></p>

<p>The entire world has gone mad. </p>

<p>The only way we evolve is if we cut our losses and reject our own individuality. You need to be part of something greater. Mother Nature is FED UP with us. Climate change may be a hoax but these thousands of species we are killing every year <em>is not a hoax</em></p>

<p>Wake up! Be a god! </p>

<p>We are gods. </p>

<p>Not cavemen. </p>

<p>Not internet trolls. </p>

<p>Not “civilians” </p>

<p>Wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus&#39; crucification only saved people because he himself wasn&#39;t a sinner. You are. We all are.</p>

<p>You start your post with both of these statements: &quot;I will not judge&quot; and &quot;we should be killing stupid people&quot;. You are the judge already. Your thought process is full of judgement. </p>

<p>Maybe the elites are only part of the problem. Maybe the other part is ourselves and our judgemental egos are too big to understand that. Everyday we all hear it, at least one of us spouting off at the mouth saying something like &quot;why is the majority of the population blind sheep&quot;, while assuming the role of being more &quot;woke&quot; than their peers. </p>

<p>We need to start giving each other more credit, and faith. We can&#39;t go much further together if we are screaming at each other or foaming at the mouth waiting to hand out a list of names of people who shouldn&#39;t breed because they&#39;re &quot;idiots&quot;. </p>

<p>You are absolutely right...we should be much more advanced. Not just with technology but I believe our senses in general. We still have the opportunity to advance, we are all still alive. I believe that wishing death to certain people (including yourself) isn&#39;t the way we get there. And if we keep assuming that most everyone around us doesn&#39;t give a damn than it becomes harder to advance...if we keep assuming that those who are lost in the matrix will never be found, we are giving up on humanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well despite your sarcasm i suggest you take some time to really reflect on what people have been saying to you over the past couple of days.</p>

<p>If your views really come from a place of good why have people reacted so strongly against you.</p>

<p>Dont think about what they are doing wrong, focus on you and why you believe these things with no reason or facts to back up your opinions</p>

<p>This guy is telling people that there needs to be a purge of dumb people and that he would kill himself if it would benefit society and you&#39;re going to try to chastise me for telling him to get on with it?  Even &quot;hinting&quot; that I&#39;m committing some sort of crime for it.  </p>

<p>You aren&#39;t going to test shit, you&#39;re going to lecture about public spaces and other bullshit why you act all morally superior.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Wtf are you even talking about? Lmfao.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s find out who gets judged by the all powerful and holy government!</p>

<p>Your honor, I present my case that the OP is encouraging both genocide of people based upon an undefined selection process claimed to judge a person&#39;s intelligence.  Like all communist purges we know that this selection process will continuously migrate from one inconvenient class of persons to the next until the very people who started the purge find themselves with their heads on the chopping block and the circle of human suffering will once again be completed in the name of &quot;progress&quot;.  I find it no longer necessary to humor these collectivist ideologies for the sake of being kind at the cost of hundreds of millions of innocent people needlessly losing their life, liberty, property and happiness.</p>

<p>So with all things considered I would like to beg of the morality justice system to grant me the liberty of replying to a stranger on the internet that while they plan to commit genocide and then kill themselves that perhaps they should reverse the order of operations &quot;for the greater good&quot;.</p>

<p>I rest my case.</p>

I will leave you with this: In my opinion your attitude is to be received very defensive-agressive. Might be caused by stress and high Cortisol. (That&#39;s just me guessing.)</p>

<p>I asked you to just reflect on your words and your reactive response makes me doubt that you even considered my request. I can&#39;t ever judge you as a person but I can and will disagree with your impulsive action and I reported OP and now you according to my moral code. It is a very simple principle. I try not to judge or compare. You can and will do whatever you want and that is your journey alone. My experiences involve harm and suffering beeing provoked by mindless words and actions and I will act according to that. I am not into ideologies or purges, I am into universal basic human respect and am making use of the chance to touch you on this medium with my words, like you might touch somebody randomly with yours. I am only responsible for my actions as are you and that&#39;s it. Let some kindness into yout heart, flytape and I will send you some peacefull thoughts and wishes for 2018.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Utopia can only exist by actively suppressing individuality, which is a horrifying concept. Your idea of a perfect world is different from everyone else&#39;s making a Utopia impossible without total mind control. That doesn&#39;t seem like the greater good to me. </p>

<p>Individual experience seems to be the point of this life game we&#39;re playing. Everything is one consciousness anyway, so duality was created for the consciousness to experience itself. Suppressing individuality violates all that is natural and a dangerous concept. I understand what you&#39;re trying to say about becoming a better version of what we currently are but I think you need to rethink your approach to attaining your goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they were used as an experiment, then yes. No one should have the authority or believe they have the authority to experiment on someone else. It&#39;s barbaric.</p>

<p>I agree about unnecessary suffering. In fact reducing the suffering of anyone or any animal I&#39;m in contact with is a major part of my life. I want to make life as comfortable as possible for everyone.</p>

<p>There are major problems in the world as you said. I don&#39;t have the answers either but I do believe that the ego is a root cause for all suffering as Buddha said. Everyone&#39;s belief that it&#39;s them against the world is the problem. Self realization is key because you understand that there is no separation at all in the universe. Once realized you become complete and have no desire. Conflict ends.  The issue is that it&#39;s self realization, it can&#39;t be forced.</p>

<p>Absolutely. The rampant narcissism and massive egotistical behavior that is promoted in this society is devastating to everyone.  Simple concern for others is basically non-existent. It&#39;s kill or be killed mentality. Divide and conquer at all levels is working. Hopefully people get sick of being sick and make changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I do agree with you completely, there&#39;s a problem with who decides who the stupid people are.  For example, if you go over to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, they&#39;d say everyone at the donald are stupid and should be killed.  And visa versa.</p>

<p>Then you have to define what stupid is.  Is it intelligence tests for voting that we had decades ago to keep certain people from voting?  Plenty of city dwellers think the rural folk are backwards and stupid.  Yet I&#39;ve met plenty of book smart people in the city that wouldn&#39;t be able to survive in an apocalypse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still hoping a virus comes out and makes all humans infertile.  That would end humans within a generation without war or famine.  Leave the planet to the animals, though we see where that got us last time (the violent ape won out - aka humans).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want out. This existence never was meant to be a paradise and it never will be. The damage has been done. I want the control over my own destiny because I realize how limited I am in this form. It&#39;s like being in a prison. The world&#39;s a prison, my body&#39;s a prison and the mind can also be viewed as a prison for certain people. I have severe depression and anxiety. I&#39;m not having a free for all party when I&#39;m having a bad day. </p>

<p>Why do I have to stay in this body for as long as I do? Why can&#39;t I go and be a cat for a spell? And then why can&#39;t I be a butterfly for awhile? I&#39;m sick of humans and I&#39;m sick of being a human. We do so many fucked up things to each other and it&#39;s old. </p>

<p>And I really want to comment more on your actual post because I feel differently than you do. I&#39;ve said on so many other places that this world is filled with traps. To realize you&#39;ve fallen through a trap and you&#39;re able to get yourself out of it is on par with being buried alive and digging yourself out of your own grave. I&#39;ll respect the ones that dig themselves out of their own grave. I&#39;ll sympathize with the ones that just can&#39;t dig out. Those aren&#39;t my enemy. The ones that are my enemies is the son of a bitches that trapped us here to begin with and the ones that make damn sure this experience will be as miserable as possible. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way of resetting the machine. Doesn&#39;t matter if you do go the route you&#39;re talking in your OP. There&#39;ll always be ones to replace the ones that get taken out--doesn&#39;t matter if we&#39;re talking about the distracted people or the assholes that commit such horrors in our existence. </p>

<p>Call me Debbie Downer, this is just the way I see it.</p>

<p>Uh huh.... Prove your immortality to us then.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t stand this new age horseshit. Just adding more delusion to an already fucked melting pot. </p>

<p>Anyone with enough sense to take a step back and looked at this post will just see another &quot;conform conform conform&quot; post.</p>

<p>But nope! Don&#39;t conform to the elite this time conform to the new age community and be &quot;one with all&quot; </p>

<p>Individuality was gifted to us for a reason. Your post stinks of the same &quot;conform and assimilate&quot; the stink that the transhumanists do. </p>

<p>Go take some more acid then get back to us buddy. Holy fuck. </p>
