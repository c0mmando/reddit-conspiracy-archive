     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       First, let's take to Wikipedia for a quick look at
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz">
        Alan Dershowitz
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Dershowitz is an author and lawyer
        </strong>
        , with such prominent clients as Patty Hearst, Mike Tyson and Jim Bakker, while also having served as an appellate adviser during the O.J. Simpson trial.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Politically he supported Hillary Clinton in her 2008 bid for the presidency
        </strong>
        , calling her "a progressive on social issues, a realist on foreign policy, a pragmatist on the economy".
        <strong>
         He eventually threw his support behind the democratic candidate, Barack Obama. In 2012
        </strong>
        , he once again rallied for Obama, writing "President Obama has earned my vote on the basis of his excellent judicial appointments, his consensus-building foreign policy, and the improvements he has brought about in the disastrous economy he inherited."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         It is also notable, then, that he campaigned against the election of Donald Trump
        </strong>
        during the United States presidential election of 2016 and has been critical of many of his actions, including his travel ban, his rescission of protections for “Dreamers” and Donald Trump’s failure to single out white nationalists for their provocations during protests in Charlottesville
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Despite all of this, Dershowitz is either true to the rule of law, or he has an ulterior motive for defending Trump when it matters (i.e. when the law is involved):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Dershowitz has strongly argued against
        </strong>
        the criminalization of political differences and
        <strong>
         the legal investigations against Donald Trump
        </strong>
        , while also stating that Trump’s alleged disclosure of classified information to Russia is “the most serious charge ever made against a sitting president.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So why would someone who is opposed to Trump be wary of a criminal investigation against a sitting president? As a lawyer, he must understand that an investigation is just that; the United States isn't a banana republic, and there certainly won't be any kangaroo courts for a sitting president, if you could argue that they exist in the US at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/11/04/dershowitz-no-criminal-evidence-yet-either-trump-russia-investigation-or-democrats">
        Back in November, Alan was on Fox and Friends
       </a>
       to try to put out the fires, on both sides:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Alan Dershowitz called the recent scandal surrounding Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee the "mirror image" of the Russia collusion allegations against Donald Trump's campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         "Political sins on both sides, but no crimes,"
        </strong>
        the lifelong Democrat and Harvard law professor emeritus told "Fox &amp; Friends."
        <strong>
         "We need to stop calling each other criminals."
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The criminal lawyer opined that he has yet to see evidence that laws were broken in either the Trump Russia collusion allegations or the more recent revelations that Hillary Clinton bought influence in the DNC when she was a candidate.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Another Clinton scandal, the Uranium One deal
        </strong>
        with Russia when Clinton was secretary of state
        <strong>
         is "very bad, nothing criminal,"
        </strong>
        Dershowitz stated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Once again, fair enough. This seems to be a measured response, and frankly there isn't any
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       of criminality on either side. Strange though, that he understands how shady the situations are, but is still uncomfortable with a criminal investigation.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Today Trump has been in the news citing an interview Dershowitz gave, where he stated that no crime took place, and that collusion isn't a crime anyway.
       <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/20/dershowitz_calls_special_counsel_mueller_good_news_for_trump_hes_going_to_find_no_crime.html">
        Here is the transcript:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm here as a supporter for civil liberties and construing status narrowly as they were written.
        <strong>
         I just don't see a crime here. I see perhaps some political wrongdoing.
        </strong>
        I see leaking information on both sides. But
        <strong>
         even if
        </strong>
        , for example,
        <strong>
         the campaign coordinated, which there is no evidence of
        </strong>
        , but coordinated activities
        <strong>
         with Russia
        </strong>
        . And even if Russia and the campaigns said, gee, wouldn't it be better if Trump were elected?
        <strong>
         That's political wrongdoing, but it's just not a crime.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Nobody can point me to a statute that would be violated.
        </strong>
        And a prosecutor is only allowed to look for evidence of a federal crime. And the reason I think Trump may benefit from this is this will be a secret proceeding. Mueller is a very honorable guy, so he's not going to leak anything. And in the end, he's going to find no crime. Maybe he will issue a report, which in my view would be improper, because he only hear is half of the evidence. Only the prosecutors pointed the evidence. But he will say there is no crime.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So we have a self described liberal who voted for Hillary and supported Obama, who now says that Trump is not guilty of any crimes. The question now is, why?
      </p>
      <p>
       OPTION 1: Deroshowitz is an intellegient man, and a lawyer with decades of years experience. While he supports liberals, he is willing to stick his neck out to support Trump because the president followed the law, and Alan isn't about to let some witch hunt take down an innocent man.
      </p>
      <p>
       OPTION 2: Dershowitz is a sexual predator that owes Trump a favor.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       First, let's take a look at
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein">
        Jeffrey Epstein
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         In March 2005, a woman contacted Palm Beach, Florida police and alleged that her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been taken to Jeffrey Epstein's mansion by an older girl. There she was paid $300 to strip and massage Epstein.
        </strong>
        She had undressed, but left the encounter wearing her underwear.
       </p>
       <p>
        Police started an 11-month undercover investigation of Epstein, followed by a search of his home. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also became involved in the investigation. Subsequently, the
        <strong>
         police alleged that Epstein had paid several escorts to perform sexual acts on him
        </strong>
        . Interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses under oath, a high school transcript, and other
        <strong>
         items
        </strong>
        they
        <strong>
         found in Epstein's trash and home allegedly showed that some of the girls involved were under 18
        </strong>
        . The police search of Epstein's home found large numbers of photos of girls throughout the house, some of whom the police had interviewed in the course of their investigation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The International Business Times reported that papers filed in a 2006 lawsuit alleged that
        <strong>
         Epstein installed concealed cameras in numerous places on his property to record sexual activity with underage girls by prominent people for criminal purposes such as blackmail
        </strong>
        . Epstein allegedly "loaned" girls to powerful people to ingratiate himself with them and also to gain possible blackmail information. In 2015, evidence came to light that one of the powerful men at Epstein's mansion may have been Prince Andrew of the UK.
       </p>
       <p>
        A former employee told the police that Epstein would receive massages three times a day.
        <strong>
         Eventually the FBI received accounts from about 40 girls whose allegations of molestation by Epstein included overlapping details.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The Guardian said, "Despite this, the US government eventually agreed to allow Epstein to plead guilty to just one count of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl under Florida state law. ... Epstein agreed not to contest civil claims brought by the 40 women identified by the FBI, but escaped a prosecution that could have seen him jailed for the rest of his life. ... Prosecutors agreed not to bring far more serious federal charges against Epstein, and not to charge “potential co-conspirators”, including four named individuals."
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         His team of defense lawyers included
        </strong>
        Gerald Lefcourt,
        <strong>
         Alan Dershowitz
        </strong>
        and later Ken Starr.[9] Epstein passed a polygraph test in which he was asked whether he knew of the underage status of the girls.
       </p>
       <p>
        In June 2008, after
        <strong>
         Epstein pleaded guilty to a single state charge of soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14
        </strong>
        , he was sentenced to 18 months in prison.
        <strong>
         He served 13 months
        </strong>
        before being released. At release, he was registered in New York State as a level three (high risk of re-offense) sex offender, a lifelong designation.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         On December 30, 2014, a Florida court filing alleged Alan Dershowitz was one of several prominent figures to have participated in sexual activities with a minor; That filing alleged that Dershowitz had sex on several occasions with an underage girl later identified as Virginia Roberts
        </strong>
        , employed by financier and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.[87] Dershowitz, a personal friend of Epstein, had represented Epstein in his 2008 criminal conviction.

      <p>
       <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/#print">
        First there’s the often quoted quip from Trump:

       <p>
        "
        <strong>

        ,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with.
        <strong>
         It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.
        </strong>

        <strong>

        </strong>
        :
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now, Trump is on the witness list in a Florida court battle over how federal prosecutors handled
        <strong>
         allegations that Epstein, 64, sexually abused more than 40 minor girls, most of them between the ages of 13 and 17
        </strong>
        . The lawsuit questions why
        <strong>

        , former Miami U.S. attorney
        <strong>
         Alexander Acosta
        </strong>
        , whose Senate confirmation hearing began Wednesday morning,
        <strong>
         cut a non-prosecution deal with Epstein a decade ago rather than pursuing a federal indictment
        </strong>
        that Acosta’s staff had advocated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's right: the prosecutor that refused to charge Epstein for raping little girls was appointed to Secretary of Labor, by none other than Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/donald-trump-teenage-rape-accusations-lawsuit-dropped">
        The same Trump that was accused, along with Epstein, of raping a 13 year old girl in 1994.

       .
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       In conclusion:
      </p>
      <p>
       Alan Dershowitz, a liberal lawyer and supporter of Hillary Clintona and Barack Obama, is falling over himself trying to defend Trump on allegations of collusion with Russia. Everything in his character indicates that this is not a fight he's willing to pick, until you realize that Dershowitz and his friends all got off virtually scott free for raping children. Dershowitz and Trump both used Epstein to abuse children; Dershowitz helped to reduce
       <strong>
        40 counts
       </strong>
       of raping kids to just 1, and them Trump turns around and rewards the person who cut that deal as soon as he can. Now Alan is repaying the favor by trying to scratch Trump's back.

       Alan Dershowitz defending the child rapist, Jeffrey Epstein, during his criminal trial in 2008. During this trial, they were able to reduce his charges from 40 counts of child rape to just one, and because of this Epstein served less than 2 years in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prosecutor that refused to bring more charges against Epstein was Alexander Acosta. Alexander Acosta was made Secretary of Labor by Trump. Trump, along with Epstein, were accused of raping a 13 year old girl.

      <p>
       Now, Dershowitz is out in full force defending Trump in the media, stating that there is no evidence of collusion, and that even if there were it isn't a crime.

       Are you disagreeing that Dershowitz is a Neo-Conservatist Zionist? I don't think he would disagree with this assessment. He is other things, but I believe this is his core issue. What does that have to do with Jews?

       Many politicians are social liberals. This does not minimize their support for skewed middle east policy. Dershowitz is a strong critic of Obama's balanced non-confrontational approach to the middle east. This has nothing to do with Jews. It has to do with the US being tangled in a alliance, which does not necessarily advance US geopolitical goals.

       I'm not sure what your point is. The money to ISIS was for a proxy was against Syria. Money to Iran is chump change to which we may never know the reason. Hezbollah and Hamas have about as much geopolitical power as a spittoon. So how much aid was given to Israel? How much of US Middle east policy is built around protection and advancement of Israel?

       Alan Dershowitz is the top zionist watch-dog.  He prides himself on this.  He is perhaps the best example of what a scummy lawyer is, and why the supposed ultimate in higher learning, Harvard, would employ such a RAT as Dershowitz, speaks volumes about that institution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dershowitz defends Trump, because Trump is also a zionist.  As long as Trump bends over at all times for Israel, Dershowitz and his admirers are happy.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dershowitz said he’s got his eye on a different role.
       </p>
       <p>
        “I’m very anxious to be involved in the Israeli peace process,” said Dershowitz, who in March spent about 30 minutes in Trump’s company at Mar-a-Lago, where both men were having dinner separately.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump, Dershowitz said, asked him to convey a message to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel and a Dershowitz friend. Dershowitz did, but declined to detail what he’d told Netanyahu.
       </p>
       <p>
        If I can facilitate a movement toward a two-state solution,” Dershowitz said, “that’s a role I want to play.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yay, the big boy gets to sit at the adult's table for dinner! Too bad he sold his soul for the privilege...

        these are the lengths he's willing to go to in order to keep Trump happy

       :

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dershowitz added that
        <strong>
         his family is no longer proud to be associated with him.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        “I was a source of pride to my kids, my grandkids,” he said. “Now it’s ‘Oy, he’s related to Alan Dershowitz.’ That hurts me a little bit.”
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Yet Dershowitz said he’s “happy with the role I’m playing.”
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        “I think I’ve changed the debate on the subject of obstruction of justice,” he said

       What baffles me is his support for Trump even after the "Nazi Charlottesville Rally" screaming "Jews will not replace us!" was not condemned , but called as 'Good people on both sides' by Trump.

      <p>
       Alan Dershowitz is an egoist who will use / destroy anyone to fulfill his own agenda regardless of values. 
He isn't liberal or conservative, he has no ideology , he's just like Trump , for himself at any cost.

       As any egoist in History, his onpy agenda is to make a name for himself , 
Incase of Dershowitz , it's by getting an upperhand in Israel-Palestine situation &amp; making a name for himself by exploiting the Trump white house's incompetency and vulnerability.
He has the best chance right now with Jared Kusher and others in WhiteHouse who'd bend over backwards to get more $$$.

       He supports Trump because he knows he's innocent.  It's that simple.

       It has nothing to do with Trump's undying support of Israel, their friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, or the fact they've both been accused of sex with minors.  That's just coincidence and fake news.

       He sees the potential outcome of this investigation. Like it or not we have seen no evidence that the Trump administration has done anything illegal. He know that if you continue down this rabbit hole it will undermine the constitution. He is just upholding the rule of law. I kinda commend him for it, he knows there are no merits to the Russia claims.

       Because that’s his opinion as an expert in constitution law. If he has one view and sees the opposite view being pushed so hard by everyone then it wouldn’t be out of the question to think he’d try to get his opinion out as well. Also, it’s not like he’s the only one. There have even been lawyers on CNN saying very similar things; that the president firing the FBI Director isn’t really obstruction of justice.

       VT says that Trump ran a pedo sex ring with epstein to blackmail through his hotels, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weinstein was thrown to the wolves because they wanted to distract from the Epstein pedo ring.

      <p>
       It makes sense this Alan guy is defending Trump sounds like Trump has the goods on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Trump pass the human trafficking asset confiscation? Maybe to strong arm someone like Epstein from coming forward with info? Or to throw people off?

       He hasn't used the EO to confiscate Epstein's assets or anyone elses.

       Many politicians are social liberals. This does not minimize their support for skewed middle east policy. Dershowitz is a strong critic of Obama's balanced non-confrontational approach to the middle east. This has nothing to do with Jews. It has to do with the US being tangled in a alliance, which does not necessarily advance US geopolitical goals.

       As any egoist in History, his onpy agenda is to make a name for himself , 
Incase of Dershowitz , it's by getting an upperhand in Israel-Palestine situation &amp; making a name for himself by exploiting the Trump white house's incompetency and vulnerability.
He has the best chance right now with Jared Kusher and others in WhiteHouse who'd bend over backwards to get more $$$.
