<p>Im actually shocked they waited this long to end his career, im guessing they didnt want to do it to quickly or it would have been more noticeable that this is obviously blackmail.</p>

<p>Its either blackmail, or making your kids disappear (think alex jones, he starts spouting a bunch of bullshit and all of a sudden he gets custody of his kids back), that seem to be the main method of control used by the elite.</p>

<p>Dr. Phil McGraw was a college football player who got his Ph.D. in psychology. He quit his private practice to start Pathways, a self-motivation seminar, as well as a company called Courtroom Sciences. After helping Oprah Winfrey win a lawsuit in 1998, he became a regular on her talk show, before launching his own daytime program, Dr. Phil, in 2002. McGraw has also penned several best-selling self-help books.</p>

<p>Phil McGraw picked up his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of North Texas.</p>

<p>I guess he decided that he could make more money from using his education to teach others publicly, which turned out to be true. As far as education goes, he is fully qualified to speak on the topic of psychology. You don&#39;t need to be a <em>currently</em> licensed and practicing psychologist to host a show as a psychology doctor. He is still a psychology doctor. </p>

<p>A much better argument could be made calling out Bill Nye &quot;the Science Guy.&quot; Notice he doesn&#39;t say &quot;the scientist.&quot; That&#39;s because he only has a bachelors in mechanical engineering and a few &quot;honorary&quot; degrees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anyone is curious what the answer to the question really is, in accordance to occult sex magic knowledge from other sources.  She was likely forced to participate in the murdering of another child while she herself was a child while in the middle of a sexual act.</p>

<p>Thus the answer to what the most traumatic thing that happened to her was, it wasn&#39;t something done directly to her.  It was something she was forced to do to someone else to avoid having it done to her.  </p>

<p>I could conjure up some mental images for everyone but nothing I&#39;m capable of imagining or expressing in words would accurately describe what these people are capable of doing to others physically or mentally.  </p>

<p>Imagine being conditioned like Pavlov&#39;s dog to associate sexual orgasm with the act of taking a human life in the most disgusting satanic ways that can be imagined into existence by the most deranged psychopaths ever shit out of their mother&#39;s wombs. Over and over again until you literally fracture as a person and start to invent new personalities who never had to experience those things, and then one those divergent personalities are identified the same process is repeated again with the innocent personality until yet another divergence occurs and again and again and again until the victims mind is a fractal torture chamber of guilt and pleasure that is layered like an onion.  At some point non-human personalities start to emerge which seems to be the point of this shit.</p>
