    <div class="md"><p>So what&#39;s the evidence this is actually Eric Paddock&#39;s attorney? I have not been able to find any info about a lawyer representing Eric Paddock, at least one that hasn&#39;t been fired by Eric. And no new info about a replacement lawyer since Oct. 22.</p>

<p>It does appear, however, that a Paddock family lawyer is also trying to gain control to administer the estate of the late Stephen Paddock, while also representing one of the victim&#39;s family, which seems to be a conflict of interest. Which may explain this interview, if it&#39;s even a real lawyer and one representing Eric Paddock in the first place. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/17/fate-las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddocks-millions-to-be-decided-in-court.html">source</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Expanding on your comment about previous attorneys hired by E Paddock... this guy sounds like a piece of work as well. Regardless of whether S Paddock actually had anything to do with the shooting (I think he did-- tho not alone), from multiple sources he sounded like a complete asshat. No &quot;I can&#39;t believe it, he was just a nice normal neighbor&quot; for this dude. Hardly anyone could stand him. E Paddock is probably overwhelmed, but he doesn&#39;t seem to want to take any help-- trying to control the situation (many ways like S Paddock). And then there&#39;s B Paddock, accused of possessing child porn. P Paddock seems to have done the right thing-- distancing himself as much as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems odd. Eric is super confused, shocked as to why Stephen Paddock would commit a crime like this. Defending the money Paddock had and how he was good to the entire family. He bought his Mom a walker, etc. Now all the sudden he&#39;s mad at casinos because he was losing money? I understand things like this can be hidden from even closest family members, but it almost seems like Eric is just singing the same song as Lombardo (who contradicted himself multiple times...). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like a counter-narrative if anything. I still have a hard time. Relieving an old guy on Valium with a leg injury did this all by himself.</p>

<p>Not totally discrediting the theory, but I&#39;ve never heard of this guy, he should know better as a lawyer than to release his statement on some minor YouTube channel, and it doesn&#39;t deal with the revelation that we have audio proof of multiple shooters involved. You can&#39;t bump-fire a gun without both hands, you can&#39;t do it with a bipod, and you can&#39;t simultaneously fire another weapon while bump firing, no matter how talented you are.</p>
