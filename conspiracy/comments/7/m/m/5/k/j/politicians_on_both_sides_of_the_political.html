With a salary of $174,000 a year how are they all millionaires. From day one they begin accepting bribes. If you or I was caught taking bribes we would go to jail,but they cleverly enacted legislation to make it a right to accept money from lobbyist. They are suppose to be from the people,for the people,but they are no part of the America I know. They have sold this country to the highest bidder. We are going to eat the fruitage of their greed. Ron Paul says were on the verge of collapsing the way the soviet system collapsed in 1989. We have our elected leaders to thank,who have sold us down the river. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh fuck off, if you think Bernie was put forth as the &quot;token guy beyond reproach&quot; then you either didn&#39;t pay attention to the desperation with which the MSM/Clinton affiliates sought to marginalize and diminish his run. Or maybe you just had a stroke and simply forgot the entirety of the 2016 primary. Or maybe you&#39;re just so politically inept that you took his pragmatic endorsement of Hillary as selling out, or a sign he was &quot;always&quot; on her side, despite the entire preceding year. </p>

<p>Trumplings have been so desperate to join with Hilltards in shitting on Bernie post election. I <em>wonder why</em>.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m the one with ulterior motives for correcting people who erroneously state, as if it has <strong><em>any sort of merit whatsoever based in reality</em></strong>, that Bernie was &quot;put forth&quot; by the same people he was fighting against. Sorry my opinions are actually based in reality, from having seen the desperation with which they silenced his supporters.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like arguing that the RNC &quot;nominated the token guy that&#39;s beyond reproach&quot; with how they handled Ron Paul&#39;s presidential run. Despite the media blackout, despite the coordinated smear campaigns, despite the rules-shenanigans to silence delegates, etc. Fucking retarded.</p>

<p>I absolutely <em>hate</em> Ron Paul and his politics I can still keep my head out of my ass long enough to recognize how- and why- he was treated. If only you people could do the same for Bernie, instead of parroting ridiculously stupid propaganda like &quot;He bought a house! SELLOUT!&quot; -_-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a leftist, (American) antifa sucks because they lack any coherent, discernable ideology aside from &quot;resistance to fascism&quot; which is so broad that it&#39;s essentially meaningless. </p>

<p>However, that being said, if you want actual decentralization of power, you should be looking at some form of libertarian socialism, i.e. anarcho-syndicalism (direct ownership of the workplace by the workers, no state involvement). American libertarianism is essentially anarcho-capitalism, which would just transition power even further to <em>the same people using their ownership of capital to buy politicians in the first place.</em> It&#39;s like thinking you&#39;ll solve feudalism by getting rid of the king even though you&#39;ll still be a shit-shoveling serf under some other lord.</p>

<p>P.s. the word &quot;libertarian&quot; has been used in a socialist context for at <em>least</em> 100 years prior to its modern (American) usage, before anyone tries and fails to look smart by acting like I&#39;m inventing some oxymoronic term. Please read stuff about it before arguing with me and equating it with Marxism/authoritarianism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly anyone who doesn&#39;t support your consensus is a threat. The military &quot;strong man&quot; is and always has been the greatest threat to consensus based anarchy.</p>

<p>So, you better get to work on breeding that out of the human genepool.</p>

<p>So before you enact your anarchy, first you&#39;ll need to become a super strong fascist state that gulags all dissidents and destroys their genetics either through castration, incarceration, or murder. Also, you&#39;ll probably want to reduce the world&#39;s population by about 99%.</p>

<p>Then, you&#39;ll be able to have your perfect society.</p>

<p><strong><em>Anyway</em></strong>, even if your &quot;argument&quot; (really just the insinuation that humans = greedy) had merit, it doesn&#39;t matter because the whole point of libertarian socialism is to structure in society in such a way that it is not possible for individuals to acquire and exert undue power and influence over the rest of us. It could easily be paired with a modern idea like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_politics">Parpolity</a> as well (advocated by Reddit&#39;s own Aaron Swartz before his death) to ensure a democratic structure with actual, meaningful participation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that communism is not the same thing as socialism, but you are wrong in that socialism and capitalism are mutually incompatible. Socialism is characterized by social ownership of the means of production. Capitalism is characterized by private ownership of the means of production. These are mutually exclusive. You&#39;re only right insofar as there are socialist tendencies i.e. Social Democrats and Democratic Socialists who support reform of capitalism rather than its outright abolition (this is why you don&#39;t hear Bernie talking about seizing the means of production). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant that elements of socialism can be implemented in a capitalistic system. I don&#39;t believe that they are mutually exclusive in this way, since one industry could operate under private ownership, while another industry could be purely socialized. For example, universal healthcare can exist in capitalist countries. This is socialism within capitalism.</p>

<p>I agree that socialism taken to its full extent cannot exist within capitalism, though, I apologize for not being clear.</p>

<p>You think you could have learned some basic terminology while living there, then, enough to at least understand that communism and socialism aren&#39;t the same thing, and that socialism and Marxism-Leninism (you know, <em>the ideology of the USSR</em>) are not the same thing.

    <div class="md"><p>Idk here&#39;s Albert Einstein&#39;s take on it (keep in mind he wrote this in <strong><em>1949</em></strong> and things have only gotten worse):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands,</strong> partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. <strong>The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature.</strong> The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. <strong>Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Albert Einstein, <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/">Why Socialism?</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like a compelling argument to me. I see no way to- permanently, and there is a need for permanent reform or else we&#39;ll simply end up back where we are now, see the slow clawing back of reforms the oligarchs won post WWII- solve this problem is either through structuring our democracy in such a way as political organization (parties) and consequent fundraising/influence trading are impossible, or to structure our economic society such that private individuals no longer hold such incredible sway over us that they can pressure the government to just about any end they wish.  Seems to me that the wisest and most equitable choice is <em>both</em>.</p>

<p>And this isn&#39;t even going into the <em>numerous</em> other arguments for socialism, and against capitalism. Such as that all wage labor under the capitalist system is <strong><em>inherently exploitative</em></strong>, because everything has been made private property and the overwhelmingly vast majority of workers have no choice but to engage in labor for another&#39;s profit or starve to death.</p>

<p>This sub likes to go on and on and on about the bankers and debt slavery and shit, but I don&#39;t know what else to call wage labor under capitalism but slavery. If you don&#39;t work for someone else&#39;s profit, you will die on the streets, the end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the thoughtful reply. I do support some things that people refer to (rightfully or wrongfully) as socialistic, such as a UBI, significantly higher tax rates on corporations (although I would be fine with keeping the rates we had in place before tax reform and just eliminating a lot of deductions) and high incomes, and drastically reducing the cost of higher education. </p>

<p>That being said, i still believe the best way for our society to advance is through incentives to work and innovate. Socialism doesn&#39;t provide that.  I also don&#39;t trust that socialist leaders won&#39;t be just as corrupt as our representatives now. We need some way to ensure that everyone shares in the bounty that technology and automation provides. We need fewer workers than ever before but we can produce more than ever before, and I (like you) believe that our current system needs to change so that we don&#39;t just become a society that&#39;s 90% destitute and 10% wealthy. I&#39;m just not sure that socialism is the best way to achieve that.</p>

<p>Just as an aside, when you say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know what else to call wage labor under capitalism but slavery</p>
</blockquote>

<p>many people will ignore everything else and focus on that. It&#39;s your decision to take that position, but I believe that you will end up having a lot of vitriolic arguments about that statement rather than  productive conversations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never be sick /s</p>

<p>But seriously, the best way I&#39;ve heard is to just do as much research as you can before going to the doctor. Obviously you won&#39;t know everything, but if you can go in knowing who makes what and what other options are, it eliminates that sense of no other option. </p>

<p>I want to say there&#39;s a website that shows which doctors or providers get kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies, but I could be mistaken. Something like that would be helpful too, at least you would know if Doctor A recommends Pill X because he&#39;s getting paid by the company or if he just prefers it. </p>

<p>Also, Tylenol/generic painkillers! The amount of times I&#39;ve heard of people who get prescribed oxy or other powerful painkillers when 2 Tylenol will do almost as well. Sure it won&#39;t work for every ailment, but sometimes you don&#39;t need as much pain management as you&#39;re told. My sister is a nurse and she tells stories of people who could take a Tylenol and be relatively pain free, but they take the oxy because the doctor said they&#39;ll need to or they&#39;re just afraid of the pain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your sentiments. And big pharma is my number one most hated thing on the planet. But they have built it up in such a way that you have to admit its going to take generations of aggressive change with people who got into the industry and did not get corrupted somehow.</p>

<p>A mass awakening and determination to change this with people who haven&#39;t yet had to deal with health issues would be a way to at least rattle cages. But, just assuming on personal experience, their is a complete lack of empathy for those who are sick and dealing with big pharma. Im thinking it would end up some stupid Twitter trend for 2 weeks and nothing would really get done. Hashtags can seriously go fuck themselves. I don&#39;t know though, i personally deal with an expensive chronic illness and have volunteered at a children&#39;s cancer ward many times. So I get it. Many just do not get it.

<p>Yet from a purely a human interaction and common sense perspective, for some of the richest, they are so out of touch and dumb if you met them and they said they were the door welcomer at Walmart you&#39;d probably say to yourself &quot;that sounds about right&quot;. </p>

<p>But <em>these</em> are the motherfucking IDIOTS that make the decisions that affect our day to day lives by their stupid fucking opinion on huge issues. For alot of them they are so detached from what&#39;s really going on with the lives of so many &#39;civilians&#39; checking the yes and no box on law&#39;s is as important as ordering a fucking coffee at Dunkin doughnuts.  It&#39;s so easy to see, and mostly everyone agrees these dummies could not give less of a shit about what is truly best to make society a better place and yet they are so incredibly insulated from reprocussions that we all look on with our various opinions of frustration. But confused on what can be done because we really are complacent, me included, on actual action.</p>

<p>It&#39;s getting to a point though with more and more people digging into how fucked this all is it may reach a boiling point. Up till recently.. really with this last election the majority of the population didn&#39;t really know any inner workings of the system. So these dumpster brains went about their lives with little worry of the general public holding them accountable for a job which should be the pinnical of being scrutinized for their actions. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really no wonder shit is so upended right now. The system kind of ran itself while these scumbags, most who assumed did their job, would acutally have a tough time being the operator of a fun house at your local carnival. Incredible really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All it takes is a really good broker. Let’s say you’re a higher up in the GOP or DEM and you’re holding stock in a coal mining company. You get work a few weeks out that your party is going to make a strong push against coal (something you’ve got a financial interest in) so you call up your broker and ask him what to do. He will likely tell you that you have two options: hold your stock and shot sell the shit out of it in the coming weeks, or sell now before the market crashes. </p>

<p>Another example is let’s say you know nothing about investing so you go to a broker. He asks what you do and you tell him so naturally he asks what initiatives your party will be pushing. He then puts your money into those industries. Think about being a higher up in Colorado when the decision was made for the strong push at legalizing marijuana. You could have bought some cheap property, set up a few shops, and literally paid multiple people to run weed shops for you starting from day 1. You could have more money from just a few shops now then you could have ever dreamed. Or you could have had an investing firm seek people out for you to do the very same thing for a crazy ROI.</p>

<p>It literally takes no thought at all, just people around you that can think slightly outside of the box and a list of items that your party is pushing for and against. It’s really that simple and I haven’t even touched the bribery, or back door illegal shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Ron Paul, but that Soviet system collapse of 1989 is a strange analogy, why would a libertarian portray than an end to communism is bad?  Russia seems better off for it.  The US is very different than the USSR was before 1989, if it&#39;s not, then a collapse caused by politicians no longer being allowed to take bribes sounds like a welcome thing and we&#39;ll be better for it.  I like Ron Paul, so I think the articles I&#39;ve read must have taken his comments out of context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m upset about the way politics has become such a failure here  in the United States. The entire political system has been hijacked by corporations. </p>

<p>Our elections feel like a joke. Even our media has been reflecting it for years and years with jokes about corrupt politicians. How can I get behind any of them? I feel like the representative democracy I was taught about when growing up has turned out to be a facade.</p>

<p>I feel disillusioned and lied to. I&#39;m not a Trump supporter. I&#39;m not a Clinton supporter. I can&#39;t honestly say I support any single person in politics in its current state. I wish I could. </p>

<p>I&#39;m constantly being bombarded by republicans and democrats about issues that are really more complicated and complex than one side versus the other. </p>

<p>Money controls the system. Donations to both sides end up with whoever comes out on top being indebted to those who got them in those positions.</p>

<p>I have to be on guard when getting information from any media outlet. Whether it be FOX or CNN.  Almost all of them have a bias, and the way they are obviously structured to make money makes this bias inevitable, at least in my opinion. </p>

<p>A corrupt news media leads to the public being less informed on both sides of the aisle. A representative democracy cannot work without a truly informed public. </p>

<p>The frustration of dealing with the healthy ignorant people can cause many health issues. I&#39;d say consult your doctor but it&#39;s really not recommended because the illness compounds with the more ignorant people you incounter. </p>

<p>Is their such a thing as common sense support groups? Kidding aside that would be hilarious and actually beneficial to have alot of like minds get together and have everyone get a say to let out all the frustrations. And have everyone in the group understand. Are we at that point? Thinking about it, it actually sounds really nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s odd is when I talk to people in real life situations, they seem to agree with me on most points. It&#39;s when I end up in a conversation and they need to know if I&#39;m a democrat or republican when things start going downhill. Those kind of people are flabbergasted when I tell them I don&#39;t support either side.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t support either side, they can&#39;t even grasp where you&#39;re coming from. A Democrat will assume you&#39;re a Trump supporter, and a Republican will assume you&#39;re automatically supporting Hillary. People don&#39;t seem to get that there are other ways of thinking.</p>

<p>I at least tell myself (trying to feign optimistim) that deep down they know how rediculous they are being. This election cycle more then ever has created politics as some fucking status symbol that it&#39;s destroying good discussion. And it&#39;s funny cause instead of acting like a rabid football fan we should ALL be respectfully trying to find out ways to start changing all the shit that has come out. The simple fact I guess so many don&#39;t get is Republican and Democrat, we are all getting fucked hand in hand while we yell at each other and not directing that anger towards the problem people defend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Both sides take bribes and kickbacks and are corrupt as fuck, but it&#39;s always &quot;the other side&quot; who are the bad guys. And they&#39;ve perfectly conditioned most of America to think the same way. &quot;My guy is a millionaire, he&#39;s so smart and works hard. That guy is a millionaire because he&#39;s corrupt and evil&quot;. </p>

<p>We have an elite class who rule over us, and they&#39;ve convinced people to give them money! Trump the billionaire convinced hard working Americans to give him their money so he could be a politician! Hillary the multimillionaire and lifelong politician convinced hard working Americans to give her their money so she could achieve her ultimate dream of being President! Don&#39;t do it! Nothing makes me sadder than to see people willingly giving their money to millionaires who will turn around and screw those people at every turn if it gives the politician an extra dollar. They use hard working Americans as a piggy bank so that they can gain power and prestige. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The company I work for is doubling its work force because we sell to the US and manufacturing is exploding.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, everyone I know bitches about not being able to afford anything because our economy is so flat and our taxes are so high and we are among the most unaffordable places on planet earth (Vancouver).</p>

<p>People like you on reddit are a laughingstock to normal folks in Canada. You finally get a politician that cares for your country and is booming the economy and keeping your borders safe, but you shit all over him because your cable news spins lies all day. </p>

<p>Plain facts like unemployment, GDP, stock market, illegal immigration, consumer confidence, and job creation show how tremendous President Trump is doing, but you&#39;d rather have a liar and cheat like Trudeau that has zero applicable experience?</p>

<p>The lies some people believe are incomprehensible. To actually think Trump is stupid is beyond reason. The breath of experience, knowledge, and success he has is nearly unmatched... from running his 30,000 employee multinational conglomerate corporation, to dominating entertainment, to winning the presidency with all the cards stack against him while spending far less money than his opponent.... It&#39;s just unbelievable the horse slop people on reddit willingly consume in the face of a completely contradictory reality. People have allowed propaganda to completely dehumanize Trump in their eyes. </p>

<p>You have no leg to stand on so you attack people that oppose your corporate engineered opinions. Trump has had one of the best first years of any president to ever live, and all the facts support that.</p>

<p>Again, stock market, GDP, unemployment, black home ownership, illegal immigration, police safety, millions of people receiving bonuses and having their minimum wage raised.</p>

<p>How do all these things happen with an idiot that hates America as president?</p>

<p>Your rhetoric is completely empty, and your arrogance comes from manufactured upvotes and hive mind.</p>
