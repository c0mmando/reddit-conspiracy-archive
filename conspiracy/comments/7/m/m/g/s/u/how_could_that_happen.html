       How could something like the "internet" happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       I had my red pill moment a very long time ago, I was 15 years old and the event that opened my eyes was
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony
       </a>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       From that moment on, I could no longer close my eyes to lies, injustice and manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I wanted to know as much as possible, I had to be sure that I would never be lied to again, I had to understand why this girl, who was the same age as me, lied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Internet was not that widespread yet, 
but I knew from the beginning that it would be a helpful tool to understand the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I understood about the world, the less I understood how it could happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Internet!
      </p>
      <p>
       How could that happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       The powerful, who had gained experience for centuries, possibly even millennia of years,
had drawn a net across the world that is only recognized by a few.
They knew very well that they had to control all the important positions in the world, you can see that if you only look back for 100-200 years, I have no doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how could the powerful not have understood the transformative power, how could they not realize that the Internet would be the end of their power?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just do not understand how it could happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had all the threads in their hands, and did not see it come that information and knowledge would change everything forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what do you think about it, why did the powerful allow us to have internet.
Is this a part of their plan? 
And if so, how can the internet be used against us?
I think that's important

       The ambassador was right, He didn't need to use his daughter to lie or get the senate to provide military support but she was needed to convince the american people that we need to send military support.

       Yes, I know, she was needed to convince people.
And that was the moment that opened my eyes.
I understood what they would do to achieve their goal.
And that is ONLY possible with people who do not have all the information.
So how could they overlook the fact that the Internet would be such a powerful weapon against their lies?

       Cause its not... Bar the occasional leak (which is ignored by many) the internet makes it harder to obtain information. anyone can be anyone and anyone can be a "journalist". No one needs to check sources online and anyone can makeup a source online. Perfect example is the vaccine debate, for every article or medical study that says they help there are 2 more that say they done. Some a reputable and others aren't. With the internet they added bias into the information you gather. You can now choose to disregard and find something that supports your bias. Where though, before you had a singular source of information and if you wanted more you had to talk to people or send in information request to the library of congress or to the FBI.

       The internet allows us to post in forums like this and debate.  We can vet the information for ourselves.   It makes it much more difficult for them to control the narrative.

       Even some sources, like Alex Jones, get it right occasionally.  I mean, facts are facts and the truth is the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a Christian, but I get a lot of good information about Freemasonry, Satanism, Luciferianism, etc. from people who are Christians.  I don't follow the religious beliefs of the source, but they have done a lot of really good research.

       I think that it is through debating that we find the truth.  The internet allows us to do that fast.

       It wasn't the end of their power... but just the beginning. They are now able to divide and conquer. by spreading a bit of misinformation here. and lie or 2 there. Then let people fight over what they believe is right.

       OK, yes, you're right, of course the beginning of the internet was not the end of their power, but I would say it was the beginning of the end of their power.
And I also understand that they feed it with lies here and there, but I believe that there is something like a swarm intelligence in the web, and that we find truth in the middle ground.

       But the thing is the middle ground isn't always the truth. it is just alie we all agree on. In reality if the TPTB don't want something seen it won't be no matter how intrusive of a journalist or how serious of a theorist you are. Thing will be scrubbed. Personally that's why I view everything as a singular theory, "The Theory Of Deception" Everything is a lie, Until proven otherwise.

       I understand what you want to say.
And I agree with you, but I'm not as pessimistic as you are.
I think the truth is out there, but sometimes you have to dig longer and deeper, but at the end of the day it will come to light.
But I have to say this is how I want to see the world, 
if I did not believe that we have a chance to find a truth, what would be the meaning of all that we call life.
At least I have to know that the people around me do not have completely different truths than I have.
That would make life incredibly difficult.

       One of the nine Satanic sins is solipsism.  It is a sin for a Satanist to practice solipsism, but Satanists want others to practice it.  That way, other people are easier to manipulate and control.  Same with stupidity.

       This is a clearer definition of solipsism.  Essentially, one can never know the truth, which seems to be what the poster above is arguing.

       Interesting point of view.
That might actually explain in part why they gave us the Internet.
But then I have to assume that they have underestimated the beast, and the sleeping giant is now partially awakened.
I would say the giant has opened at least one eye, and I do not think he goes back to sleep for the time being.
But who knows that, maybe the TPTB know a lullaby.

       I think you underestimate how much people were ready for computers.
From the moment Pong was available to private customers, only the sky was the limit.
We still had a dial-up phone, but we've dreamed of Skype back then.

       Ok, he was stupid!
I work in a computer exhibition, which is a small part of my job.
But we have storage that weighs 250 kg and is as big as truck brake discs, and they only have 2.5mb storage space.
I think he should have known that 64kb is not enough.
But I could be wrong.

       The internet is a powerful tool for us and them. We can use it to learn and communicate. They can use it to figure who believes what. It would be naive to think the information we put on the internet (particularly social media) doesn’t have the potential to be used to create an ideological profile of sorts, documenting and archiving millions of individual’s political, ideological, and religious beliefs. That information could be used for innumerable purposes. Many of them devious.

       I do not think so!
In Europe, this is already very much limited!
On YouTube for example and quite often on Google!
This is not a problem if you know a way around.
But I do not think it's the last attempt to get the cat back in the bag

       I think it happened too quickly for them to react. They didn't think it would take off so fast because originally it was a pay per minute proposition. The transition from pay per minute to monthly subscription to online transactions happened so fast that from there the message boards popped up before they could react.

       people with that level of power, and more specifically their advisors, do not think in terms of tomorrow, or next year, or 10 years from now.
      </p>
      <p>
       they think in terms of centuries. what we must do to catch up with them is to try to see what the internet enables on a long scale.

       imho that would be... total control of information after initial period of collecting and aggregating

       By creating the illusion of freedom for example.

       Increasing the tools to spy on people (all modern cellphones have a built-in GPS and Google tracks your every movement and records all your voice serches).

       By keeping people numb browsing facebook, watching porn or even chasing their own tail in useless stuff..

       This overestimates the influence and foresight of TPTB - which isn't to say their powers aren't vast but that the possible progressions of human affairs is vaster.

       If you look at any competitive system there are always either internal or external disruptions. Horses are disrupted by automobiles, armored knights are disrupted by gunpowder, dinosaurs are disrupted by meteorites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rapid development and adoption of the internet as we know it, arguably, took everyone by surprise, and all sides could be seen as playing a game of catch-up to figure out how to exploit the new tool as well as how to counter competing exploitations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you look at what's going on now, you'll see methods and measures being employed to control and mitigate the spread of information through the internet, e.g. trolls, shills, spoof, and dis-info.

       It's part of the Antichrist's system that he will rule.  There will be a one world government and currency and he Bible says he will destroy through peace.  He will seem to be a peaceful ecumenical leader who will resurrect after appearing to be killed by an attack.  Ai, VR, the internet of things is all part of that system he will use to control the world.

       Tve internet has given them  more power then they have lost. They now have trackers that give them any information they want on any important person. Thet can target rebel groups. They have taken over entire  industries not only in the usa but across the globe  whether it be movie rental and production  (netflix), communication (google Reddit facebook), retail (amazon), taxi driving (uber).
      </p>
      <p>
       And remember the main thing they want is immortality, upload minds onto computer and such. The spreading the intwrnet makes progress towards these goals go faster.
