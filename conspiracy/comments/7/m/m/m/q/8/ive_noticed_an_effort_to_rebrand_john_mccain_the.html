    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t any proof of fake votes. Both sides cheat in other ways.

    <div class="md"><p>Well OP said that there were 3 million fake votes and that’s why Hillbot won the popular vote. So OP is being very specific. I’m not saying I disagree with you  (aside from bussing people in, show me proof that those people cast votes illegally) but such a specific amount of fraud is crazy considering there’s barely ever been any voter fraud proven. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, I&#39;m not agreeing with the OP on 3 million fraudulent votes. The only &quot;proof&quot; of campaign officials bussing people in is in some of the Veritas videos, but I wouldn&#39;t submit that as official evidence. I&#39;m simply saying it happens more likely than not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why are you saying it happens more often than not? Because republicans tell you that? Veritas is right leaning, so it’s no better than cnn. Trump also donated money to them <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.newsweek.com/trump-donated-project-veritas-organization-tried-trick-washington-post-723888%3Famp%3D1">link. </a> So while you aren’t submitting it as evidence, you are allowing literal government propaganda to sway your beliefs. I’m more than happy to entertain evidence, but every study I’ve read doesn’t come to this conclusion at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I despise the republican party as much as I do the DNC. They are essentially the same on most policy positions. No, not stating it happens in large amounts (assuming this is what you mean by more often than not). I would simply be more surprised if it didn&#39;t happen than if it did. I&#39;m not swayed by Veritas, most of their content is coerced or taken out of context, thats plain to see. Simply stating thats the only place I&#39;ve seen admission to it by campaign workers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Burden of proof is on the one making the claims. Are we just to assume that votes are fake unless proved otherwise? No, we follow the election process to the best of our ability unless evidence of widespread voter fraud becomes known. So, have you seen any evidence of widespread voter fraud? I certainly haven&#39;t, only allegations with no evidence, but maybe one of you can enlighten us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s not what the facts are. People who say that lack of an understanding of statistics and probability. The national polling average was almost exactly dead on in terms of the popular vote. Like within 1%. Several states that were very close and had margins of error (as all polling has) that meant the state was technically up for grabs just all went Trumps way, but within the margin of error. His win was extremely narrow vote wise despite the EC numbers. Something like 70k voters across 3 states determined the outcome. That’s super well within margins of error, and it’s why 538 gave Trump a 3/10 chance of winning. I studied probability and stats as an undergrad and work in master data for my company so I’m not a total novice when it comes to this stuff. It’s frustrating to see Trump supporters get the math wrong repeatedly just to justify their claims that the media is wrong and biased. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, all of Trump’s business dealings are in the US? All of his hotels and manufacturing were moved back here? Because if not, he’s a globalist, not by opinion, but fact. Or are you just into buzzwords and hadn’t heard the term globalist until his campaign? I mean for real, discourse is being pummeled into the ground, made into something worthless because there’s two sets of rules. There’s wild accusations and there’s researched backed up by facts. You’re on one of those sides, but not the one you think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Owning hotels and golf courses in foreign countries is not the same as being a global elitist.</p>

<p>How many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bilderberg_participants#United_States">Bilderberg meetings</a> has he attended? Is his politics nationalism or one-world-government? How many times has he gone to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">Bohemian Grove</a> to make ritual sacrifices to a devil-owl? Has he ever <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-rothschild-gang-shadow-conspiracy-or-rumor-2011-6">financed both sides of a major war</a>? Has he ever <a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/news/527529/george-soros-using-greece-as-a-trojan-horse-against-europe">caused a currency to collapse</a>?</p>

<p>No. He hasn&#39;t. Those the actions of the global elitists. Not merely owning businesses that provide a good or service that people willfully purchase.</p>

<p>I am no fan of Trump. I just wish people would focus on our true enemies. The globalists installed Trump as a distraction. And it is working all to well.</p>

<p>while putting nothing out about Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You clearly don&#39;t understand how wikileaks works. They don&#39;t do the hacking. Hackers do. The hackers have info that they want to get out to the general public and wikileaks publishes it.</p>

<p>Wikileaks can&#39;t engage in some sort of editorial control. For example, if a hacker was able to get Trump&#39;s tax returns and wanted to get it out, they would take it to wikileaks. If wikileaks didn&#39;t publish it, the hacker would just take it to CNN or some other DNC mouthpiece. CNN would salivate at the opportunity to publish it.</p>

<p>Therefore, we can conclude that there is no tax return hack to publish. Or anything of Trump that would be of interest. Otherwise it would be out there. Somewhere.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure, I could buy into the hypothesis that Reddit admins exercise censorship to push a narrative.  But I think there may be an easier explanation.</p>

<p>Have you noticed that in the past 18 months, subreddits have become echo chambers?  A media platform like reddit has a business interest to segment users into nice neat homogeneous groups.  They can get much more in advertising revenue.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they will ever ever ban r/ td.  Do you think Fox News would advertise for Hannity&#39;s show in r/ politics 18 months ago when there use to be some sort of diversity in political beliefs?  Doubtful.  It&#39;s great for reddit to have all of the Trump supporters packaged in their own sub.  They can sell advertising at a premium since that audience is a known demographic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the changing of the algos to slide r/ td off the front page is a result of a study that indicated that most new users were not Trump supporters and those posts were hurting their new user acquisition and engagement.</p>

<p>Reddit is reportedly considering an IPO by 2020. Conde Nast wants to get a return on their investment. They are likely being advised to do everything they can to show maximum growth in users and revenue to achieve the highest valuation in the market.  </p>

<p>Subreddits have ALWAYS been echo chambers. The upvote/downvote system all but guarantees it. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> became Clintontown the second the primaries ended, but before that it was indistinguishable from <a href="/r/sandersforpresident">/r/sandersforpresident</a>. It&#39;s just that you only notice the echo chamber when you&#39;re not in it.</p>

<p>His voting only aligns 82.7% with Trump. He&#39;s mostly trashed because he dosen&#39;t follow party lines as much as other Republican senators.</p>

<p>People are pissed because he votes what he believes is right rather than Yes for Republican legislature and No for Democratic legislature.</p>

<p>Shit happens for bob parties. Joe Manchin, Democrat Senator for West Virgina, also has a weak record of voting party. Democrats always try to primary him with a yes-no man and don&#39;t seem to understand it&#39;s WV, a deep red state. He&#39;s actually voting like he represents his people and the idiots gang up on him.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about party lines these days and voting like a drone.</p>

<p>You clearly don&#39;t understand how wikileaks works. They don&#39;t do the hacking. Hackers do. The hackers have info that they want to get out to the general public and wikileaks publishes it.</p>

<p>Wikileaks can&#39;t engage in some sort of editorial control. For example, if a hacker was able to get Trump&#39;s tax returns and wanted to get it out, they would take it to wikileaks. If wikileaks didn&#39;t publish it, the hacker would just take it to CNN or some other DNC mouthpiece. CNN would salivate at the opportunity to publish it.</p>

<p>Therefore, we can conclude that there is no tax return hack to publish. Or anything of Trump that would be of interest. Otherwise it would be out there. Somewhere.</p>
