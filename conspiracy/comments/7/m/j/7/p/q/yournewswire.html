       I just saw a post on r/all about how the mods decided not to ban yournewswire which is obviously fakenews in every sense of that word. If CNN had grounds on being banned why not the aforementioned?

      <p>
       I missed that post so can someone fill me in what the reasoning was for keeping it?

       Also, it's not censorship if they allow archived cnn posts, it was intended to remove providing them ad revenue.  Whether you agree or disagree with that decision, it didn't have to do with censorship.

       It has to do with a direct threat to doxx someone on reddit.  Fake news or totally credible news, if you are going to threaten the sancity of a reddit user fuck you.  If I see yournews when I am scanning NEW I pass, it is garbage.  CNN is garbage at a totally different level.

       CNN wasn't banned as a source, just had to go thru archives to deny them ad revenue in retribution for them discussing doxxing a reddit user. YNW is kept around cause they didn't write about doxxing redditors.

       Lots of things wrong with that though.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Doxxing" is not an IRL thing. Nowhere do you have an absolute right to privacy. Especially on the Internet. You never did - if you want to air your political opinions in public you usually had to, well, give up your identity. Bedrock of democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of "doxxing" is nothing more than a crutch horrible people on the Internet invented to justify their rights to be the biggest asshole possible online and get away with it... this idea that one's online life should be totally separate from reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's this idea that journalists putting names to people who anonymously hold power on the Internet is "doxxing." I first saw that with the whole violentacrez scandal. A guy who runs borderline illegal porn sites on the Internet, and was routinely awarded and in direct contact with the owners of "the front page of the Internet" is a very newsworty individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing with the guy who made a tweet advocating violence against journalists, which was then endorsed by the most powerful man on the planet: The President of the United States himself. It raised serious questions about the extent of Trump's endorsement of what appeared to be an incredibly racist individual's world views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Journalists have been identifying and holding accountable those who use anonymity to manipulate, harm, and advocate crime for hundreds of years. It's nothing new, yet somehow it's a huge scandal because it involves redditors being held accountable for the tripe they post on the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings us to how unfair it is to deprive CNN of ad revenue while garbage sites like yournewswire thrive in it. let's be real here - this subreddit is a drop in CNN's advertising bucket. It's nothing more than reactionless pandering.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a site like yournewswire, which relies on gullible people to drive click revenue, would fold overnight if this single subreddit were to deprive it of ad revenue. Seems like there's a $$$ issue at play here.

       Eh, this happened back when CNN was acting like the fascist president was silencing the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize that we are talking about a news outlet worth billions that threatened to doxx a Reddit user's identity and still holds that threat in order to control that person's freedom of expression? And you think that is ok?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fair enough. It is also OK for a group of people that thinks that is horribly heavy handed, oppressive and hypocritical to decide that entity betrayed the spirit of the sub and no longer deserves revenue by way of links through this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could just apologize and promise not to threaten doxx again. Instead, they send hundreds of bots to vote brigade to make themselves look even worse. Fuck CNN.

       Once again, you keep saying "doxx" like it carries any weight outside of an Internet forum.

       They found a person advocating violence against journalists, whose views appeared to be endorsed by the President of the United States of America. Clear-cut public interest in determining how much of this guy's extremely racist world views Trump actually agreed with in re-tweeting a photo by that user advocating violence against people he disagrees with.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it became apparent that Trump did not know the person who sent the tweet, the public good in naming the tweeter did not justify the potential harm to the person's reputation. So CNN didn't do it. That's part of journalistic ethics. You keep warping this into some kind of bizarre war on those with certain "political" views when it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do admit the wording on the original article is very confusing for those unfamiliar with journalism and and ethical issues. It was clearly inserted by legal to cover the outlet's ass.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Although mostly irrelevant to the topic at hand, I'll leave you with this thought: if you want to expound your own political views, regardless of what they may be, do you not agree that you must be willing to accept personal responsibility for those views? That person's freedom of expression is not being taken away. CNN didn't kidnap the tweeter guy, hold a gun to his head, and say "if you ever tweet racist shit again we'll blow your head off."

       The guy posted a wrestling meme against a fucking logo. Grow the fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides that, his meme wasn't even the identical meme that the President tweeted.

       So, you think that meme was inciting violence?? And, you think it is ok that any mega-corporation can tell you to shut up about your views or they will doxx you? And hold that threat indefinitely? And, don't you think it is horrifying that a group dependent upon the right to free expression would stoop to that form of strongarming when the freedom of expression hurts their feels??

       This is an outright lie - the GIF is exactly identical. Only difference is the one tweeted added sound.

       He created a meme whose message was endorsed by the most powerful man on the planet. Very real questions about how Trump found it, if Trump and the guy knew each other, how much of the original creator's fucked up views Trump endorsed, etc. Why do I feel like I'm repeating myself?

       Except they didn't hold a gun to that hansolo guy's head and say "we don't like your views so don't spout them again or we'll kill you." HS is free to expunge any political views he wants - albeit he might be forced to admit his IRL identity.

        u/hanassholesolo made a pro Trump GIF that advocated violence against CNN and reveled in Trump retweeting it. He made no effort to obfuscate his identity; any Internet detective could have found his identity. Revealing his name would've been doxxing in the same way that referring to Alice Cooper as Vincent Furnier is doxxing.

       I ask this because I've seen the weasly dishonesty so many times regarding this whole subject.

       The decision was made so that CNN would stop receiving revenue clicks if I remember correctly.

      <p>
       And now we have an archive option that can be used for any post...to allow users to avoid giving any source revenue clicks.

       My thought: This sub's traffic is a drop in the bucket to a Top 100 site like CNN. Advertising revenue lost is minuscule.

       But to sites like yournewswire, which is practically catered to this sub, the site would disappear instantly if deprived by hits from here. Wonder if there's a $$$ issue.

       That was exactly my thought. They stopped revenue to a site for the threat of a doxx, which is fair, but they refuse to do the same when the mod that was making the argument agreed that he thought it was damaging to public discourse. Why would they advise us to downvote instead of policing on their end. It's not censorship, it's cutting out the cancer.

       The argument really is why can't the same be extended to sites whose only goal is click baiting us into traffic with fabricated stories. If a single source is providing a large amount trash, they should fall under the same rule.

       YNW didn't blackmail a kid making a funny political joke gif into stopping making GIFs that showed the president knocking them out in a wrestling match. They treatened a kid with a rabid group of internet psychos and giving up his family's home address, full name, numbers etc. if the kid didn't apologize for making a funny GIF at their expense. That's fucking sick.
