    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       I've been on a little bit of a rant in comments so I figured I would consolidate my recent thoughts into a PSA kind of post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to dox myself so I will not provide any credentials.  What I will tell you is I have been in board rooms of multiple advertising, internet marketing, and media companies.  Including those for political campaigns.  I have seen how the sausage is made.  I am not special, there are many many like me.  It is a huge industry.  I'm not providing anything that isn't already out there - it's somewhat hard to find and to difficult to synthesize the big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't the movies and these people don't sit in dimly lit smoke-filled rooms and openly concoct schemes to influence your actions.  They speak in industry terms like impressions, eCPMs, click-through rates, targeted audiences, segmented demographics, ROI, retargeting, etc.  It's compartmentalized.  Different entities play different roles and no single person really oversees everything from start to finish.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people think of mind control, they think of an MKUltra-like scene with a subject's eyelids taped open, strapped to a chair, watching a barrage of video clips, with heavy industrial music blaring.  Sure, some of that exists in the form of government experiments (MKUltra = proven conspiracy), but it sounds pretty expensive and you have to literally kidnap people.  It's much easier, cheaper, and more effective to run an advertising campaign (i.e. propaganda).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the people in this industry don't think they are doing anything wrong.  And I wouldn't necessarily say they are doing anything wrong - just exercising their free speech.  But everyone needs to understand how this works and how this is evolving.  In the past few years, many many people are being used as pawns in this game unknowingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The components (some entities do a combination of the below - most are compartmentalized):
      </p>
      <p>
       Advertisers:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Companies, political campaigns, interest groups, governments, anyone with motive and means to control your actions
       </li>
       <li>
        Regardless on how you feel about their products/message/etc at the end of the day they are trying to get someone to do something (buy a product, vote a certain way, have a view on a topic).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Creative/Strategy Agencies:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        These are the highly-paid creatively-minded people that develop the content, concepts, outreach strategies, etc that will work to achieve the campaign goals (i.e. mind control) - they sometimes direct all of the components below but most of the time more focused on specific channels (TV, print, internet ads vs. what the PR agencies focus on).
       </li>
       <li>
        This can be a really expensive component for a broad-reach campaign that spans multiple channels (think Mad Men type people - yes, they do exist)
       </li>
       <li>
        This can be relatively cheap for a more narrowly defined campaign (i.e. hire a designer to develop a banner ad for a mobile game)
       </li>
       <li>
        This can be really really cheap (free) when your neighbor creates the content / creative! Successful campaign! (more on this later)
       </li>
       <li>
        Content creation is still the bottle-neck in the process - most everything else is automated and creating campaign creatives that work needs a human touch
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       PR/Social Media Agencies (people and tech):
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        These have rapidly evolved.  In the past, they would respond to feedback in the market or a crisis situation and engage the community with a meticulously crafted lawyer-reviewed PR statement (still do).  Can sometimes look like news - factual, but highly crafted and one-sided.
       </li>
       <li>
        These are now engaging the community real time to drive the narrative and make it look organic
       </li>
       <li>
        These are where the shills live (social media engagement professionals - such a nice term!) - working of a script most of the time
       </li>
       <li>
        These are where the bots live (social media uplift tools - such a nice term!) - used for upvoting/sharing/etc but mostly dumb I/O programs - can be sophisticated
       </li>
       <li>
        Shills are way more expensive than bots - shit-wage hourly payroll
       </li>
       <li>
        Some of these can be good-natured, some are pure scum of the earth
       </li>
       <li>
        A lot of times these are black-boxes - advertisers and creative agencies literally do not know how these firms achieve their goals (proprietary tech!) nor do they want to
       </li>
       <li>
        Sometime your neighbor may be fulfilling this function! For free! Success!
       </li>
       <li>
        Think about what AI could do...
       </li>
       <li>
        Influencers also play a role here (and in media below) - how do you think these twitch/YT personalities make money?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Ad Tech / Big Data:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        You could spend a lifetime trying to catalogue these tools.  There are many that pop up and die all the time.  The big media companies have some of these tools internally that they developed/acquired.
       </li>
       <li>
        There are a ton of different functions these companies preform.  Good luck trying to decipher what they actually do on their website.
       </li>
       <li>
        These players are largely tech driven firms without a lot of human oversight / interaction
       </li>
       <li>
        The relevant ones here for this discussion are the ones that collect different data points about you (web history, netflix viewing, online comments, likes/shares, etc.) to profile you and segment you into a different groups that are relevant to advertisers.  There are also firms that monitor and evaluate campaign reach / effectiveness.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Media Platforms:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        This is the platform to deliver the mind control message - TV, print, radio, facebook, twitter, reddit, etc.
       </li>
       <li>
        A lot of the advertising that is sold by these companies is automated and aggregated/moderated by third parties.  Yes, the full page takeover on ESPN.com is a result of a phone call negotiated campaign but most of digital advertising is bought on an exchange where advertisers just type in a budget and click on some checkboxes for demographic targeting (think zip codes, interests, etc.).  The only people monitoring the advertising content are low-paid interns and bots that just scan for porn/obscene shit.
       </li>
       <li>
        Selling this advertising space and user data is what pays for all of the internet that we enjoy for free.  We are not the customer.
       </li>
       <li>
        Media platforms are also advertisers, can, and absolutely influence their users to achieve their goals.
       </li>
       <li>
        Segmenting and cataloguing users is valuable to media platforms - advertisers pay more to reach specific users with specific interests.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Sharing Economy:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        You know what has been a fantastic development for this ecosystem?  User generated content!  Media platforms don't have to push news or create recreational content.  Users will do it for free!  Users create content en masse and the advertisers pick up what sticks and blast it to relevant audiences that get re-shared!
       </li>
       <li>
        You know what is the high mark for a successful mind control campaign?  Sharing!  Free advertising!
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Regarding politics, all of these firms salivate every four years at the juicy juicy campaign budgets.  What do you think Google's position is on Citizens United?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that you know how the sausage is made and the landscape, I'd like to revisit a handful of topics that come up often on this sub in this context:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) The well-known and not-so-known firms in the 2016 election.  Cambridge Analytica has made the news.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Correct the Record (now retracted back into Media Matters / Shareblue) is a "social media agency" that was literally using low paid wage workers to respond to social media comments off a script.  Easy to spot and highly ineffective since they were mostly reactive and blanketing the internet with scripted responses that every audience saw.  Expensive and doesn't scale.
       </li>
       <li>
        Cambridge Analytica is a UK "big data" firm that enabled the Trump campaign to segment, catalogue, target, and deliver different messages to different groups of people across multiple platforms.  Virtually impossible to spot and extremely effective.  For example delivering "drain the swamp" to the conspiracy minded and delivering "build the wall" to blue collar workers on FB.  Inexpensive and scales immensely.  You just develop single-issue creatives (risky if it doesnt resonate), the rules on what audiences see what creative (with the help of CA), and pump dollars in for internet media buys (free flowing thanks Citizens United).  But who created the content?  Was it the campaign/SuperPACs?  Was it crowdsourced on 4chan?
       </li>
       <li>
        Little known to most, Bernie had an impactful "social media agency" called Revolution Messaging.  They were the ones that coordinated the online grassroots fundraising.  These were still shills but had a proactive, targeted, well-crafted message delivered to hand-picked audiences.  They probably did this pro bono or on contingency.  Otherwise they would be really expensive.  Doesn't scale.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       (2) Collusion and campaign finance
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        As you can see in the landscape above, it's all compartmentalized.  So much plausible deniability at every fucking level.
       </li>
       <li>
        Is it illegal for the DNC to pick up the tab after the RNC to pay for Fusion GPS' hiring of an ex-UK spy?
       </li>
       <li>
        Is it illegal for Russia to get data and analytics from the same UK firm that the Trump campaign did?  Is it illegal for Cambridge Analytica to "independently" help their clients achieve their goals?
       </li>
       <li>
        Should internet political campaigns be regulated in a similar way as TV, print, and radio?
       </li>
       <li>
        Does any politician or group above have a motive to promote campaign finance reform?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       (3) Reddit censorship and echo chambers
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Does Reddit have a business interest to create echo chambers?  Do they give a flying fuck about open discussion or would much rather have similar-minded users neatly packaged into catalogued subreddits?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Would they really ever ban r/T D? - Are raking in the cash from Fox News and the like who advertise to that group?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Do they censor subreddits and discussion if it hurts their bottom line or impairs their advertising goals?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       (4) Q
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        I've curiously followed Q from the beginning and still do.  I find his questions interesting.  Q's legit-ness (straight-legit, GOAT LARP, nefarious) is a polarizing topic and already heavily discussed but it's not relevant.
       </li>
       <li>
        The actual stated goal of Q's questions (as interpreted by those researching / meming) is "To explain the chaos of our times to our loved ones and friends. We have been chosen to spread the word and to ease and assist the transition of our world".
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        If that is the case, this means to literally create advertising content and share it to targeted audiences.  Psy-op.  Mind control.  For better or worse depending on how you feel about Q.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Happy to answer any questions about my experience in the advertising world to a limited extent (without doxing myself or violating NDAs).

       what is the propaganda requirement for dogcrap quality commercials AND THEN playing them over and over? Why is no real person relating to advertising actors, but ads continuously portray a utterly unreal version of "life"?

       If it's a high-budget national campaign, you're just not the target audience.  Someone somewhere thought it would be effective to the target audience watching the show you are watching.  TV is much harder to audience segment than internet.  For the most part, there is a majority demographic profile of the people that watch your show and the region you are in.  Repetitiveness is a function of budget and how frequently they can repeat it until it loses it's effectiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's low budget, it's just that low budget.  Most of the ad space is owned and sold by the network (e.g. CNN) but portions of the ad space are reserved for the provider (e.g. Comcast).  The providers usually sell the ad space to local businesses that produce low-budget and low-quality commercials.  They don't really deal with all of the players I described or put in nearly as much thought into influencing people to buy their stuff.

       If that were true, this Q larper would speak in normal language, and not little parlor trick word games.  I have never gotten the appeal, especially in a conspiracy community.  "He would be in danger!" will no doubt be what the response is, but that is BS.  If the message is so important, anyone would risk all,
       <em>
        and just tell it
       </em>
       , instead of play these psyop games.  I believe this Q stuff is entirely inorganic, it often has the
       <strong>
        very same screen names
       </strong>
       day after day shouting down any opposition, as if it were their job and their favorite hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Has Q dropped"?  "Who knows where I can read about Q?"
       <br/>
       Entirely inorganic, dogwhistle so you won't pay attention to what really matters.

       Personally I just find it entertaining and take it with a grain of salt.  Some of the questions / connections are new to me and interesting.  I'm sure as fuck not going to play the game and "redpill" q-maps to family and friends.  I'm not doing free advertising work.

       I agree with you.  If he is well intentioned and legit then just come out with it and say the shit that needs to be said.  If it would hinder an ongoing investigation then why risk leaving crumbs at all.  If this is all true, then we have a government "cleaning house" in the fucking shadows and everyone is left in the dark about what is really happening.  One shadow govt replacing another.  The cycle will continue until there is real transparency.  Fuck this nanny "the people cant handle it" shit.

       Assuming all of the claims and interpretations are true, the public should be mortified and devastated but I don't think society is going to go into meltdown.  Followed by a period of introspection and growth.  No truth, no growth.  People would let it happen again because they wouldn't believe it could happen if they didn't know that it actually did in the past.

       The President of South Korea was outed as a puppet of a literal cult sorceress last year.  Many many conspirators (including the CEO of Samsung) were outed and jailed.  I'm pretty sure SK is doing just fine and Samsung is still in business employing many people.

       You really think that if all this came out to be true that people are going to stop going to work, pull their kids from school, and take to the streets?  That sounds like a lot of work and people are lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you even assess that if you don't know what the truth actually is and are just relying on interpretive dances with Q's questions?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the biggest problem I have with Q if he is real.  It's just another flavor of the smug ruling-class elitism that he claims to oust.  Once politicians and leaders get the whole truth, they keep it to themselves to maintain power.

       And what is it that really matters? What the media tells you matters? The best thing about Q is that as he says it's up to you to find the meaning of his posts. His clues are just a guide to where we should direct our attention.

       Finally someone else who thinks Q is selling Trump. His promotion of meme magic almost gives him away. Maybe he's a high ranking media guy in the inner circle, imo Scavino.

       My guess is Bannon.  No hard evidence but the timing coincides with his departure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding everything else, I guess it’s nothing new or revealing.  Like I said, nothing that isn’t already out there.  I know a lot here don’t read MSM so I was just trying to be informative and consolidating info from my first hand experiences and observations.

       I feel like it has to be someone who's still allowed on the AF1 and are still allowed access to Trump's tweets. So Bannon left too early for that but it could easily be Scavino or someone close to him.

       tons of money is being made by declaring people mentally incompetent, and forcing them into being dollar signs. Six thousand per month to house a "mentally ill" person is way more than profit from food or other marketable item. Robbery and slavery is the new economy.

       I didn't mention Vets, but that brings up more dollar signs for predators. Much of that info might be private. It does seem that mental health diagnosis is damaging Veterans.
