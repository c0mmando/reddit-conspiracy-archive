       Hicks was also 6’1″ tall. Jones is 5’10”

       This conspiracy is obvious disinfo. A lot of the same people who say this also say that Mark Dice is River Phoenix lol:

       Not only does he look different but he sounds different. I'm not saying he's Bill Hicks, frankly I don't think he is but I do think that this is not the original Alex Jones.

       I see what you're saying. I just respectfully disagree. Watching those videos, all I see is a young Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the transition of young Alex Jones to old Alex Jones is just like a young Alec Baldwin to an old Alec Baldwin. He put on some pounds, his voice got a little raspy,
       <em>
        his head got fat
       </em>
       . These things happen with age. For some a lot more severe than others.

      <p>
       Look at Alex Baldwin in Beetlejuice

      </p>
      <p>
       compared to now:

      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is Donald Trump. Young with a thin face. Old with a fat head.

       I appreciate what you're saying but I have to disagree and say that Baldwin is not a legitimate comparison. You're comparing him 30 years ago in Beetlejuice (1988) to now. The period that I'm referring to is only a few months. Yes people change but not that drastically and not the way Alex Jones did in 1997.

       Sorry, the yearbook photo is a proven forgery. We already know this photo is false because Jones is really too old to have been a high school student in 1990. But it also has anomalies that prove it was photosphopped. Alex Jones’ head is so much larger than the other students he looks like Goliath. Since everyone sits the same distance from the school photographer all their heads should be approximately the same size. So clearly this page is not accurate. Here we see that they photoshopped the page using a ‘curl’ effect – but failed to adjust the warp of the boxes to match. The boxes remain perfectly straight – a clear indication that this is a digital forgery. That makes it certain that this is not a real yearbook – it has been faked. Creating a fake yearbook page is not difficult in this era of digital fakery

       It is not a proven forgery, you just think it's a forgery to fit your belief that jones is hicks. And what about the family photos of jones as a kid? They match the photo in the yearbook since it still looks exactly like him

       Again, Your points do not prove the photo to be a forgery. Show me a video of a photoshop expert (with a neutral stance on the conspiracy) calling it a forgery because I'm certainly not going to trust the analysis of someone with confirmation bias.  You honestly think the public school in rockwall texas is in on this conspiracy too? You don't think investigators have gone to the school to verify that the yearbook is legit? And if it was a fake yearbook, I'm sure it'd be all over the news since the school would have issued a statement calling it fake. There are people who went to rockwall high school who obviously would have come out to say that jones never went there (as famous as he is)

       Your strongest point would have been that Jones isn't old enough, but SloppySniper very clearly addressed that.  As for his largeness, he could be leaning forward unlike the other kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I believe the theory is that Jones was swapped out at some point, meaning there was an actual Alex Jones who was eliminated and replaced with Hicks.  That would mean there would be actual HS photos of the original out there.  It'd be difficult and somewhat pointless to suppress those in favor of a photo-shop job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider the theory unlikely at this point.

       Does any harm come from an individual erroneously believing Alex Jones is actually Bill Hicks? Like, yeah, I'd agree that is wrong, but why do you care if people are wrong about that? We'll never be able to prove he isn't and they'll never be able to prove he is. Why spend such time and effort even trying? If someone looks at the sky and says it's green, why waste your time trying to tell them it's blue? It's not like their stupidity on that one issue affects anything. Alex Jones is still Alex Jones even if he's also Bill Hicks. It doesn't really matter.

       That Ross Elder article didn't debunk anything.

       All it says is that officially Bill Hicks is dead and it shows 4 photos of Alex when he was younger that could have been easily photoshopped. How in the hell is that supposed to be proof? The article mentions but doesn't show proof of the height disparity between Hicks and Jones. It states that Jones's mannerisms are similar to Hicks but that is due to Jones being coached up to act like him. How does that make any sense?

       Nothing is ever debunked with this theory. The conversation usually ends when a very upset person says 'Hicks wouldn't do that' as if they knew anything about the man whatsoever other than his stage performances.
