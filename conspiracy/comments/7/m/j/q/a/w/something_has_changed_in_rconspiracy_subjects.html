       Since pedogate and vatican and kiddie abuse is why I am here, and most of us are, this is a conspiracy fact. So it does not make sense that posts are removed or downvoted like fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have any doubt look at the first few pages of r/conspiracy, and check out old stories that have just popped up. Interesting but not as interesting as what is happening in the political spectrum right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is time to move on from this sub. Shame, had potential but reeks of something stinky and not in a nice way
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: the new system targets posts BUT posts are not the problem, anything is possible in CONSPIRACY no matter how manic the subject matter sounds. The weakest links are the mods, admin, the trolls and the shills that misdirect and delete that is the problem. So with the new submission declaration, how do I know that the post will go through without someone with nefarious agenda not submit the post, no?

       Maybe a deeper conspiracy but I’m inclined to chalk it up to people spending quality time with their friends and families over the holidays.

       I'm super happy with the changes, I think they've already born positive fruit and I expect much more to come. I hope you will consider staying on; this isn't a fight that will be 'won.' Fostering thoughtful discussion between disparate minds is just too threatening; the more effectively you et al do that the more aggressive the counterplay will be.

       Admins may have removed him and not mods but does that mean any posts related to kiddie fiddling and the pope in this sub is subjected to unnecessary and unfair censorship? If that is the case, what is the point of posting in this sub then?

       Mods are compromised. Reddits trying to turn this sub for the 2018 midterms and beyond to 2020. Think about it. This sub and a few others were largely responsible for Clinton losing the 2016 election. Non stop discussion about PG, Clinton and DNC corruption. Reddit cant have that again, especially with its new corporate overlords and shareholders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit going full MSM PR mode. They just cant outright do it blantantly so they do it quietly like they did to politics, news, worldnews etc. The highly brigaded threads about Wikileaks etc in the past couple months were test runs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here shortly the sub will flip. It will be 90% shareblue over running the organic users with their leftist globalist narrative. It will be just like all the other subs.. (politics, topminds, ama,news,worldnews, technology etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark my words, its coming. Reddit is the new Dig and Leftist propaganda outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the mods and thenhuge shift the past few months. Thats the new conspiracy no ones talking about.

       Try a couple thousand. Who do you think circulated the emails via social media? It became so widespread the media could no longer ignore it. Trumpsters litterally meme'd Trump into the Presidency. Otherwise, accirding to CNN. Its illlegal to read wikileaks related news from anyone but them. Haha.

       It's probably organic. I downvote anything with pizzagate in the title. Unless it's something like 'pizzagaters fuck goats,' in which case, full speed ahead. But I upvoted your McMartin preschool post, because while I don't subscribe to those ideas, it was a decent link with a thoughtful submission statement. And I may be many things, but original isn't one of them. So there's a whole pile of alternate me out there same as there's a whole pile of you. Frightening and comforting to contemplate all at once.

       Yeah, I stay away from the pizzagate stuff now. I think it was pushed the way it was for a reason, with a lot of people coming up with crazy theories related to it on purpose, because now anytime child pedophile networks are brought up, some people automatically link it mentally. "Yeah, just like pizzagate. Where Hillary ran a pedophile network from a pizza place. Sure."

       I want to know why have a 20 days old account saying it is time to move on from this sub like you have vested time here. Those of us who have been around for a long time (since 2011) have seen this sub go through many changes and many different coordinated attacks. Your negativity does not help the situation. You say you come for Vatican,an pedogate an such, then make this post which will turn away new comers. How does that help? I may not agree with how the mods have handled things over the past year, but this submission statement thing appears to be good. Now "new" is not clogged up with horseshit stories because redditors from outside the community think it is funny. Mocker is the greatest form of flattery but it is still annoying.

       Posts are not the problem, anything is possible in CONSPIRACY no matter how manic the subject matter sounds. It is the mods, admin, the trolls and the shills that misdirect and delete that is the problem. So with the new submission declaration, how do I know that the post will go through without someone with nefarious agenda not submit the post, no?

       Anything is possible in a conspiracy. An a lot of things have been possible in this conspiracy forum. It is an until we win, always will be an information war.  An the large number of shitposts are the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are really concerned with what is being deleted I believe the site is called ceddit an it allows you to see what has been deleted. As far as the submission statements i dig em, if you share a conspiracy you should have some of your own thoughts on to why you believe it or desire to share it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of nefarious agendas all over reddit, we are no different. Some of the regulators here are on our side and some are not. Infiltrating "subversive" groups has not and will not stop. It is a double edge sword i guess but you have to trust someone in a world where we trust very few. So as of right now I am trusting the mods have this subs best interests in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       An remember, the shills will brigade report shit to their Admin handlers who will come in and remove it without the mods knowledge.

       But it's not always obvious how things fit into the conspiracy world and sometimes it doesn't fit at all, it's just spam and political bullshit and gossip, either way a declaration statement helps.

       Whose shit has been taken down simply for being manic? I've seen several manic posts get put up recently and stay up because they legitimately related to conspiracy. They're trying to cut back on spam and bullshit and so far, the consensus seems to be that it's working.

      <p>
       From what I understand, it's considered spam when a submission comes in via spambot, which would hopefully be evident by said spambot not being able to provide a submission statement. It's political bullshit if the Op submits a mission statement that can't justify it being put up under the banner of conspiracy.

      <p>
       "You trust reddit, a corporate company? Ok ..."

       I don't "trust" reddit, or the mods, or the users, or spambots, or trolls, any more than I have too in order to enjoy browsing the site and engaging in conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you explain how it's any easier for mods to cut legit submissions than before there was the new rule? If you can, cool, I'd honestly like to hear about it. Take your time though, I probably won't even check for a response to this question til morning, honestly it's just not that big a fucking deal commensurate to the time I've spent in this room. Otherwise, relax, go run a couple different searches, read some of the submissions and maybe reassess the conclusion you came to earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, reddit got co-opted, so they say, and I believe those who know better than I and I kinda see it myself. Oh well, that's not news, not a surprise and yet it's still not totally useless to me personally...not yet anyway. Ymmv.

       They do get what you're saying, but what you're saying is rubbish. The new changes simply require more effort to be put into posts. The mods are just trying out the new system. I am sure we will see plenty of "the mods are censoring my posts about xyz " if that starts happening. However, you're acting as if that has already happened.

       I legit can't find any posts that should have stayed but were removed, I think the rule is pretty good tbh. We just saw a thread about the Vatican get a lot of attention, the admins suspended the user for some reason but that's not the fault of this subs mods. Heck there's even a follow up thread asking what happened to that user that's gaining a decent amount of attention.

       The chaos used to be caused, in part, by the mod philosophy that anything goes as long as it didn't doxx or break any laws. Very anti-censorship.

       Then reddit became a safe space and simultaneously this sub got nice set of rules in the side bar. And shitty mods that ban the word shill like some sort of Orwellian overlords. And now every submission has to be approved by them.

       Dude, mods are asking for ppl to declare why there submission should be relevant under the conspiracy umbrella. It reduces spam. It also gives Op a chance to justify why a submission should be here and others a chance to read it, so it can't be taken down as easily, as long as it's legit. If I'm not mistaken, before the new rule went into effect, mods could take stuff down just by saying it didn't relate in any meaningful way to conspiracies. You got your shit backwards.

       Because reddit isn’t a place of free speech and open sharing of ideas.

       Reddit is just another sold out corporation that caters to the highest bidder to push agendas and influence the masses.

       Of course it is controlled and manipulated. You’d be naive to assume it’s a place of free thought and openness.

       You really think so, do you? From my perspecive this subreddit got swamped with new members which all pushed a few selective stories. There was a
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       before the_donald members started massposting and pushign their agenda and a time after.
      </p>
      <p>
       And given that most of the pedogate sentiment uses a rethoric already used in other instances and don't care for the actual problem (reducing the instances where pedophila results in molestation and rape) but only for a vague liberal conspiracy I daresay that you've been played...

       Most of us are not here for pedogate. Most of us joined when this subs content was how alien farts were the actual cause of weather, back when conspiracy was filled with shit about mkultra, 9/11, area 51, and other cool and interesting shit. Vatican abuse isn't a conspiracy theory anymore. Priests are the butt of many jokes, the Vatican's efforts to systemically provide a safe haven to it's members is very well known, and there was an extremely popular and critically acclaimed movie that came out two years ago on the subject called Spotlight that won two Oscars. Pedogate isn't a conspiracy theory anymore. People are damn well aware of the sexual abuse power structure that exists in Hollywood as well as many other areas of several different industries. It's a tired subject, with legitimate cases already being covered by the MSM. If you're conflating that with Pizzagate, then the fact of the matter is that the community is very divisive on Pizzagate because it's a shitty conspiracy built entirely from poorly glued together speculation. Sure, anything is possible in conspiracy, but people harassed people in real life over a very fanatical and implausible theory that actually had no real evidence whatsoever. The shit gets downvoted because it's put this sub at a huge risk for being shut down several different times and people who come here for other reasons don't want that.

       Oh okay so the 350,000 people here before pedo/pizzagate even existed out of the 550,000 people that are subbed now were just people waiting for the news to drop? Right.

       And? Your point? Look at the Reddit metrics? We've gained a little more than 200,000 subs since then, a population that's still a minority on this subreddit and you wanna tell me that 100% of those people subscribed solely because of pgates and other contemporary GOP conspiracy theories? Okay. Don't you have a Ben Shapiro podcast to listen to "only2gendersnot2417?"

       Maybe the best solution is to collectively move to another platform and leave Reddit to fix itself. There are corporate interests involved with Reddit, and it isn't exactly to their financial benefit, nor is it good for business to have disturbing stories about how sick and/or corrupt some powerful people are. It makes it harder to generate revenue from advertising. It seems highly likely (as well as logical) that the aforementioned is what's driving the changes we're all seeing.
      </p>

       Several platforms are in development on darkweb. However, the attack surface has to be reduced across all APIs before they'll be published to the Hidden Wiki. Right now there are too many risks to deploying websites for large amounts of people in the darkweb specifically because the military and intelligence agencies leverage it heavily (and are constantly scraping every last bit they can get at). Implementing a secure social media platform is a huge PITA on darkweb (especially a port of Diaspora). Segmentation and containerization are making it more secure, but it's slow to get it right because of all the details involved. Then there's the security level vs. the user experience (UX). If everything is too complicated, slow, or locked-down; you won't have users. It's a precarious balancing act of priorities.

       I don't understand your concern OP. You talk about mods deleting the post. However the truth is that mods are capable of deleting the post one way or the other, whether the post has a submission statement or not. So the submission statement is incapable of having any effect on a mod's ability to delete the post. What the submission statement does affect, however, is a mod's ability to judge whether or not a post is garbage. So if there is a mod who is inclined to delete a post as a result of its seemingly low value, the submission statement has the effect of better enabling the mod to make a correct decision. What this means is that, on one hand, the submission statement may be a net positive, but on the other hand, if mods desire to delete posts, the submission statement is simply neutral, since they have the ability to delete posts regardless. So when the worst case scenario is neutral, there really isn't any logic that justifies having an argument or having a problem. Just saying man

       I've seen this myself now. I am usually stalking around without posting or commenting, but it seems that things are compromised now and these topics are forbidden.
To me, this is only a proof that the truth have been revealed and it is too visible/correct to be left out uncensored.

       It is a real shame but it happens with every mainstream/trendy/hype mediums/channels we use to communicate. The quality of Reddit is gone long time ago, just as 4chan and many others.
