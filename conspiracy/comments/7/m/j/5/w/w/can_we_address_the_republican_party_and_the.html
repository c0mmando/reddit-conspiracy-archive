        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of world you guys live in, but money and wealth is still the basis of all power in this world. It buys politicians, it buys bots and shills, it buys slaves and sex slaves. It&#39;s literally how the elite operate.</p>

<p>Well then why is it, so many in this sub and the wider conspiracy community, are completely blind to why and how the Republican Party operates? </p>

<p>Basically they operate as the political arm of the elite. They use all kinds of slogans about patriotism and Christianity, but at the end of the day they are the Western Capitalism version of Putin&#39;s Russia: It&#39;s all about concentrating money and power in the hands of a small number of families.</p>

<p>Trump is doing exactly what the NWO wants him to do. Do you really think Trump is powerful enough to go against the Owners of the Republican Party?</p>

<p>Why the blindspot here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, we need to begin to focus on what the people in power are doing.  With that said, it&#39;s both parties really, for instance, the Dems are pushing a bill to subvert state consumer protection laws and allow pay day loans with 300% apr if they do them through national banks.  It&#39;s something you would expect from the repubs, but neither party gives a fuck about us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither party could give a rate ass.  100%.  People need to get multiple parties involved.  Not just Green or Libertarian, but even more parties to the table.  The suppression of past starters can be fought with web awareness and it has been in full swing.  Two are easy to control.  Multiple parties is a different matter.  Wedge issues under multiple parties are far too spread out making them ineffective.  The public needs to believe one thing....  Vote for the greater good, not the necessary evil.  Push that shit.  Doesn&#39;t have to be Green.  Tide is turning folks.  Let&#39;s wash this political shithouse so it works for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If everyone&#39;s life is improving there&#39;s nothing wrong with income inequality. Otherwise you&#39;re just jealous of other people&#39;s wealth.  </p>

<p>Who are you to decide how wealth should be distributed? Does Bill Gates being richer make your life worse? No, it makes it better as he provides goods and services you use and enjoy for cheaper.  </p>

<p>People are wealthy because they engage in voluntary exchanges of goods and services. Never understood the rich people are bad argument. Unless they&#39;re doing something illegal, you&#39;re morally wrong to demand they be less wealthy.  </p>

<p>When those who supply us goods and services get wealthier, we all live better. It&#39;s up to you to become rich, no one is stopping you. You need to provide something others want.</p>

<p>&quot;National Medical Device Registry” section.Page  1006 “to be enacted within 36 months upon passage”
Required RFID implanted chip Sec. 2521, Pg. 1000 – The  government will establish a National Medical Device Registry. What does a  National Medical Device Registry mean?</p>

<p>National Medical Device Registry from H.R. 3200 [Healthcare Bill], pages 1001-1008: (g)(1) The Secretary shall establish a national medical device registry  (in this subsection referred to as the ‘registry’) to facilitate analysis of  postmarket safety and outcomes data on each device that- ”(A) is or has been used in or on a patient; ”(B)and is- ”(i) a class III device; or  ”(ii) a class II device that is implantable, life-supporting, or  life-sustaining.”</p>

<p>Then on page 1004 it describes what the term “data” means in paragraph 1,section B:”(B) In this paragraph, the term ‘data’ refers to  information respecting a device described in paragraph (1), including claims  data, patient survey data, standardized analytic files that allow for the  pooling and analysis of data from disparate data environments, electronic  health records, and any other data deemed appropriate by the  Secretary
“What exactly is a class II device that is implantable?
Approved by the FDA,  a class II implantable device is an “implantable radio frequency transponder  system for patient identification and health information.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TIL There are no rich or elite Democrats, Socialists, Libertarians, Communists... /s</p>

<p>This fails to explain why a Democratic Congressperson can just <strong>take</strong> your airline seat and then blame you.</p>

<p>How naive can one be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is at 58%. So I guess we&#39;re technically allowed, but only quietly.</p>

<p>The GOP seems cartoonishly evil at this point. As bad as the Democrats can be, there is just no comparison. </p>

<p>The GOP attack healthcare, education, and wall st regulation; while being the primary supporters of the war on drugs, tax cuts for the rich, and unquestioning increases to military spending.</p>

<p>About the only thing that does happen then is that they loosen the rules so even more poor can get into the country and grab a piece of the pie the poor are using to survive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From an abrahamic perspective: thou shalt not covet. What is it to you if someone else has more? Earn your own.</p>

<p>New testament perspective: Give to cesar what is cesar&#39;s. Rich men don&#39;t get into a spiritually good place. </p>

<p>Enlightenment: individual liberty is more important than violating individual rights for the greater good. Equal protection for poor AND wealthy. Property ownership rights are sacred. Being subject to or enslaved by state power is bad. Freedom to disagree with masses and retain ones liberty over life and property as the individual sees fit. All institutions should be voluntary in their participation.</p>

<p>Civil war: slavery is bad. Being owned by others is bad. Right to retain property is essential to escaping slavery. People are not property.</p>

<p>Me: focus more on oneself and don&#39;t get carried away with the insecurities of keeping up with the jones&#39; or trying to force others to do anything. What right do we have over others to violate their rights to make them do as we wish? If we invite that mentality, then surely it will be used against us in greater efficiency. The individual is the most persecuted minority and must be defended from the will of the masses.</p>
