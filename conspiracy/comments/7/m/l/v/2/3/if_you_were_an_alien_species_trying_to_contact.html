    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>At one point, Dick claimed to be in a state of enthousiasmos with VALIS, where he was informed his infant son was in danger of perishing from an unnamed malady. Routine checkups on the child had shown no trouble or illness; however, Dick insisted that thorough tests be run to ensure his son&#39;s health. The doctor eventually complied, despite the fact that there were no apparent symptoms. During the examination doctors discovered an inguinal hernia, which would have killed the child if an operation was not quickly performed. His son survived thanks to the operation, which Dick attributed to the &quot;intervention&quot; of VALIS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another event was an episode of supposed xenoglossia. Supposedly, Dick&#39;s wife transcribed the sounds she heard him speak, and discovered that he was speaking Koine Greek—the common Greek dialect during the Hellenistic years (3rd century BC–4th century AD) and direct &quot;father&quot; of today&#39;s modern Greek language—which he had never studied. As Dick was to later discover, Koine Greek was originally used to write the New Testament and the Septuagint. However, this was not the first time Dick had claimed xenoglossia: a decade earlier, Dick insisted he was able to think, speak, and read fluent Koine Greek under the influence of Sandoz LSD-25.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>contact humanity or communicate with humanity about its circumstances?</p>

<p>doing the former is easy.  just do it.  </p>

<p>doing the latter might involve placing the storyline all over the place in media hidden as fiction, coupled with an increase in the ability of people to mass communicate, coupled with a slow and steady increase in the leaks regarding the corruption of the system itself, coupled with an increase in the tools of self-sufficiency.  in other words, teach humans how to remove themselves from their controllers, inch by inch, as if chaining a jits submission together.  </p>
