       It seems to me that the opioid epidemic has been allowed to get to the point its reached for more reasons then just greed by the big pharma. 10 years ago the epidemic was just as bad but was tolerated by the DRs, insurances, cops, DEA and government why though? Also we know that opium production has grown wildly since the Afghan war begin, is afghan opium used in American opiates?

       Salt in excess isn't good for you (all of the food in the US is basically swimming in sodium). For some reason (I'm no doctor) black people are more sensitive to salt. Not sure why pork was mentioned but I assume it has something to do with the saltiness of the meat, idk.

       Avoid canned and boxed foods as much as possible. If you can't, you just gotta read the labels to see which brand is better. I agree though, I eat a low sodium/low sugar diet and it can be hard sometimes.

       I highly doubt this. As someone studying Food Science, a lot of cultures used to salt the shit out of their food in order to preserve it. They would often cook it in a soup to dilute the salt, but a lot of times they ate it straight up salted. You can even see people in South America commonly doing this today with salted beef. We didn't have heart attacks reported until the 18th century, and the practice of heavily salting foods was around for thousands of years. My family back home in Poland used to salt everything. They would eat lard and salt by itself, and this was common in their village and nobody every had heart problems and even weight problems were rare. I find it hard to believe that sodium consumption causes heart attacks. Nobody knows for sure what the biggest cause is, but it looks like oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids rank high, which would make sense since the atrocious amounts of vegetable oils and deep fried foods that we consume means that oxidized PUFAs has increased proportionally to the heart disease epidemic. That and sugar and inactivity.

       Well clearly you haven't gotten to sodium's effects in your Food Science study. Salt and the negative effects (especially black people) is heavily documented. It's not really up for debate.

       No, it is a scientific approach to formulating food for optimal taste, texture, chemical and microbial stability, etc. Food scientists make all the food you see in stores and most restaurants, not chefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been no large scaled randomized controlled trials examining the effects of reduced sodium intake. There exists a lot of controversy over the effects of sodium intake and the science is far from settled. Our kidneys are extremely good at excreting excess sodium from high sodium intake and you are far more likely to experience negative side effects like lethargy from cutting salt then eating it as you normally would.
      </p>
      <p>
       In "Associations of urinary sodium excretion with cardiovascular events in individuals with and without hypertension: a pooled analysis of data from four studies" a study involving 130,000 people from 49 countries, concluded that low-salt diets in people with and without high blood pressure may actually increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and death compared to average salt consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so the science is anything but settled and if anything, on the side of suggesting eating more salt. Once again, excreting excess salt is trivial for our kidneys, especially if we are reasonably well hydrated. It is just not feasible that this is a serious cause of heart attacks. This is yet another blunder by the health community that will end up making you less healthy, especially if you exercise or live in a hot environment.

       Salt doesn't cause high blood pressure. It can negatively effect people with certain dispositions to high sodium, but by and large dietary intake of salt doesn't effect blood pressure or other things.

       There is no evidence to suggest usage would increase. Ending the war on drugs is not more than that.  It wouldn't require a reordering of society. That's totally specious. And I have no interest in whether or not people want to do drugs, drugs can be positive or negative.  I simply wish that people could purchase their drugs off of companies that have liability.

        The rate of new HIV infections in Portugal has fallen precipitously since 2001, the year its law took effect, declining from 1,016 cases to only 56 in 2012. Overdose deaths decreased from 80 the year that decriminalization was enacted to only 16 in 2012. In the US, by comparison, more than 14,000 people died in 2014 from prescription opioid overdoses alone. Portugal's current drug-induced death rate, three per million residents, is more than five times lower than the European Union's average of 17.3, according to EU figures.

       The guy I'm replying to is saying that to think drugs are a problem is wrong and only helps the state suppress them and that the suppression is the problem. Which is wrong. Drugs can be and often are a problem and so is the war on drugs.

       The biggest reason for the opioid crisis is mass overuse of prescription opioids, which I'd argue is part of a legal drug dealing infrastructure. And hey - whether it's Sketchy Bob on the street corner or some marketing exec in a nice office, business owners are going to try to maximize your market share.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But Purdue &amp; Friends lobbied the government, faked research, and bribed doctors!" Yeah, they're trying to make money. Making money with addictive drugs involves deliberately trying to get as many people addicted as possible. That's what happens when you make drugs legal - big corporations are going to go "Oh ho ho, I see an opportunity here!"
      </p>
      <p>
       When people think "legalization," they need to stop thinking of poor old drug dealers going to prison. They need to think of the heroin version of Big Tobacco having the ability to market to hundreds of millions of people.
      </p>

       Legalization got us into this mess.

       You’re being a concern troll who is using slipper slope fallacies to scare people into doubting the veracity of legalization.

      <p>
       In states where marijuana has been legalized, use of other addictive drugs has decreased.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s a fact. Try using them.

       The likelihood of that happening is minuscule. The likelihood of marijuana legalization is far greater, let’s stick to getting that accomplished before we discuss the potential pitfalls of a slippery slope that is unlikely to occur.

       Portugal locks up dealers. Possession is decriminalized (although they still sentence you to rehab). If you're a dealer, you're committing a crime, and you get locked up upon conviction.

       Of course, their prison terms aren't like the US' sentences.

       The only real argument is that what you consume can negatively affect others around you so it isn't just about the person doing the drugs. I'm not sure what the right answer is, but it is something that needs to be taken into account.

       I'm not saying it's common but it is a fact that drugs can and have made people do harmful things to others. By making the assumption that the person is just sitting in his own house not bothering you you make your question irrelevant to my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I don't think someone sitting in their house will cause problems for others. But some people will be pushed by their drug use to harm others and that is the problem. That doesn't mean drugs should outright be illegal but it is something that should be considered in the decision. Prohibition has its own problems.

       You do realize that Fentanyl is the opiate, not the cutting agent?  I guess you could cut it with heroin as most street heroin is pretty well stepped on before you get it.

       When people are dying from fentanyl it’s generally from taxing heroin or oxys which are cut with fentanyl. So it absolutely is a cutting agent. People aren’t generally trying to purchase fentanyl, which is substantially more potent than he aforementioned, thus leading to overdoses

       Which do you think is worse losing everything or dyeing doing something you love? Once you become a addict whos lost everything and admit your a junkie, most of the time you want to die anyways. Im being serious I don't think death is worse then losing everything.

       Or know something about history. Are you familiar with the opium wars and the affect it had on China? Mass opium addiction was a
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       factor in the collapse of China and directly or indirectly responsible for all the woes it faced during the early - mid 20th century. There's a reason the Chinese do not fuck around with drugs. It almost killed them as a nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       China may well have been the asian power to industrialize, not  Japan, but they lost and opium was no small factor.  It was so widespread and devastating you had imperial officials looting coffers earmarked for modernization &amp; development to pay for their drug habits and all the nasty things that go along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It boggles my mind that people who think pharmaceutical companies are basically Satan, essentially want to give them a free hand. Because that's exactly what will happen. If you think they're overprescribed and overused you ain't seen
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not even touching on the security issues. Why bother with expensive social media manipulation and complicated psyops when China, Russia, etc. can just invest in big pharma and destroy society while making a tidy profit. May as well through the elites in there too.

       If they knew anything about history they would see how prohibition of alcohol didn’t work. They would see that they can’t even keep drugs out of prisons. I’m not saying addiction isn’t an issue. I’m saying people should be able to buy drugs safely and it would benefit society if drugs were a taxable product like alcohol. When was the last time you bought a beer that was cut with hard drugs? Never. I’d rather buy drugs from Pfizer than the Sinaloa. At least there’s a degree of quality control and legal recourse.

       Quit making sense and being logical. When it involves drugs people disregard logic and let their emotions get the better of them. Usually weak people that think they have the right to control other's lives.

       I’m not sure if the epidemic was “planned”, however I remember reading that since the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan the production of poppy plants has risen considerably.  Poppy is a huge cash crop considering heroin is made from the plant. There was mention of Sadam Hussein giving subsidies to farmers to grow crops besides poppy plants, because of his religious beliefs and immense dislike for drugs. Once we came in and they had to spend money to fight us the farmers went back to what made them the most money, which was growing the poppy plant. American soldiers could destroy these fields, but then we risk angering the local populations and giving rise to more dislike of western intervention and more fuel for terrorist recruiting. So we let the farmers grow and sell it, and hope to catch the traffickers in later stages of production. However this has proven to be largely ineffective.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the whole Oliver North scandal with the Contras and cocaine, our government has proven it’s capable and willing to sell drugs/allow the sale of drugs in order to fund the armament of rebel groups. The epidemic may not be the direct end game, but more of an acceptable by product of government agents profiting from the black market off-the-books money making scheme that are drug sales

        Oxycodone
       </a>
       on Wikipedia, and it seems that the pills are synthesized from a different plant,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_bracteatum">
        <em>

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebaine">

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe the US allows Afganis to produce poppies to fuel the opiate trade worldwide, but in this case I think it's just a pharmaceutical company that saw their drugs were being abused and did nothing to stop it (that's the real conspiracy).
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2007, Pudue Pharma (the pharmaceutical giant that makes Oxycontin)
       <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/18591525">
        was fined $634.5 million
       </a>
       "for claiming the drug was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications".
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, they just
       <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/oxycontin-class-action-1.4093781">
        settled a class action lawsuit in Canada for $20 million
       </a>
       for "overmarketing" the drug, and that "that they were underreporting the addictiveness of the medication".
      </p>
      <p>
       As if any of this wasn't clear enough, in October of this year
       <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/new-jersey-lawsuit-purdue-pharma-oxycontin-1.4380376">
        the State of New Jersey filed suit
       </a>
       alleging "a "direct link" between the state's opioid crisis and the firm's deceptive marketing practices".
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of these stories, you would think Purdue would take notice, and
       <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-17/purdue-is-said-to-approach-states-in-bid-to-settle-opioid-claims">
        they have:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oxycontin maker
        <strong>
         Purdue Pharma LP is proposing a global settlement in an attempt to end state investigations and lawsuits over the U.S. opioid epidemic
        </strong>
        , according to people familiar with the talks.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Purdue’s lawyers raised the prospect
        </strong>
        with several southern-state attorneys general who haven’t sued the company,
        <strong>
         as they try to gauge interest for a more wide-ranging deal
        </strong>
        , said four people who asked not to be identified because the talks aren’t public.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They know that they're guilty, so they're now trying to get out in front of the inevitable lawsuits that they will face, and ultimately lose. Given that Purdue is publicly traded, a corporation willingly giving out money that should be directed to their shareholders is a company that is trying to mitigate losses from confirmed, deceptive and illegal business practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand the driving force behind all of this, we first have to look at the basic facts:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Opiates can be highly effective in treating pain, but are physically addictive
       </li>
       <li>
        Oxycontin/codone (whatever you want to call it) was designed as an alternative to "dangerous" opiates, as it features a 12 hour time release
       </li>
       <li>
        While this breakthrough was meant to mitigate overdoses and drug dependency, users quickly realized that if they crushed or chewed the tablets they could experience an intense high, given that all of the medicine was readily absorbed at once
       </li>
       <li>
        This 12 hour pill was stronger than it's predecessors, because it was meant to slowly break down while releasing small amounts of opiates over a long time. When taken in crushed form, the intense high rivaled that of other opiates
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Taken on it's face this seems like a good solution to a real problem, with unintended consequences.
       <a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/">
        Think again
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Purdue has known about the problem for decades. Even before OxyContin went on the market, clinical trials showed many patients weren’t getting 12 hours of relief.
          </strong>
          Since the drug’s debut in 1996, the company has been confronted with additional evidence, including complaints from doctors, reports from its own sales reps and independent research.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          <strong>
           The company has held fast to the claim of 12-hour relief, in part to protect its revenue. OxyContin’s market dominance and its high price — up to hundreds of dollars per bottle — hinge on its 12-hour duration
          </strong>
          . Without that, it offers little advantage over less expensive painkillers.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          When many doctors began prescribing OxyContin at shorter intervals in the late 1990s, Purdue executives mobilized hundreds of sales reps to “refocus” physicians on 12-hour dosing. Anything shorter “needs to be nipped in the bud. NOW!!” one manager wrote to her staff.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Purdue tells doctors to prescribe stronger doses, not more frequent ones, when patients complain that OxyContin doesn’t last 12 hours
          </strong>
          . That approach creates risks of its own. Research shows that the more potent the dose of an opioid such as OxyContin, the greater the possibility of overdose and death.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          <strong>
           More than half of long-term OxyContin users are on doses that public health officials consider dangerously high
          </strong>
          , according to an analysis of nationwide prescription data conducted for The Times.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Despite the fact that they knew there were problems with the drug,
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/business/raymond-sackler-dead-of-purdue-pharma.html">
        Purdue still went hard trying to get it to market
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         OxyContin, introduced in 1995
        </strong>
        , was Purdue Pharma’s breakthrough palliative for chronic pain. Under a marketing strategy that Arthur Sackler had pioneered decades earlier,
        <strong>
         the company aggressively pressed doctors to prescribe the drug, wooing them with free trips to pain-management seminars and paid speaking engagements. Sales soared.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To finish it off, in case anyone was wondering
       <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain">
        why
       </a>
       Purdue would engage in such immoral practices:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Within five years of its introduction, OxyContin was generating a billion dollars a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The drug became a blockbuster, and
        <strong>
         has reportedly generated some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue for Purdue.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Money talks, and $35 billion dollars is apparently enough to overlook a drug that kills more people annually
       <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/6/15743986/opioid-epidemic-overdose-deaths-2016">
        than were lost during the entire Vietnam War
       </a>
       . To clarify, more Americans die annually from prescription drug overdoses (65,000) than were lost during the Vietnam War (58,000 US soldiers); this statistic doesn't take into account all of the Vietnamese and Cambodian deaths, for example.

       Problem - reaction - solution to quote a phrase that is commonly used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know where these people get a lot of their strategies and tactics from?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ancient Romans. They used to do the same exact thing - never let a crisis go to waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another good example of a Roman tactic requires a bit more explaining. After conquering a region the native peoples weren't always entirely cooperative. So, one of the techniques the Roman's employed was to flood that particular area with other foreign peoples, essentially diluting the native base and 'removing' the basis of their culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the mass immigrations in Europe from the middle east, the immigrants themselves aren't to blame necessarily, but the circumstances that created this situation can be traced backward and it could essentially be perceived as a parallel to said Roman tactic.

       We're not barbaric? I would like that to be the case.

      <p>
       The common person might care but those in power do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings have not changed for thousands of years. We are the same as we were in 1,000 B.C.. It's why the 'Art of War' collection can still be applied today, it's no different, regardless of guns or spears, the same concepts apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       The day I see the common American realize where the actual power in this country is - despite the secret tech, secret plans, etc - if all Americans stand up one day and say, refuse to pay excess taxes, insist a foreign war stops or insists the corruption in the government stops then I'll agree with 'we're better'.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the primary reasons why the United States is unusual and special is because the common people have the right to do what they ought. As long as these powers that shouldn't be are not afraid of the wrath of the common person then nothing will ever change and we collectively are no better.

       Even with the Syrian migrants places in Europe aren't dilluted no where near enough to have an effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was nothing more than capitalizing on the crisis and ensuring Europe (especially Germany) has the type of uneducated laborers they'll need in the near future after Germans start retiring and there won't be enough to fill the jobs. They'd have an economic crisis.

       the romans made they conquered people in to slaves
      </p>
      <p>
       virtually the whole population of rome was owned by a small number of its wealthy citizens
      </p>
      <p>
       one of the big problems of late western rome was the sheer number of slaves that they wealthy owned and their realization that their personal wealth made them more powerful then empire that they needed to serve
      </p>
      <p>
       it made sense if you where wealthy to simply hire your own armies and make yourself a king instead of serving the empire from which you gained little
      </p>
      <p>
       most romans did not even notice the collapse of rome till the conquests of justinian when he informed people who had been ethnically roman that they where no longer considered part of the empire due to the power of the ostragothic kings in italy

       Yeah good luck finding it nationally anywhere else, asked for some from the hospital as i have several friends who use opioids and i want them to be safe when using, the doctor literally said it will never be handed out and that i should report my friends for using illegal drugs and if they OD they should go to the hospital
      </p>

       Yeah she's on opiates and muscle relaxers. The lyrics was horrid, and it was harder for her to get off it than anything she's ever gone through. There are heroin addicts that claim it's easier to get off heroin than off lyrica. There are a number of amino acids that help w the nerve pain more than lyrica like l-acetyl-carnatine. However she also has psoriatic arthritis on top of that.

       all the medicines for 'recovery' are worse than heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       methadone, suboxone, much much harder to quit. its seriously a trap, because your addicted twice as hard for twice as long of a withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       kratom is the best solution, thats why they are hunting it down now trying to make it illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its still longer withdrawal than heroin, but MUCH MUCH milder with about half the symptoms, and still shorter than suboxone or methadone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Id still be hooked on subs if I didnt switch to kratom and quit from there.

       Same here. Fibromyalgia and RA. Tried Lyrica and all the rest. Either had side effects or they didn't help. Part of the problem is also addictive personalities. I've been battling RA for years, but 3 pain pills a day is my limit. Most days I keep it to two. It doesn't get rid of the pain. It just takes the edge off and makes it easier to function. One of the kids that comes around here works in law enforcement and told our son when he came home for a visit about another friend of there's from high school who is addicted to pain pills. He took in a week what I take in a month.

       And Suboxone. They really benefit from Suboxone used to “treat” opioid addiction because it’s more than a once in a while medication. It’s the new, safer methadone (which I guess is good, but still is just a legal addiction mask).

       The relapse rate for Suboxone is huge and a lot of Junkies hate subs which proves that it is powerful for recovery but only while a addict is taking it. DRs don't want people on subs longer then 15 months so the cycle of active recovery and addiction continues.

       I think it's probably an unintended side effect of all the opium from Afghanistan. They spent a lot of money tearing that country apart to get at their resources, they're just trying to get return on investment by selling all that product. Maybe they see this happening as a benefit for them, but I think the core intent was always profit from selling drugs.

       "It seems to me that the opioid epidemic has been allowed to get to the point its reached for more reasons then just greed by the big pharma. 10 years ago the epidemic was just as bad but was tolerated by the DRs, insurances, cops, DEA and government why though?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it was as widely known how many people were dying and getting addicted 10 years ago and all the groups of people you cited have to prioritize their concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, ppl really like to get high. I think this is often overlooked slightly when discussing conspiracy around the drug trade.  It's not like corruption surrounding a lot of other endevours.  People might smuggle diamonds or guns and a border guard or politician might look the other way, but they are not directly addicted to the product. A lot of people involved in things like I just mentioned may want the pay-off of helping to smuggle guns or diamonds, but don't want to get anywhere near the product and they aren't controlled through addiction. Drugs can do the opposite.

       The United States would not wage an opium war on themselves. Doing so to another country to cripple them, so you can control trade is another thing. What is going on in the US is a byproduct of our economic depression and resulting mental health problems that occur because of it. Outside of the US we may be having a "opium war-lite" but ME opium doesn't even make it to the US, it goes to Russia and EU thru Turkey-&gt;Balkans.

       I have a theory about this... China is sending fentanyl as a perverse drug war against the US. 1) The CIA is responsible for generating American heroin addicts to boost its budget. 2) Fentanyl kills the addict because overdoses are insanely common, especially if it's carfentanyl--a significantly more portent opioid that just about guarantees death, also produced namely by Chinese labs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... if China is spiking the CIA's heroin supply, it's effectively trying to cut off its black ops revenue by killing the addict.

       This is so painfully wrong I had to reply. The US (read: CIA) is
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       waging an opiate war on its own soil. It did so with cocaine by starting cartels in S America to bring it up through bases throughout Central America, and finally into airports like Clinton's Mena airport. This is well documented enough and hell, Gary Webb lost his life reporting it. Come to think of it, part of the reason the US hated Cuba was because they refused to allow their air bases to be used for drug import/export.

       <del>
        bribes
       </del>
       campaign contributions. Opium then comes in through legal pills, and bootleg ones manufactured as vet (animal) meds. Pakistan also ships in the drugs through the ports, stuffed in things like rice, mangoes and soccer balls. It's likely able to clear through diplomatic status, as that can't be screened like normal cargo.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also comes in through the balkans, yes, as the US established many airport bases in places like Kosovo. And look who runs that country: a NATO-selected narco terrorist known not just for drugs, but trafficking in arms, humans, and organs. So yeah, it's not surprising
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       guy is amenable to the US flying drugs in and out. But hey, he's no different than many other drug lords-cum-politician that the US has installed over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the stats, you might see figures claiming that it's Mexico the US goes after when it comes to heroin. This is true... but the DEA only goes after them because they're the CIA's competition. Otherwise, you'll find countless articles detailing the FBI's frustration at multiple stings quashed at the highest level with Turkey drug runners. I forgot to mention their role in bringing in heroin but if you look up Fetullah Gulen's history you'll quickly discern his role in the opiod epidemic in the US.

       One thing that seems to fly over a lot of people's heads, is the fact that opium production and use has spiked ever since the US invaded Afghanistan (the worlds top opium producer). Ironically, opium production there has reached record levels every year following.

       In March of 2001, the Taliban declared opium production to be unislamic and burned all the crops to the ground. The CIA was not happy. Big big money we're talking here.

       And then in September the towers went down, and what a coincidence, it was "all Afghanistans fault."

       I know of the opium wars and there was no conspiracy, it was just elites using force. The people knew who to blame, right now we don't. Pharmacist police abuse of prescription abuse better then doctors do and I feel like pharmacist are more aware of the destruction then the DRs. So whos to blame for this epidemic?

       I can only speak about the situation locally, 10 years ago pills were everywhere and cheap. Then there was some news storys and documentarys and a few pharmacy robberys (one where a few people died). After that police and doctors cracked down on pills. The mistake they made was to also crack down on the medicine used to get off of the pills (like subboxine) They did not have a replacement so a lot of people started using heroine which was very easy to get (rather then come clean with doctors and loved ones). Lots of people, young and old died or ruined there lives and its still happening...all the time. They need to make it cheap and easy to get subboxine before we loose too many more.

       Absolutely not! Trauma affects us
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       . Hence, calling excess a cause of drug abuse is a perfect example of correlation not equalling causation. One could equally say drug addiction is a sign of poverty. Both are true, but it is more that a drug addict is just as likely to come from wealth or poverty; still, neither is a cause.

       Dude. I'm clinically depressed and a drug addict but I have nothing traumatic to blame it on. I've been this way since I was probably 11. My childhood was extremely privileged and most of my introduction to drugs can be accredited to abusing the extra spending money my parents used to give me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our nation's drug epidemic is the result of a need to cope and traumatic experiences some of the time, but excess and the glorification of drug culture are equally guilty where this is concerned. Just because your situation applies to you doesn't mean it's the standard.

       Please understand that trauma does not necessarily mean a specific event taking place in a moment of time. This is crucial to understand when speaking of trauma and addiction. There are fractal factors (reads badly) deeply woven into the general psyche that add to addiction so naming any one cause other than the general umberella of pain. Our society's glorification of excess leads to the chronic programming of always needing "more". Society and that learned constant craving for nothing in and of itself is extremely traumatic. Another example is the fact that in the year 2017, establishments of mental illness diagnoses have soared for an obvious reason of hightened tension and emotional social climate. I am also not speaking from my situation alone but with the credentials of a BA in psychology with an emphasis in mental health counseling as well as quite literally hundreds of hours of personal research.

       I would venture to say that any recent increase in diagnoses of mental illness is probably more related to our society's romanticizing of mental illnesses (specifically anxiety and depression) than some collective rise in social tension. I'm not trying to downplay the importance or severity of some of our current events, but we as people have experienced social turmoil throughout our history, and that probably won't change any time soon; so I don't think that the "rise" you're talking about is something that was obvious or easily predicted based on the factor of romanticizing disabilities, nor do I think it merits use of the word "traumatic." But you're the expert. My only point was that wanting more of something isn't always related to traumatic experiences, some people just try drugs and like them too much. Some people have a genetic predisposition to addiction that others do not. I'm trying, as a drug addict, to convince other addicts that it's not beneficial to focus on the trauma you've endured if you want help or a change in your situation. I think that focusing on yourself as a person instead of on how terrible the human experience is will allow the person to stop trying to justify their drug use, something that nearly every addict does, as I'm sure you're aware.

       I would have passed this post over if I hadn't been working with the middle class for the last three years and seen how they're dusted up to their eyeballs with pills. 
Grandma gives them to the grandkids and the kids distribute to friends. They then have the disposable cash to fund their heroin pill addiction. They're dropping like flies but the deaths and subsequent crimes are under reported by the police to keep property taxes artificially high. Crazy &amp; scary

       I would say that this is partially true, it's the result of the war on drugs, which gives authority figures the ability to disrupt and incarcerate communities and those they deem dangerous. This is supported by those who do not see the degradation and overreach these laws/ideals create. Those who benefit from these laws want more bodies in their private prisons, while the government takes away their right to vote decreasing the chance of reform. Now, those targeted are low to middle class, slowly moving up the socio-economic ladder. If things don't change soon, high class citizens who are vocal about pro-legalization could also be affected to silence a reform movement.

       It's amazing how they are making it harder to get pain medication that can be legally prescribed as well as illegalizing anything natural for pain relief as well. I've been talking Kratom for 4 years, and it truly is a life saver having Fibromyalgia. All things considered it is pretty safe to use. Because of the upcoming ban and media bashing the hell out of it (paid by big pharma) all my relatives think I'm on heroin however they skip past the fact that 1. I've been functioning very well for four years with some improvement even and 2. They themselves all have addictions to either to opiates, weed (not trashing weed at all but for the irony) or alcohol. God bless America.

       I don't know if it's targeted, though i do agree it's more about corporate greed that addictive tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's difficult to say something is targeted. I'd prefer to say that many people looked at the jars of certain decisions, including who would be harmed, and those people concluded that this portion of the population is suited to absorb the punch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sayin it is targeted isn't even as horrible to me as the truth, which is that many people down the line, down to even the local levels did not have a problem with these policies.

       Yes. Its a direct byproduct of the "war in terror" the Taliban had shut down opium production in Afghanistan, fast forward a few years and there's US soldiers guarding the fields! Idk, if that doesn't scream intentional I don't know what does.
The other take could be that the fentanyl-heroin is a way to push addicts to pharma-pills, but I think that's just a good way to make money off of the original setup

       Yes yes and yes a million times over. 2 Yeats sober, 25 year old Anchorage Alaska resident. Watched it sweep over my whole town encompassing everything. Everyone I graduated with who stayed behind got addicted to heroin. We are being targeted and they are letting it through our borders and than acting like they are fighting this drug war.

       This is just the latest in a long line of drug scares. Statistically opiate use hasn't gone you just a different demographic is using it. Ie white middle class 20 something's. Plenty of people are making bank on it though. Rehabs, courts, Suboxone doctors, methodone clinics, private prisons. The list goes on and on

       The opioid epidemic is a by product of almost 2 decades of constant warfare.  Well over 100,000 soldiers injured for life. Many with a lifetime prescription for painkillers. After a while they stop working,or maybe the solider can no longer work,so they sell them. Or trade them for other drugs or whatever. More people get hooked,like I did. Maybe if we truly "supported the troops" after they get home this might not be such a problem.

       I definitely think that lots of Afghan opium is ending up on America's streets in the form of heroin. They did the same shit during the Vietnam War. And it would not at all surprise me if there is some deliberate plan to just let the epidemic grow and grow and thin out the herd, so to speak. What have they got to lose? They make money off of it on both ends (selling it and busting people for using it). The mysterious part of it for us peasants, of course, is how is this being done, exactly, behind the scenes? What kind of illicit framework is in place, from the poppy fields all the way down to American users? Recovering heroin addict here, btw. Got clean finally last January by weaning with methadone.

       I feel like it's marginally less nefarious than crack. What we're seeing with heroin is in large part a byproduct of decades of deregulation of pharmaceutical industries, over prescribing of opioid painkillers and the fact that the US is one of two countries that allows direct to consumer marketing for prescription drugs (New Zealand is the other and they're preparing to ban it).
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there is also no doubt in my mind that the occupation of Afghanistan is contributing to supply in a major way. Actually, I think that's proven fact at this point. I suspect this is more like a happy accident for the ruling class. I don't think they deliberately kicked it off but they sure as shit don't care when poor people get poorer and start dying so they're definitely not going to try to fix it.

       The opium harvested from Afghanistan isn’t used in opiate based Pharmaceuticals .  The opium for most of the worlds pharma is grown in Tasmania Australia under extremely tight security by a private firm that contracts to all the major suppliers of opiate based and synthetic products , the opium scientifically cultivated is much higher grade than what’s on offer in Afghanistan. Fentanyl which is synthetic mainly coming now from China . 
Most of the heroin that’s in the US is now grown in Columbia , Peru and Mexico . 
Afghan heroin is mainly for Russia , Asia and European  markets .

       No, what benefit is there for that to happen? As greedy and inhumane as certain corporations/big pharma/rich people can be, they still need the middle class and even the lower class, to make money off of. Destroying them doesn't do them any favors. Sure when those classes are struggling and down in the dumps they'll take advantage of that and/or look the other way and let it happen, and there have been cases of systematically ruining people for gain (mostly lower class - like you say, with crack), but the opioid epidemic is not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, big pharma/doctors push these drugs, and it helps fuel addiction. And yes, opium production went through the roof since we invaded Afghanistan (and started propping up drug lords, and obviously profiting from them too), but there's plenty of other factors that exist as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest factor no one ever talks about in drug addiction, when they sit there and have their think tanks or group talks about "why is this happening", or "why do people get addicted", what never gets brought up: because drugs are fucking great. Opioids make you feel awesome, and that's extremely dangerous, especially given the side-effects. That awesome feeling is a good escape from mundane or shitty life for most people. So the answer isn't "let's get these people off these drugs", it's "find the root of the problem, and replace that need with something else". Unfortunately for many, and in today's day in age, that something else is usually chemical. Fortunately, in today's day in age, we can find natural and safer ways to give those fixes and good feels. But good luck getting big pharma and their lackeys behind that one.

      </p>
      <p>
       My little bro Michaelangelo was in a car accident. They handed him pain killers like they were candy for way too long and then just cut him off and by then he was addicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a good kid in every way. When he couldn't take the withdrawl or pain he turned to heroin because it was cheap and easy to get. No one saw it coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took him in and had him living with me to try and help get him cleaned up. Then he relapsed and bought some real fucked up shit with fentanyl. He died.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was 21.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't move a single thing in his room for almost a year. His skateboard sat next to the backdoor and I couldn't touch it.

       That's part of what kills me about all of this. We didn't know how many pills he was getting/taking until it was too late. No one thought about it (
       <em>
        huge guilt
       </em>
       ) as he was in pain because the car accident really fucked him up. Then they just cut him off cold. Hell, I probably would have turned to heroin too after some of the stories he told me about how it felt to go through the withdrawal. Those doctors should be in jail.

       I do believe the US allows Afganis to produce poppies to fuel the opiate trade worldwide, but in this case I think it's just a pharmaceutical company that saw their drugs were being abused and did nothing to stop it (that's the real conspiracy).
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2007, Pudue Pharma (the pharmaceutical giant that makes Oxycontin)
       <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/18591525">
        was fined $634.5 million
       </a>
       "for claiming the drug was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications".
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, they just
       <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/oxycontin-class-action-1.4093781">
        settled a class action lawsuit in Canada for $20 million
       </a>
       for "overmarketing" the drug, and that "that they were underreporting the addictiveness of the medication".
      </p>
      <p>
       As if any of this wasn't clear enough, in October of this year
       <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/new-jersey-lawsuit-purdue-pharma-oxycontin-1.4380376">
        the State of New Jersey filed suit
       </a>
       alleging "a "direct link" between the state's opioid crisis and the firm's deceptive marketing practices".
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of these stories, you would think Purdue would take notice, and
       <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-17/purdue-is-said-to-approach-states-in-bid-to-settle-opioid-claims">
        they have:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oxycontin maker
        <strong>
         Purdue Pharma LP is proposing a global settlement in an attempt to end state investigations and lawsuits over the U.S. opioid epidemic
        </strong>
        , according to people familiar with the talks.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Purdue’s lawyers raised the prospect
        </strong>
        with several southern-state attorneys general who haven’t sued the company,
        <strong>
         as they try to gauge interest for a more wide-ranging deal
        </strong>
        , said four people who asked not to be identified because the talks aren’t public.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They know that they're guilty, so they're now trying to get out in front of the inevitable lawsuits that they will face, and ultimately lose. Given that Purdue is publicly traded, a corporation willingly giving out money that should be directed to their shareholders is a company that is trying to mitigate losses from confirmed, deceptive and illegal business practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand the driving force behind all of this, we first have to look at the basic facts:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Opiates can be highly effective in treating pain, but are physically addictive
       </li>
       <li>
        Oxycontin/codone (whatever you want to call it) was designed as an alternative to "dangerous" opiates, as it features a 12 hour time release
       </li>
       <li>
        While this breakthrough was meant to mitigate overdoses and drug dependency, users quickly realized that if they crushed or chewed the tablets they could experience an intense high, given that all of the medicine was readily absorbed at once
       </li>
       <li>
        This 12 hour pill was stronger than it's predecessors, because it was meant to slowly break down while releasing small amounts of opiates over a long time. When taken in crushed form, the intense high rivaled that of other opiates
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Taken on it's face this seems like a good solution to a real problem, with unintended consequences.
       <a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/">
        Think again
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Purdue has known about the problem for decades. Even before OxyContin went on the market, clinical trials showed many patients weren’t getting 12 hours of relief.
          </strong>
          Since the drug’s debut in 1996, the company has been confronted with additional evidence, including complaints from doctors, reports from its own sales reps and independent research.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          <strong>
           The company has held fast to the claim of 12-hour relief, in part to protect its revenue. OxyContin’s market dominance and its high price — up to hundreds of dollars per bottle — hinge on its 12-hour duration
          </strong>
          . Without that, it offers little advantage over less expensive painkillers.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          When many doctors began prescribing OxyContin at shorter intervals in the late 1990s, Purdue executives mobilized hundreds of sales reps to “refocus” physicians on 12-hour dosing. Anything shorter “needs to be nipped in the bud. NOW!!” one manager wrote to her staff.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Purdue tells doctors to prescribe stronger doses, not more frequent ones, when patients complain that OxyContin doesn’t last 12 hours
          </strong>
          . That approach creates risks of its own. Research shows that the more potent the dose of an opioid such as OxyContin, the greater the possibility of overdose and death.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>

         OxyContin, introduced in 1995

        <strong>
         the company aggressively pressed doctors to prescribe the drug, wooing them with free trips to pain-management seminars and paid speaking engagements. Sales soared.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Money talks, and $35 billion dollars is apparently enough to overlook a drug that kills more people annually

       </a>
       . To clarify, more Americans die annually from prescription drug overdoses (65,000) than were lost during the Vietnam War (58,000 US soldiers); this statistic doesn't take into account all of the Vietnamese and Cambodian deaths, for example.

       I graduated high school in 2001 from a small upstate NY school.  When I attended school there the worst narcotic you would find amongst the students was weed.  After I got out of the military in 2008 and returned home, several high school students had overdosed on heroine and a lot more of them were addicted.

       Were they using pharmacy drugs or street drugs? I hope a day comes where a giant civil law suit happens to help people hurt or destroyed by opiates. Staying away from it is smart. But I think the people who try it know what there doing, they just under estimate the power opiates have, I know I did.

       I know in Portland and Seattle Meth and Heroin is being decriminalized because cops know they can't stop addicts and addicts don't pay fines. So now cops are going after kids hoping they pay fines and maybe will stop using drugs before they try meth or heroin.

       I don't know. What I do know, during the 80's-90's there was a big push in healthcare pain management for patients to feel no pain, so alot of people were getting doped up for minor stuff, &amp; the pharma. Reps were telling doctors Oxycontin wasn't addictive.

       It's not natural opiates from poppies that are the issue. It's lab-made opiates coming from Chinese labs that are the main cause of the recent spike in opiate related deaths. China is a problem country in a multitude of ways, luckily their economy will have issues soon ;).

       I'm in the same boat here, seen far too many people die before they were even 25 y/o. Some friends and some family, most just acquaintances through school and family friends but it's hard to even count them all. The worst is the ones that are still alive and have fried their serotonin responders so bad that they feel no emotions anymore, I've seen cousins steal our grandparents rent money for a fix, gun point robberies on me and other family, my closest cousin that I played with every weekend growing up killing a 65 year old man while fleeing the scene of a crime. I could go on and on

       Absolutely not! Trauma affects us

       . Hence, calling excess a cause of drug abuse is a perfect example of correlation not equalling causation. One could equally say drug addiction is a sign of poverty. Both are true, but it is more that a drug addict is just as likely to come from wealth or poverty; still, neither is a cause.

       Which do you think is worse losing everything or dyeing doing something you love? Once you become a addict whos lost everything and admit your a junkie, most of the time you want to die anyways. Im being serious I don't think death is worse then losing everything.

       I know in Portland and Seattle Meth and Heroin is being decriminalized because cops know they can't stop addicts and addicts don't pay fines. So now cops are going after kids hoping they pay fines and maybe will stop using drugs before they try meth or heroin.

       Fair enough. I just hate how it’s such a boogeyman and yet legalization never gets seriously suggested. The only options vocalized are increasing funding to things like customs, first responders, etc

       The guy I'm replying to is saying that to think drugs are a problem is wrong and only helps the state suppress them and that the suppression is the problem. Which is wrong. Drugs can be and often are a problem and so is the war on drugs.

       all the medicines for 'recovery' are worse than heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       methadone, suboxone, much much harder to quit. its seriously a trap, because your addicted twice as hard for twice as long of a withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       kratom is the best solution, thats why they are hunting it down now trying to make it illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its still longer withdrawal than heroin, but MUCH MUCH milder with about half the symptoms, and still shorter than suboxone or methadone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Id still be hooked on subs if I didnt switch to kratom and quit from there.
