       private banks alone are aloud to created money.  not even the government creates its own money  (although it could and should).
these private banks somehow (puppets in government) get governments to borrow the countries money from them  - with interest - and the taxpayers pay it back   ?!?!?!   the money is also created as a debt via loans where it could and should be created as a credit - think building infastructure and paying workers good wages though there are many ways to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       but that will never happen in this financial global crime syndicate monopoly we find ourselves in.   this is one of the root causes of the worlds problems and can be rectified over night by the flick of a pen.   we cannot ever win them while they have control over the creation and distribution of debt.  so i urge some of you to research this more and spread this as much a you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       i wrote this post to see how if i get many downvotes as a test.
remember the other thing they don't want you to know is that if we could all just come together on one issue we could be free by tomorrow...  please everyone respect each others differences and believes   we are all just at different points of the learning curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       we need to focus our energy.... if enough people can hold the same idea at the same time we win.   don't sweat the small stuff.  the big picture is that the world is run by a cabal/mafia and they are farming you and your loved ones for you time money energy wealth and  we have to stop them.
      </p>
      <p>
       thats all you need to really concentrate on for now.   come together peeps unite under a common goal we just need to stop this gang THEN we can find out ALL THE SECRETS....
      </p>

       peace be with you.   :D

       Not really true.  Governments direct the central banks more than you likely realize unless you look into it (look at how changes in central bank policies coincide with new regimes of federal government).  When a central bank purchases bonds it's under government direction and with the implicit knowledge that it will devalue the dollar.  It would be more accurate to say they leverage money out of future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't agree with private central banking, but the logic is fairly obvious.  Politicians who serve for a short amount of years are likely to try to leverage monetary policy to their ends, even if it only helps in the short term, and may even hinder in the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact its essentially the same argument for a parliamentary monarchy.  Long term investment

       value of the currency is tied to the various world currencies pumped into it at historic volumes. Self control dictates that dropping in $ is not your only responsibility. You have to manage a crypto wallet everyday if youre shrewd.

       Regardless of what we call money - "dollars" "euros" "bitcoin" "yen" - it's all worthless, just a number to quantify the value of something and a medium for trade.  Real monetary value is in resources, assets and human skills.  You cannot be rich by accumulating money, money changes, crashes, disappears, what value was there in Bitcoin?  It wasn't gold, it didn't have actual value.  Money is just a trade: trade skills and work for money by an employer or client, trade goods for money, trade money for goods.

       Saying money is just a placeholder is meaningless when you can create as much of that placeholder as you want for yourself to accumulate more REAL things that you haven't actually earned through creation of a real good to be traded in exchange. The problem IS that money is meaningless. Banks use other people's money to create wealth for themselves and also create money out of thin air to create wealth for themselves. It's like being the banker in monopoly and just taking the money when you please. It's a part of the problem.
