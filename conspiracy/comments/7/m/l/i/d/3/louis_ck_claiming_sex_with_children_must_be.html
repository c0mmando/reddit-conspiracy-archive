<p><em>&quot;There&#39;s no life worse for a human than being a caught child molestor. And yet they still do it! which from, you can only really summarize that it must be really good&quot;</em></p>

<p>This took place mid 2015. He copped a bit of flack but in general, people wrote it off as him just being cheeky. A lot of people even applauded his ability to get away with what he said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS: There&#39;s also the allegations of Louis CK jacking off in front of women. This information was known for at least a year before the media blew it up yet nobody considered an issue, it was dismissed as &quot;cheeky old Louis CK&quot;. It&#39;s funny how society doesn&#39;t think things a big deal unless big media tells them to think something is a big deal. </p>

<p>The media will tell you &quot;Don&#39;t trust this politician because he wants to install a communist dictatorship&quot; and people will believe that this politician is the enemy of their nation. Or the media will say &quot;start hating this celebrity now&quot; and all of a sudden the celebrity is now a menace to society. </p>

<p>What he said may have offended you or were tasteless in your opinion. I think that a comedian MUST have the freedom to push boundaries, regardless of the fallout. If you don&#39;t like what&#39;s being said, just dismiss it and move along. A comedy bit is in no way life scarring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course it&#39;s okay to openly support those things.  In fact it&#39;s preferable to allow these ideas to be vocalized, than suppressing these ideas and allowing them to be fetishized by idiots who have no one explaining why these ideas are ignorant and insidious.  Freedom of speech philosophically has nothing to do with American patriotism as a root, but rather with classical liberalism, in the form of John Locke and John Stuart Mill and several others, which was distinctly European, not American. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with your interpretation and I&#39;m not attempting to be argumentative to that regard. Philosophically, I do feel that classic liberalism and its tenets are rooted in political ideology (well, it&#39;s not just that I feel that way, it is that, by definition), and not social mores, and it&#39;s understandable that the two would be conflated. </p>

<p>We are not dealing with the rule of law here, in my opinion, which is why a debate that I was encouraging that we entertained really doesn&#39;t have to specifically do with what we think is right in regard to personal sovereignty, but a matter of discussing the social zeitgeist of the day. </p>

<p>In the case of promoting the flourishing of humanity (which classical liberalism seeks, as much as anything else worth its salt to many), I&#39;m just speaking to the nature of the brotherhood of man, rather than the rights of man, which both has its place, if we are to be principled as it seems that we all are and are all trying to work towards.</p>

<p>First, thanks for responding. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I would support such leveled-headedness and measured responses, as it&#39;s surely and unfortunately lacking, when it should be considered most, in my opinion. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the matter.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I hear ya, man, and no, I don&#39;t feel like your comments came off that way, to be sure. Sorry if my brevity of words had implied that.</p>

<p>To answer the other response of &quot;Is this what you want?&quot; in a principled fashion, as the three of you have shared your principles here (and thanks for the input, btw):</p>

<p>I actively seek to promote more love and less hate, as what appears to be sought here by you and others is sovereign justice (in this case), which again is reasonable. You do you, as and how you do, and that&#39;s okay. Or, to put it another way, I seek more empathy and less indifference. You all surely have no indifference to the principles of sovereignty, in regard to personal freedoms, and empathy for those voices oppressed by the lack of it around you. </p>

<p>Both freedom to speak one&#39;s mind and implied violence to others, especially towards those that are highly susceptible to the will of others (ie, a child), should be regarded with care and empathy, in my opinion, and of course I&#39;m sure you&#39;d agree. And, to be sure, I&#39;m not implicating that anyone, include LCK had intentioned otherwise, as I can&#39;t ultimately presume to know his motivations through any single comedic acting-out. </p>

<p>What I wanted to communicate, in the end, is that, I feel that both place deserves a place where we could allow for supporting it (if you agree with the above), and not one at the expense of the other. In this case, I think Op just deserved a little allowance to show empathy for those that he felt were slighted, as much as Louis CK deserves representation. It&#39;s clear that you feel strongly about personal rights, and even though his post may have implied an attack on that to you (as I could see how you could interpret that, reasonably), Op did a pretty solid job of leaving out his personal opinion about LCK - even if that was implied by the nature of it, as he didn&#39;t choose to attack him with his words, but let what was alleged to be his actions speak for itself for others to consider. </p>

<p>I think, as you would agree, especially in times like these, it would be reasonable to consider allowing for that voice to be represented, also. And sure, there needs to be a balanced approach, I would agree. As with comedy routines where it would be reasonable to not get into a debate about personal values in the middle of his act, I would consider this post Ops act, for which he can have the floor for us to focus on his choice of topics at hand.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting me sharing my voice here and for reading it, much appreciated.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are supposed to be &quot;civil&quot; and a &quot;civilized people&quot; who should be above that kind of nonsense but unfortunately not all are. </p>

<p>Our freedom of speech is our freedom <em>to speak the truth</em> to power or <em>to speak the truth</em> about things as we genuinely know them to be without being repressed or punished by the state which is also responsible for keeping anyone else from trying to repress or punish us for it. </p>

<p>That is the essence of a &quot;Free Society&quot;... one that is based on truth and reality but only insofar as the exercise of the basic freedoms we subsequently enjoy is done in a responsible manner.</p>

<p>Freedom of speech like any other &quot;right&quot; can be abused or mis-used and when it is it tarnishes and degrades the importance and value of that right to speak &quot;freely&quot; i.e. &quot;truthfully&quot; and &quot;honestly&quot; about matters that really are important to us as well as others.</p>

<p>When you have enough people who don&#39;t care about that or think that that&#39;s not important that right and it&#39;s proper exercise simply becomes something of a bad joke. </p>

<p>So yes, we do have to have some civil and civilized limits and limitations if we don&#39;t want to wind up defending the very people who are undermining and devaluing our fundamental rights by openly abusing them.</p>

<p>There are all kinds of &quot;freedoms&quot; not all of which are good like the freedom to be poor and destitute and starve to death in a society that has more than enough resources to prevent that from ever happening to any of it&#39;s members but doesn&#39;t actually give a damn about that. Or to be free to deal with any overwhelming or catastrophic conditions you have no control over and no personal resources to contend with in a society that doesn&#39;t care about that, either. </p>

<p>We make laws and rules not for ourselves but for the few who have no regard for other members of their own society. In fact they have no regard for the society itself or for accepting any sense of responsibility towards it&#39;s proper function.</p>

<p>And yes, every society has a collective right to impose limits and limitations on any right in order to maintain and promote responsible and civilized behavior within that society and to defend the place and importance that has to have for any society to work better than having none at all.</p>

<p>Typical reply from someone who can&#39;t handle an opposing view. If you want a discussion, you can&#39;t tell people they sound stupid. Obviously, it goes without saying that your post is fueled by emotion rather than rational thought. I&#39;m just explaining the joke to you, since you missed it. Anyway, your post isn&#39;t conspiracy related as I don&#39;t see Louis CK advocating pedophilia or even trying to normalize it. You&#39;re upset over a joke that some find tasteless and should probably in another sub.</p>

<p>This is as much humor as crapping on a canvas is painting. Intellectual snobs will pretend to like it (or even convince themselves of it) because it is “subversive”, “the unwashed masses couldn’t possibly understand it”, “therefore I am superior”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. Here&#39;s how I see this. I don&#39;t know his intent but I believe that he was encouraging people to laugh at a sick joke. It&#39;s like hearing a joke about 9/11 and part of the reason you laugh is because it&#39;s a very serious subject and you know you shouldn&#39;t. You want to consider the way &quot;society laughs along at a comedian&quot; but that&#39;s what comedians do. Knock-knock jokes don&#39;t really make it. Do you really think everyone in the audience was thinking about having sex with kids? The reason people do it isn&#39;t because it feels good but because they have mental health issues. So what he&#39;s doing is taking this disturbing subject that makes people feel all sorts of ways, angry, upset, helpless to stop it, and he&#39;s making a joke about it and the joke isn&#39;t that kids get raped but that he is sort of daring you to laugh that someone would say something so sick. Comedy is complicated and I have been offended by comedians too. But I think your interpretation of the situation you&#39;re describing is not the only point of view and I don&#39;t agree with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that you think he was being edgy and forcing people to laugh at taboo subjects is a great way to stick it to the people that rejected you all your life but I don&#39;t think he did it the right way. We&#39;ve all seen other comedians do this properly, with an intelligent punchline/story. </p>

<p>I think he just wanted to get away with saying something fucked up. He wanted to keep pushing the boundaries. But it&#39;s still hypocritical of him to criticize other people for behaving unethically when he himself is an extremely unethical comedian. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really a fan of his and never was but I do like edgy humor. Lately I&#39;ve been watching Norm Mcdonald videos and this is an example of the sort of thing we&#39;re talking about.<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrbZxtuUdsQ"></a><br/>
This is really horrible subject matter and you might not not want to watch but he basically just talks about Albert Fish and makes people laugh uncomfortably. It&#39;s not really fair to use this as an example of his work because he rarely gets this dark but it&#39;s just an example of what I think Louis CK was trying to do.<br/>
If you&#39;re old enough you might remember there was an episode of the Mary Tyler Moore show where she laughs at a funeral and the fact that she&#39;s not supposed to laugh makes her laugh more.<br/>
I can&#39;t really guess his motivation but a lot of comedy today does seem to be about shock tactics and he is sort of in that area.<br/>
I really like Patrice O&#39;neal.<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUcjutVBIpw"></a><br/>
There are a few videos of him on youtube discussing conspiracies. You can hear these other &quot;edgy&quot; comedians, like Opie and Anthony, shutting him down sometimes when he talks about things like 9/11. There is actually a video where he is &quot;vs Louis CK&quot; on these subjects but I haven&#39;t watched it because I just don&#39;t like Louis CK. I do separate his joke from his personal life but that doesn&#39;t really matter. The thing is that I don&#39;t think his point was to normalize child molestation and I do think it&#39;s important for comedians to have free speech. They should be offensive sometimes. You can say a lot of things when you&#39;re making people laugh and I think that some of the comedians like Patrice and Bill Burr do put &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; ideas out there in a way that is a lot easier to accept than Alex Jones. I can&#39;t watch very much of his act and I think it is an act. I&#39;m not mad at Alex Jones. He found a role in the media and he&#39;s playing it. He even says something that I agree with once in a while. But he provides a symbol by being ridiculous so that people that want to believe the official story can just switch to &quot;Oh another Alex Jones theory&quot; when they start hearing something that threatens their view based on what they&#39;ve been told.  </p>

<p>Typical reply from someone who can&#39;t handle an opposing view. If you want a discussion, you can&#39;t tell people they sound stupid. Obviously, it goes without saying that your post is fueled by emotion rather than rational thought. I&#39;m just explaining the joke to you, since you missed it. Anyway, your post isn&#39;t conspiracy related as I don&#39;t see Louis CK advocating pedophilia or even trying to normalize it. You&#39;re upset over a joke that some find tasteless and should probably in another sub.</p>
