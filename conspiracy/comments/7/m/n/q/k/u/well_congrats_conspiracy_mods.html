        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You have officially started the final exodus out of here to other platforms and places. This sub used to be a pretty great stream of free information for all who were willing to do actual research. </p>

<p>Normal people could never interpret the information presented because most people lack critical thinking skills and there are a lifetime of dots to connect. Sure, you had to wade through a lot of garbage here to get to the truth, but that’s what critical thinkers do. That’s part of the exercise. </p>

<p>Then once too much truth leaked, the shills started pouring in from the cess pool corners of reddit like TMOR, trying their best to bury the truth using every single known forum control technique. </p>

<p>We caught shareblue and other corporate shills multiple times completely red handed. Shit a few times shills came out and straight up admitted it. </p>

<p>Then of course mod takeover was necessary. Now the narrative can be completely whitewashed and we will never see posts that the mods don’t agree with. Fuck everything about the idea of this. </p>

<p>Now it’s nothing more than hand picked propaganda like the rest of reddit.  New rules being put in place to filter the truth and make it nearly impossible for people to ever get any truth here. </p>

<p>It’s been a long time coming. This place was really great for a long long time. Too long that’s why “they” needed to take it over. </p>

<p>So... I guess I’ll see all you fellow truth seekers elsewhere. Voat? CBTS? Please help compile a mega list and leave this sub once and for all. </p>

<p>It seems like most comments are about how Trump is taking everyone down and here are the reasons why. Like posting a former State Senator was taken down, but ignoring that the FBI raided his office in early 2016. Or how AG Sessions is at Guantanamo, but it was actually back in July... but it was totally because he was clearing room for people. Or a &quot;timeline of a takedown&quot; which is literally just random events with specious links that end with Eric Schmidt stepping down as Chairman of Google. Or a horrible infographic about &quot;the links between people&quot; which is just a bunch of lines and dotted lines with zero explaination.</p>

<p>This new sub is truly bizarre though. I have so far tagged 60+ accounts and accounting all created on the 19th/20th or later. I get that some would be coming from the chans and twitter, but this is a lot of activity and automatic buy in. Several of the older accounts also seem to be bought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be happy to if I end up finding another vast network to post about. I think I only made it to the front page twice, regarding the jborg007 group. You could also make a post if you really have been collecting and documenting more of their alts and duplicate comments. I think you actually have more of a feel for who are the regulars and what goes on in TMOR. But I would support you and I really think you have projected some allegiances on to me that don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure, though, if I end up making a new effort-post it will be about this new sub. I am currently watching brand new accounts (5 in the last hour) fill up the new queue and also be created in that same time frame to comment on the new accounts&#39; content. I&#39;ve never seen a sub like this while so nascent. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How does this do anything other than make it harder to post or control what is being posted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It makes it harder for spammers to post, yeah.  Now they need to actually include an original statement about why the sub should care about their post instead of just spamming a dozen links per day and never participating in the thread.  And now spam bots are completely neutered because they aren&#39;t able to come up with original/unique statements for each post.  How much harder does adding a couple sentences really make posting for legitimate/honest users?  If you can&#39;t take 30 seconds to explain why you want to post something then why are you posting it at all?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not just let user voting decide what makes it to the front page? Isn’t that the idea behind reddit in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you hadn&#39;t noticed, voting can be and has been manipulated not just on this sub but across all of reddit.  Relying on votes alone was what got us to the place we&#39;ve been this past year or more, where the entire front page was full of political spam and Donald Trump/Hillary tweets etc.  It wasn&#39;t working, something needed to be done and this is one idea we had.  It&#39;s already had a noticeable impact as the amount of spam has been reduced considerably in the last few days and the number of quality self posts has increased.</p>

The submission statement is meant to explain why the <em>link</em> being submitted is relevant, but the only requirement for the statement itself is that it be original and unique from the OP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can any mod delete a post because it breaks the rule, or do you guys hold a vote?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Posts without a statement after 20 minutes are automatically removed, those with a statement stay up.  Is that what you mean?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I can also see the reasoning behind people yelling censorship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasoning behind yelling censorship would be if you were actually seeing censorship.  Everyone I see complaining about the rule is just alluding to the <em>idea of</em> censorship but can&#39;t demonstrate that any has actually occurred as a result of it.  That&#39;s the annoying part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a thought here. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say that it would be a good idea for the rules to be updated with how long the submission statement must be. Otherwise the shills, spammers, trolls...will post one sentence statements (or copy text from the article) and then cry &quot;MODS ARE EVIL!!11&quot; whenever such a statement is removed (then screenshot those examples and post them in provoking threads...etc.)</p>

<p>Making the rule less ambiguous is important imho. Simply because that would make the provocateurs have less substance to latch on to in posts like this.</p>

<p>They are trying to undermine the credibility of the mod team and thus bring down the sub. By showing that the rules are minimally subject to the interpretation of the mods and stand on their own accord (as much as this is is possible), they will have less opportunity to create discord by making the mods out as some kind of evil shills (and having the community trust the mods is quite important, yet people are so easily persuaded at times in the most inane manner).</p>

<hr/>

<p>On a side note....as I&#39;ve started checking in more on this sub from CST (in an effort to help improve the quality of the content and because now self-posts have become more visible, so posting is more rewarding), I&#39;m really starting to appreciate what you guys do here. The constant attacks on you, u/axolotl_peyotl, u/JamesColesPardon.... etc. are absolutely everywhere. I never thought it was this bad, but being a mod on this battleground of a sub really must be draining. </p>

<p>I recommend some kind of meditative practice to help deal with this constant barrage of negativity, simply because pushing it down or repressing it only leads to hyper stress and insanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you check the subreddit rules, the other day I added an amendment saying explicitly that submission statements have to be original and can&#39;t be copy/pasted.  I wrote the same thing in my stickied comment in the linked thread in rule 13 of the sidebar if people were to click that, and if we see people copy/pasting multiple times after being warned we&#39;ll ban them. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is why I don&#39;t think we want a strict limit for length/quality of submission statement.  If the user is an obvious troll we can use our discretion and take action based on that, but as long as the statement is unique and demonstrates some understanding of the subject material and why the sub should care about the post that&#39;s fine with me.  We want the enforcement of the rule to include as little subjectivity as possible, as you said.</p>

<p>It can be draining for sure, especially in the beginning when you don&#39;t know how it works and think you can please everyone.  I&#39;m pretty much used to it by now and I have a very happy and fulfilling life away from reddit so I don&#39;t really let it get to me much anymore.  At the end of the day any negativity here is coming from anonymous internet strangers - not worth getting too upset about.  I do appreciate the kind words though for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HMMM well let&#39;s see,</p>

<p>Before this rule was enacted you would pull up the new queue and see a flood of washingtonpost articles about trump-russia and when you clicked &#39;related discussions&#39; at the top it was a 13k-upvoted post from r/politics, and when you asked what this had to do with conspiracy you&#39;d get an answer &quot;ummm are you serious? the president is about to be impeached??&quot;</p>

<p>And now <em>tumbleweed</em> they&#39;re all gone. This is something that I had been campaigning for for months because it was clear that those articles were being posted to create a political power struggle not because people cared about actual conspiracy. And I love how the counter was &quot;well you don&#39;t criticize thedonald when they post seth rich/pizza gate&quot;. Like are you fucking kidding me? That&#39;s a clear slide tactic because it&#39;s trying to group baseless trump-russia claims with videos and pictures of satanic rituals, child porn, child rape, and a guy who was disinvited from the white house and killed a few days after he did the  dnc leaks</p>

<p>If it were up to reddit they would keep the flood of r/politics users into here and institute mod reform to put in shills and make this another subverted forum. Then you&#39;d get nothing but snopes, cnn, politifact, wapo, nyt and probably some DNC campaigning posts since it would be what the &quot;community&quot; wants</p>

<p>censorship is everywhere.  that&#39;s the terrain, man.  having the expectation that the terrain isn&#39;t the terrain is blindness.  what&#39;s needed is <em>adaptation</em>, if it&#39;s someone else&#39;s platform.  if it&#39;s your platform what&#39;s needed is Good Design.  and at the end of the day, people will abuse things.  so...we&#39;re always in a state of requiring to handle those edge cases.  it isn&#39;t going away.  blaming the mods for failures that both internal and external pressures will create is like blaming snow for existing.  don&#39;t blame the snow - use it to ski.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  Submission statements hinder the community.  Shouldn&#39;t have to explain the submission, link or otherwise.  People now want an easy digestable explanation handed to them in 2  minutes or less.  They don&#39;t want to dig for themselves.  Then instead of reading, they just pick apart everything.  Anyone into conspiracies can read between the lines and doesn&#39;t want or need it spoonfed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a thought here. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say that it would be a good idea for the rules to be updated with how long the submission statement must be. Otherwise the shills, spammers, trolls...will post one sentence statements (or copy text from the article) and then cry &quot;MODS ARE EVIL!!11&quot; whenever such a statement is removed (then screenshot those examples and post them in provoking threads...etc.)</p>

<p>Making the rule less ambiguous is important imho. Simply because that would make the provocateurs have less substance to latch on to in posts like this.</p>

<p>They are trying to undermine the credibility of the mod team and thus bring down the sub. By showing that the rules are minimally subject to the interpretation of the mods and stand on their own accord (as much as this is is possible), they will have less opportunity to create discord by making the mods out as some kind of evil shills (and having the community trust the mods is quite important, yet people are so easily persuaded at times in the most inane manner).</p>

<hr/>

<p>On a side note....as I&#39;ve started checking in more on this sub from CST (in an effort to help improve the quality of the content and because now self-posts have become more visible, so posting is more rewarding), I&#39;m really starting to appreciate what you guys do here. The constant attacks on you, u/axolotl_peyotl, u/JamesColesPardon.... etc. are absolutely everywhere. I never thought it was this bad, but being a mod on this battleground of a sub really must be draining. </p>

<p>I recommend some kind of meditative practice to help deal with this constant barrage of negativity, simply because pushing it down or repressing it only leads to hyper stress and insanity.</p>
