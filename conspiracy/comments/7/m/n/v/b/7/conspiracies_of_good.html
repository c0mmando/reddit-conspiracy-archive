       There are so many negative conspiracy theories proposed and discussed on this sub. The usual conspiracies discussed are ones with evil or amoral methods, usually based in lust for money, power, or to further some religious or political agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm of the belief that there are other conspiracies out there meant to do good. These are conspiracies to take down evil or corrupt regimes, or topple dysfunctional structures through new technology and new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       With so many negative things to think about, I'm trying to find good things to believe in and restore my faith in humanity. Some things that give me hope are renewable energy, cryptocurrencies, the open source community, DIY maker spaces, and even certain subreddits and podcasts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have any conspiracy theories about groups that are trying to do good in the world?

       Maybe in the past, like the early Christians, but they were hardly a conspiracy.

       Do you think it's even possible today in a world of full-spectrum surveillance? Such a group would be infiltrated very early on.

       I discovered a very interesting term recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pronoia - The fear that people are conspiring to help you.
      </p>

       Although i cannot provide you with the examples you want, i though the term was quite fitting.

       I'm begining to think so. They seem to have infiltrated many nefarious organizations. The few traces of evidence i can find of their involvement always seems to be found amongst the debris of a foiled plot.

       Hmmm... Theres one that said extraterrestrials are monitoring Earth and secretly disabling any sort of nuclear devices so that there can never be mutually assured destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       And another one about how all the Nazis that escaped to Argentina actually decided to atone for their ways...so the scientists and their offspring have all been dedicating their time and minds to curing cancer and a wide variety of other diseases which they will one day announce to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I guess the original Illuminati are postulated to be benevolent... so ya get organizations like the Shiner's hospital that use their influence to do good... and perhaps secretly fight the evil global elites without our knowledge.

       I have to say...I really think the whole "New World Order" stuff and the complete control of society in the hands of these government officials is the best thing we can do because if it wasn't for these people, I don't think we would survive. I think we are angry at them becuase we don't understand how complex it is to run a society and the truth is, how they are doing it is probably one of the only and best ways to do it. You can't have actual citizens making decisions, people are too dumb for this.

       You are right and wrong at the same time. IMO, people are not inherently good and we are not the innocent victims of the 1% who would thrive and flourish had they not existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The archetype of Hercules, half-man, half-God, I interpret to be a symbolism of Man. Just like the yin and the yang symbol, we have the capacity for either extremes, good and evil, rational or impulsive. And it takes a great deal of effort and personal responsibility to consciously work on ourselves to balance these two. By acknowledging our dark side(our animalistic tendencies) without being engulfed by them, we can consciously transmute these forces towards the creation and maintenance of a flourishing order.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB are maintaining order in some sense but not only are they doing it nefariously through deception and subversive tactics but only to the level that it benefits the few that are at the top of the pyramid. As I've said, there is a way that we can find a way for everyone to flourish but there we need to learn to love each other more and celebrate our similarities rather than be stuck in our primitive tribal mindsets. The way to do to is by reforming our education systems to create a curriculum that will truly enlighten the masses and guide them towards becoming disciplined and virtuous beings.

       I don't know if I would divided it into good and evil conspiracies but what we have right now is a fight over just how the "new world order," will be governed, with one side
      </p>
      <p>
       Choosing violent oppression of the masses including a lot of lower level enforcement according to keeping groups hating each other and one group actively denying the rival group or organicasion for reasons of race, culture or religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other side is also oppressiveness bu thinks race, cultural and religious differences must be tolerated and accepted  to achieve a more harmonious and less violent system of oppression, a somewhat softer and actually easier to govern version though it doesn't deliver all the resources to the top, only most of them and allows some limited ladder climbing from the  bottom to the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       So some from the divisive organizers consider their system good and the more egalitarian system evil.

       I get what you're saying. I imagine many people taking part in what we would consider conspiracies of evil think they are on the side of good. Religious extremists, for example.

       I would love to see it my man (more than anything) but this chess game has been played for longer than you've been alive and you are watching the end game unfold. Could you imagine rolling over on all that work now? peacefully?  To think the most powerful tool, a tool that has been sought after for centuries will just be handed back to the people is just wishful thinking. A lot of this stuff is disinfo and feel good news to keep good intentioned people from becoming active in the cause/fight. i.e. Don't worry... we got it!  ...ya dig? "white hats" lol

       There are definitions of conspiracy that expand beyond law to general acts of collusion or coordination. Secondly, unlawful doesn't mean immoral per se, and harmful to whom? If an act is harmful only to a corrupt institution, I think it's justified.
