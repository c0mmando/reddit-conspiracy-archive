       My personal Conclusion
CONCLUSION:
      </p>
      <p>
       There were 2 shooters according to the one summery, There were two rounds through the neck and back, One in the window and on  Texas Governor John Connally through his chest and wrist,(logically how is this one bullet being over 1 ½ feet seeted away from JFK) (There was 3 shots 1 missed, 4 limbs / body parts shot( Jfk’s neck, throat, and Texas Govnor chest and wrist) ) Also there is Skeptics wondering if the Warren Commission Was Paid Off.

       Only Dallas Police and Secret Service Knew the Route.

To further substantiate this, POTITO said there was a bullet hole in the wind shield of the President’s car”

       What the hell..... every time I try and click on the link about the CIA having assets in the media my Reddit app crashes. And when I tried to open the page in Safari it also crashed..... both times right when I got to page 17.
