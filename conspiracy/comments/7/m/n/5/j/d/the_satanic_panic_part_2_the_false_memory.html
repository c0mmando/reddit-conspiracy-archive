        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The False Memory Syndrome Foundation was founded in 1992, in the middle of the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; that was sweeping the U.S. &quot;False Memory Syndrome&quot; became a common diagnosis for many children during that time who alleged that they were the victims of ritual abuse, and psychologists and therapists were sued, many lost their licenses, for being accused of implanting &quot;false memories&quot; in these children. Let&#39;s take a look at the False Memory Syndrome Foundation.</p>

<p>&quot;The False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1992[1] by Pamela and Peter Freyd, after their adult daughter Professor Jennifer Freyd accused Peter Freyd of sexual abuse when she was a child.[2] The FMSF describes its purpose as the examination of the concept of false memory syndrome and recovered memory therapy and advocacy on behalf of individuals believed to be falsely accused of child sexual abuse[3] with a focus on preventing future incidents, helping individuals and reconciling families affected by FMS, publicizing information about FMS, sponsoring research on it and attempting to discover methods to distinguish a true or false allegation of abuse.[4] This initial group was composed of academics and professionals and the organization sought out researchers in the fields of memory and clinical practice to form its advisory board. The goal of the FMSF expanded to become more than an advocacy organization, also attempting to address the issues of memory that seemed to have caused the behavioral changes in their now-adult children.[5]&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Memory_Syndrome_Foundation">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Memory_Syndrome_Foundation</a></p>

<p>And here are the original founding board members:</p>

<p>Founder Peter Freyd: accused of abusing his own daughter. His own brother is certain the abuse occurred. &quot;Freyd&#39;s brother added that, in his view, &quot;The False Memory Syndrome Foundation is designed to deny a reality that Peter and Pam have spent most of their lives trying to escape,&quot; and that he was certain abuse happened to his niece.[7]&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._Freyd">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._Freyd</a></p>

<p>Ralph Underwager: Ralph Underwager (28 July 1929 – 29 November 2003) was an American minister and psychologist who rose to prominence as a defense witness for adults accused of child sexual abuse in the 1980s and 1990s. Until his death in 2003, he was the director of the Institute for Psychological Therapies, which he founded in 1974. He was also a founder of Victims of Child Abuse Laws (VOCAL), a lobby group which represented the interests of parents whose children had been removed from their care by social services over abuse allegations, and he was a founding member of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation.</p>

<p>Underwager was a prolific defense expert for people accused of child sexual abuse. By the late 1980s, he had appeared in court on behalf of defendants in child sexual abuse cases more than 200 times in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Britain.[8] In court and in the media, Underwager claimed that 60% of women sexually abused in childhood reported that the experience was good for them,[9] he characterized child protection investigations as nothing less than an &quot;assault on the family as an institution&quot;[10] and he alleged that 75% of mothers alleging sexual abuse in custody proceedings suffered from a &quot;severe personality disorder&quot; that prompted them to manufacture false allegations.[</p>

<p>He was later forced to resign for saying an an interview that he thought a relationship between a pedophile and victim could be &quot;God&#39;s will.&quot; </p>

<p>Martin T Orne: &quot;Dr Orne received CIA funding through Project MKUltra Subproject 84 in 1958.[7] Subproject documents indicate that he received TOP SECRET clearance from the CIA in 1960.[7] In an interview with John Marks, unidentified CIA personnel explained that Dr Orne was one of a handful of informal consultants the CIA used on a regular basis.[8]&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Theodore_Orne">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Theodore_Orne</a></p>

<p>Dr. Harold Lief: Former major in the Army medical corps. Close colleague of the co-FMSF board member Dr. Martin Orne (the MKULTRA-connected scientist with many connections to different intelligence agencies and mind control research) and consulted with him on several studies in hypnotic programming and behavioral modification experiments at the University of Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>Dr David Dinges: &quot;Director of the FMSF who replaced professional skeptic Ray Hyman. One of two faculty heads of the Unit for Experimental Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, together with Dr. Martin Orne (who founded the unit; died in 2000). Martin Orne, a member of Scientific Advisory Board of the FMSF, has been at the center of the creation of a Manchurian candidate, has worked with Navy Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence, the Human Ecology Foundation (a major CIA funding front for MKULTRA), and almost certainly also the NSA and Army Intelligence.&quot;</p>

<p>The diagnosis of &quot;false memory syndrome&quot; became the number one defense whenever there were allegations of ritual abuse during the so called &quot;Satanic Panic.&quot; In my opinion, this time in history was the closest this country has ever come to exposing the networks of ritual child abuse that exist going up to the highest echelons of our system. If it truly was nothing but a &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; then why was this foundation formed during this time with ties to the CIA and mkultra program? How many of these kids were referred to connected &quot;therapists&quot; that potentially erased these memories? The forming of this foundation, in my opinion, was the number one vehicle for the discrediting and cover-up of the near exposure of the epidemic of ritual abuse and victimization of children by pedophiles, and pedophile networks in this country at that time.</p>

<p>&quot;MICHAEL A. PERSINGER, Ph.D.</p>

<p>Is there a link between temporal lobe activity and mental aberrations?</p>

<p>In a series of papers and books, Dr. Persinger has pursued the possibility that this may be the case. He notes experimental studies indicate that unusual temporal lobe activity contributes to &quot;visual hallucinations, the sense of a presence, mystical (paranormal) experiences, unusual smells, anomalous voices or sounds, vestibular movements and anxiety.&quot;</p>

<p>A veteran of more than 40 years as a professor at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, Dr. Persinger has concentrated much of his research efforts on how natural phenomena (earthquakes, geomagnetism, weather) can affect human group behavior and cause mental aberrations.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Great link! A ton of related info there. Thanks! </p>

<p>Is this the project you&#39;re referring to?</p>

<p>&quot;During the Reagan Administration, a top-secret project Operation Sleeping Beauty was initiated. Its purpose was to examine the possibility of using electromagnetics to disrupt the functioning of the human nervous system. They explored a list of what seemed to be foolishly impossible notions; but in fact, are nearing technical reality.</p>

<p>Some of the ideas explored were focused on the use of artificially generated electromagnetic fields to:
Unhinge a man&#39;s mind;
Paralyze the capacity to reason and react;
To induce a fit of rage, a state of panic, or a lethargic state of indifference — all at the throw of a switch;
To induce physical reactions.</p>

<p>Later, they developed a number of scenarios which could be handily resolved through the use of these terrifying futuristic electromagnetic weapons...</p>

<p>Quelling rampaging mobs by zapping them with a beam that would cause them to involuntarily vomit.
In hostage situations, disrupting the hostage takers’ minds long enough to storm the place safely;
In cases where terrorists are holed up in impenetrable stronghold with explosive devices, electromagnetic weapons could penetrate the walls and disable the terrorists.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the one. I thought I had something on my site from a primary source, like Defense Quarterly or something. I know one exists. Maybe I&#39;ll dig for it later. </p>

<p>Persinger publicly says he can induce the experiences of alien abductions, meeting God, induce huge dopamine releases ala taking an opiate, etc, using only EM waves. He does this with something he calls &quot;The God Helmet.&quot; </p>

<p>There&#39;s even a commercial version of it available called The Shakti Helmet, I believe. When it was first introduced it had the dopamine releasing option, but I think that&#39;s gone now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure there are cases where &quot;false memory syndrome&quot; is scapegoated for things that actually happened. But it&#39;s improper to suggest that the vast majority of satanic abuse allegations were passed off as this. It seems to rather come from false testimony caused by directive or suggestive interviewing techniques that were not resulting from actual memories of the children. There are numerous examples of things reported in these cases that were physically impossible, which suggests that many of these kids were just making things up or going along with stories due to overzealous investigators trying to make a case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some great points that were made from that link. It&#39;s shocking how much influence they ultimately gained over the way child sexual abuse was covered in the media. Of course this was part of their purpose. </p>

<p>&quot;A study published last year [1996] by a University of Michigan sociologist, Katherine Beckett, found a sharp shift in how four leading magazines – Time, Newsweek, U.S. News &amp; World Report, and People – treated sexual abuse. In 1991, more than 80 percent of the coverage was weighted toward stories of survivors, with recovered memory taken for granted and questionable therapy virtually ignored. By 1994, more than 80 percent of the coverage focused on false accusations, often involving supposedly false memory. Beckett credited the False Memory Syndrome Foundation with a major role in the change.19&quot;</p>

<p>This relates to the theory I talked about in the OP, that perhaps victims were sent to have these memories erased. But apparently, replacing memories is easier than erasing them. Interesting stuff.</p>

<p>A S [subject] who is able to develop good posthypnotic amnesia will also respond to suggestions to remember events which did not actually occur. On awakening, he will fail to recall the real events of the trance and will instead recall the suggested events. If anything, this phenomenon is easier to produce than total amnesia, perhaps because it eliminates the subjective feeling of an empty space in memory.103 [emphasis added]
This from Martin Orne, a founder of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, and heavily implicated in mind-control research. You have to wonder what the “real events of the trance” were likely to be, given his funding sources and documented history of unethical research projects. It certainly demonstrates a new way to think about “false memories” and “real memories” and suggests that perhaps there is some ulterior purpose here. At the very least one must consider that false memories can be used to conceal abuse.</p>

<p>This is also interesting because one of the ways to induce alters (multiple personalities) in children is, yep, sexual abuse. </p>

<p>&quot;
This is the real back-story to the founding of the FMSF. Perhaps the greatest hypocrisy was the stance the Foundation took regarding Multiple Personality (MPD) – now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) – that it does not exist. Yet many members of the founding advisory board knew better because the goal (successfully achieved) of the covert research was to do just that. There was truth in one of their talking points though: that Multiple Personality is created by doctors. They just never said which ones.&quot;</p>

<p>Lots of great info in this. I bookmarked it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It has only been since pizza gate that the Satanic Panic of the 80’s has become popular topic of discussion again. What used to be a MSM creation to sell commercials has been turned around and used to give credence to “satanic pedorings”. Pedorings exist, sure but to say that they are satanic in origin and reason is pretty flimsy and plays right into the control of organized religion which should be considered the true enemy of “woke” folk. People get on here and say whatever they want about HRC, Soros, Podesta and the like but try saying something negative about Christianity. For people who are constantly reading between the lines to believe that there is “one pure evil and it is Satan” is pretty shortsighted. Every aspect of religion is there to enslave us and believing that people diddle kids for Satan buys right into their ideology. I’d rather have a satanist babysit my kids then conservative Christians any day. Anton Levay or Mike Pence anyone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not saying it is not worthwhile, I just wish we could break from the religious narrative of “good and bad”.  Why blame a myth when humans are as evil as they need to be? For me using the term “Satanic” undermines any real research because it shows a reliance on established religious beliefs which over history have been used to enact horrible atrocities. “Satan” is a scapegoat for humanity’s misdeeds that allows for the blame to be shifted from an individual and onto a greater universal force, “evil”, thus allowing the individual to escape responsibility for their actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m definitely not giving you credit for that gem. And being against child abuse is not conservative. I didn&#39;t say it was and let&#39;s not leap to conclusions. You have &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; in your title. Yes, that triggers me because it has been debunked and because I lived through it and saw how fucking dumb it was. Child abuse is not dumb, don&#39;t put words in my mouth. You have some well cited evidence, much more than many posts which I criticize just as I criticize this sub for not digging a little deeper into sources of posts and the mods for not getting rid of some of the garbage which lurks. So yeah, I insult the sub occasionally. If you just believe everything that gets posted here you are in big trouble just as if you believe everything you read elsewhere. </p>

<p>As for the CONTENT of your thread it relies very heavily on a single article from &quot;The Institute for the Study of Globalization and Covert Politics&quot; which I can tell is a reputable publication because it has &quot;&quot;Still reeling from how much excellent work you have managed to bring under one roof&quot; -Harvard History Professor&quot; pasted at the top of the banner and says that it has also been banned from Google for whatever reason. </p>

<p>ONE of the people involved (Dr. Martin Orne) with the organization was part of MKUltra in 1958 and had secret clearance in 1960...a full thirty-two years before forming False Memory Syndrome Foundation. And that was just Orne, though the article makes it seem like Leif and Dinge were also CIA by guilt through association which makes me further question ISGP&#39;s motives.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the doctors involved with FMSF: you need experts to give expert testimony in court. These people were just that which is probably why in the case of Orne he was sought out by the government and also why he worked with the others. Just a logical guess. Look at <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00926230701401626?journalCode=usmt20">Lief&#39;s</a> obit; he was compared to Kinsey for his contributions to the understanding of human sexuality (I did not link to the NYTimes obit, which is very nice, because this sub). The one person involved,Dr.  Underwager, that even said anything weird resigned his position and said his words were taken out of context. </p>

<p>So, &quot;Why was this foundation formed?&quot; Peter Freyd formed it after being accused by his adult daughter of sexual abuse after seeing a therapist. &quot;How many of these kids were referred to &quot;connected&quot; therapists?&quot; None. The opposite is actually true. The Foundation was set up to battle questionable therapy practices that involved recovered memories while under hypnosis and the like which the doctors you list were experts in. The False Memory Syndrome Foundation did not determine where or if children saw therapy as far as I can tell but funded research and helped in court cases trying to prevent false accusations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no satanic panic. I lived through it as a survivor. I was part of the movement that began to break the silence around child sexual abuse. There was never any doubt about the purpose of the FMSF, it was to shut us up. When the backlash came on we were all silenced, and those of us who suffered the worst forms of organized abuse and trafficking became social pariahs. We heard from victims in high profile cases who were threatened into recanting. Therapists, good therapists who never used hypnosis, who never did anything other than listen to and believe us, were followed, threatened and sued. The media never reported on any of this. You wouldn’t know it unless you were connected with the movement at the time or were motivated to do some actual research on the issue. It is clear you haven’t done any, as your post here is filled with factually incorrect, off the cuff assertions.</p>

<p>The PR campaigns had nothing to do with protecting against false claims, it was abusers, just like any other class of criminal, covering their asses, traffickers protecting their profits, and yes, national security level contractors making certain their experimentation programs remained secret. </p>

<p>False memory is nothing more than “women lie about rape” applied to child abuse, and satanic panic is the cover story that protects a number of small and large organized crime networks within the multi-billion dollar child porn and child prostitution industries. Here you are doing their dirty work for them. I suggest you cut it out.</p>

<p>Start here: <a href="http://blogs.brown.edu/rcheit/sample-page-2/">http://blogs.brown.edu/rcheit/sample-page-2/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This powerful book shows how a narrative based on empirically thin evidence became a theory with real social force, and how that theory stood at odds with the grim reality of sexual abuse. The Witch-Hunt Narrative is a magisterial account of the social dynamics that led to the denial of widespread human tragedy.</p>

I know several people with it and finding help when something is blindly discredited so heavily makes it very difficult to bring the truth about abuse to light. It is very real and about as common in the general public as schizophrenia. And the people with it survived horrific abuse as young children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m glad you were at least taught the right info in college. At my university, professors considered False Memory Syndrome very real and that people having foggy memories about such things very likely could have false memory syndrome, especially if these memories arose during the 80s and 90s, that it was a likely result of therapists seen then. It was really quite alarming to hear about because I kept thinking how such thinking would discredit real victims of abuse as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone brushes off the Satanic Panic as a hoax when in reality it was very real! Just look at the West Memphis 3 case... 3 young boys killed by 3 teenage boys who were convicted on an abundant amount of evidence. Years later celebrities and others came to their defense stating they were convicted because of Satanic panic. With so much press and support, the 3 then got off with an Alford plea deal and are now walking free. Very sad part is (in my opinion and research of the evidence) they are clearly guilty. The 3 boys will never see justice. And now the 3 guilty boys (or at least 1) are out not even hiding the fact they are satanist.  Satanism was and is a very real thing and I&#39;m happy to see it coming to light now, but by how much? Only us small few who look at the facts and not dismiss the actual messed up truth... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You made a case why Satanic Panic was/is a real thing. Three innocent boys were jailed because of the religious and ignorant believing that because they liked heavy metal and wore black and were interested in the occult, they had to be devil worshipping Satanic murderers.  It&#39;s bullshit and a perfect example of how people, such as yourself, can be very dangerous when in positions of power.</p>

<p>One of the boys does claim to be a Satanist, but not as in a person that worships the devil, but an atheist. The vast majority of Satanist are athiest and do not believe the devil is at all real. It&#39;s more so to be anti-christian than pro-devil. </p>

<p>Ritual sacrifice is bullshit, there are no hidden Satanic messages when you play records backwards, no poison or razorblades in Halloween candy, D&amp;D does not conjure up spirits or draw you to the devil, no Satanic daycares, no covens of Satanists sacrificing animals late at night in the park, and Harry Potter ( or any other fantasy book/cartoon) is not a gateway to devil worshipping. You people are not truth seekers, you&#39;re the same ignorant religious assholes who are scared of anything different and bored with your mundane life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Abundant amount of evidence? It was a botched investigation where the boys were targeted because they were supposedly bad kids with unusual interests.  Not to mention the later-recanting witnesses and lack of DNA evidence. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t say I&#39;m 100% sure they&#39;re innocent. But I am 100% sure they should not have been convicted. </p>

<p>Satanism is a very real thing. But most satanists aren&#39;t murderers or even believe Satan is a real thing. It&#39;s moreso an ultra-conservative or ultra-progressive philosophical belief system, or in many cases just an aesthetic people like. Not people who sacrifice children over a pentagram. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I will agree it was a very botched investigation and maybe they deserved a new trial. I am only stating my opinion from what I have researched and I have dug very deep into this case. You can look at all the evidence and see how guilty these boys are but again that&#39;s my opinion and everyone has the right to look into the case and decide for themselves.<br/>
Satanism and rituals are a very real thing and this does include sacrificial murder. Not sure why ppl in this thread are disagreeing just because I bring up this case. Most have watch the very one sided documentaries and that is what they base their opinions. 
I only bring up this case because it is a good example of Satanic panic and how what most perceived then  as untrue and a hoax was actually the truth after all. Yes I&#39;m sure their are many examples to show otherwise but their are many truths behind it and we are seeing this now more and more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure people have done satanic rituals, yes. What I&#39;m saying is, everyone who&#39;s interested in the occult or identifies as a satanist isn&#39;t doing that stuff. Most of them aren&#39;t. In the WM3 case, there&#39;s not even enough evidence that the murders were satanic in nature. </p>

<p>I actually have looked at both sides of it quite a bit, I&#39;m not interested in one-sided cases (that&#39;s why I&#39;m a skeptic of conspiracies on r/conspiracy). I think it&#39;s very possible they&#39;re guilty, but there&#39;s other very likely suspects as well (Terry Hobbs obviously sticks out), and there isn&#39;t enough evidence from a legal standpoint against any of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Satanic panic was based on bad interviewing techniques with leading questions. Regardless of the origins of this group the fact remains the Satanic panic was completely bogus with no evidence to support the existence of a national satanic child abuse network. Molesting children is not a part of any occult group, it&#39;s not part of any ritual. 
This is an organized diversion from the absolutely confirmed existence of pedo religious figures in Christianity/Judaism/Islam  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a large number of human trafficking organizations in the world, a handful of them work with groups who believe in and practice old occult teachings. I think a lot of the reason many people dismissed the entire idea of SRA being a possibility is because they were raised by evangelists who were being exploited by charlatans, who had overblown the issue and over-parented or even abused them as they grew up, at least that is often the reason I find outside of the dismissed cases and false accusations that swirled around during the panic days in the US.</p>

<p>The US media labelled it as a &quot;satanic&quot; panic, mostly because of the many local churches and pastors pushing that narrative but none of the rings committing the abuse see or describe themselves that way, and it doesn&#39;t matter what you believe the fact is they believe in what they do and should be stopped by law enforcement. If you care about the real rings, the Belgian Beast is a good place to start.</p>
