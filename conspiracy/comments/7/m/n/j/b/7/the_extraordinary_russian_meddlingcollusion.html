        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The most shocking aspect of this entire debacle is how many folks are upset with us conspiracy theorists for <em>not</em> jumping on their bandwagon.</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s shocking that otherwise intelligent people have been conditioned to believe that conspiracy theorists <em>must</em> believe in <em>all</em> conspiracies.</p>

<p>In actuality, most conspiracy theorists have <em>always</em> distrusted the MSM, and the &quot;shock and outrage&quot; directed at this sub for not embracing the Russian conspiracy theory is as disingenuous as it is revealing.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7mkx91/jailed_russian_says_he_can_prove_hack_of_dnc_on/">Take this story</a> that&#39;s currently at the top of <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. Let&#39;s examine the title:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jailed Russian says he can prove hack of DNC on Kremlin&#39;s orders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, let&#39;s assume that the Kremlin <em>did</em> hack the DNC. What exactly happened as a result of this &quot;hack&quot;? Well, the DNC was exposed for the corrupt abomination that it is. </p>

<p>American voters became <em>more</em> informed about the election and the election process as a result. The &quot;hack&quot; resulted in <em>more</em> transparency and more informed voters. </p>

<p>If the DNC didn&#39;t want to lose votes for rigging the primaries, they shouldn&#39;t have rigged the primaries and pissed off countless Bernie supporters.</p>

<p>This little bit of rocket science is apparently too convoluted for the MSM, so the narrative was demonstrably shifted towards the Russia bogeyman. </p>

<p>If similar corruption had been discovered and exposed on the Republicans side, how many Dems do you think would be calling for Russian blood?</p>

<p>The most shocking thing to me is how they&#39;ve successfully revitalized the Cold War mentality, when I truly was beginning to believe that we had grown out of such xenophobia on a collective scale.</p>

<p>Well, I underestimated the ability of the MSM to unite under a banner of propaganda and FUD, and I overestimated our ability to remain skeptical and think for ourselves.</p>

<p>Trump has proven to be a useful idiot that they&#39;ve used to unite otherwise free-thinking and intelligent individuals into an incredibly destructive circle-jerking feedback loop that is having an extremely deleterious effect on society on an individual and collective level. </p>

<p>Fortunately, even folks in that <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> thread aren&#39;t buying this latest propaganda, as the following comments have received hundreds of upvotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I can prove anything you want, just get me out of this Russian prison&quot;</p>

<p>Juicy, but it sounds fishy.</p>

<p>That allegation is difficult to prove, partly because of the limited universe of people who have seen the details of the hack. The DNC initially did not share information with the FBI, instead hiring tech firm CrowdStrike, run by a former FBI cyber leader.</p>

<p>&quot;Bummer&quot;</p>

<p>Is it just me or do I see a post like this every other week.</p>

<p>A post on the &quot;Russian Collusion&quot; appears on the Front Page at least once a week, but at least its better than the way it was this time last year. </p>

<p>Alternate title: &quot;Guy in jail says WTF ever he has to in hopes to get a deal/lesser sentence&quot;. </p>

<p>uncredible criminal makes wild, desperate claims in order to get out of jail...QUICK! GET IT TO THE TOP OF r/WORLDNEWS</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t the hack expose all sorts of legitimate corruption, as well as a plot to stop the Bernie campaign? Sounds like a bunch of crooks getting upset that they got caught in the act and want everyone to divert their attention to a straw man to avoid prosecution.</p>

<p>&quot;Russia rigged the election by exposing how we [the DNC] rigged the primaries.&quot; ;)</p>

<p>Oh the Russians hacked the DNC. Can the FBI look at your servers to verify?... No</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it&#39;s consistently disappointing to see propaganda at the top of major subs like <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, it&#39;s extremely refreshing and heartening to see the comments call out the propaganda for what it is.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, <em>these allegation may prove true</em>, but I&#39;m proud of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for refusing to accept an MSM-driven conspiracy theory &quot;just because&quot; it&#39;s trending.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll soon see who was on the right side of history...</p>

<p>Key word: possibility.</p>

<p>Show us proof or gtfo. Conspiracy theorists are lambasted constantly for not providing proof of our claims, and instead merely providing circumstantial evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes Mueller&#39;s word right or wrong?<br/>
If our president&#39;s are puppets for the system that is currently in place, what makes this person, who has been entrenched in politics for a long time, more valid than a president?<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzFdMy4gIdQ">Why is Obama telling people that the election of course isn&#39;t rigged, when they thought Hillary had that 98% chance of winning</a> But once she lost, all of a sudden it&#39;s actually rigged, and throwing Russia in our faces.<br/>
Does it make sense that if Trump was actually colluding with Russia to win the election, that Trump would actually throw himself under the bus and claim that the election is rigged (which he cried about constantly)?<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsVNKmb6jEc">When Obama ran for president in the past he complained about the elections being rigged as well, but now once he&#39;s served his time it isn&#39;t possible?</a><br/>
What happened here, is that Obama joined the club (the club of people under control of the rich) once he became president, and now to maintain face and cover up stuff like Uranium One from leaking he had to do his part.<br/>
Do we not remember our government lying to us about WMD&#39;s in Iraq, and the ensuing wars and stuff that followed.<br/>
The CIA tools that can mimic any location anywhere on the planet? What&#39;s to say that the C.I.A. didn&#39;t &quot;hack&quot; the election and use their tools to make it look like it was actually Russia?
Remember, all of these people behind the scenes are friends and 
are very likely just putting on a show for the public.  The only thing that matters (to the elite who are in charge, not the politicians themselves) is that the current system stays in place, and the American population stays reigned in and remains under control of the system (which keeps the wealthy people in charge).<br/>
All I&#39;m saying is there is a ton of data to sift through (that would skew the results), instead of just taking one corrupt politicians word for it.</p>

<p>The hysteria surrounding Russian collision has created a tinder box and if you think a bunch of liberal gay kids burning trash cans in the streets is anarchy, just wait until they impeach Trump for anything other than collusion with Russia.</p>

<p>Welcome to 21st century politics.</p>

<p>I&#39;m literally saying in this post that we need to <em>wait</em> until we have all the evidence before we brandish our pitchforks, and you&#39;re saying that&#39;s &quot;disinformation&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so we’ve moved from the idea that the collision is a false narrative to “even if it was, who cares?” If Russians actively disrupted our democratic process, and we subsequently reward them on sanctions deals for their help in electing the current President, that’s a huge deal to our democracy.

<p>This is <em>precisely</em> the mentality that I&#39;m referring to, and it exposes your bias brilliantly.</p>

<p>The entire point of my post here is that <em>conspiracy theorists are not uniform in their beliefs</em>, and the constant attempt to portray us as &quot;unified&quot; in our beliefs is extremely disingenuous and approaches propaganda.</p>

<p>By all means.</p>

<p>Submitting a handful of posts on a topic is not <em>pushing a narrative</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, I submit things I <em>disagree with</em> all the time just to stimulate discussion in this sub. </p>

<p>Although I suppose the concept of playing devil&#39;s advocate is too overwhelming for someone obsessed with &quot;narratives&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can also dig up all the times posts that implicate Trump got tagged as “misleading title”, “unverified accusation”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The majority of posts that get labelled as misleading are misleading.</p>

<p>We moderate the #1 post in our sub <em>far</em> more aggressively, as this is the position that&#39;s the most open to manipulation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you only see flair on the #1 post that you don&#39;t see on any other posts. A forum covered in flair is distracting to say the least.</p>

<p>On a handful of occasions, improper flair was used, and that mistake hasn&#39;t been made since.</p>

<p>The fact that this hasn&#39;t occurred for the better part of a year and folks are <em>still</em> harping about it is indicative of an agenda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or got randomly put into contest mode as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Posts get put into contest mode when they are brigaded by other subreddits.</p>

<p>When posts are linked to other major subs, and then all of the sudden a comment with 500+ upvotes is shitting on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, it&#39;s our right as moderators to defend our sub against such blatant manipulation.</p>

<p>Contest mode lets every voice be heard, even during a brigade, and it&#39;s incredibly revealing that you&#39;re complaining about it.</p>

<p>Explain. Many people here would argue that you don&#39;t live in the &quot;free democratic&quot; society you think you live in. The DNC primaries are a great example of it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so interesting that criticizing the DNC is the greatest crime known to man now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you assuming any genuine user of this sub is blanket-accepting or rejecting any theory that comes up?</p>

<p>There are clear reasons to doubt the Russia/Trump collusion issue. The entire thing has been vetted by multiple 3 letter agencies - both in the US and abroad - and pretty much all evidence has been linked in some way to his opponent&#39;s as it has him. Unless somebody is sitting on information and Trump is being protected by the establishment, there is no smoking gun. So based on their professionalism, I doubt there is much there.</p>

<p>On top of this, we have the worst actors of the establishment pushing the narrative the hardest. Am I supposed to forget the years of clear corruption because Trump is such an easy target? Do I forget what lies the MSM has planted in the past?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll believe Trump/Russia when there is an indictment on the table and we can say for sure it is something real. Until then we are just talking about a fairy tale.</p>

<p>First of all, let&#39;s assume that the Kremlin did hack the DNC. What exactly happened as a result of this &quot;hack&quot;? Well, the DNC was exposed for the corrupt abomination that it is.</p>

<p>American voters became more informed about the election and the election process as a result. The &quot;hack&quot; resulted in more transparency and more informed voters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that there is some truth to &#39;exposing the DNC&#39; and its&#39; practices. </p>

<p>As for how informed the American public became, can you say with certainty that the information provided by the &#39;hackers&#39; was not manipulated? Not so much the contents, but perhaps in the way it was leaked? Selective information dissemination maybe. I personally still view that as an attempt to influence the American electorate. </p>

<p>But, to be fair, the same attempt to influence was happening on both sides. The Access Hollywood tape is a prime example of selectively releasing information in an attempt to influence voters. I think the real question, and potential scandal, would be whether or not the influence was being applied by outside (foreign) entities as opposed to inside (domestic) players. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which MSM are you talking about? Fox or CNN? Because plenty of people on fox don&#39;t believe in the Russia conspiracy. So if you don&#39;t want to believe the MSM, the. Maybe there is something to this conspiracy. After all, 4 dudes from Trumps campaign have now gone down on federal charges. Trump is already preparing to discredit Flynn if he comes out with anything damning against him. Trump surrounded himself with people trying to connect him with Russia. Wikileaks was in contact with Trumps campaign. There&#39;s some serious shit going on and people would rather be discussing what some random ass LARP on 4chan has to say about Anderson Cooper. </p>

<p>This is why people don&#39;t take the conspiracy community seriously. People only choose to believe in the theories that already fit their worldview. So any Trump supporters here will never believe Trump or his campaign ever did anything wrong. They will cry &quot;where is the evidence?&quot; While pushing a litany of theories that have absolutely no evidence. </p>

<p>People have been whining about how all this is fake for a year now. Since then, 4 guys have gone down on criminal charges. </p>

<p>But sure, we are too smart to believe any of that bullshit because the dumb face MSM talks about it. What does Q have to say about this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair with you, I actually agree with what you&#39;ve suggested here, it isn&#39;t that the &#39;conspiracy community&#39; has a problem with rigid world views.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that perhaps all of the west has this problem. There was an unrelated article about a potential mastodon site found in California on the latimes site(<a href="http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-americas-first-humans-20170426-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-americas-first-humans-20170426-story.html</a>) and the majority of the article was about the clashing of one group of scientist&#39;s findings against the dogmatic worldviews the &#39;established&#39; scientists have.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same bs. The tv has diluted the ability to communicate and accept what perhaps does not fit a world view. But it&#39;s also a humanity issue too. People don&#39;t like having their world views trampled upon and they don&#39;t like looking like fools. Egotistical and narcissistic certainly, especially within the conspiracy community and the latter mentioned scientific community although for different psychological reasons.</p>

<p>If you take a step backward from it, from yourself and your ego, if you&#39;re able, you might see what I see. It&#39;s lunacy! Humanity behaves in a very insane manner at times. Imagine how we might look or appear to look to an outside observer? Especially if they looked at the tv, what human beings spend so much time looking at. Just insanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly the amount of time people have said, &quot;the Russian collision is the perfect story for a sub like this why is this the one conspiracy theory you don&#39;t believe&quot; has been outrageous.</p>

<p>The fact that this kind of logic is a popular upvoted opinion makes my head hurt. I guess it really goes down to our education which programs children at a young age to conform. In kindergarten what happens when you literally step out of the lunch line or do anything &quot;wrong.&quot; This kind of mentality has a strong effect on the subconscious that lasts for a lifetime and I&#39;d argue its by design to create a powerless masses who don&#39;t even realize none of there thoughts are there own Brave New world style </p>

<p>You argued against this logic well. First of all the idea that everyone sub believes every conspiracy theory here is sub is outrageous to begin with. Second of all assuming that is true (it&#39;s not) they are essentially saying, &quot;you believe or accept every conspiracy theory except for this one&quot; not realizing the clear irony that they, blindly refuse and criticize ever conspiracy and label anyone who agrees as insane except for this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it that every other sort of conspiracy, from the possibility of the government faking an alien invasion to rampant sexual abuse in Hollywood and among the world elites, can be discussed by everyone, but anything Trump/Russia is immediately dismissed by so many people?</p>

<p>When it comes to Clinton or Obama, even the slightest connection brings on a swarm of different theories, none of which would be good for them if proven true. But when it comes to the possible collusion between Trump and Russia, we need to wait until we have more information, or it is all just lies. </p>

<p>This entire post is just saying that it&#39;s MSM propaganda and shifts any negative light away from Trump and Russia and onto the DNC, without any real substance. I don&#39;t understand why this one conspiracy theory is off limits because it&#39;s <em>so obviously</em> fake. </p>

<p>ROFL, I&#39;ve seen the material pandered here, and the majority is far from sensible and substantial. But that isn&#39;t the point, the point is the goal posts are different based on the subject matter. For 90% of topics, no &#39;hard proof&#39; is needed, but for some reason, anytime Trump/Russia is brought up, the shills come out and claim &#39;no evidence!&#39;.</p>

<p>Oh I know how the media inflates, sensationalizes, and illogically makes certain stories. But if you actually look at source material and read the context, there is tons of eye opening material brought forth, from money laundering with Trump properties and Manafort, to dirty loans with Kushner, to coordination on with Wikileaks, there&#39;s ample motive and means, the pieces are all there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some good info on the Russian money laundering.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/10/24/557162777/what-is-money-laundering-and-why-does-it-matter-to-robert-mueller">https://www.npr.org/2017/10/24/557162777/what-is-money-laundering-and-why-does-it-matter-to-robert-mueller</a></p>

<p>&quot;Over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to Russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in and even run criminal activities out of Trump Tower and other Trump properties,&quot; wrote Craig Unger, in a long feature for The New Republic.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever his knowledge about the source of his wealth, the public record makes clear that Trump built his business empire in no small part with a lot of dirty money from a lot of dirty Russians.&quot;</p>

<p>Rodgers of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity says it may not be Trump who should necessarily worry about money laundering charges at this point. The president may have good reason to fear, according to some reports, but the person in the most pressing legal jeopardy could be Trump&#39;s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.</p>

But this one, for whatever reason, needs more information before anyone makes any judgement. It&#39;s almost hypocritical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I literally stated the (fact) that the DNC rigged the primaries and you refer to that as having no real substance?</p>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t fathom your logic, can you attempt to justify this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, they did rig the election, but that has nothing to due with the possible collusion between Trump and Russia. You&#39;re acting like Trump couldn&#39;t have worked with Russia to win the election because the DNC is a steaming pile of shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, it&#39;s incredible that you&#39;ve received so many upvotes for such an obvious untruth.</p>

<p>I never said this conspiracy theory was off limits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said that you said this conspiracy is off limits. What I was implying is that so many people but so much time and effort into telling people that this one conspiracy theory is fake, made up, not true, all lies, when so many other theories are pushed to the front of this subreddit with substantially less evidence to back them up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering the main reason <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is so deeply rooted with t_d is because around october/nov following the election as someone who wasn&#39;t openly democrat meant following news relating to wikileaks, podesta emails, asking unpleasant questions like &quot;did DNC really throw an election against Bernie?&quot; &quot;Is there really a CTR presence on reddit and if so, how prevalent is it?&quot; which was openly dismissed on the default subs. I browse both t_d and conspiracy became literally the only other place on these boards where I can find skeptical minds. </p>

<p>I used to engage in Trump-Russia discussions and pizzagate and etc. but I honestly feel discouraged by what I perceive as a willingness to associate anyone who follows t_d as a partisan that&#39;s unwilling to discuss anything. Eventually I just started to feel like shilling is just too prevalent here (especially the pizzagate threads) and nowadays I don&#39;t comment too often at all. </p>

<p>One thing I genuinely don&#39;t see is this dismissive attitude towards Trump-Russia. It&#39;s definitely not a &quot;vast&quot; majority like you hyperbolize. You already have a vast majority following this &quot;theory&quot; on every default news sub as well as politics, but you won&#39;t be satisfied until <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is your echochamber. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty ironic for you to say that. You didn&#39;t address a single specific thing the post said, just disingenuously summed it up and dismissed it. </p>

<p>Why is it that there is a constant influx of accounts less than a month old all parroting the same partisan, dismissive viewpoint? Like, for example, you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the Russiagate narrative being pushed so hard right now is not that it is untrue. It seems entirely plausible that Russians tried to influence our elections. The problem with the narrative is that it gives the Democrats an absolute pass on doing any inward reflection after losing so hard. Rather than talk about what really led to this absolutely unforced error of an election, they are following the exact same path that led them to ruin in 2016. </p>

<p>If we expect liberals to win in 2018 or 2020 just because Donald Trump is being Donald Trump, we are probably doomed to the same fate we suffered the last time we used that logic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also some terrible sleight-of-hand that they want us focused on the social media (&quot;fake news&quot;) aspect of the story rather than the legitimate hacking that may have occurred re: voting machines, voter registrations, and election software. It serves to divide us (&quot;look at those dumbasses who fell for Russian propaganda on Facebook and voted for Trump&quot;) and distracts us from the real vulnerability of our current voting system, a discussion we should seriously be having if you don&#39;t trust Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is this admitting to key evidence, because remember the accusation is collusion with the Russians to steal the election?</p>

<p>All I see is someone offered dirt on the opposing candidate and him agreeing to sit down and see what they might have, not collusion with the intent to defraud the election process as the media would like you to believe.</p>

<p>The next and most important question is, was the attorney working on her own or as a representative working on behalf of the Russian Government and was he aware of that?</p>

<p>The final observation is do you think Hillary did the same by paying a British officer to dig up dirt on Trump?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t that by your definition make Hillary colluding with the British to get dirt on Trump?</p>

<p>Keep in mind too, she actually payed for the dirt, Trump Jr. did not.</p>

<p>Hillary on the other hand paid a US company for legal opposition research... who subcontracted a former (and highly respected) Mi6 spy who compiled a dossier. That dossier WAS NOT USED IN THE ELECTION BUT WAS INSTEAD GIVEN TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not claiming anything is &quot;true&quot; I&#39;m just marveling at how aggressively <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been attacked for not immediately embracing an MSM-championed conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>if you voted for trump-&gt; you dont believe it</p>

<p>now we get a bunch of &#39;im a bernie bro, and i hate trump but even i can see this russian collusion is bs!&#39; which is a pretty common tactic. you see it all the time in disinfo. but if you follow their statements, theyll never say a thing that lines up with being a sanders supporter, outside of the small overlap in the trump/sanders camps</p>

<p>anyways, it also follows that if you dont believe in russian collusion, you do most likely believe in pizzagate, or that seth rich was a leaker (not a hack!! lol) or any number of conspiracies that make the left look bad.</p>

I saw first hand how corrupt the DNC is and was so I removed myself from the party and affirmed a hardline independent view. However, i do see faults in Bernie--especially his cowardice and some social programs. I like Bernie more than Trump but when it came down to Trump vs Hillary I was allllll  in on Trump. He didn&#39;t come from a political background and he funded his own campaign for the most part. He also called out Hillary for her lies and scandals--which MSM NEVER does.

<p>the only positive i see in a trump presidency. instead of the creeping cornyism/corporate owned govt/oligarchy of hillary, trump is so bold and transparently unethical with his conflicts of interest and serving of big business that america might just start to drop the pretension that these politicians arent out for themselves</p>

<p>also, for better or worse, I think it has opened the door for non career politicians to enter the fray. Hopefully people i respect will consider running for office. God knows the people typically attracted to the job have been the absolute wrong types</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You POV sill is using an angle of Dems vs Reps, though. In the end, a corporation will be in the pocket of both candidates---they dont lose against the little people. Well, unless someone like Sanders won (who was self-funded by the people). </p>

<p>Since Trump has been so polarizing (for better or worse) people have become more involved in understanding politics to a degree (some parrot MSM talking points). BUT at least there is more conversation. If Hillary had won, people would still be saying &quot;I dont do politics/Politics doesnt affect me/I dont care about politics&quot; while man behind the curtain and hypnosis remained unopposed.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait for 2020 when you have people like The Rock running for president (he has already hinted at it). It is going to be yet another instance of hypocrisy on their part (&quot;BUT TRUMP ISNT QUALIFIED WAA WAA WAA&quot;). Plus The Rock is also part of the ultra-rich and a contributor to the decay in culture (as part of Hollywood). His face is botoxxed to hell already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that saying &quot;most people don&#39;t buy it&quot; is the consensus of response to the MSM narrative, not an attempt to establish truths about any purported collusion.  Truth seekers aren&#39;t actively trying to shape the narrative, the MSM is.  Pointing out that the MSM position is widely considered false propaganda around here is the only way to defend against false propaganda taking root, so it shouldn&#39;t be considered a red flag.  It&#39;s the scientific method at work. </p>

<p>The population is being inundated with a ludicrous story that Russia has taken over control of our government with not only no proof, but not even specific charges, just a vague idea that collusion happened.  A lot of people don&#39;t buy this bogus story because it is devoid of facts and evidence, not because we want the &quot;home team&quot; to win and this helps our team acheive that.  </p>

<p>He wouldn&#39;t stand a chance of pardon/immunity with Clinton and thus releases email leaks at oped fine times when Trump has negative coverage to deflect.</p>

<p>Trying to cooperate with Trump team personnel. This would accomplish an insider friend and favors. It was unsuccessful but an attemp fits the motive.</p>

<p>Rohrabacher after talking with Assange wanted to talk directly to Trump to negotiate a pardon in exchange for his information on the leaks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a possible motive, but it fits the bill so far. Secondly if he does not get a pardon/immunity, he has little to risk. He is also a worldwide known figure so the government betraying it&#39;s word would have negative implications.</p>

<p>Lastly, take a look at a Wikileaks defector, much of his story has been affirmed by Assange himself.</p>

And he made this transformation conveniently for the 2016 election cycle? 0 to 100 with no sign change?</p>

<p>Even if I buy this quick transformation narrative, it still doesn&#39;t do anything to allay my concerns about the Clinton Cabal. Assange could have gotten a payment from the devil himself and I still wouldn&#39;t care. Those wikileaks emails are Google DKIM signed and therefore true. </p>

<p>That is the important thing that nobody will discuss. There are real crimes documented there instead of the theoretical crime of exposing info for political gain. The very same type of info we all wish our Journalists would expose. And those wonderful &quot;defenders of Democracy&quot; wont deign to examine the wikileaks data and instead bluster about &quot;where it came from&quot;.</p>

<p>Notice the date on the articles. 2010 and 2011. This is nothing new. There are others too, I originally wanted to find an article about a defector in 2015 specifically talking about selling information. However I&#39;m on mobile as the links show and I couldn&#39;t find that specific case. Pretty much all Wikileaks defectors tell a similiar story or selling out and selective releases.</p>

<p>Neighter has anyone mentioned Clinton here until you. The emails tell their own story. This is about statements Assange makes outside of leaks, in this case it started by his Seth Rich statements. The leaks are real, but that changes nothing that Assange lies, twists, and deals with secret information to outside parties that are not leaked. His statements need to scrutinized due to his past behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah so now we come to another issue, propaganda.</p>

<p>You write Clinton threatened Assange with drone strikes like its a fact. Yet that info came from Truepundit, a site with many false news stories, in what they claimed was an annomynous source that heard it 6 years ago. They than conflate the story by referencing an email that strictly talks about diplomacy, lawyers, and PR. It&#39;s not even a sound article and yet this claim shows up a lot. Not to mention the use of an annomynous source which somehow no one questions.</p>

<p><a href="https://truepundit.com/under-intense-pressure-to-silence-wikileaks-secretary-of-state-hillary-clinton-proposed-drone-strike-on-julian-assange/">https://truepundit.com/under-intense-pressure-to-silence-wikileaks-secretary-of-state-hillary-clinton-proposed-drone-strike-on-julian-assange/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you mentioned the Smith-Mundt amendment of 2013 included in the National Defense Authorization Act. Obama did sign it, and he issued a signing statement that he dosen&#39;t agree with some provisions but the constitution does not allow him to pick sections. He also tried to threaten a veto the year because of provisions that allow holding us citizens without heabus corpus. He had no success and ended up signing that one too. You should research before pinning it on Obama.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/01/obama-signs-defense-bill-notes-regrets-153222">https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/01/obama-signs-defense-bill-notes-regrets-153222</a></p>

<p>Also check their link to a copy of his complete 2012 and 2013 statements.</p>

<p>As for Assange, the defectors statements don&#39;t just stand by themselves. While we don&#39;t have much else besides them to describe Wikileaks inner workings, we have a mild example in DMs between Wikileaks and Trump team.</p>

<p>Specifically, as an example of information dealing we have the password to an opposition website being handed out. This Rutherford contradicts Wikileaks prior statement on how information is acquired and handled. In short, Wikileaks has lied and schemed, blemishing their record outside the defectors statements</p>

<p>So what Obama regrets subjecting American people to propaganda. Every propaganda piece can carry an apology. History and the demise of First Amendment will note his regret.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obama dosen&#39;t just regret, he tried fighting it the year prior. The Smith-Mundt act when solo legislature had failed and needed to be bundled up. A veto for the NDAA would mean the military gets unfunded until a new NDAA is released. He viewed it as no choice and his resistance was ineffective because like he said the constitution does not give him the power. It also passed 98-0 through the senate. </p>

Look at population changes in the last 10-20 years. Red states are losing a massive amount of the younger population. While states like Colorado, Oregon, Washington and California the population has exploded. The red states get to keep a minimum amount of electoral votes so they just work on keeping those and they can win easily if the democrats don&#39;t get their heads out of their ass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can absolutely fathom that Russia would try to influence the election -- along with basically every other major country/world actor. It&#39;s public record that the U.S. gets funneled with foreign money during elections. In fact, we do the same thing to other nations. </p>

<p>What people can&#39;t &quot;fathom&quot; is what exactly the &quot;crime&quot; here is. &quot;Colluding&quot; is not a crime (however ominous this carefully chosen word sounds). Simply &quot;knowing&quot; is also not a crime. Instead, you would have to show that Trump helped Russia do something <em>illegal</em> (remember, facebook ads or something like that <em>is not</em> illegal). It is conceivable that Trump helped Russia hack the emails -- although, honestly it seems very unlikely. Your &quot;what did he know and when did he know it&quot; question has absolutely no bearing on criminality, or frankly, wrongdoing. </p>

<p>Our own two party system was caught red handed blatantly screwing over their constituents in favor of lobbyists and corporate donors. Ignoring the will of the people in favor of the elite. We all knew that Democrats and Republicans both only care about the lobbyists and corporations that fund their campaigns, but rarely have we been given such undeniable proof of their backroom dealings to keep the Wallstreet/corporate friendly candidate in the race. </p>

<p>We have been handed a proverbial treasure trove of evidence of corruption within our own government, and yet we sit here and argue over whatever small role Russia may have played in the game? I call bullshit. The same people who helped prop up Hillary and Trump (remember how he received over a billion dollars in free advertising throughout the campaign?) are leading the McCarthy-esk witch hunt over Russia.</p>

<p>We should be focused on the curruption in our own government, on both the red and blue sides, rather than the donkey show the media keeps pushing. Don&#39;t let the establishment control the narrative. </p>

<p>They use hot button issues (such as gay marriage, abortion, etc.) to polarize the masses. Do you really think the Koch brothers or George Soros give a rat&#39;s ass if two dudes can legally marry each other? No. Not in the slightest. These are issues the rich could care less about, while the issues that matter to them are passed no matter who sits in the white house.</p>

<p>I also would argue that a lot of the severely politically biased comments and threads are being pushed by companies like share blue. It is a way to help keep us divided and fighting each other instead of focusing our aggression toward those that have enslaved us all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what you mean. The republicans are consistently more eager to suck that corporate cock. AND they hide behind their supposed faith. </p>

<p>Point is, the platforms at least tell you what they want to do. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a human being, with an ounce of empathy, it&#39;s a clear choice. </p>

<p>The Republican Party is, straight out, a criminal racket. Anyone who votes Republican is either a sociopath, or a brain dead, Fox watching idiot. </p>

<p>You literally have to be an fool to vote for these assholes whom they keep voting for. </p>

<p>Fuck the USA. We deserve Trump AND a useless Republican congress. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Exactly! Red and blue are two sides of the same coin. There is no discernable difference to the elite few who actually run our country. No matter who wins the presidency, the rich profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a counterproductive, cynical narrative. No politician is perfect, but the GOP is unequivocally worse for the average American than the democrats. The GOP ideology itself is specifically crafted to shut down even the basic <em>concept</em> of government being able to provide for its citizens. They have an ideological slant against the government as ineffective and damaging towards &quot;individual freedoms&quot; and when they&#39;re in power they set out to make that a reality. </p>

<p>It&#39;s far easier to present government as unsound and destructive <em>at its core</em> than it is to present government as having high potential for success, so long as effort is appropriately applied. It&#39;s ideologically lazy, and this alone makes it far easier to blindly abide. People would rather believe that government is a misguided cause and <em>give up</em>, than they would believe that government can be successful and just with extraordinary effort.  But the narrative that both parties are the same is absolutely ridiculous and screams ignorance. Here&#39;s some actual data to justify your opinion of these &quot;2 sides of the same coin&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet you only further prove my point. The articles you provided show the exact hot button issues that each side pushes to further polarize us.</p>

<p>Do these issues matter to the average American? Of course they do. It absolutely matters whether people can be discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, etc. It absolutely matters that we are destroying our environment. The differences in the democratic and republican parties matter to US, not to THEM. </p>

<p>Wallstreet, big pharma, bit oil, the war machine, and other sectors that bribe our elected officials win no matter who we elect. The oligarchy that actually runs our country wins no matter who we elect.</p>

<p>We may be promised that each politician will be different. Obama promised to get us out of the middle east, then proceeded to expand and escalate our military conflicts in the region. He promised to stand up to the banking industry that caused the recession, and yet allowed his entire cabinet to be hand picked by a citibank executive resulting in almost no ramifications for the countless lives their greed had destroyed. Example after example of our government putting the rich before the common folk.</p>

<p>You can bury your head in the sand if you like and pretend the two parties are at odds with each other, but the fact is the DNC and the RNC have far more similarities than differences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The actual data says you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>You bring up money in politics as being a common factor, but ignore the data I posted above showing the party line vote to remove that very influence in our government.</p>

<p>You bring up regulation in the financial sector post-recession while ignoring the democrats&#39; creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, while the GOP actively fought to ensure that Bureau would not be an <em>Agency</em>. You say Obama had cabinet members influenced by Wall Street, ignoring the unequivocally more severe installment of literal Wallstreet CEOs in Trump&#39;s cabinet, and his appointment of ExxonMobil execs to the EPA.</p>

<p>You think that the DNC and RNC are equally influenced by large scale donors, but ignore the GOP passing a 1.5 Trillion dollar tax cut for the rich. You ignore Orrin Hatch proclaiming that the GOP must pass their tax reform literally for the sake of their donors.</p>

<p>You say <em>I&#39;m burying</em> <strong><em>my</em></strong> <em>head in the sand</em> while you refuse to acknowledge the actual, vital differences between these parties because it&#39;s easier for you to say they&#39;re both the same and do <em>nothing practical</em> against it than it is to acknowledge that one side is far better despite their flaws. You preach an ideology of defeatism and laziness because you don&#39;t want to put in the work necessary for positive change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rich vs poor is another false dichotomy and you&#39;ve bought into it hook line and sinker. If you could you&#39;d be one of the village people with torches storming the manors of the <em>bourgeoisie,</em> ie you&#39;re a thieverous Bolshevik. </p>

<p>The only time these people have done anything wrong is when they exploited authoritarian systems to raise the barrier of entry and/or insure monopolies. Otherwise business relationships are always voluntary. You don&#39;t have to buy their products or work for them and there are usually other options even if that means relocating. </p>

<p>And any of the power which they have can be hedged against by pooling your resources together with other like minded folks, like with net neutrality the proper solution is for rural communities to pitch in for new fiber lines coming to their communities owned by the community members themselves. And since when did authoritarian collectivist progressives care about rural people? You want to take their guns away but &quot;save&quot; (censor) their internet?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a problem in our culture where so many people think government is the only way to pool resources together. That&#39;s wrong and government is actually the worst instrument for doing this as well as the least ethical. Corporations take advantage of it all the time yet you don&#39;t feel unethical for doing the same? </p>

<p>Every time government is used as a band aid for a societal problem that is a failure of society and means that you are threatening some group with a gun to their head and threats of being thrown in cages. And the power that government officials wield is almost absolute so it corrupts them absolutely. Once someone is in government it&#39;s in their best interest to gain more power for their position and every time the public surrenders control to them they take and inch but really will be taking a mile in the future. </p>

They allow the political teams to argue over irrelevancies while things that actually matter (ESF shenanigans, water ownership, hypermilitarization, GMOs/terminator seeds, data collection, etc) progress outside of most people&#39;s realm of thought. We&#39;re so bombarded with superficial news that it&#39;s difficult to actually sift through it to discover what things of importance are taking place. Even when we do get actual news, it&#39;s just reporting that X event happened. What aren&#39;t told is: &#39;What preceding events led to X happening? What do all factions involved with X believe and why do they disagree? Who stands to benefit from X occurring?&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose it can be interpreted that way, and if so I apologize.</p>

<p>What I meant was that while browsing the &quot;default&quot; subs, I&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s essentially become a meme in itself that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a whole isn&#39;t embracing the Russiagate narrative, while emphasizing the &quot;irony&quot; that a &quot;conspiracy&quot; sub therefore must be supporting the POTUS.</p>

<p>Instead, I see no indication whatsoever that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (and conspiracy theorists in general) are united on <em>any</em> front. </p>

<p>There are those on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> who put more credence in the Russia conspiracy than others...my point is that there is, and never will be, any definitive &quot;stance&quot; on anything among the alternative research/conspiracy community.</p>

<p>The fallacy I&#39;m trying to highlight here is the notion that since Russiagate is a conspiracy theory, therefore <em>all</em> conspiracy theorists should believe in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This drives me crazy. Even if Russia is guilty of everything accused of them. It comes down to &quot;Hacking emails&quot; (read phishing), and reddit shills, twitter bots, and facebook posts. The grand conspiracy from this angle is that Russia stole the election... with email phishing, reddit shills, twitter bots, and facebook posts. </p>

<p>See how silly that sounds. How is that going to delegitimize an election? I have no doubt Russia tried/did these things, as they have for decades, but it amounts to NOTHING. It does not delegitimize our democracy or our election. </p>

<p>Like OP said, the &quot;hacks&quot; just showed DNC&#39;s corruption. That’s it. That was the only real effect. And well that was the DNCs fault. </p>

<p>And Trumps collusion? &quot;I&#39;ll lower sanctions if you expose the DNCs corruption. Oh and also make fake facebook posts. K thnx bye great working with you.&quot; --- SILLY</p>

<p>Name one thing that Russia and Trump is accused of except what I listed. Because that is the CNN narrative when you really look at it. </p>

<p>Id much rather look into Trumps shady business dealings or his current decision making as president. </p>

<p>But it’s clear as day to me. As it was in those emails during the election. That MSM is the one doing the colluding.</p>

<p>thats not what the investigation is about. Yes, they tried to do that, and im sure USA does that as well. Its geopolitics. The patriots dont get mad that the steelers want to score touchdowns on them.</p>

<p>The investigation is about whether a candidate promised favorable legislation to a rival nation in exchange for help getting elected and/or personal gain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but what form did that help come in allegedly? An email dump and shills. </p>

<p>How is that help in getting elected and/or personal gain. </p>

<p>The personal gain I can see as Trump has businesses everywhere. But thats not what everyone is talking about. Its Russia hacked the election in exchange for sanctions being lowered. I dont see how anyone can reach that conclusion when they look closely enough. </p>

<p>It was an email dump.</p>

<p>And reddit shills, twitter bots, and fake facebook posts. </p>

<p>Thats all people. And even that hasn&#39;t been proved 100%. And even if it was. It doesn&#39;t change the course of anything. </p>

<p>So who got what? Trump got that. And Russia got what? The sanctions havent been voted back into place yet perhaps. Either way it doesnt seem like this grand conspiracy. </p>

<p>Trump received nothing of value. </p>

<p>Yet people talk like Russia is the only reason he is prez. Which is misinfo and pulls us away from all the real issues. THATS the conspiracy if you ask me. And we know 100% MSM has done it many times before. We know they did it during the election. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just talking in this one instance. I&#39;m personally sure Trump is part of the elite and all that, but this Russia narrative is BS and I&#39;m sure its there to hide something or set us up for something else. </p>

<p>I understand the reason for the investigation. Its obviously worth looking into. But people take it as fact when they havent even really looked at the underlying context.</p>

<p>One more time. </p>

<p>It was an email dump.</p>

<p>And reddit shills, twitter bots, and fake facebook posts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm yeah actually this is a fair point. And I suppose the the email dump did in fact make a difference in the election. </p>

<p>I guess I just get annoyed at &quot;Hacking&quot; and &quot;Stealing&quot; the election. Its the hyperbole of it all. </p>

<p>I don’t see MSM saying... &quot;Granted the email dump only exposed the truth, but it may have been obtained illegally in a quid pro quo matter&quot;</p>

<p>Instead I see all over the news and kids parroting here, &quot;Russia, Putin himself, with Trumps blessing, hacked the election and thus stole the presidency away from Clinton.&quot; When in reality it was something much more nuanced. A crappy password phished from an email that exposed a crooked DNC. </p>

<p>It would be a much more intelligent and honest conversation if it was read out and as it happened in reality.</p>

<p>I agree with OP however. The MSM coverage of this issue has turned otherwise rational people into babbling paranoiacs. </p>

<p>But I concede that if everything is true it would have been a quid pro quo situation, however how much it was lopsided in Russia&#39;s favor. </p>

<p>What is this obsession with &quot;MSM says something so it must be false and you&#39;re an idiot for believing it&quot;?. Is the opposite true as well?

<p>You&#39;re proud of r/conspiracy for not immediately believing a MSM story trending.

    <div class="md"><p>Strictly based on what Putin has said in the past(I don&#39;t claim to know what he thinks of course) he seems directly opposed to the lies and disinformation the main stream media in the west pours on the people.</p>

<p>He clearly doesn&#39;t want world war 3 either. I don&#39;t think anybody rational does.</p>

<p>I really hope most Americans don&#39;t view the Russian and Chinese people as &#39;the enemy&#39;. How many times does our species have to go down the same path? We shouldn&#39;t be opposing these great peoples, we should be working with them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any Russian or Chinese ancestry either btw. The only dog I have in this fight is helping try to break the &#39;bs paradigms&#39;.</p>

<p>In as far as the Democratic or Republican parties, both are wildly corrupt and neither party should necessarily be trusted regardless of what is said. I take all of it with a massive grain of salt, as recent history shows the level of &#39;not always accurate&#39; slander thrown about from both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it goes one or two ways. We either get this “great divide” with blue v red, or black v white, or whatever you want to call it; and things go to absolute dog shit. Then one day along comes a “savior” of sorts and unified the entire country under one flag just seconds before the break of civil war. We put aside our differences and fall under a new rule which is unlike anything we’ be seen before. One day we wake up and realize we are actual slaves to a very few select elites and things are too far gone to ever go back. They’ve won. When I say this I don’t mean like how it is now, I mean we reduce ourselves so much because they were “driving us apart” (ie no credit cards, mortgages, loans, cars, TVs, etc), and we start a “utopia” (read “hell”) where we work 20 hour days and eat scraps. North Korea will seem like a pipe dream.</p>

<p>The other option (which I think is the most likely) is Trump leads us to a war with [insert country here]. It won’t matter whom with, and it won’t be a quick victory. This country will have some backing from some other shit country (this will all be planned by the way, by TPTB) and we will enter into a multi-front war. This will likely escalate in a manner that invokes another (major) country to become involved and will probably spark a WWIII type event. Things will seem ok on the home front because the economy will boom and we will get lots of good news of “winning the war” and we will be driven into a shitty situation that the next president will gladly take over. Meanwhile the global elites will be making background moves which will further their power post-war (ie new laws, protections, who cares) and eventually we will be living in the same hell previously mentioned in scenario 1, just will less work and more scraps. </p>

<p>It likely won’t be us, but one day an average global citizen will wake up and realize that there is nothing to dream for, and that we did it to ourselves. </p>

<p>The reason I think option 2 is likely is because the US is definitely gearing up for something. I know of 2 recent deployments on national guard regiments from two states on opposite ends of the country. I couldn’t get details obviously, and even if I did I probably wouldn’t put them on here, but we aren’t heavily active anywhere that I know of right now and we don’t have a pressing need to rotate national guard at any front so something seems fishy about both of these deployments. We are on the offensive but I don’t know where or why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres actually a jailed Russian who claims he was instructed to hack the DNC by the DNC. You can Google it, it&#39;s been posted here. Obviously a quack job. The job of a conspiracy theorists isn&#39;t to believe conspiracies, it&#39;s to challenge the narrative. We know the media is owned by wealthy interests and they have agendas, that&#39;s why we don&#39;t take it at face value we look for truth. If anything we should take back the misnomer the cia chose for us and change it to truth seekers because that&#39;s what conspiracy theorists are supposed to be. Most clearly are not, many are just interesting alternative reality seekers. Given how much propaganda is in the media you could say the same of anyone. </p>

<p>Anyway a lot of the Russian outrage is clearly manufactured from the MSM. Any genuine discussion about it would be about geopolitics in general, and Americas espionage, not more red scare. It&#39;s also clear a lot of it is just trying to impeach trump out if anger he won, not anger as a result of the inconsequential Russian intervention. I hate trump as much as the next but the Russian interference was ultimately very minimal. If we&#39;re going to say Russian propoganda had an effect then we&#39;d have to put Facebook, Google, and walk at the top of that list too. </p>

<p>I also sincerely doubt most people on either side know the full details. It&#39;s just a shouting match at this point. Politics is the new sports of the 80s/90s,pointless outrage for no real reason except that the people at the top are wanting it. </p>

This isn’t the standard approach for our MSM, there’s typically more verifiable facts needed to warrant this level of coverage and attention, MSM doesn’t often deal in conspiracies.</p>

<p>There was nothing damning or remotely surprising in the Podesta emails.  Our country is under a criminal administration that is actively robbing us by using our tax dollars to line his own pockets.  This is happening in no small part due to a conspiracy on the part of Russia to trick America&#39;s most stupid demographic into voting for a pro-Russia shill with 0 integrity and 0 care about anyone other than himself.  The Russian government committed a crime under our laws when they attacked our electoral process.  The Trump team committed a crime when they helped them do this, something which is far more serious.  Donald Trump committed a crime when he fired James Comey in a laughably stupid attempt to cover up this malfeasance.</p>

<p>You got duped.  You&#39;re not some secret super genius charged by god to lead the conspiracy movement, you are a rube who was wrong about something, didn&#39;t want to admit so you doubled down on it.  Now 40 double downs later you sound so goddamn stupid it&#39;s incomprehensible.</p>

<p>&quot;Fake news&quot; is a smokescreen for blatant propaganda. These idiots have been mindlessly consuming opnions-as-news on Fox for decades. They no longer have any interest in facts or evidence, but they want to pretend that everyone else is just as bad or worse than them. The online &quot;news&quot; outlets if the far right see an opportunity for advancing both economically and ideologically. For them to be successful they have to convince their audience that reliable sources of factual news reporting doesn&#39;t exist, so thst they won&#39;t be held to any standards whatsoever, and can then fabricate or repeat whatever lie might help them the most in that moment.</p>

But then again it could be for something bigger. I think the Government realizes they are on the losing end of this fight and it&#39;s to late to change the mind of the average American. They may have to resort to an alien invastion, war with North Korea, the US dollar crashing because of crypto, rise of the middle lower class and the fact that people are waking up and if you&#39;re not awake you&#39;re considered an idiot. We&#39;re winning ya&#39;ll still got a long ways to go.

<p>Yeah, we need to wary of the mainstream media narrative, but there&#39;s just too much to this Russia story to ignore. Who, after being widely accused of being Putin&#39;s puppet, would take a secret one-on-one meeting with Putin?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so proud of this sub too.  We protect Trump here come hell or high water.  All Russia news is FAKE news.  All connections between the Trump campaign and Russia is FAKE news.  The Dossier is FAKE news.  Manafort being under FBI investigation is a travesty of American justice.  Flynn pleading guilty is good for Trump, not bad.   Papadopoulos pleading guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about contacts he had with the Russian government is FAKE news.  Mueller is corrupt.  The entire FBI supports Hillary and Obama and we should purge all agents and give them a loyalty test.</p>

<p>There have been no connections between Trump and Russia, at all.  He has no business interest in Russia.  The meeting between Trump Jr. and people with Russia interests is FAKE news. The entire investigation is a total witch hunt and isn&#39;t based in reality.  </p>

<p>If the tables were turned, we Republicans would recognize that this is pure McCarthyism and we would give the demorats the benefit of the doubt, just like we&#39;ve always done with Obama, Hillary, Podesta, etc.  </p>

<p>Thankfully we have a mod setting us straight. </p>

<p>So what if Russia DID hack the DNC?  They exposed corruption and that makes it okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I knew Trump was going to be a disaster domestically (I&#39;m not a Democrat or even an American though), but I was hoping for an improvement from Bush-Clinton neoconservativism on the foreign policy front.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I failed to considered the implications of Sheldon Adelson&#39;s involvement and here we are.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve loathed Adelson since 2011. </p>

<p>I used to be a winning recreational poker player online but was never good enough to take it further. The Adelson-orchestrated ban against online poker in the United States kicked a lot of shitty players off the online rooms and probably cost me a few grand by no longer making it profitable for me to play. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sabbath777 already commented about how astonishing it is that so many people view every conspiracy theory through the lens of their political paradigm. I&#39;ll echo that comment, but I want to add a little more to it.</p>

<p>There is a war going on right now for control of the United States. You would have to be blind and deaf not to see it. The Storm has been coming for a long time now and is nearly upon us. On the one side we have the &quot;Cabal&quot; (for lack of a better word) that has been firmly in control of the Deep State and the mainstream media. On the other, we have &quot;the Resistance&quot; (again, for lack of a better word... its what they seem to call themselves). But who exactly are the players and what <em>exactly</em> do both sides ultimately want? What does the picture look like if one side or the other &quot;wins&quot;? Can either side really &quot;win&quot;? I doubt anyone reading this post actually knows for sure. I certainly don&#39;t.</p>

<p>But the weapons of this war are plain enough to see. False allegations, fake news, disinformation, distractions, divisions and narrative narrative narrative. As both sides get more frantic, we will see more extreme things starting to happen. The mainstream media will continue to double down on the zeitgeist it is trying to create, while the other side will continue to push wild conspiracy theories that might very well be true but how can we really know. <em>What do we really know?</em></p>

<p>The whole Democrat/Republican, Liberal/Conservative divide is just another aspect of this contest. A tool of manipulation and control. Try to look past it. Expand your thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, good. You took the bait and responded, so I can further clarify my deliberately snarky comments.</p>

<p>First of all, you may be &quot;well known&quot; around this particular shallow pond, but you&#39;re certainly not &quot;well informed&quot; enough to swim in deeper waters. Be careful if you do, however, as you might get swallowed by a much larger fish.</p>

<p>Just because someone is new to reddit, does not mean that they&#39;re new to the world of conspiracy. This assumption alone shows your lack of critical thinking skills.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Yeah look at my name dumbass.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did. And isn&#39;t it ironic that your name (SmedleysButler) implies that you&#39;re at least superficially aware of a past presidential coup attempt, yet obviously completely unaware of a similar attempt happening right in front of you. And yes, orchestrated by the same forces (in spirit) as those who conspired to take down Roosevelt.
But then, maybe you&#39;re living in the past, making you unaware of the present.</p>

<p>The line of apostolic succession, politically speaking if you&#39;ll excuse the mixed metaphor, is clear. But I seriously doubt you&#39;ll understand that or make the connection. </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;m sure we can agree on is that neither of us is a fan of Trump. I&#39;m almost certain that statement is a surprise to you, as you probably also made the assumption that I was a Trumpster.</p>

<p>I am not, however, I do understand who his enemies are in the establishment. And yes, the term, &quot;establishment&quot;, is key here.</p>

<p>Are you establishment? Be honest and thoughtful in how you answer that, as it will determine how vulnerable you&#39;ve been to the decades-long propaganda machine.  </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say that you&#39;re a dyed-in-the-wool progressive who considers himself &quot;anti-establishment&quot;. A proud freethinking liberal who&#39;s always felt comfortable in knowing that you&#39;re morally and intellectually superior to those &quot;deplorables&quot; who deigned to support someone so odious and reprehensible as that, &quot;Orange Rancid Sack of Pig Vomit&quot;.</p>

<p>Amirite?</p>

<p>When you&#39;re feeling a little more pretentious, you probably decry the whole left/right dialectic as being a tactic used by the TPTB to divide and conquer the sheeple. Ain&#39;t you hip.</p>

<p>Yet, you&#39;ll fall right into this trap while claiming to warn others. </p>

<p>Do you have enough self-awareness to understand the hypocrisy of your words and actions?</p>

<p>Listen, I don&#39;t want you to think that I&#39;m picking on you, however, I do want you to be aware of your own elitism, which is why I replied to your comments in the first place.</p>

<p>This whole &quot;Russiagate&quot; narrative being pushed by the Democrats is just as abhorrent as the Republican witch-hunt on the Clintons during the nineties. And I&#39;m no fan of them either.</p>

<p>What the OP was pointing out, and rightly so, is that many (too many) on the left are becoming irrational to the point of madness with regards to Trump and this whole Russian collusion nonsense. And yes, it is objectively, rationally, and factually, nonsensical. And you don&#39;t have to be a Trump supporter to understand that.</p>

<p>The cognitive dissonance many experienced on election night has obviously affected people&#39;s mental health, the consequences of which we&#39;ve yet to fully realize. And we haven&#39;t even gotten to 2018 yet... when the bad acid trip of revelations coming down will make November 2016 look like a mellow high. </p>

<p>For this reason alone, you should be very concerned about your own ignorance regarding all of this.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like, I can submit some information for your consideration. However, I&#39;m having serious doubts that you&#39;d read it anyway.</p>

<p>Enjoy your cognitive dissonance, but when it all goes down, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its best not to conflate the russian election meddling and the Trump/Russia collusion narratives. Russia and many other countries most certainly attempt to run influence campaigns and test the strength of our election security. Election &quot;meddling&quot; is a valid concern but I think the MSM is disingenuous when they only point the figure at Russia and not any other countries.</p>

<p>Now when it comes to Trump Colluding with Russia to meddle in the election, I am highly skeptical of the idea. It certainly would have much more credibility if the FBI and Mueller didn&#39;t have such a tainted reputation. The main issue here is that people want to use Trump&#39;s somewhat shady/corrupt business and political dealings with Russia, as proof of collusion with the Russians to affect the election or that Trump is a puppet for the Kremlin. Trump probably could be impeached and removed from office for these crimes but if that&#39;s the goal then those people need to get away from this election meddling collusion narrative. At this point the term Russian-Collusion is so ingrained in everyone&#39;s minds that they can easily dismiss it, so if you want to accuse Trump of a different form of corruption you need to be very precise in defining what type of Russia Collusion you are referring to or just use a different vocabulary to make the argument.</p>

<p>Is Trump compromised on the same level as previous Presidents? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia is a Slavic nation. Slavs are a race. Like Asian. Like blacks. And yes I know what Jim Crow is. Unjust laws that are based on race. Unjust laws which suppress people because of skin colour, allowing racist and corrupt elite to remain wealthy and powerful through state intervention. If you were white and complained about the injustice you were a niggar lover and destroyed/kilked.</p>

<p>As for FBI warning the DNC, then it is the DNC fault for not listening. Perhaps then we won&#39;t have only CrowdStrike&#39;s dodgy report to rely upon. And the FBI warning still does answer why the DNC didn&#39;t turn over servers for the FBI to inspect after the event. What did they have to lose? The FBI confirming hack took place?</p>

<p>And the United States has a long history with Russia preceding the Bolshevik revolution. Most of it was friendly, with czarist Russia if anything helping the fledging country.</p>

It&#39;s obvious that the dude has something major to hide and it&#39;s more than likely because of flat out corruption. He&#39;s been doing business with foreign countries for years. He&#39;s taken money from countries like Saudi Arabia and then only a few months into his presidency, he and Congress approved a 110 billion dollar weapons deal with them to carry on their genocide against Yemen. But no one cares because Saudi Arabia is our oil Ally and Russia is an easy scapegoat. Were they involved? Sure, yes, absolutely. Is Trump Putin&#39;s puppet? I have yet to see any indication of that. He&#39;s handling this really poorly though. Maybe he should have just released his tax returns like everyone else to clear the air but no just take his word for it that he&#39;s clean! Russia isn&#39;t the threat it once was during the cold war. America is going to lose (I think it already has because of this presidency) it&#39;s sole superpower slot on the world stage to China.
Bottom line, there are plenty of ways to go after Trump and get him indicted and impeached but the establishment hears no evil and sees no evil when it comes to US &quot;allies&quot; like SA. </p>

<p>Steve Bannon said the following this week:</p>

<p>Michael Flynn has admitted speaking with Russians about sanctions to the FBI </p>

<p>The Trump team has both admitted that they were and weren’t involved in the platform change in the Ukraine</p>

<p>There’s verifiable proof that most senior Trump officials helped spread the fake TruePundit story (with the help of agents in the NY FBI office, NYPD, Jeanine Pirro) that led to Clinton’s emails getting reopened for investigation (which subsequently led to nothing but arguably swung the election</p>

<p>The mods here can&#39;t put an actual prohibition on it, the users here are too anti-censorship to get away with that, but they do as much as they can. This post is basically the top mod outlining the official <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> narrative.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you forgetting what the GOP did only 1 election ago to Ron Paul?</p>

<p>They literally changed the rules mid election to stop him from gaining delegates at the pace he was.</p>

<p>They were going to change that rule back this election to stop Trump but realized they were already too late and were stuck with him.</p>

<p>Both parties do fucked up shit to try and pick the candidate they want.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll never forgive the DNC for what they did, I&#39;ll never stop bringing it up.</p>

<p>But we currently have a president compromised by outside influence that worked to fuck with our election, we know this, we need to deal with it. Hillary has no power anymore</p>

<p>What deflecting? Are you unable to follow an argument?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re talking about Trump/Russian connections and collusion and you deflect to &#39;Isn&#39;t HRC bad too?&#39;. The definition of deflection, who gives a fuck about HRC, this discussion is on Trump/Russia and how dirty those connections are, HRC is a different discussion all together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell me WTF any of this has to do with alleged collusion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russian money laundering? Property laundering? Manafort, the campaign manager, and his Russian ties? That is DIRECTLY what the discussion is about (Trump/Russia connections and collusion). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yes, we&#39;ve seen you&#39;re &#39;evidence&#39;, and we conclude that it is non-existent. I&#39;ve seen all those arguments a million times, repeating them doesn&#39;t make them any less rubbish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God, it&#39;s like talking to a brick wall. What happened to users here being open minded and actually thinking logically instead of thinking based on political party lines? Can&#39;t you see past the red and blue? If you&#39;re going to be a political hack and not be open minded, maybe T_D is more suited for your silo&#39;d thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, there&#39;s more evidence it was a leak. Now I&#39;ll sit back and watch you deny that one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck are you getting on about? What was I denying before? You&#39;re literally the only one denying things and deflecting away from the topic of the thread. JFC you trolls are annoying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We were once respected worldwide and all Western leaders looked to us as the leaders of the free world and NATO. Now they&#39;re appalled and embarassed. The guy was accused of raping a 13 year old, and there are piles of other complaints. </p>

<p>Man, I don&#39;t even know where to begin. </p>

<p>Someone very close to me has a twitching condition. Our president mocked a guy with disabilities on national TV. &quot;Grab em by the pussy?&quot; All, what, 25 women are lying about Trump assaulting him? I believe the one woman who claimed Bill did, but I should believe that all those women are liars and he&#39;s totally a good dude- even though I&#39;ve heard him say that &quot;he just starts kissing, doesn&#39;t even wait....grab em by the pussy.&quot; </p>

<p>He excused Putin for &quot;killing journalists who disagree with him.&quot; That should send red flags up for any Patriot. </p>

<p>He&#39;s giving working people, perhaps, a temporary tax cut, while slashing the taxes of corporations and the ultra-rich. This will be paid for by slashes to medicare and social security. </p>

<p>He seems to make policy decisions based on Fox News. He trusts Putin more than American intelligence sources. </p>

<p>America first? What a load of bullshit! The first sentence he commuted was of a wealthy businessman who got raided by the feds who found 400 illegals working in his plant! He lied to the people who voted for him. </p>

<p>Joe Arpaio is like a cartoon villian, but because he and Trump are birthers and are &quot;tough on illegals&quot; he pardoned him. The guy bragged about running &quot;concentration camps&quot; in the desert where he recorded the heat got up to 130 degrees if I remember correctly. </p>

<p>He&#39;s said his twitter rants are official presidential statements. Woops! Except the one where he implicated himself in a crime stating he knew the FBI was lied to. He totally didn&#39;t write that one. It&#39;s one fucking embarassment after another. </p>

<p>Whatever happened to diplomacy- speak softly and carry a big stick? This guy is on Twitter mocking the leader of N. Korea calling him &quot;short and fat&quot; or something. </p>

<p>I could go on and on. Have you seen idiocracy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, good. You took the bait and responded, so I can further clarify my deliberately snarky comments.</p>

<p>First of all, you may be &quot;well known&quot; around this particular shallow pond, but you&#39;re certainly not &quot;well informed&quot; enough to swim in deeper waters. Be careful if you do, however, as you might get swallowed by a much larger fish.</p>

<p>Just because someone is new to reddit, does not mean that they&#39;re new to the world of conspiracy. This assumption alone shows your lack of critical thinking skills.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Yeah look at my name dumbass.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did. And isn&#39;t it ironic that your name (SmedleysButler) implies that you&#39;re at least superficially aware of a past presidential coup attempt, yet obviously completely unaware of a similar attempt happening right in front of you. And yes, orchestrated by the same forces (in spirit) as those who conspired to take down Roosevelt.
But then, maybe you&#39;re living in the past, making you unaware of the present.</p>

<p>The line of apostolic succession, politically speaking if you&#39;ll excuse the mixed metaphor, is clear. But I seriously doubt you&#39;ll understand that or make the connection. </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;m sure we can agree on is that neither of us is a fan of Trump. I&#39;m almost certain that statement is a surprise to you, as you probably also made the assumption that I was a Trumpster.</p>

<p>I am not, however, I do understand who his enemies are in the establishment. And yes, the term, &quot;establishment&quot;, is key here.</p>

<p>Are you establishment? Be honest and thoughtful in how you answer that, as it will determine how vulnerable you&#39;ve been to the decades-long propaganda machine.  </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say that you&#39;re a dyed-in-the-wool progressive who considers himself &quot;anti-establishment&quot;. A proud freethinking liberal who&#39;s always felt comfortable in knowing that you&#39;re morally and intellectually superior to those &quot;deplorables&quot; who deigned to support someone so odious and reprehensible as that, &quot;Orange Rancid Sack of Pig Vomit&quot;.</p>

<p>Amirite?</p>

<p>When you&#39;re feeling a little more pretentious, you probably decry the whole left/right dialectic as being a tactic used by the TPTB to divide and conquer the sheeple. Ain&#39;t you hip.</p>

<p>Yet, you&#39;ll fall right into this trap while claiming to warn others. </p>

<p>Do you have enough self-awareness to understand the hypocrisy of your words and actions?</p>

<p>Listen, I don&#39;t want you to think that I&#39;m picking on you, however, I do want you to be aware of your own elitism, which is why I replied to your comments in the first place.</p>

<p>This whole &quot;Russiagate&quot; narrative being pushed by the Democrats is just as abhorrent as the Republican witch-hunt on the Clintons during the nineties. And I&#39;m no fan of them either.</p>

<p>What the OP was pointing out, and rightly so, is that many (too many) on the left are becoming irrational to the point of madness with regards to Trump and this whole Russian collusion nonsense. And yes, it is objectively, rationally, and factually, nonsensical. And you don&#39;t have to be a Trump supporter to understand that.</p>

<p>The cognitive dissonance many experienced on election night has obviously affected people&#39;s mental health, the consequences of which we&#39;ve yet to fully realize. And we haven&#39;t even gotten to 2018 yet... when the bad acid trip of revelations coming down will make November 2016 look like a mellow high. </p>

<p>For this reason alone, you should be very concerned about your own ignorance regarding all of this.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like, I can submit some information for your consideration. However, I&#39;m having serious doubts that you&#39;d read it anyway.</p>

<p>Enjoy your cognitive dissonance, but when it all goes down, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.</p>
