<p>China is poised to launch the Petroyuan in 2018. I&#39;m not an economist, but as I understand it, this system will allow oil-based futures contracts to be exchanged for Yuan, which will also be fully convertible into gold.</p>

<p>We know that many of the wars of the past several decades have been fought to maintain American economic power, specifically protecting and propping up the Petrodollar.</p>

<p>So, short of starting WW3 (which is still a possibility), how does the USA ensure that they stay number one?</p>

<p>You introduce exotic technology that you&#39;ve been keeping secret for the past 70 years, including a new energy system that renders oil effectively obsolete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm.  This is an angle I hadn&#39;t considered before, and definitely has some merit.  But, I think it&#39;s more likely we&#39;ll see WwIII and a new global fiat currency instead.</p>

<p>The reason I think this is that US hegemony is really just a front operation to mask the true PTB.  And TPTB don&#39;t care so much about the details of their front - they really just care about maintaining control.  So it really doesn&#39;t matter if the number 1 economy is US or China or whomever.  The goal is to keep the fiat currency scam in operation, and eventually replace it with a true global fiat currency that supercedes the currency of any particular nation.</p>

<p>One thing we need to consider on the flip side of all of this is that these technologies may possibly be &quot;beyond&quot; our current layman understanding of things like interstellar travel, routes, mapping, etc. Hell, even trying to predict what &quot;the singularity&quot; will be like is next to impossible, and you don&#39;t need to bring aliens into the mix for that.</p>

<p>And while we don&#39;t have official confirmation of aliens, we have tacit confirmation.. so things are weird and impossible to predict, but thank you for discussing with me!</p>

<p>I enjoyed <a href="/u/VenomousVoice">/u/VenomousVoice</a> &#39;s comment very much, I couldn&#39;t have phrased it better. Still I think your OP and his comment aren&#39;t incompatible, as this OP might officially describe one day how/why the disclosure happened in the first place (e.g. 21st century &quot;race to alien technology&quot; vs &quot;20th century space race&quot;, &quot;weapons race&quot;, etc.).</p>

<p>But I think you are both missing an important factor: this will not merely be a question of technology. I will be a profound hermetic/spiritual/occult &quot;new age&quot; (in addition to political, monetary, etc.). It will be called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_%28Thelema%29">aeon of horus</a> or something equivalent. This is what they&#39;ve been preparing for, at least since Blavatsky.</p>

<p>I am right there with you on the hermetic stuff too, but didn&#39;t want to head in that direction for the purposes of the OP.</p>

<p>So, what do you think? Is some switch going to get flipped and we all &quot;ascend&quot; to the next plane, or will it be more gradual? Will it be more of a societal shift, where, freed from the stresses of acquiring resources to survive, we are able to explore consciousness without social rebuke?</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/username/high%20level%20insider/">High Level Insider</a> Talked about this... especially his discussion on <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/space%20elevator/username/high%20level%20insider/">Space Elevators</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You introduce exotic technology that you&#39;ve been keeping secret for the past 70 years, including a new energy system that renders oil effectively obsolete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really &quot;secret&quot; but outside of coherence of consciousness.  Keep people fighting over trivial shit so they cant figure out how to solve problems.  We already have the technology available to do this today.   You can replace the petrodollar with the Solar Dollar quite easily do away with wars.  You would need to Build <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2402141/Plugged-sun-Solar-panel-satellite-beam-THIRD-humanitys-power-Earth-2025-claims-Nasa-engineer.html">these</a> and send them in space with a <a href="https://newfederalistpapers.joomla.com/11-orbitalring">Space Elevator</a></p>

<p>For those of you that doubt that we can build a Low Earth Orbit Space Elevator - Nasa states that we have the ability to build one today with existing materials <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20000105202.pdf">Link to NASA PDF</a></p>

<p>This is the reason we exist here.</p>

<p>A theory, simple and concisely stated. It&#39;s not insane. it&#39;s ideal to the conditions of &#39;real-politik, and follows the inherent nature of war-machines needing oil = war-machines and their fuel is power presence = petrol-dollar is power.</p>

<p>Remove the war-machine from oil. Oil is now only necessary to run a domestic industry that has been primed for decades to worry about &#39;carbon emissions&#39;. While the rest of the nations now trade it in surplus - the way we keep strato-bombers by the thousands in depots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm,considering the petrodollar is no longer a thing referred to by anyone in power anymore, USAs current socioeconomic internal status, their political game on international forum. And the almost stupid military expansion towards borders of russia and china, all means USA isnt number one anymore. But uS is a former world superpower and still a strong and powerful nation, so the question should be, will it fight back to global Number 1 status? ww3, we are already in multiple, economic and trade wars, we are in an informational propaganda war, we are in economic war, and itching towards actual military conflict. </p>

<p>The current elite of US empire, global elite, asian and russia powers. There isnt enough room on global markets for this many leaders in economic growths and global main reserve currency (currently its still US, but Yuan is second.) </p>

<p>Plus US has really ran out of countries to exploit, Iraq was the last one, then it was meant to be syria but russia stopped that. All other developing countries, dont have the wealth US can extract easily (iraw had already had the infrastructure for oil extraction). So it is left exploiting its own land for wealth greed (the bailouts for example, gave money to rich from the rest and nobody was punished for the criminal behaviour). </p>

<p>So in my opinion, trump is that ease of american people into the realisation that US is no longer #1, hasnt been on many markers on global prosperity rankings. Economy is one factor, and thats being help up by threads of support and lies (just like the market was behaving before the house bubble popped, US markets are acting like that atm, preventing total loss, abrupt recession/depression). </p>
