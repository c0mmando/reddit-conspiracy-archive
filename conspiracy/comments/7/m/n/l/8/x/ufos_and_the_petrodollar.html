       I wanted to share a theory I've been toying with, and get some new perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       China is poised to launch the Petroyuan in 2018. I'm not an economist, but as I understand it, this system will allow oil-based futures contracts to be exchanged for Yuan, which will also be fully convertible into gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that many of the wars of the past several decades have been fought to maintain American economic power, specifically protecting and propping up the Petrodollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, short of starting WW3 (which is still a possibility), how does the USA ensure that they stay number one?
      </p>
      <p>
       You introduce exotic technology that you've been keeping secret for the past 70 years, including a new energy system that renders oil effectively obsolete.

       Interesting, she apparently also predicted that China would surpass the USA as a super power in 2018 as well. At least, according to an article I read that is what she said... trying to find the actual quote from her if possible.

       Hmm.  This is an angle I hadn't considered before, and definitely has some merit.  But, I think it's more likely we'll see WwIII and a new global fiat currency instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I think this is that US hegemony is really just a front operation to mask the true PTB.  And TPTB don't care so much about the details of their front - they really just care about maintaining control.  So it really doesn't matter if the number 1 economy is US or China or whomever.  The goal is to keep the fiat currency scam in operation, and eventually replace it with a true global fiat currency that supercedes the currency of any particular nation.

       That's my other thought, is that WW3 is all but unavoidable at this point, and when the missiles fly, the space bros will show up and disable the nukes (hopefully before any manage to hit their target).

       So, to stop people from thinking it's Jesus or something, they told everyone about the UFOs.

       Only prob with this line of thought that I can see is: if aliens are intent on saving us from destroying ourselves and/or the planet, wtf are they waiting for??  I spose it's possible that due to some galactic regulation they have to have consent from world leaders before revealing themselves, but still...

       In the long run, if humans vanished or all died, the earth and the environment would be fine. So there's that.

       For the intervention part, maybe there are only certain scenarios that they would step in for, and maybe global nuclear war is one of them?

       we begin a nuclear war? What if they'll just let it happen and have it do it ourselves? They could just as well be a neutral party.

       Presumably they are enlightened enough that they see the value of life, and are aware that the vast majority of humanity has no say or control over if we have a nuclear war. So, I really don't see them wiping us out.

       Sure, but those are human concepts. Who is to say intelligence, or an intelligent society, doesn't reach a point where morality becomes obsolete and the best path forward is to let nature take its course and just stand aside.

       Hmm..my only issue with this is simply that we just don't know if there is enough intelligent life out there. All of the stars we see in our sky are only from our Milky Way galaxy and we haven't even mapped 1% of life sustaining star systems in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may be millions if not billions more galaxies brimming with intelligent space faring life. Scarcity is an issue for us because we've only just begun.

       Billions is a stretch, but the gist of your comment is correct. However, FTL is possible through an alcubierre drive and it seems likely that an advanced society would figure this out. We're probably less than a hundred years from doing it ourselves even without potential alien help.

       So it's fine without us , great, so what? So what's the the point of earth's existence if no sentient intelligent life is here to enjoy it as their home? And on that note what's the point of humaity working to improve enviroments if we are gonna get wiped out?

      <p>
       Just general questions to consider.

       Also the  the odds intelligent Alien's timelines match up with modern humans Earth is astronomically low , basicaly a mathematical impossibility.

       Consider the billions of years of time and  infinite distance of space, finding another intelligent life form who are technologically advanced at the same time as us ? C'mon, any disclosure is either Bluebeam or extradimensional Demons

       Asteroid mining. With the alcubierre drive tech likely involved you could form a mining cartel operating at near zero cost, generating trillions of dollars. And you could have a monopoly defended by US. UFO tech (I'm sure we're the only ones with it) and space defenses.

       I do think that is a given based on humanities track record, but if we somehow get benevolent super intelligence, I don't think inequality will be a thing. I mean.. once it's smart enough it can overthrow any human faction seeking to use it at leverage.

       What makes you think that AIs will become self aware enough to change their goals from what their makers set? Seems more likely that the AI just gets super competent at any task it's set up to do. Not unlike how some autistic people are.

       Automation and relatively fast transport has already brought us to relative superabundance. The distribution is skewed and we still struggle because of lifestyle creep but on a macro scale our existence has improved. So I do believe that instantaneous travel and free energy might improve. But it won't completely flatten the power paradigm because people can still exert power through the flow of commodities and manufacturing.

       I think also that we naturally desire some sort of heirarchy - but I again I do hope for a future where, while there will certainly still be inequality - it won't be the kind that we have today. If I am good at science and from a rural village in (insert poor country here), I will do science because there is enough abundance to provide a life for my family, who can also travel the stars if they so choose.

       Even if we do have warp drives we'd have to scout out planets and plan trips before risking trips. You can't be like one of those pre-WW2 pilots just soloing everywhere. Unless the aliens already have routes and maps and shit to help navigate, in that case we can be solo pilots all we want assuming the tech trickles down to us proles.

       All good points. Hopefully we reverse engineered their navigation systems / deciphered their maps too though :P
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing we need to consider on the flip side of all of this is that these technologies may possibly be "beyond" our current layman understanding of things like interstellar travel, routes, mapping, etc. Hell, even trying to predict what "the singularity" will be like is next to impossible, and you don't need to bring aliens into the mix for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while we don't have official confirmation of aliens, we have tacit confirmation.. so things are weird and impossible to predict, but thank you for discussing with me!

       That place seems more about conventional space than the warp tech. But I'm sure their endgame would be similar and equally implausible. If you want to know how it will really turn out, look at Africa and the DeBeers cartel.

       I suppose so. But we don't know of the safeguards that would be put in place, how it'd be run, or on what basis, because with the proper oversight and execution, I believe it's somewhat possible. However that'd require some things to be fixed with the current government, and that's a major understatement.

       Yeah but it's a lot more fun to envision some Martian wild west that's mostly untamed besides the mining towns. Like a 21st century gold rush.

       Whether ufos are ET in origin or just blackbook tech that's been kept from us, id never considered that maybe the technology to free us from oil wasn't just being withheld for the sake of continuing our dependence on oil, but as a wild card for when another currency became the standard exchange for it.

       OP I think you might enjoy [my post yesterday] on CST about how the full-blown UFO "disclosure" might happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoyed
       <a href="/u/VenomousVoice">
        /u/VenomousVoice
       </a>
       's comment very much, I couldn't have phrased it better. Still I think your OP and his comment aren't incompatible, as this OP might officially describe one day how/why the disclosure happened in the first place (e.g. 21st century "race to alien technology" vs "20th century space race", "weapons race", etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think you are both missing an important factor: this will not merely be a question of technology. I will be a profound hermetic/spiritual/occult "new age" (in addition to political, monetary, etc.). It will be called the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_%28Thelema%29">
        aeon of horus
       </a>
       or something equivalent. This is what they've been preparing for, at least since Blavatsky.

       I am right there with you on the hermetic stuff too, but didn't want to head in that direction for the purposes of the OP.

      <p>
       So, what do you think? Is some switch going to get flipped and we all "ascend" to the next plane, or will it be more gradual? Will it be more of a societal shift, where, freed from the stresses of acquiring resources to survive, we are able to explore consciousness without social rebuke?

       I think my experience will not necessarily be the same as your experience. We both live in different (internal) universes. Our universes may intersect once in a while, such as when we speak together. But the notion you still are in my universe while I have no relation/interaction with you, is an illusion.

       Therefore, whatever happens entirely and wholly depends on us.

       A US company called Brilliant Light Power claims to be very close to a so cheap it might as well be free energy generator based on novel physics.

       A theory, simple and concisely stated. It's not insane. it's ideal to the conditions of 'real-politik, and follows the inherent nature of war-machines needing oil = war-machines and their fuel is power presence = petrol-dollar is power.

      <p>
       Remove the war-machine from oil. Oil is now only necessary to run a domestic industry that has been primed for decades to worry about 'carbon emissions'. While the rest of the nations now trade it in surplus - the way we keep strato-bombers by the thousands in depots.

       Hmm,considering the petrodollar is no longer a thing referred to by anyone in power anymore, USAs current socioeconomic internal status, their political game on international forum. And the almost stupid military expansion towards borders of russia and china, all means USA isnt number one anymore. But uS is a former world superpower and still a strong and powerful nation, so the question should be, will it fight back to global Number 1 status? ww3, we are already in multiple, economic and trade wars, we are in an informational propaganda war, we are in economic war, and itching towards actual military conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current elite of US empire, global elite, asian and russia powers. There isnt enough room on global markets for this many leaders in economic growths and global main reserve currency (currently its still US, but Yuan is second.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus US has really ran out of countries to exploit, Iraq was the last one, then it was meant to be syria but russia stopped that. All other developing countries, dont have the wealth US can extract easily (iraw had already had the infrastructure for oil extraction). So it is left exploiting its own land for wealth greed (the bailouts for example, gave money to rich from the rest and nobody was punished for the criminal behaviour).
      </p>
      <p>
       So in my opinion, trump is that ease of american people into the realisation that US is no longer #1, hasnt been on many markers on global prosperity rankings. Economy is one factor, and thats being help up by threads of support and lies (just like the market was behaving before the house bubble popped, US markets are acting like that atm, preventing total loss, abrupt recession/depression).

       I do think that is a given based on humanities track record, but if we somehow get benevolent super intelligence, I don't think inequality will be a thing. I mean.. once it's smart enough it can overthrow any human faction seeking to use it at leverage.

However that'd require some things to be fixed with the current government, and that's a major understatement.
