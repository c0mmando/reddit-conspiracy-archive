<p>The title if this video is literally about how the US military is fighting the opium trade. So, are they fighting against it, it protecting it?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Look, people there are just trying to survive. Opium is a cash crop, like tabbaco was for the US about 70 years ago. Yeah, we we&#39;re at one time trying to get the society to start being self sufficient and grow domestic crops but 1) it doesn&#39;t make enough money even after the substaties 2) no country wants someone to come in and tell them what to do (see IMF)</p>

<p>&lt;Of course, we know the poppy farmers obviously never switched to grains or vegetables given that the opium industry is at an all time high, and of course, the US military is still there. Therefore, years after restoring the poppy/opium industry,  the US government is either still guarding the fields, or it has eliminated the threat to the fields and no longer needs to guard them.</p>

<p>Here is where your logic is wrong. It is not illegal to grow opium in AF, it never was just highly discouraged. If opium is found during an OP or suspected in financing terrorism it is burned. I&#39;ve seen thousands of tons if this stuff burned from my 6 years in deployments there. </p>

<p>This is false. Probably because there was no way to track this information at the high of Taliban rule as technology was discouraged. If you want a conspiracy, President Karzai&#39;s brother was the biggest manufacturer and distributer if both raw opium and herion. The herion factory was in jalalabad, and he used the Taliban to move the product out of the country. Any reports with this info we&#39;re kicked back, and we we&#39;re told to erase it. His brother died I&#39;d strange circumstances, his driver if 30 years allegedly killed him, and then was killed himself. </p>

<p>In Kabul there is a area where are the mansions are, called &#39;the opium highway&#39; where all the drug lords live. </p>

<p>Yes, we marched through opium fields and protected villages that grew opium, but the actual opium was never protected. In fact, all fighting from the various terrorist groups stop during the opium harvest session which lasts 3 weeks. </p>

<p>Does the opium industry benefit? Yes, but it&#39;s not even close to the main product produced in the ag industry, just the most profitable. Opium can only grow in the west and the mid east of the region due to climate reasons. Think that all innovations made in Afghanistan is only to promote the opium industry is obtuse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that&#39;s more evidence that the opium provides funding for the US itself now. It might seem trivial compared to the US economy and defense budget, but keep in mind that money that comes from below like this is much more useful for funding black projects. There are already pesky journalists pointing out that trillions go missing from the US. Opium money never reaches the surface to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two reasons:
1. We&#39;re not just talking about massive corruption, we&#39;re talking about millions of people dying or suffering, so why would anyone laugh about all that?
2. Try going to your friends and family and saying, &quot;The US soldiers are guarding the poppy fields. No really. Some guy on the Internet says that he has a friend who says that he has hundreds of pictures of it, and ... um ...  he thought it was pretty funny.&quot;</p>
