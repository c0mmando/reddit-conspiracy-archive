<p>His claim that some people thought this was the DOD confirming Q and it wasn&#39;t, is correct.</p>

<p>My point is Q never posted that pic to show is credibility in the first place. He opened his first post on 4Chan with the same picture. I think it was just because that raid happened on Christmas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that it does not change the fact the MAJORITY see this as confirmation. It comes off as deceiving. He should be the one explaining what your trying to explain. And to be honest this is the first I&#39;m hearing of his first 4chan post &quot;coincidence&quot;. He should have made what your saying clear by saying it himself once people started using it as confirmation. If he has and I missed it please bless me with a link, because again i stopped giving a fuck.</p>

<p>IMO It seems to me he isn&#39;t straight forward regarding any of the proclaimed info hes providing because it allows for him to dance around it when hes wrong.</p>

<p>Not sure we have any proof of that but maybe. The ones who really understand Q don&#39;t for sure.</p>

<p>You&#39;re misunderstanding. It is a coincidence, that is what I&#39;m saying. This wasn&#39;t meant to be proof he&#39;s credible. It isn&#39;t used as confirmation of anything. Whoever is doing this (larp or not) just likes the picture.</p>

<p>Well then according to you, the ones who really don&#39;t understand Q are highly regarded Youtuber&#39;s who are pushing this info to thousands of subscribers. This is how I actually first heard of this. I.E Jordan over @ DestroyingTheIllusion, TracyBeanz ETC...</p>

<p>It really is a brilliant marketing strategy.  Give people just enough so they do the creative work, A/B test it, and take it viral.  For free!!</p>
