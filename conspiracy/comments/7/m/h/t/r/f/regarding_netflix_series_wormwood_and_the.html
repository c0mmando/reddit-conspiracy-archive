        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In an episode, the journalist Seymour Hersch quickly talks about how other suicides and mysterious deaths became uncovered in his investigation. Quick flashes of news articles, showing what I would assume to be the headlines of the deaths he was referring to, show up on the screen. However, I was trying to see if there was any articles or investigations of these deaths online or why they might be considered suspicious. Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never know what to trust in this new wave of docudramas. Considering the content (both true and false) I just can&#39;t help but feel there is some sort of gatekeeper role with any show involving intelligence agencies behaving badly.</p>

<p>As to any additional deaths related to MKULTRA I&#39;m pretty sure Ewan Cameron must have killed someone with his wacky &quot;experiments&quot; but thats not quite the same as murdering someone to silence them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you catch that during the interview with Eric, the clock is permanently stuck at 2:33, which is the time that his father officially died. That small little tidbit proves to me that he has inserted information non-verbally into certain scenes of this show. What I would look for is at the very end of the last episode, it shows his father teaching him how to swim in a lake. There is a sequence of letters that flash by really fast on the left hand side vertically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the series, but I&#39;m not remembering the exact moment you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>But what it could be is the 1951 Point Saint Espirit event, where a sizable portion of the town&#39;s population went insane - at least seven people died. It&#39;s been alleged, with enough evidence that warrants the theory to be taken seriously, this was an early test from the collection of projects that would become MKULTRA.</p>

<p>UFO realist Jack Brewer speculates Olson may have had a degree of involvement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s in one of the final episodes. He talks about how investigating this case puts other cases in a different light and headlines start showing. I know one is a UN official of some sort and there were some others. Just looking for links to news stories or facts surrounding each death. Trying to determine if this statement had some merit or he was just making an exaggerated statement to add effect.</p>
