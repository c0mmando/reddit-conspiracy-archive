        concerns of weed scientists at the university of Arkansas, Mizzou, and elsewhere
       </a>
       were gaining traction around the end of october, and if you look around some of the more popular

        alt "news"
       </a>
       and conspiracy spots, the unprecedented resurgence of a soon to be irrelevant glyphosphate conspiracy appears to coincide. I think monsanto was behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The EPA's approval of dicamba
       <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-and-states-collective-efforts-lead-regulatory-action-dicamba">
        has been restricted
       </a>
       as a result of the controversy regarding volatility (how far it spreads after you spray it,) i thought i read something about it causing rashes too. iirc, the brand name was nemastrike.
      </p>
      <p>
       It almost slipped through the cracks though. Monsanto and one other company were on a warpath to discredit every person and study refuting it's findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Volatility seems like a pretty simple things to measure. If this formulation of dicamba doesnt end up making it through or gets revoked completely in the long run, I'm sure a perfectly logical explanation of the way Monsanto was able to fudge the numbers enough to get through the EPA in the first place will be provided.

       So were you deliberately lying to make it seem worse or did you just decide not to research your claim before you made it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if ypu would have researched him even the tiniest bit, you would have found information like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_R._Taylor">
         In 1999, a lawsuit (Alliance For Bio-Integrity v. Shalala and GAO report revealed considerable disagreement within the FDA concerning decisions about biotechnology products made during Taylor's tenure. The lawsuit and report also said that Taylor had recused himself from matters related to Monsanto’s BGH and had “never sought to influence the thrust or content” of the agency’s policies on Monsanto’s products.
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So if he recused himself from Monsanto related matters and "never sought to influence the thrust or content" of the agencies policies on Monsanto, is it really a conflict of interest?

       Yeah because that was in 1999. So what? he got backed into a corner and recused himself and thats supposed to make up for the decade he spent going through the revolving door before Obama appointed him? Why are you white Knighting for Michael R Taylor? An ex-Monsanto lobbyist should never have been appointed to an authoritative position within the FDA, I dont give a fuck what he recused himself of in 1999.

       It shows he was willing to recuse himself from "prominent" conflicts of interest, an act you accused him of.

       What exactly did he do wrong in the decade before Obama appointed him?

       Why are you lying about him and considering him guilty until proven innocent?

       That is your opinion. Obama had a different opinion. You don't know Michael Taylor, you don't know his motives or his expertise. You don't know the reasons why he was appointed to the position that he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's face it, you just view Monsanto as a big evil boogeyman and therefore conclude Michael R Taylor is guilty of secretly working to benefit Monsanto with no evidence to support it.

       How's dicamba the successor? It's ten years older than glyhposate and only works against dicotyledons, whereas glyphosate is also effective against monocotyledons.
