       Submission Statement: There are various angles and conspiracies here. Is Communism good/bad? Is War with N. Korea another Business Op for the M.I.C. done on Purpose? Can this lead to WW3 considering the proximity to Russia and the Chinese still doing business with Norks despite sanctions? Plenty to discuss and think about

       There's no way.  They already have the artillery pieces at the ready, and once they're in the air, there isn't much you can do about them.  Seoul is only 35 miles from the dmz.  It would take less than two days for them to turn it into a crater, according to my buddy who's a veteran of some intelligence branch or other of the army.

       America is in absolutely no danger because even Guam is 3,400 miles away, it's our Ally, South Korea, that's in the real danger.

       When I say liberation I'm talking about liberation from Kim Jung UN's oppressive regime. Probably the worst government on the planet when it comes to human rights.

       If we leave him long enough and allow him to carry on building his nuclear Arsenal then it becomes a of who lives and who's money (although the money is irrelevant IMO).

       How long before he decides to attack South Korea or Japan with nuclear weapons? How long until they can strike America?

       How many countries has DPRK invaded in yhe last 100 years? What about the US? Who is really a threat to global security. I bet if we quit provoking NK, putting their country under seige, starving their people, and threatening to attack them every day they would calm down a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you are so concerned about the NK people I encourage you to dedicate your life and resources to the cause instead of sending someone elses child to do your dirty work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its real easy to sit behind a keyboard and act tough. Its a whole other thing to walk that toughness. I dont blame you though. Im sure if you knew the suffering, divorces, kids growing up without fathers, soldiers frying their brains, and all the other horrible shit that cimes with war you would change your tune.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really encourage you to think about exactly what it is you are advocating for. If history is a guide we will only make the situation much worse.

       The main goal of the DPRK is the reunification of Korea under DPRK rule. If we suddenly stopped putting them under siege as you put it then they would likely invade the south. Its noty like we put sanctions on them for nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest your post I have as much right to comment and give my opinion on current events as anybody and I won't be guilt tripped into not doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes peopled will die. Its very sad,but if we leave them to their own devices like you suggest then those dead will be Americans or her allies and in a case of them vs us then I would much prefer the dead to be them.

       At the expense of killing untold thousands of innocent NK civilians?  It's very easy to be so aggressively pro-war when you don't have to worry about being harmed or involved in the conflict whatsoever.  Obviously Kim Jong-Un should be removed from power if he strikes first against the US, but the American military is sophisticated enough to take him out with minimal casualties.

       When a crazy guy has nukes and says he's gong to  use them, a few 1000 NK civilians seems okay to me.  Sorry, war is a game of numbers and sometimes that means their innocents get killed so that ours don't.

       this is the sad truth, but truth nonetheless.  of course everyone would wish that kim could be removed peacefully, but leaving him in power will cause generations of suffering - not just the untold thousands of NK civilians who are already suffering

       What's the alternative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanctions haven't worked and there's no sign that they ever will!.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been hoping the North Korean regime wil collapse for years ,talking tough and imposing more and more sanctions. The result, the people starve and now the regime has nuclear weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we just going to let him get a bigger and more powerful arsenal?
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we stop this from happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think war is inevitable. Its going to happen one day. The sooner its done the easier it will be. It will be easier to be beat them whilst they have 1 or 2 nukes farther than wait until they have 10 or 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe future generations of North Koreans will thank us.

       NK needs to be put to an end.  Today or tomorrow?  regardless its going to come to it sooner or later, so better now than when they are even more threatening
