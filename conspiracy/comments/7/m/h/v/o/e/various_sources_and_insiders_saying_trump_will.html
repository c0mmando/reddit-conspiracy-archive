<p>Submission Statement: There are various angles and conspiracies here. Is Communism good/bad? Is War with N. Korea another Business Op for the M.I.C. done on Purpose? Can this lead to WW3 considering the proximity to Russia and the Chinese still doing business with Norks despite sanctions? Plenty to discuss and think about </p>

Seoul is only 35 miles from the dmz.  It would take less than two days for them to turn it into a crater, according to my buddy who&#39;s a veteran of some intelligence branch or other of the army.</p>

<p>America is in absolutely no danger because even Guam is 3,400 miles away, it&#39;s our Ally, South Korea, that&#39;s in the real danger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many countries has DPRK invaded in yhe last 100 years? What about the US? Who is really a threat to global security. I bet if we quit provoking NK, putting their country under seige, starving their people, and threatening to attack them every day they would calm down a bit.</p>

<p>And if you are so concerned about the NK people I encourage you to dedicate your life and resources to the cause instead of sending someone elses child to do your dirty work.</p>

<p>Its real easy to sit behind a keyboard and act tough. Its a whole other thing to walk that toughness. I dont blame you though. Im sure if you knew the suffering, divorces, kids growing up without fathers, soldiers frying their brains, and all the other horrible shit that cimes with war you would change your tune.</p>

<p>I really encourage you to think about exactly what it is you are advocating for. If history is a guide we will only make the situation much worse.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The main goal of the DPRK is the reunification of Korea under DPRK rule. If we suddenly stopped putting them under siege as you put it then they would likely invade the south. Its noty like we put sanctions on them for nothing.</p>

<p>As for the rest your post I have as much right to comment and give my opinion on current events as anybody and I won&#39;t be guilt tripped into not doing so.</p>

<p>Yes peopled will die. Its very sad,but if we leave them to their own devices like you suggest then those dead will be Americans or her allies and in a case of them vs us then I would much prefer the dead to be them.</p>

It&#39;s very easy to be so aggressively pro-war when you don&#39;t have to worry about being harmed or involved in the conflict whatsoever.

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the alternative?</p>

<p>Sanctions haven&#39;t worked and there&#39;s no sign that they ever will!.</p>

<p>We have been hoping the North Korean regime wil collapse for years ,talking tough and imposing more and more sanctions. The result, the people starve and now the regime has nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Are we just going to let him get a bigger and more powerful arsenal?</p>

<p>How can we stop this from happening?</p>

<p>I think war is inevitable. Its going to happen one day. The sooner its done the easier it will be. It will be easier to be beat them whilst they have 1 or 2 nukes farther than wait until they have 10 or 20.</p>

<p>Maybe future generations of North Koreans will thank us.</p>
