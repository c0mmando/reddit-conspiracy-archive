<p>Last night my wife&#39;s phone, my phone, and our tablet all locked up and when we were able to restart them all of the batteries were completely drained. It happened to all of them at the same time. None of them were charging, all had battery life left. I was using my phone while my xbox was updating a game (which didn&#39;t have any issues). No other electronics flashed or dimmed or made a peep. The only thing I can think is that these 3 are all similar personal devices connected to the wifi. But, again, the xbox and my pc, which are also connected to the wifi, were unaffected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wonder if android was pushing an update.  Although I don&#39;t know all that much about the workings of android, I do know the battery level is subject to being flat wrong.  I had an android tablet (which I returned) that always showed 100% battery life, right up until the battery died.  Anywhere I checked (the home screen, the settings, etc.) all showed 100% all the time.  Otherwise, Android worked normally except that the battery only lasted 3 hours, so I returned it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Monitor your batery life.  A few weeks ago I was charging my phone and unplugged it at like 75%.  But when I unplugged it it went up to 100%.  A few days later I was charging it from off after I let it drain.  It was around 68% when I turned it on, and as soon as I did it jumped to 100%.  It&#39;s been draining quicker ever since.  LG Android.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things can be accidental software bugs since the chips need to be put into different low powered modes and if there is a bug in that then the chips can run at lower clock rates or stay in full powered mode permanently.  Also if you are being eavesdropped on then the battery is just going to drain faster.  Its just something to pay attention to.  Probably you shouldn&#39;t even be owning a smart phone but then the downside is that I don&#39;t get drunken spur of the moment calls from horny ex-girlfriends and my friends don&#39;t call me on the phone I don&#39;t have and they mostly refuse to remember how life was before.</p>

<p>normally my phone holds a charge for 24-36 hours unless im actively using it. this happened about 7 hours after coming off a charger.</p>

<p>my first thought is malware farming bitcoin, as there was a story about that just the other day, i assumed it was just a connection issue eating battery trying to keep a signal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be as simple as the cell tower we&#39;re at limit, since people are calling relatives. Your phone, since it was idle, was handed off to another free tower. And used more of it battery to get a signal. </p>

<p>I know the farther the tower your phone will use more power to try to get signal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check your wifi router logs. That will reveal everything each device did on the network and give you timestamps. It probably lists them by MAC address. </p>

<p>Check the network adapter logs on each of your devices. Not sure how to do it android, but do some homework and figure out what was going on on them. </p>

<p>You&#39;re NOT helpless. Educate yourselves a bit and use the tolls you are given. Don&#39;t just sit back and guess what coulda/shoulda/mighta happened. </p>
