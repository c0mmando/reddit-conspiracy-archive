       So, I posted this to
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       last night when it happened but didn't get much of anything in response. Thought I'd ask again here and see if any of you had ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night my wife's phone, my phone, and our tablet all locked up and when we were able to restart them all of the batteries were completely drained. It happened to all of them at the same time. None of them were charging, all had battery life left. I was using my phone while my xbox was updating a game (which didn't have any issues). No other electronics flashed or dimmed or made a peep. The only thing I can think is that these 3 are all similar personal devices connected to the wifi. But, again, the xbox and my pc, which are also connected to the wifi, were unaffected.

       Wonder if android was pushing an update.  Although I don't know all that much about the workings of android, I do know the battery level is subject to being flat wrong.  I had an android tablet (which I returned) that always showed 100% battery life, right up until the battery died.  Anywhere I checked (the home screen, the settings, etc.) all showed 100% all the time.  Otherwise, Android worked normally except that the battery only lasted 3 hours, so I returned it.

       I could see it being a weird battery issue with one device, maaaybe with two, but all three at the same time is just too much. It could have been an update, but I haven't been able to find anything about an update yesterday and they'll usually tell you they're updating or at least restart themselves.

       True.  I admit it's a longshot, but I just was wondering if they were pushing the same android update to the devices, and something was screwy with that update's battery level thingy.

       Mine started automatically updating by itself even though I have it to only do it manually. I managed to notice it quickly enough to stop it. My other phones wind up getting all fucky when I update them.

       Monitor your batery life.  A few weeks ago I was charging my phone and unplugged it at like 75%.  But when I unplugged it it went up to 100%.  A few days later I was charging it from off after I let it drain.  It was around 68% when I turned it on, and as soon as I did it jumped to 100%.  It's been draining quicker ever since.  LG Android.

       These things can be accidental software bugs since the chips need to be put into different low powered modes and if there is a bug in that then the chips can run at lower clock rates or stay in full powered mode permanently.  Also if you are being eavesdropped on then the battery is just going to drain faster.  Its just something to pay attention to.  Probably you shouldn't even be owning a smart phone but then the downside is that I don't get drunken spur of the moment calls from horny ex-girlfriends and my friends don't call me on the phone I don't have and they mostly refuse to remember how life was before.

       hmm interesting i work night and around 2-3 am iirc my phone just up and died battery wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       normally my phone holds a charge for 24-36 hours unless im actively using it. this happened about 7 hours after coming off a charger.
      </p>
      <p>
       my first thought is malware farming bitcoin, as there was a story about that just the other day, i assumed it was just a connection issue eating battery trying to keep a signal.

       My brothers galaxy s6 died and went black for no reason on dec 8th at a work hristmas party. It would not turn back on or charge. He got pissed and threw it at a wall, so I dont know if it would have worked again or not layer on, but it seems weird to happen to androids specifically.

       surveillance teams carry an item that can immediately drain batteries on portable devices.  Probably not this case assuming you aren't cooking meth or something.  Just throwing this out - but the firmware update seems more likely.

       That would be pretty weird. I'm pretty sure there's a meth house down the street, but I doubt anyone would be surveilling it on christmas day, especially since no one seems to be doing anything about it on non- holidays.

       It could be as simple as the cell tower we're at limit, since people are calling relatives. Your phone, since it was idle, was handed off to another free tower. And used more of it battery to get a signal.
      </p>

       I know the farther the tower your phone will use more power to try to get signal.

       Check your wifi router logs. That will reveal everything each device did on the network and give you timestamps. It probably lists them by MAC address.
      </p>

       Check the network adapter logs on each of your devices. Not sure how to do it android, but do some homework and figure out what was going on on them.
