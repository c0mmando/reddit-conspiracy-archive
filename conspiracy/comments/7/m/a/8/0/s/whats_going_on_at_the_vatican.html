        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Have you seen Paul the 6&#39;s Audience Hall in the Vatican?</p>

<p>The outside is reminiscent of a snake&#39;s head.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/0bOVm5e.png">https://i.imgur.com/0bOVm5e.png</a></p>

<p>The inside leaves no question.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kZaxVxM.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/kZaxVxM.jpg</a></p>

<p>In the center of the snake&#39;s mouth is &quot;The Resurrection&quot; by Fazzini.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/6iqpRX4.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/6iqpRX4.jpg</a></p>

<p>If you mirror the resurrection, you get a very clear image of Baphomet/Khnum.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/NK8ejtE.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/NK8ejtE.jpg</a></p>

<p>In fact, Khnum is from an ancient cult in Aswan, Egypt, where they used red granite quarries to build red granite obelisks. Eratosthenes used one of these red granite obelisks to measure the circumference of the earth, using it&#39;s shadow.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/79WOE2V.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/79WOE2V.jpg</a></p>

<p>The Vatican still has that red granite obelisk standing in front of it, today...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/30CMlHR.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/30CMlHR.jpg</a></p>

<p>The early incarnation of the Jesuits shaved off the writing somewhere between the 1400s and 1600s.</p>

<p>The red granite obelisk used to be in the Circus of Nero, where chariots would run people down in a track. This symbolism is referenced in a lot of places in modern times...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are lots of ancient texts describing &#39;lizard&#39; people and their attempt to invade human power circles. Whether it&#39;s true or not, is another story. It&#39;s definitely part of history, and mythology, but so is flat earth I guess. How do you debunk something like a reptilian race that would be living underground though, not as easy as flat earth given the instruments we have now? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I have no idea whether Reptilians (aka. humanoid reptiles) or anything of the sort exists or not. But lets just speculate for a moment. Imagine reptiles evolving into an intelligent, upright, humanoid species prior to mammals. What would have happened if reptiles evolved into an intelligent species rivalling current humans, much earlier than primates evolved into humans? Did an asteroid truly wipe out all the dinosaurs or did evolution continue at that point and created an intelligent reptilian humanoid sentient species?</p>

<p>Now if this were the case, it could mean a great, great deal of things, all of which are of course again speculation, yet interesting to think about. </p>

<p>Where would these reptilians have gone? Are they still here, but in the shadows, or perhaps in hiding, but from who? Have they perhaps intermixed with humans throughout history and are various myths and legends about such &quot;snake-men&quot; true and not fiction? Have they gone underground?</p>

<p>An interesting interview that I found on the Internet, is from a female reptilian called Lacerta. The interviewer claims that the interview is 100% genuine of course, but obviously you can&#39;t just believe things like this without question at face value. It involves a story of their evolution, their current existence underground, as well as contact with extraterrestrials that meddled with as well as helped various beings on this planet (including humans of course).</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think things were exactly like that, but despite that, in my opinion, based on my research I&#39;d say reality and our history is truly stranger than fiction. </p>

<p>But only time will tell. </p>

<p>Right now, these are simply speculations, ideas to play around with. There are likely more important things to focus on in the world at this point, like finding mutual compassion and creating a better society based on a paradigm of peace and bringing the insanities and evil of our society to light.</p>

<p>In spite of that, the reptilian stuff will always be intriguing to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve never read anything on the reptilians, just heard the word in conspiracy circles. I found this very interesting. I’ve only read part 1, and who knows if it’s truth or fiction but it definitely makes you think. </p>

<p>The part I found most interesting is how weak the human mind is and that other species may have power over it, makes you wonder what goes on around us that we don’t see or perceive.</p>

<p>The Papacy suppresses the Gnostic sect of Christianity--the true root of the religion; the analog to Rishi and Rishaka of ancient India.</p>

<p>Serpents are the symbol of the Syzygy, the Sun, the Moon; the wax and waning of bulls.</p>

<p>Demonizing snakes, the agathoi daimones themselves, the Papacy severs the species from its mother, the plants, the animals, the Gaia or Themis.</p>

<p>If you have eyes and ears that see and hear the truth, you will listen to the prophet of the Danu, the Kanaan, Knossos, Krete. I stand in accord with the ancients, my ancestors, the earth herself. I cannot be eclipsed, Moonlike.</p>

<p>I almost went into gnosticism here... but this isn&#39;t always the place. thank you for going there though.</p>

<p>To put it simply, because I do not have answers, I&#39;m saying you should be wary of the alternate reality that creates giant gold towers to be dominated by good or evil boogeymen in the days and nights of our consciousness. They don&#39;t have any better answers than the next guy.</p>

<p>I will say, though, no ideology or religion or, arguably, morality supersedes basic human decency. This applies to a personal interest in spiritual development, which I believe cannot truly be corrupted if done realizing do unto others as you would have them do unto you (&quot;you&quot; being a rigorously developed self [or lack thereof] and not a pile of puddy) is truly the most important commandment. </p>

Let alone the issue of why/who is making these videos at all. What person wants to make a video of cartoon characters eating feces and hurting themselves with pizza cutters?

<p>Now think back.  Anarchist&#39;s cookbook.  2600.  Waiting for porn pictures to appear.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s simply google elsa rule 34.  Quick internet is amazing.</p>

<p>Kids will find a way.  Would I want my 13 year old kid to watch it?  No.  But dude if you couldn&#39;t stop me at 13 what makes you think you could stop a 13 year old you?</p>

<p>Does your kid have a phone?  A friend?  A computer?  They&#39;ve already seen it all at 13.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re not retarded.</p>

<p>Also changing my response, yea watch it.  Learn what is out there.  I mean dude they&#39;ll find out at one point Santa isn&#39;t real and they aren&#39;t special.</p>

<p>Stop treating kids like they are complete idiots, they&#39;re sociopaths.  So teach them as they grow.  Yea go watch Elsa and Spiderman, but give them some toilet paper to clean up.  Grow.  Learn.</p>

Many shamans, not just in Egypt, are scorpios who are picked early on for this work. The shaman is tasked with venturing into the team of chaos and bringing back wisdom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was randomly watching a documentary yesterday on the Aztecs and Maya and the mysteries of the mesoamerican pyramids yesterday, and one thing that triggered something in my mind was when they were talking about the importance of sacrifices to the gods - whether animal or human. It made me wonder, what if the “Illuminati” are the good guys, continuing the sacrifices from ancient times to the old gods in order to keep balance on the planet, but as society has become more secular and political, the majority of the population would revolt against human sacrifice? So, not unlike in Cabin in the Woods, it’s a big ole conspiracy only because it needs to be done but in order for it to be done it must remain occulted (hidden)?
Could explain why the world is constantly churning out wars, too. I mean, the sacrifices surely must be proportionate to what the gods wish but also to our global population. And it’s a tidy solution for mass depopulation disguised in the theatre of politics etc. </p>

<p>I hope that makes sense...  it’s hard to explain! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps. Then again, if we are sacrificed to feed others, their attachment to life takes primacy over ours, and to concede their right to existence and deny our own denies the necessity of death for these allegedly &quot;higher&quot; entities. </p>

Throughout history many cultures have partaken in human sacrifice for the greater good, whether it be a good harvest season or to appease  volcano gods.

    <div class="md"><p>The reptilian theory is not one that I believe in, however the Resurrection sculpture does have a reptilian looking head, as noted by the OP.  That doesn&#39;t mean the church is run by reptilians.  And I would argue a secret reptilian race is not necessary for human corruption.  We do that just fine on our own.  I think its more likely that the sculpture&#39;s reptilian qualities simply fits the overall snake theme of the entire hall.  You can&#39;t deny that the Nervi Hall looks like a snake.  It&#39;s clearly a snake head.  Make of that what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It causes fearmongering; people come up with claims that are completely unsupported by the evidence, then twist the facts to push their agenda; imagine someone now tries to discredit the Vatican by claiming that the pope is a cultist? The evidence does not support this, but in our culture, making a claim is support in itself, and evidence is &quot;proof&quot; rather than something that contributes to the claim itself. That&#39;s what leads to people claiming the president is an alien, or that Jewish people worship Satan. Do you think that kind of thing is helpful? It just distracts from real conspiracies, and completely masks what might really be going on. It defeats the point of trying to &quot;expose&quot; something at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying that the evidence he presented could be interpreted to corroborate a preexisting case for the pope being a cultist, but it isn&#39;t strong enough to construe one. Imagine a man is on trial for murder. The victim was killed with a fencing rapier to the throat. Later you find that the man on trial is a fencer. It could certainly suggest that he killed the victim, but if it was the only evidence, no sane jury would convict him solely on that basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s totally fine. I may be hard on lexicon but if you can think how that would that reshape the meaning of what you said i guess you would understand why i made a point. Anyway i see you got the right ideas, i was not making a point for the pope being a cultist, just a logic one about way of expression which i think is important to be intended correctly.</p>

<p>I have this idea that a culture is a tail with many heads, and a cult is a head with many tails.
Since i don&#39;t have facts on the matter, i&#39;ll just say that an organization can well behave in both ways separately, although only one can in the end be true.
If you see a culture at the end of the pope&#39;s role and not a cult, i think we can leave this argument with clearness. But i wouldn&#39;t reframe the definitions...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look into things like Pizzagate, ancient mythologies and cultures, and other common conspiracy stuff, you can come to the reasonable conclusion that many of the world&#39;s elite have some sort of fascination with the occult/Satan. You can also come to the reasonable conclusion that the elite want a one world government. How the NWO and Luciferianism are connected (if they even are) is up to you.</p>

<p>I should probably state that I&#39;m also a Christian. What the Bible says and what I understand of the &quot;conspiracy theory world&quot; interconnect and make a lot of sense to me. Conspiracy theories are not proof that the Bible is reliable and the Bible is not proof that some conspiracy theory is real. But for me, as a Christian, there is a lot of proof that the Luciferian elite are the true rulers of this world. </p>

This destroys Christianity, while making the occultists and rabbis the heads of the church, as kabalah is inscrutable, well, bullshit, that hinges in thier word alone. </p>

<p>The next capture was when the church fell into debt and surrendered when they handed financial control to the Rothschilds in the 1800&#39;s.</p>

<p>Now, how to handle the real Christians left inside the church? Mass infiltration of occult secret society members. Freemasons were sent in. Later, a wave of communists (6000 were ordered to become priests at one time,  and promoted the pedophilia from within that blew up in the churches face later)</p>

<p>Malachi Martin wrote about it in fiction, bit he was telling the truth.
