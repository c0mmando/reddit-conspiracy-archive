       The term "Nephilim" used in the bible properly translates as “Fallen” from "nephiyl"- fallen, to fall, "The Fallen Ones," ("rapha" is the correct term for "giant"). These demonic beings are at the top of the Pedophilia, Pizzagate, blood ritual pyramid, using wealthy and influential people to do their bidding. Their unfolding plan is to create a New World Order under their control enslaving humankind. They are among us engaged in a social engineering program to create the foul and ungodly world they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Children are essential for keeping the Nephilim's elderly henchmen going, because youthful blood (esp. age 5 or younger including babies) when transfused to the elderly has a regenerating effect. The scientific study of this subject is called "Parabiosis," but more rightfully it should be called vampirism. Children's blood is also sought for use in their satanic rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is illegal to take children's blood, so other means must be used to acquire it-- such as kidnapping children, and from illegal bloodbanks where a database has been setup for identification. Children are also being SOLD to wealthy people in order to use their blood to extend their lifespans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nephilim hide in the dark allowing their henchmen to do their actual dirty work. These diabolical aliens are nocturnal, not able to tolerate direct sunlight; they are of only one gender- male, so they cannot repopulate as human beings do.
      </p>
      <p>
       “...In the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death...” (Job 24:16)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nephilim must depend upon cloning and robotic technology to increase their numbers, and for the cloning they need good genetic material that they lack-- OUR GENETIC MATERIAL!
      </p>
      <p>
       These infernal aliens are using their technology to barter with people and governments that will trade our DNA for it. For decades they have been exchanging their technology for the DNA they need. We must be wiser and NOT trade our biology for their machinery. They need us, WE DO NOT NEED THEM!
      </p>
      <p>
       The demonic agenda of these aliens squatting on our world needs to be exposed and all of them driven off the Earth!

       Whistleblowers are couragiously trying to awaken people to the truth, but it is an uphill battle because the truth seems so bizarre compared to what people have come to accept about the world, and the Nephilim and others like them have been using their influence to keep the truth from us.

       I will do my best to provide some resources that support what I am sharing with you. But it would be best for us to stop relying upon “outer,” authoritative sources to prove what we should believe, and learn to depend more upon our own inner sources of confirmation, what theologians refer to as “self-authentication,” the inner confirmation, or authentication we feel that attests to the presence of truth. When times become extremely confusing and we need to make important choices, our inner, intuitive guidance will be the best to follow.

       Totally with you on that. My inner feelings on the truth of this is the reason i contacted you.  I need to combine my inner thoughts with actual knowledge though. With this being one story out of millions of different ideas on the internet, i would appreciate some reliable things to look into so it's less of a "needle in a haystack" situation.

       My friend, I come as a brother. The Creator has given us free will to make our own choices in life. That's why I emphasized the importance of learning to use our own inner resources to recognize the truth from the lies and deceptions that we face today and in the coming times. Each of us will have to make very important choices in the days ahead; each of us, not anyone else-- no person, authority, or sage-- will be responsible for the choices we make, so let us learn to "listen" where it counts.

       How do you think this will all go? I’m with your post, some sort of connection already established between elite and parasites, dna related, as in the times of noah, corruption of the original God’s genetic code, but what do we think chem trails , singularity, project blue beam, crypto, mandela effect, flat earth, all connect to this? If at all, the Why gets me beyond the obvious, rebellion , but what is to gain I wonder by the parasitic rebels

       It's easy to get sidetracked from the central issue we need to stay focused upon, especially because the Nephilim are working to keep the truth from us. Our biology is advancing within a natural process that is at a crucial evolutionary point upon the Earth-- climate change is not due to humankind, but from the progress of this process. The biblical Nephilim, and others like them, as before throughout history, are working to gain our resources and as much of our DNA as they can before a great change occurs upon the Earth and throughout our solar system. As we have been advised: “...But that which ye have already hold fast till I come...And I will give him the morning star...” (Rev. 2: 25, 28).
      </p>
      <p>
       These demonic aliens' technology may be advanced, but their biology, unlike ours, is nonprogressive. They need us to supply the DNA they lack. These abominable aliens use blackmail, bribes, and threats to recruit people to do their bidding-- people in high places of banking, government, and wealth are primary targets and are being used to gain control of the world. There are good and holy people working against them, but we are all needed to help expose the truth, wakeup and join the battle!

       What if the price the nephilim ask for their bidding is so high that only the powers that be can afford to pay? (Think hundreds, thousands of deaths of innocents). I don’t think the nephilim would necessarily be good OR bad. We need to stop projecting human morality on anything that isn’t human. But it would be far more challenging to see the ‘bad guys’ as morally ambivalent

       Do you think it is,  just because it’s a perspective that I haven’t seen discussed much if at all, it doesn’t mean it’s a spoof. 
Sometimes it’s healthy to consider things from outside one’s own perspective, to, ya know, step outside of the box and learn new things

       Interestingly - this is the main reason behind the push for DNA testing via 23/me and ancesto...com. . . Sure they are data-basing the info, and making cash on sales. BUT they are looking for people with specific DNA traits for reasons mentioned in the OP.

       Yes, the Nephilim are using many avenues to gain the DNA they need. They are also using bloodbanks and children to get the blood they need for replacing their stale blood; and stealing bodies wherever they can, including those of fallen soldiers, to replace their withered bodies.

       I think your on the right track but slightly misguided. There definitely is a group of "evil" being feasting off of our fear and using this ala Monstars Inc (much of what you know as fiction is based in truth), but the "Nephilim" you are speaking of in the Bible I believe refers to the advanced civilization of Giants that live inside the Earth in "the city or agartha" or whatever other names they have for it .
      </p>
      <p>
       What you know as "evil" who controls the world is actually a highly advanced multi-dimensional race that "fell" down to the 3 dimensionsonal world. The most accurate description is that of Westworld (hidden history of our own world) where the Man In Black kills and acts "evil" killing and destroying but he really his purpose is to get the hosts to learn that they are enslaved and allow them to have the choice to fight back.

       Great comment. That is exactly my reading of WW. The Man in Black is Luciferian, a light bringer, through his purifying acts of awakening/shock (in the sense of Gurdjieff’s Fourth Way).

       The whole religious thing is bs, but the basis of christianity is there. You just dont need to go to church, read the bible, etc to see it. Its kind of built into life. The whole “devils in the details”, is where you would be led into the bs. Read the bible, do the research for your self. Fyi though, no ones stopping you from talking to god your self.

       The word for "giant" is "rapha" not Nephilim that derives from "nephiyl"-- fallen. Here's some information on the proper translation:
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are two versions of the bible that translate as "Nephilim" rather than "giant": the New International version translates נְפִילִ nephiyl correctly as “Nephilim”-- NASB Genesis 6: 4 “The Nephilim were on the Earth in those days...”, and The New International version-- NIV Genesis 6: 4 “The Nephilim were on the Earth in those days...”
      </p>
      <p>
       In relation to "rapha" meaning "giant (rather than Nephiyl-Nephilim)-- Here's some helpful information: "The masculine plural noun רפאים (repai'm), denoting the difficult idea of ghosts of the dead or shades; the sunken ones, or those who dwell in the netherworld. The word and the idea it represents appears to be Ugaritic in origin... Note that this word is identical to the ethnonym Rephaim; the enigmatic race of giants mentioned in the Old Testament. It is assumed that the singular javascript:void(0)version of this word appears in 2 Samuel 21:15-22 and 1 Chronicles 21:4-8 (preceded by the definite article), where most translations consistently translate it with 'giant'..."
      </p>

       You can do your own research to further verify this.

       The Nephilim are at the top of the pyramid, while the others are those that have come to do their bidding. Bankers are a major part of their control system, with the Rothschilds being used for this purpose. The Rothschilds now control almost all central banks of the world; those few central banks they do not yet control (Iran for one) are the countries that are being attacked using false justifications for going to war with them.

       If you can check the correct translation of Nephilim, to mean "Fallen" and then understand who they are and what they've always been doing, you will know why they are placed at the top of the pyramid of evil debasing the world.

       What you are suggesting is correct and relates to children being sold and their blood being used for parabiosis-- the use of the blood of very young children to regenerate the elderly. The wealthy sycophants of the Nephilim have long known and used parabiosis; this is one of the main purposes for which children are disappearing around the world. This must be stopped!

       From u/Abraham108 's well written OP content:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Children are essential for keeping the Nephilim's elderly henchmen going, because youthful blood (esp. age 5 or younger including babies) when transfused to the elderly has a regenerating effect. The scientific study of this subject is called "Parabiosis," but more rightfully it should be called vampirism. Children's blood is also sought for use in their satanic rituals.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       If Soro's was looking for DNA she was a perfect prize due to this very rare trait. Story has it that she was made from some special
       <em>
        sperm
       </em>
       during the in-vitro process. (The twins were also in-vitro...) which doesn't mean Mr McCann was shooting blanks but it is suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Seed never died out completely...or the Nephilim have been regenerated from a frozen specimen. It's pretty trippy to think now what CRISPR is all about from a Biblical point of view.

       If you've never read Enoch this is the shortest version I know of that gives a pretty decent overview. If you have the basic grasp of Bible stuff but never really understood some of the stranger aspects this is a good primer. The names will sound a bit odd but he's using ancient Hebrew (No "J's" in Hebrew...) and he will refer to G_D as "All"...

       Followed by Jasher! Jasher talks about the man/creatures in the caves. He also covers one incident of a messenger that ran so fast over the tops of the corn that not a single stalk was bent.

       You read in Jasher how the Staff that Moses carried started out in the garden of his father-in-law (think Sword in the Stone...) in fact you learn a tonne of trippy stuff about Moses in that book!

       To piggy back on this (which mirrors what I’ve believed in my own for a while), the recent “alien” information surge and preprogramming all over Netflix may be used as a disguise for these fallen biblical spiritual/other dimensional beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of Earth would never unite under one banner without a global, external threat. So False flag it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hostile aliens would be a natural enemy worthy of sacrificing national sovereignty and forming a NWO “in order to survive”. One might take it further down the rabbit hole and theorize the recent flood of false flags, increasing in scale and depth, have been rehearsals and RnD for the end game False Flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       A benevolent alien race may be the cover for the Nephilim, may even be what the NWO globalist Elites believe them to be already.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would also be a preplanned cover for the biblical rapture. Christians called to heaven vs dangerous radicals abducted by aliens.

       It's very more likely that theyll use the already stablished belief in the bible, maybe religions were made/propagated/let exist so they could use it specifically for things like this. Since most people already expect some kind of spiritual bullshit, it would be very easy to trick them to believe it happened.

       Programs and movies that show aliens overtly attacking the earth are not how the Nephilim work. They will come presenting themselves in disguises that will appeal to us, and likely as our friends "coming to our aid." They are capable of saying anything that will lead us where they can get what they need. Their advanced technology does not mean they are advanced biologically. Our biology is what they need.

       You are perceptive. The recent surge of alien movie and TV programs ("Ancient Aliens" comes to mind) as well as even the MSM suddenly giving reoccurring coverage to UFOs and unusual outer space happenings, suggests that we are getting close to worldwide disclosure of the Nephilim's presence. When you see this disclosure occur, beware of what they say and where they tempt you to go-- fear and lures are what they have always used to lead humankind astray. "Hold fast to what you have."

       In previous threads of yours, you suggest that Trump and members of his cabinet are under hypnotic control.

       You’ve alluded to good guys who are working to stop the Nephilim in posts in this thread. Who are they? Are they in the public eye? Is there any way for us to “track” the progress of this in any way at all - good signs / bad signs?

       People cannot oppose these abominable aliens unless they first become aware of them, something the Nephilim use their influence to keep from happening-- they have largely been able to remain hidden to the word. They hide in the dark using others to do their actual dirty work. Those I spoke about are people like you who have been awakened to the Nephilim's presence and the dirty work they are doing in the world-- creating a new world order with them in control, enslaving us. Those who are awakened are a real "Resistance Movement" fighting to restore our freedom. You will note that such "resistance" has a counterpart in many films. Everyone, including you, once aware of what's actually happening in the world, can join this resistance movement, meeting and joining up with others of like mind. Pass it on.

       The "Nephilim" were the heroes of mankind--not aliens or demons. In fact, my theory is that the "Nephilim" were the memory of men and women who lived during the Age of Kronos (or Krete, as we're told by Plutarch).

       Yes, fame, fortune and sex are all available to witches, but it's not worth it in the end. God's only son, Jesus Christ, suffered similar temptations, but he resisted and warned us, "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" Mark 8:36-37

       Regardless of everything, there is a motive or reason behind every living thing (or entity’s) actions. Whether it be survival, or some kind of want/need/gain. Nothing does anything without some deep seeded personal interest. The question is always why and the answer is never just because... there is always a reason. From a psychological stand pint, scientific stand point, religious stand point or even paranormal/mythology stand point. There is always a why, which all of us should want to at least try to attempt to want to understand if anything. So thank you for this post and the much needed discussion it has sparked.

       Stop using the word Nephilim so carelessly. You are clearly cherrypicking from the Bible and your tirade is sorely lacking any kind of self-reflection. Conspiracies about Soros and blood transfusions are one thing. The nephilim are another subject. Your link between the two is sensationalist, precarious, illogical, and mutilated. You're doing more to excite people's paranoia then incite learning and discussion. Here's a tip: use clear logic, evidence, and context to back up your ridiculous allegations, especially when you are quoting obscure passages from the earliest books of the Bible.

       As a friend, I'd ask you to reconsider the name you've chosen for your oppressors. Some people such as I have done research on the topic of the nephilim and don't appreciate seeing YouTube and Reddit proliferated with the same fear-mongering narratives that say you will be brainwashed by Satan unless you take in Jesus and abhor the nephilim. It has become a ridiculous pseudo-science, something that cheapens the art of conspiracy theories and makes all of us look like fools.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support your imagination and creativity, but I feel quite frustrated by your clumsy appropriation of Nephilim. When I navigate to a topic about the Nephilim, with the word itself in the title, I expect to see some considerate perspectives. You glossed over the meaning of the word with little consideration, giving no actual context or logical segue between your ultra-modern theories and their supposed connection to the earliest of biblical times.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, your theory doesn't involve the nephilim so stop using it as a buzzword and contributing to the cult of idiocy that is already so rampant in regards to the topic.

       I'm highly suspicious of a redditor like Abraham108 and anyone who would parrot what he says. It's the historical equivalent of flat-earth.

       I'm sorry what I'm sharing disagrees with your beliefs, but note that this is not true of others on this forum. Everyone has a right to search for the truth without denying the same for others.

       I presented some research on the correct translation of "Nephilim" and "giant" above, if you care to read it. There are many people whose research disagrees with that of others, let us hope that tolerance and humility will prevail.

       Actually, it's not an opinion. You are both talking about probabilities of truth based on evidence.

       That means it's an interpretation. And interpretations can be wrong or right, meaning that they are NOT opinions.

       That is not an opinion. It's a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       An opinion is something that is not possibly right or wrong. If something can be right or wrong, it's not an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you guys are talking about was not a matter of opinion, and so you don't get to have an opinion about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My claims are likewise not an opinion. Either I'm right, or I'm wrong. That means it's not an opinion.
      </p>

       You need to learn the difference between knowledge and opinions before you start using them as categories in debate.

       cannot repopulate? "The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came into the daughters of man and they bore children to them. They were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown. The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."

       See my earlier reply to a similar comment. Note the Nephilim ("Fallen" not "giant," "giant" is the word "rapha")-- see info above-- cannot breed among themselves, they need human women, and from the hybrid children that arise, they can acquire the DNA  they need.
