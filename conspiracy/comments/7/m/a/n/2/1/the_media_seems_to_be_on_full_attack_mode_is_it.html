       Trump signs everything the establishment passed and does nothing else aside from rant on twitter and at rallies. Other the fact that he says controversial shit to stir up his base how is he a threat to status quo.

       Counter point, they're news agencies cashing in on outrage culture. Lots of people are upset with Trump (for good reasons imo) and it's easy to put out garbage that makes Trump look bad at a specious glance.
      </p>
      <p>
       bonus conspiracy points: news agencies purposely put out obviously misleading articles criticizing Trump to inoculate Trump supporters that all criticism of Trump is equally fake news.

       It is being removed because the nation's top arborists have determined it is dead and should have been removed in the 80's. The headline should say the the first lady is taking care of forty years of neglected yardwork, IMO.

       You're correct. I think all businesses who operate in the United States should not be able to discriminate against people because of their age, mental/physical disability, gender, race, color, religion, or sexual preference.

       A wedding cake for a gay couple would be a gay-themed cake. And I cannot believe you would insist that someone should be forced to create one. As I asked in the earlier thread, should a Jewish baker be forced to make a "The Holocaust is Fake" cake? Are you ready to force artists to "PC", or are you only half-in on this?

       It is not illegal to deny writing that on a cake. It is illegal to refuse service to someone because of their religion, race, color, disability, national origin, or sexual orientation. You are really bad at coming up with relevant examples. Like, you strike out every time when it could be so easy. All you need to say is “should a Jewish Baker be allowed to refuse service to a Person because they are Christian.”  But my answer would still be “No”
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as gay-themed cake, would it surprise you that a cake for a same sex wedding could be identical to a cake for a traditional marriage? And that the bakers didn’t deny them because the cake was a “gay theme” but because the couple was gay.

       Thank god you don't run the country.  You people disgust me.  "I don't care if there are other bakeries who would love my business.  You are going to put homosexual messages on my cake specifically because you don't want to.  And if you deny me, I'm going to make it a national scandal.  Ya know, instead of just going to a bakery that would love to decorate my cake with as many cocks as I want."  You people just want power to command others, plain and simple.

       You should look into what ladies were saying about Weinstein and why he was so messed up. They said he wouldn't look anywhere else but your eyes when he was around other people as if he was waiting to get you alone to look else where and make his move. A healthy adult male enjoys the female form and doesn't care who knows. I highly doubt the rumors about trump creeping on kids but I wouldn't doubt he checked out some hot legal chicks.

       He literally admitted on Stern to walking into dressing rooms where contestants as young as 16 were getting changed, specifically to cop a look.

       That's such a bullshit cop out. I've never heard a single adult man blatantly objectify women like that in all my years, including years in actual locker rooms. Real men don't talk like that, unless they're sick, old sexual predators like Trump.

       Also worked construction for years. The only guys that talked about grabbing women by the pussies, or moving on them like a bitch, were the single guys who still acted like they were in high school.

       That tree got whacked in 1994.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then, the plane passed over the Ellipse, located south of the White House, and dove directly towards the Executive Mansion at a steep angle of descent. A minute later, with the flaps up and the throttle fully forward, the plane plowed into the White House's South Lawn, skidding across the ground and its left wing was clipped by the magnolia tree just west of the South Portico steps (which was planted during Andrew Jackson's presidency), and impacted the southwest corner of the first floor of the Mansion's West Wing.

       It's disgusting.  Just like Donald Trump, we Republicans never attacked Michelle Obama because we have the ultimate respect for women.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, there are many instances that the LIBERAL media will point out that refute this, but it's FAKE NEWS.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         She expressed some mixed feelings about being proud of America as a black woman, which was obviously unpatriotic.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She’s “strikingly ungracious.” (Jim Geraghty, writing for National Review)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She doesn’t look like a first lady (and she did push-ups). (Virginia voter Bobbie Lussier)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She disrespected the flag, as determined by lip readings of Obama whispering something inaudible to her husband during a ceremony. (Washington Times, American Thinker, Debbie Schlussel)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She weighs too much to care about health: “The problem is — and dare I say this — it doesn’t look like Michelle Obama follows her own nutritional, dietary advice. And then we hear that she’s out eating ribs at 1,500 calories a serving with 141 grams of fat per serving, yeah it does — what do you mean, what do I mean?” (Rush Limbaugh)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She “needs to drop a few” pounds before she can be taken seriously on the issue of nutrition. (Keith Ablow, prominent member of the Fox News “Medical A-Team”)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She eats too much, as demonstrated by a cartoon of a chubby Michelle chowing down on a burger and fries, telling a skinny Barack to “shut up and pass the bacon!” (Big Government)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She didn’t support dessert enough, and she “cannot trust parents to make decisions for their own children.” (Sarah Palin)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She forced children in day care to be weighed. (Urban legend, debunked by Snopes)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She has “no business being involved” in what people eat. (New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She’s a “feminist nightmare” for focusing on her family. (Michelle Cottle, writing in Politico)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She is actually a man, and she murdered Joan Rivers to cover it up. (Alex Jones)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She’s not classy enough and is an “atrocity” as first lady: “She makes a fool of herself — every time she comes on TV, I have to turn it off. Laura Bush was so classy, and that’s what we really need again.” (Laurie Boilard, quoted by Bloomberg Politics at a party for a Republican candidate’s wife)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She dared to talk about the enslaved people who built the White House.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She is an “ape in heels.” (Pamela Ramsey Taylor, director of Clay County Development Corp., Clay, W.Va., who later swore she was not racist.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She has a “gorilla face.” (Patrick Rushing, mayor of Airway Heights, Wash.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She is a “poor gorilla” who “needs to focus on getting a total makeover (especially the hair), instead of planning vacations.” (Georgia schoolteacher Jane Wood Allen)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She put her left elbow on a table once. (Salon)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She ” ‘voluntarily surrendered’ her law license in 1993. after a Federal Judge gave her the choice between surrendering her license or standing trial for Insurance fraud!” (Chain email)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She went “to Buckingham Palace in a sweater.” (Oscar de la Renta)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She’s President Obama’s “baby mama.” (Fox News)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She wore shorts.

       I know this topic can be upsetting, and I know it feels good to be dramatic about it, but I ask you to in the future consider reframing your comment so as not to be so dramatic and emotional.  I'm actually on your side on this particular issue but I wouldn't have known it if I didn't push through my initial feelings and re-read your comment manually glossing over your emotional and sarcastic remarks.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, you didn't do anything wrong, and I'm not trying to tell you what to do.  I'm only telling you that you're coming across as upset, emotional and high and mighty, and those aren't states of mind to be in if you want to convince

       Notice how Trump hasn't started a war yet? A war so CNN can embed reporters and show disgrace like it's great stuff? Yeah. Soon as Trump starts a war, CNN will turn pro-Trump.

       They didn't turn anti-Putin overnight. He's been on peoples shit list for invading Georgia(2008) and annexing Crimea(2014). Thats not even getting into his 'gay purge' in Chechnya or the decision to decriminalize domestic abuse. Theres a plethora of reasons people hate the man.

       This is some weak shit compared to what was flung at Michelle. They've got the kiddy gloves on for Melania. Which is incredible respectful seeing as she's a porn star who admitted to marrying Trump for his money.

       I never said anything bad about porn. I just stated the fact that first lady gets naked for little bit of money. I'm not knocking that at all. It's a much easier way to make money than say, graduating from Harvard Law like Michelle. If you think that's a bad thing that's on you.

       You can't be serious. The msm fawned over Michelle- PBS even reran her White House Christmas this year. Melania- they made jokes about the "tastelessness" of her choice of decor.

       Anyone associated with this POTUS is going to be slammed by the Project Mockingbird/deep state media. Just expect it. Yet I'm sure they would have had high praise for the First Man, Bill Clinton, if HRC had been able to cheat herself into the White House. Even engaging in his leering, creepy behavior--like he displayed at Trump's inauguration--I'm sure they would have ignored it. I'd still like to know if he was staring at Melania or Ivanka back then. It made my skin crawl.

       And you are OK with the pedophile Trump? If anyone was creeping on Ivanka you know it's daddy. Trump has never been shy about talking about how badly he wants to fuck his own daughter. Though she might be to old for his taste now
