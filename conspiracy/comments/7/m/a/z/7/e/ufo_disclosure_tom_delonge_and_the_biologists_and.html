        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As many of us know by now, Tom DeLonge is spearheading UFO disclosure. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">The New York Times</a> and the rest of the worldwide establishment media, is now openly acknowledging the existence of an intelligent ET presence on Earth, largely because of DeLonge and his intelligence community handlers in To The Stars Academy. </p>

<p>Yet there is one overlooked aspect of this UFO disclosure, and it&#39;s this one: <a href="https://dpo.tothestarsacademy.com/">DeLonge&#39;s team</a> includes several people with a background in genetics and biotech. Why is that? </p>

<p>His team is fairly small, and a disproportionate number of the people are biotechnologists. Seems a bit strange, no? </p>

<p>Couple this with the fact that DeLonge and his team refers to all UFOs as <em>threats</em> ... and we might just be headed for some interesting times, aka a staged alien invasion or at least some fictitious &quot;war against the aliens&quot; to bolster the MIC. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t true. Media is acknowledging an unidentified craft and possible unknown technology. There is, as of yet, no confirmation of anything extra terrestrial. </p>

<p>Though, Delonge&#39;s narrative that this is based on alien technology doesn&#39;t seem that far fetched to me.</p>

<p>No confirmation from the media itself, but insiders such as Robert Bigelow is quoted -- by the MSM -- as being 100% sure that intelligent space aliens are on Earth, and have been here for a long time. </p>

<p>And the New York Times is acknowledging that he keeps strange alloys of &quot;an unknown origin&quot; in at least one of his hangars. </p>

<p>And Bigelow is a government contractor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re in some sort of soft disclosure scenario.</p>

<p>Check out some of Richard Dolan&#39;s talks on YouTube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irzr3fkrMRA">&quot;Why UFOs Matter&quot;</a> and some of his talks on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZikgXoewJw">Disclosure</a> in the Trump era.</p>

<p>The documented proof that we have historically is that governments have been covering up information surrounding UFOs for well over half a century. Things happened of interest... the things were covered up, and the interest was covered up. That much we prove beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>

<p>So we know that the gov has been hiding something... so important to keep secret all this time. And if you&#39;re credulous you can start to make informed arguments about what these things might be. When you stop outright dismissing honest witness and experience reports, a fairly consistent picture of worldwide ETI visitation and contact comes out. As well as a picture of established government contact.</p>

<p>So say it&#39;s all true... a black government already holding keys to light speed or extradimensional travel, already having access to free energy, already in diplomacy with several alien races... At a certain point it becomes less expensive to let it all hang out, than to keep up the ruse. Yet, while at least <em>some</em> citizen freedoms remain, those in the <em>visible</em> government will not want to face the backlash. </p>

<p>But they&#39;re making huge strides in that department. After the 2016 democratic convention and the election abuses there, and all the terrible things Trump is doing in the meantime, a sense of fatalism is setting into America eroding the last of our beliefs that we have any say in elected government... or whether we will have any power to change that.</p>

<p>So I think what we&#39;re seeing here is a sort of soft disclosure. DeLonge is a patsy, being guided by several seriously connected handlers, to ensure they have someone on the face of this who is a kook. People who &quot;want to believe&quot; can jump on the bandwagon, and people more incredulous can write it off for the time being. More importantly, it leaves the situation flexible. Because if things start going &quot;off&quot; about disclosure, they can induce him into some highly publicized meltdown, discrediting the entire movement and protecting their secrecy for another 30 years. Credible, sane individuals have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClhNHIEPCKE">coming out of the woodwork for years</a> in the interest of disclosure, but they&#39;re not the one&#39;s getting traction, and they&#39;re not invited to the party. They still have to be &quot;the real crazy ones&quot; in this scenario.</p>

<p>All these other little admissions, NYT coverage, etc.... this is all being carefully, carefully coordinated. The average citizen needs to think some shit had gone down and their gov is maintaining secrecy &quot;in our best interests&quot; and some weird shit goes on but that&#39;s just the price of security in this day and age. That&#39;s the meme that&#39;s been planted in our minds. Because we&#39;re afraid to consider that it might be more insidious than that.</p>

<p>This is what&#39;s called a &quot;limited hangout...&quot; They&#39;re letting some truth hang out, but in such a careful way that they protect deeper truths and still control the narrative. What&#39;s odd is that there must be some compelling reason to start this process now. Maybe Trump has made the White House too insecure for the beans not to get spilled accidentally? Maybe they&#39;ve been waiting to do this shit for a long time and this is just a unique low point in American History where the involved are not currently in the White House and disclosure can blow back on a President unconnected with the real Elite? It&#39;s hard to know for sure, but this is springing forth from something. This is a singular and decisive action.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised if, over the following decades, a series of &quot;releases&quot; indicates previous gov interest but of a limited scale, and that future staged &quot;discoveries&quot; or &quot;contact scenarios&quot; create the false impression of a natural course of events.</p>

<p>To further that, a continual &quot;muddying of the waters&quot; is still necessary. This whole flat earth thing, for example is likely completely staged, in order to create public antisentiment against all sorts of &quot;truthers,&quot; in this time where Trump&#39;s buffoonery is causing the curtains to sag a bit.</p>

<p>Case in point is this SpaceX Launch currently occupying the sidebar, and 1500+ upvote post at the top of the sub right now, relating this event to several disparate UFO events picked for a 20 year interval. I&#39;m perfectly satisfied by this conventional explanation by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ6nn8fZOmc&amp;amp;t">Scott Manley</a>, and would really have to bend my head to see this as anything other than the SpaceX launch. The Vancouver sighting shares an elliptic shape, but has a clearly defined geometry, and is clearly seen at close range. This all just smacks of classic disinformation. Many of these sorts of events are not &quot;planned,&quot; per se, but are opportunities taken to muddy the waters, get people thinking what they want to think, while popular consensus slowly builds.</p>

<p>By heavily investing in both &quot;conspiracy geeks are crazy&quot; and &quot;ufos are real&quot; public info campaigns, they can cause a crystallization of opinion later by creating or emphasizing a future event. Given the right stimulus--a DeLonge meltdown, or a verified crash--people will look back on the past differently, and decide that whatever version of reality they are presented with, they knew it all along. &quot;I knew those folks were kooks... look at what these idiots thought about SpaceX.&quot; Or, &quot;Makes sense that they finally found something, I&#39;ve been seeing those weird articles for a while now.&quot;</p>

<p>The aliens as an &quot;enemy&quot; thing is an extremely worrying part of all of this, because it forces us to see our government in a savior and protector light. Once the general population becomes open to the idea, it&#39;s how they&#39;ll keep society from collapsing. The far-right don&#39;t-take-our-guns Bush and Trump crowd will rally behind the Black State  and preserve the current power structures. It will steer any dialogue instantly away from governmental &quot;responsibility&quot; and put everyone in a fight or flight mode. Any governmental abuse of power can be written off as &quot;acting in self-defense.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to hear it! I would recommend watching about everything Richard Dolan has done on YouTube, because I just love his context. He&#39;s a scholar first, so he always brings things back to what&#39;s fact, what&#39;s speculation, etc. And he has views on coping with all of this that are based on where we are and what can we do, and not all this emotional loading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If true “disclosure” will reveal Ike met with greys @ Holloman AFB in ‘53 (maybe @ Edwards AFB as well). After the closure of National Airport (DC) in ‘52 it was apparent the situation had to be addressed. </p>

<p>As Vince Vaughn says, “but here’s the thing”. The greys aren’t aliens from outer space. They are an ancient species based on Earth and aligned with inter-dimensional entities most would consider demonic in nature. I do believe Ike was duped. And I also believe some members of the Govt were aware the grey’s true evil nature.</p>

<p>BTW, any of you seen the drawing of A.Crowley’s friend ?</p>

<p>“Disclosure” will instead likely be “they are visitors from Vega” b.s. and humanity believes it. For those who expect the anti-Christ this could be the start. I still think the anti-Christ emerges from the Mid-East but time will tell.</p>

<p>If the real ones were printed for another genetic code, obviously you need people to figure out how to adapt it to recognize our dna to be able to use their tech. Like a fingerprint scanner but obv far more sophisticated. </p>

<p>On the other hand, we have crafts (also ufos) that were manufactured on earth using said/and other technology. You can spot the difference pretty easy as those are usually made out of various parts and not 3d printed on a atomic lvl as one piece. </p>

<p>Yes, you&#39;re on to something here. This has been mentioned by Steven Greer in the past, and it&#39;s also a concept found in some hard sci-fi, such as the Night&#39;s Dawn trilogy by Peter Hamilton. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After the first 10 mins of Tom Delnge on Joe rogans podcast I believe he knows alto about what&#39;s happening right now. Ive seen the stuff he talks about too. Its not aliens though. Its devil/Satan stuff.
In the podcast interview he mentions his body changing, which they do using time. Some of those &quot;aliens&quot; are here and look like the kid in the video for aerials by system of a down, but its not just them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its interesting to see people call a guy crazy and a shill and fishy etc... When you know some stuff he says is right. On the Joe rogan podcast his breathing words, but its hard to decipher. Soundslike he says &quot;theyre going to kill me&quot; on one of them.</p>

<p>no confirmation of anything extra terrestrial.</p>

<p>No confirmation from the media itself, but insiders such as Robert Bigelow is quoted -- by the MSM -- as being 100% sure that intelligent space aliens are on Earth, and have been here for a long time. </p>

<p>And the New York Times is acknowledging that he keeps strange alloys of &quot;an unknown origin&quot; in at least one of his hangars. </p>

<p>And Bigelow is a government contractor. </p>
