<p>Turning now to Pearl Harbor false flag event itself, some of the best information can be found in the book Day of Deceit by author Robert Stinnett, who served in the US Navy during WW2. His research includes declassified documents which were withheld from the American public for over 60 years. Stinnett’s work shows that there were really 3 conspiracies surrounding the event: the first was to induce Japan to attack America and thus provide an unbeatable pretext for America to enter World War 2; the second was to deprive the Pearl Harbor commanders of available information about Japan’s intentions; and the third was to ensure that all evidence of foreknowledge remained hidden from the public.</p>

<p>Conspiracy #1: Coaxing Japan into Attacking Stinnett includes a memorandum that he obtained under FOIA by Japanese expert Captain Arthur McCollum, chief of the Far Eastern Section of Naval Intelligence, dated October 7, 1940. This nefarious McCollum memo (pictured above) listed an 8-point plan to induce Japan “to commit an overt act of war”. In an interview in 2002, Stinnett was asked whether FDR saw the memo:</p>

<p>“Is there any proof that FDR saw McCollum’s memorandum?</p>

<p>Stinnett: There’s no proof that he actually saw the memorandum, but he adopted all eight of the provocations—including where he signed executive orders…And other information in Navy files offers conclusive evidence that he did see it.”</p>

<p>Here are the 8 points McCollum advocated, all of which Roosevelt performed or arranged (some over the objections of Commander-in-chief of the US fleet James Richardson):</p>

<p>A. Make an arrangement with Britain for the use of British bases in the Pacific, particularly Singapore. B. Make an arrangement with Holland for the use of base facilities and acquisition of supplies in the Dutch East Indies. C. Give all possible aid to the Chinese government of Chiang-Kai-Shek. D. Send a division of long range heavy cruisers to the Orient, Philippines, or Singapore. E. Send two divisions of submarines to the Orient. F. Keep the main strength of the U.S. fleet now in the Pacific in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands. G. Insist that the Dutch refuse to grant Japanese demands for undue economic concessions, particularly oil. H. Completely embargo all U.S. trade with Japan, in collaboration with a similar embargo imposed by the British Empire. Point F is highly significant, because it allowed the Japanese to destroy a major part of the US fleet, thus maximizing the injury in the public’s perception – which was after all the ultimate target that day. In addition to coaxing the attack in many ways, the US also allowed a Japanese naval spy carte blanche to spy on the base at Pearl Harbor and transmit information back to Japan in preparation for the attack.</p>

<p>Conspiracy #2: Crack the Japanese Code but Keep ‘Em in the Dark Remember the good old mushroom modus operandi? Feed ’em shit and keep ’em in the dark? That’s what went on with the Pearl Harbor commanders, Admiral Kimmel (Commander in Chief of the US Fleet) and Lt. General Short (head of the US Army Defenses at Pearl Harbor), who were denied the critical information they needed to prepare for and defend against the attack.</p>

<p>According to Stinnett, US cryptographers had deciphered Japan’s diplomatic code (known as MAGIC). They had also deciphered some of Japan’s military codes, which meant that they could understand the messages they were intercepting in the Pacific. The significant information that was received from these intercepts (such as the Japanese Task Force’s last-minute choice for its staging area, its destination and its attack order) was deliberately withheld from Kimmel and Short.</p>

<p>Around 2 weeks before the attack occurred (on November 23, 1941) Kimmel had ordered (without White House approval) a search for Japanese forces north of Hawaii. He had actually moved the fleet into the North Pacific. However, once White House officials learned of this, they ordered the ships back to Pearl Harbor. Another piece of evidence is that on November 25, the Navy headquarters in Washington ordered Kimmel to route all transpacific shipping southward leaving the north Pacific conveniently open, allowing Japan to attack with no intervening vessels.</p>

<p>Conspiracy #3: Evidence of Foreknowledge There is a considerable amount of foreknowledge, in addition to the points above. Here are some more examples:</p>

<p>– Roosevelt wanted to “win the war together” with England. As James Perloff writes:</p>

<p>“Roosevelt dispatched his closest advisor, Harry Hopkins, to meet British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in January 1941. Hopkins told Churchill: “The President is determined that we [the United States and England] shall win the war together …”</p>

<p>Roosevelt’s intentions were nearly exposed in 1940 when Tyler Kent, a code clerk at the U.S. embassy in London, discovered secret dispatches between Roosevelt and Churchill. These revealed that FDR — despite contrary campaign promises — was determined to engage America in the war. Kent smuggled some of the documents out of the embassy, hoping to alert the American public — but was caught.”</p>

<p>– On November 25th, 1941, FDR received a “positive war warning” from Churchill that the Japanese would strike against America at the end of the first week in December. This warning caused the President to do an abrupt about-face on plans for a time-buying modus vivendi with Japan and it resulted in Secretary of State Hull’s deliberately provocative ultimatum of November 26th, 1941, that guaranteed war.</p>

<p>– On November 26th, 1941, Washington ordered both US aircraft carriers, the Enterprise and the Lexington, out of Pearl Harbor “as soon as possible”. This order included stripping Pearl of 50 planes or 40% of its already inadequate fighter protection. On the same day Cordell Hull issued his ultimatum demanding full Japanese withdrawal from Indochina and all China. The US Ambassador to Japan called this “the document that touched the button that started the war.”</p>

<p>– On November 29th, 1941, Hull told United Press reporter Joe Leib that Pearl Harbor would be attacked on December 7. The New York Times reported on December 8th (“Attack Was Expected,” p. 13) that the US knew of the attack a week earlier.</p>

<p>– On December 1st, 1941, the Office of Naval Intelligence, ONI, 12th Naval District in San Francisco found the missing Japanese fleet by correlating reports from the 4 wireless news services and several shipping companies that they were getting signals west of Hawaii.</p>

<p>– On December 5th, 1941, FDR wrote to the Australian Prime Minister, “There is always the Japanese to consider. Perhaps the next four or five days will decide the matters.”</p>

<p>– Stinnett also notes that it was reported that before the bombing occurred, newspapers were delivered detailing the attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Submission Statement:</p>

<p>The Pearl Harbor False Flag Motive: Providing a “Legitimate” Cover Story for the Long-Planned Entry of the US into WW2 To begin with, the Pearl Harbor attack is not a false flag op in the sense that the US attacked in its own ships and planes. It is a false flag in the sense that at the very least Roosevelt let it happen, and as the evidence will show, he made it happen. Most of the US Pacific fleet of planes and ships were intentionally left there as sitting ducks with no air protection, an easy target for the Japanese torpedo planes. The Japanese managed to destroy nearly 20 American naval vessels (including 8 massive battleships) and over 300 airplanes.</p>

<p>The “surprise” attack proved to be an easy excuse for Roosevelt to convince the American people and Congress to enter World War 2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UNANSWERED QUESTION #1 Did the United States intercept Japanese messages long before an attack, but failed to warn the Hawaiian base?</p>

<p>Suspicious Facts</p>

<p>• By the summer of 1940, the United States had cracked Japan&#39;s top-secret diplomatic code, nicknamed &quot;Purple [wiki].&quot; This enabled U.S. intelligence agencies to monitor messages to and from Tokyo.</p>

<p>• Although several U.S. command posts received machines for decoding &quot;Purple,&quot; Pearl Harbor was never given one.</p>

<p>• Messages intercepted in the autumn of 1941 suggested what the Japanese were planning:</p>

<p>› On October 9, 1941, Tokyo told its consul in Honolulu to &quot;divide the water around Pearl Harbor into five sub-areas and report on the types and numbers of American war craft.&quot; › The Japanese foreign minister urged negotiators to resolve issues with the U.S. by November 29, after which &quot;things are automatically going to happen.&quot; › On December 1, after negotiations had failed, the navy intercepted a request that the Japanese ambassador in Berlin informed Hitler of an extreme danger of war ... coming &quot;quicker than anyone dreams.&quot;
On the Other Hand</p>

<p>• Although the United States had cracked top-secret Japanese codes several years earlier, &quot;the fact is that code-breaking intelligence did not prevent and could not have prevented Pearl Harbor, because Japan never sent any messages to anybody saying anything like &#39;We shall attack Pearl Harbor,&#39;&quot; writes military historian David Kahn in the autumn 1991 issue of Military History Quarterly.</p>

<p>• &quot;The [Japanese] Ambassador in Washington was never told of the plan,&quot; Kahn says, &quot;Nor were other Japanese diplomats or consular officials. The ship of the strike force were never radioed any message mentioning Pearl Harbor. It was therefore impossible for cryptoanalysts to have discovered the plan. Despite the American code breakers, Japan kept her secret.&quot;</p>

<p>• Actually, Washington had issued a warning to commanders at Pearl Harbor a few weeks earlier. On November 27, 1941, General George Marshall sent the following message: &quot;Hostile action possible at any moment. If hostilities cannot, repeat CANNOT, be avoided, the United States desires that Japan commit the first over act. This policy should not, repeat NOT, be construed as restricting you to a course of action that might jeopardize your defense.&quot;</p>

<p>• But the commanders at Pearl Harbor were apparently negligent. The base should have at least been on alert, but the antiaircraft guns were unmanned and most people on the base were asleep when the attack came.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UNANSWERED QUESTION #2 Did a sailor pick up signals from the approaching Japanese fleet and pass the information on to the White House - which ignored it?</p>

<p>Suspicious Facts</p>

<p>• This theory is promoted in John Toland&#39;s bestselling book, Infamy. He asserts that in early December, an electronics expert in the 12th Naval District in San Francisco (whom Toland refers as &quot;Seaman Z&quot;) identified &quot;queer signals&quot; in the Pacific. Using cross-bearings, he identified them as originating from a &quot;missing&quot; Japanese carrier fleet which had not been heard from in months. He determined that the fleet was heading directly for Hawaii.</p>

<p>• Toland says that although Seaman Z and his superior officer allegedly reported their findings to the Office of Naval Intelligence, whose chief was a close friend of the president, Pearl Harbor never got the warning.</p>

<p>On the Other Hand</p>

<p>• Gordon Prange, author of Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History, refutes many of Toland&#39;s assertions. Although he concedes that there may have been unusual Japanese signals that night, Prange says that they were almost certainly signals to the carriers from Tokyo - and thus would have been useless in locating the carriers.</p>

<p>• To prove his point, Prange quotes reports written by Mitsuo Fuchida, who led the air attack on Pearl Harbor: &quot;The Force maintained the strictest silence throughout the cruise ... [Admiral] Genda stressed that radio silence was so important that the pilots agreed not to go on the air even if their lives depended upon it.&quot; The chief of staff for Fleet Admiral Nagumo adds, &quot;All transmitters were sealed, and all hands were ordered to be kept away from any key of the machine.&quot;</p>

<p>• Prange notes, &quot;It would be interesting to know how the 12th Naval District in San Francisco could pick up information that the 14th Naval District, much nearer the action in Honolulu, missed.&quot;</p>

<p>• Finally, Prange reports that years after the war, &quot;Seaman Z&quot; was identified as Robert D. Ogg, a retired California businessman. Ogg flatly denied that he had said the unusual signals were &quot;the missing carrier force,&quot; nor was he even sure that the transmission were in Japanese - &quot;I never questioned them at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UNANSWERED QUESTION #3 Even if FDR didn&#39;t specifically know about an impending attack on Pearl Harbor, did he try to provoke the Japanese into attacking the U.S. to gain the support of the American public for his war plans?</p>

<p>Suspicious Facts </p>

<p>• FDR told close aides that if the Allies were to be victorious, the U.S. had to enter the war before Japan overran the Pacific and Germany destroyed England.</p>

<p>• FDR told a British emissary that the United States &quot;would declare war on Japan in the latter attacked American possessions ... [but] public opinion would be unlikely to approve of a declaration of war if the Japanese attack were directed only against British or Dutch territories.&quot;</p>

<p>• Earlier that year, on July 25, 1941, Roosevelt froze Japanese assets in the United States.</p>

<p>• In 1937, Japan sank a U.S. warship in China&#39;s Yangtze River, and relations between America and Japan began deteriorating. Both countries made a public effort to negotiate, but FDR presented a series of impossible ultimatums to the Japanese negotiators and openly loaned money to the Nationalist Chinese, whom the Japanese were fighting at the time.</p>

<p>Crews of the Flying Tiger (Image Credit: Wikipedia)</p>

<p>• According to columnist Pat Buchanan, Roosevelt also committed an act of war against Japan in August 1941, when he secretly approved sending a crack U.S. Air Force squadron, the &quot;Flying Tigers [wiki],&quot; to fight alongside the Chinese Nationalists. Although these fliers were officially &quot;volunteers,&quot; Buchanan claimed that they were &quot;recruited at U.S. bases, offered five times normal pay [and] sent off to fight Japan months before Pearl Harbor, in a covert operation run out of FDR&#39;s White House ... Though their planes carried the insignia of the Chinese army, [they] were on active duty for the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>American anti aircraft gunners on Diamond Head said there were no enemy aircraft at Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941, source: MovieTone News in a clip that appeared to have been filmed on location the same day, that was included in the first cut of 911 hit piece <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyiwOJ2pnGg">Loose Change</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/1fhp.jpg">Wheeler Army Air Field, December 7, 1941</a>, smoke coming from planes in a row of undamaged aircraft upwind of a conflagration of other burning planes and no blast damage or bomb craters anywhere, says the aircraft were deliberately set alight at ground level.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/27ek.jpg">In this shot</a> no one appears to be at action stations despite the undamaged battleship should be an obvious target for enemy bombers, while spectators wandering around fails to assert a force of some hundreds of enemy aircraft is at large.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/27el.jpg">One aircraft in this pic</a> no one appears to be too concerned with spectators cramming every vantage point on an as yet undamaged vessel, if an attack were underway surely it would be the last place to be!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.sflistteamhouse.com/Misc/Pearl%20Harbor/original.htm">Officially</a> Beginning at 0600 hours the first wave of 183 fighters and torpedo bombers struck at the fleet in Pearl Harbor and the airfields in Hickam, Kaneohe and Ewa.</p>

<p>The second strike launched at 0715 hours consisted of 167 aircraft which struck at the same targets, at 0753 hours the next wave consisting of 40 Nakajima B5N2 &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers, 51 Aichi D3A1 &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers, 50 high Altitude bombers and 43 Zeros struck at airfields and at Pearl Harbor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>a lot of jews died on 9/11 so thats a big lie</p>

<p>you do know the emperor of japan wrote a book about the war? in it he discuses pearl harbor</p>

<p>we also have a great deal of evidence from japan about how they planned the attack and why they did it</p>

<p>regardless, at this point i am willing to accept most people on this sub just think ww2 was a hologram at this point, so fuck it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took a course about the history of modern espionage back in the day. Pearl Harbor came up. The US definitely had the intelligence, but it was ignored due to a combination of needing a reason to join the war, and racial prejudice. As in, reports were coming in about the Zero and its range etc but those on the receiving end seemed to think that the &quot;Nips&quot; couldn&#39;t see well enough in the dark to pull off such a surprise attack. Due to their slanty Asian eyes and all.</p>

<p>That just sounds like a convenient excuse though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. Every word of the hisyorical portion of it could be true. But that is not the definition of a false flag. False flag has becone an overused buzzword.</p>

<p>The definition, from wikipedia:</p>

<p>deceive in such a way that activities appear as though they are being carried out by individual entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them.&quot;</p>

<p>A false flag centres on who executes the action, not so much the how.
I can totally buy that America induced Japan to attack. In fact that much has <em>always</em> been the story, be it that the attack was <em>intentionally</em> or <em>unintentionally</em> induced.</p>

<p>Forknowledge of a <em>possible</em> attack- not false flag.</p>

<p>Political policies or moves to induce an attack-  not false flag.</p>

<p>Witholding possible information about a possible attack, regardless of whether the intent is to ensure the attack occurs or not- not false flag.</p>
