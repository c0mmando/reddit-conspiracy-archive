        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The US could easily afford to provide every single person in this country their basic needs - food, water, housing, clothing, healthcare, etc. but instead they choose not to because Republicans don&#39;t want that. Instead of making sure every person on US soil is taken care of, they instead would rather divert the money that could be used for that into the pockets of the filthy rich so they can buy yet another yacht or private jet. So basically they want everyone that isn&#39;t filthy rich to suffer. </p>

<p>This country would be <em>far</em> better off if people could pursue their passions and interests because they didn&#39;t have to worry about need, because all their needs were taken care of. People wouldn&#39;t have to work a job they hate just to put food on the table. But that is how it is today. People are forced to work against their will, or starve. That&#39;s not freedom, that is just slavery. Modern day slavery - forcing people away from their passions and interests and skills into menial, soul crushing work. Where they have to do that menial, soul crushing work day in and day out just to put food in their stomachs and a roof over their head. Fuck that shit. It doesn&#39;t have to be that way, but Republicans choose that path all so the rich can get richer. </p>

<p>We have plenty of money and resources in the US to make sure everyone&#39;s basic needs are taken care of and them some, but it doesn&#39;t happen. Republicans hate non-rich people that much and would rather die than see that come to fruition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha ha, what would people do with their time. You say that like not working is some new concept that nobody has ever even considered. I only work when I have to. I find lots of productive things to do with my time. Volunteer at the shelter, clean up litter at the park, find ways to be happy and make people around me happy. There are lots of things to do that give you a sense of worth. If all you can think to do is play the vidya (which I also do), then I feel bad for you.</p>

<p>The only reason to make this a partisan issue is so your side can keep getting rich off the taxes of all sides. Our government does not care about us and it does not matter if the color of the gang whose running the hill at the moment. Money talks an if WE as a people are ever going to make an actual change for the better WE have to come together as one and force everyone who currently holds a senate or house seat out. Or we come together as one nation and do some fund raising. Everyone pitches in a dollar and we take it right to capital hill and start buying the people some better laws and protections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism doesn’t work if people don’t have the capital to start their own businesses, and capitalism doesn’t work if these businesses cannot possibly be competitive with the established ones, regardless of quality.</p>

<p>This is the fundamental state of affairs the Republican Party desires. Monopolies. Static mobility. You can call it modern day slavery; that might be a bit dramatic.</p>

<p>In any case, the fundamental point remains valid. Capitalism must be restrained in order to function in a healthy fashion.</p>
