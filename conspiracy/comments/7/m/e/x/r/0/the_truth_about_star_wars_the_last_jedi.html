<p>The truth is that there is more than just the ‘red’ and ‘blue’ pill. That much this whole recent Star Wars charade has already shown.</p>

<p>Once the alstream block was opposed to everything that smelled like (big) government and imperialism.</p>

<p>Today that belief is different, the old is gone completely (by design)</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>those who once embraced the idea of not complying with the corrupted and globalist system and agenda are now calling for compliance with and submission to imperialism and enslavement of mankind. Millions of people that have been caught up in this alternative news media deception are now being led to the chopping block, submissively, completely docile and unaware of what they have helped to build. Their own demise.</p>

<p>SW became SJW thanks to Disney <del>programming</del> pandering to millenials.</p>

<p>It has all the symbols of the identity politics: the protagonists are feminist and a oppressed black archetypes fighting a white male villain. Flinn antagonist is a aryan-white woman (bonus point for simultaneous race and sex divide).</p>

<p>Chewie goes vegan and the cassino section is a critic of &quot;rich people profiting from innocent animals and children&quot;.</p>

<p>I can safely proclaim SW as good as dead to me.</p>

<p>The excuse is using chewie as comic relief. </p>

<p>In one scene he picks a Porg (those fluffy creatures on the trailer) and intends to eat it. But as he is about to bite another Porg does the &quot;Puss in boots&quot; eyes and our furry fella forfeits the snack.</p>

<p>So much for the &quot;rips arms off people when lose in space chess&quot; Chewie we had.</p>

What’s the point of this chewie conspiracy if it’s true? What <em>real</em> value does this achieve? Why would some shadowy entity <strong>gain</strong> from someone not wanting to eat meat? If <em>anything</em> the meat industry has a bigger foot hold in this nation and pulls more strings, so why not have chewie reject veggies and gorge on KFC and McStar burgers?
There’s no <strong>profit</strong> behind this gag, no hidden agenda 
It’s a <em>joke</em> in a movie series that has had jokes alllll along </p>

<p>Yes and Hollyweird is one of the main tools for social engineering.</p>

<p>Add that to the fact that both JJ and Rian are SJW sympathizers.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Whats the problem of having a black guy as villain? The audience can cheer for a white guy being punched but not a black one? Hows that bias reasonable?</p>

<p>Just think if Flinn and Phasma got their sex and ethnicity reversed: 
A heroic blonde dude against a villainous black woman? Heads would explode and riots would erupt in every theater. But since is reversed no one bats an eye.</p>

<p>Heck this is SW, the villain could be even non-human (like Darth Maul or Vindican). But no, it has to be white male.</p>

<p>The symbolism is there, whether you like or not.</p>

<p>Are you sure?</p>

<p>Agreed. But why a &quot;aryan&quot; white women was casted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There would absolutely be no riots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This we will never know. But we live in a world when people call drinking milk white supremacy. So I have good reasons to think that they will not cast a black person as a bad character.</p>

<p>No. And while Kylo is a big role in a larger than life franchise, he is a terrible character. Unless you enjoyed his 4yo temper tantrums from the first movie.</p>

<p>Because stormtroopers were expected to be faithful clones of Jango Fett, that, its like..not black.</p>

<p>Well..this is a conspiracy sub, isnt it?</p>

<p>I bet the majority of vegans (as the majority of people) tends to nice. BUT. The dark side of ideologies is that they capitalize on genuine, nice values and feelings (in this case, animal affinity) and weaponize it to create a divide and conquer among humans. So, whoever is playing chess with us normies is taking advantage of us for us trying to be nice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Veganism is not only about mammals. They cant even use honey (because bee exploration ya know).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why demonize not killing animals? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could you pinpoint exactly where did I demonized? I&#39;m just saying there&#39;s no moral high ground in not using animals (Not all animal use involves death. Milk and Honey are examples).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really do you need to find an ulterior evil motive for natural Empathy with other species?</p>

<p>You said Lions eat their step sons. Spiders and Bears eat their own offspring. Mantises decapitate their mates. Where&#39;s the empathy in Nature?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why apply naturalistic mechanisms to human social constructs? I</p>

<p>What constructs are we talking about?</p>

<ul>
<li>Female lead doesn&#39;t automatically scream SJW man-hating; women will sometimes be leads in movies - better get used to it</li>
<li>FINN (from his assigned code name starting with FN) is not an &quot;oppressed black archetype&quot; - he&#39;s a black dude who was made a storm trooper as a kid - presumably much like many others, at least one of whom has already been shown to be white (the chrome commander trooper.) </li>
<li>Everyone is fighting Kylo Ren, not just Finn</li>
<li>Chewie was literally cooking a dead bird to eat before not giving it to the Porg - probably not a vegan. I don&#39;t like the soft portrayal of Chewie though. I assume the whole Porg thing was meant for comedic relief, but fell quite short of good comedy imo. </li>
<li>The whole Casino narrative was a little Marxist, I&#39;ll admit; didn&#39;t see the point in a SW movie, personally. Though there is an argument to be made about vast wealth inequality in the States, where the movie was made. I&#39;m all for capitalism done well but there is an argument for it having gone a little far in the US. </li>
</ul>

<p>Before you get all riled up if you&#39;re one of those people who ties up their opinions with their identify, I only meant to make fair criticism of your arguments. I understand wanting to be against the over-sensitive lefty crowd, but there are stronger arguments to make out there. </p>

<p>But what ever the hell this new movie is, it aint Star Wars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they’ve thrown canon out the window so is anyone surprised?</p>

<p>... I liked Luke and the movie despite its faults. I’m also someone who still wants Rey to somehow be Jaina Solo while <em>also</em> wanting her to turn dark side so, what do I know lol.</p>

<p>I’m just saying even Luke pointed out that she just ran towards the evil sea vagina because she wanted something from it regardless of consequence, at least Kylo has some inner conflict. I also think Kylo is bullshitting about her parents OR he has to refer to Han and Leia as nobody for obvious dark forcey reasons. </p>

<p>Idk but I enjoyed the movie except for those bug eyed hamster-puffin hybrids... fuck Porgs. </p>
