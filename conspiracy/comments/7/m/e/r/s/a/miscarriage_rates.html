        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Please try not to be harsh- not only do i not post often  or speak about personal things but this had been a very difficult month ..but the information I heard had been bothering me for the past 2 weeks and I’m unsure what to make of it. </p>

<p>backstory- I have had 2 miscarriages within the past 6 months. I was told after the fist miscarriage that it was just bad luck, things just happen... Im currently extremely lucky to have two beautiful children who are both currently toddlers- because of this was told not to Worry about it. Fast forward 5 months to this most recent pregnancy - go to my doctor for my first trimester ultrasound to find I have another miscarriage.. my dr seemed very distraught- I am very close to her and i assumed it was because she saw how devastated we were. </p>

<p>But...</p>

<p>I went in for a checkup after initial appointment and my main dr was unavailable so the other Dr at the practice checked on me and became visibly distraught. She then hesitantly told me that within the last 2 months they have not had 1 viable pregnancy. That within all of their years of practice this has never happened and it’s been heartbreaking. 15-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage... the dr was crying when she looked at my ultra sound and said it makes no sense how their office was filled with the 20%..</p>

<p>It may be my hormones going crazy and making me crazy.. but I have been wondering if this is going on anywhere else? </p>

<p>TLDR: suffered two recent miscarriages within past several months- doctor, who was visibly upset, told me their office hasn’t had a viable pregnancy in at least 2 months and they have no idea why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right about it being localized. I very much doubt anything fishy at your doctor&#39;s office. Usually when you see highly localized rates of miscarriages and birth defects it&#39;s an environmental pollutant. See things like Erin Brockovich discovering PG&amp;E&#39;s chromium dumping through localized miscarriage and defect rates. When it happens it&#39;s usually heavy metals contamination of the water. If you can get a hold of your local water works or an inexpensive independent laboratory you can have testing done. Unfortunately some heavy metals bypass a lot of filtering processes and are unchanged when lightly heated or boiled i.e. cooking.</p>

<p>Good luck, I hope you find your answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kolbrin Book of Manuscripts mentions women not being able to to conceive during this time.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MAN:6:1 The dark days began with the last visitation of the Destroyer, and they were foretold by strange omens in the skies. All men were silent and went about with pale faces.<br/>
MAN:6:2 The leaders of the slaves, which had built a city to the glory of Thom, stirred up unrest, and no man raised his arm against them. They foretold great events of which the people were ignorant and of which the temple seers were not informed.<br/>
MAN:6:3 These were days of ominous calm, when the people waited for they knew not what. The presence of an unseen doom was felt, the hearts of men were stricken. Laughter was heard no more, and grief and wailing sounded throughout the land. Even the voices of children were stilled, and they did not play together, but stood silent.<br/>
MAN:6:4 The slaves became bold and insolent, and women were the possession of any man. Fear walked the land, and women became barren with terror, they could not conceive, and those with child aborted. All men closed up within themselves.<br/>
MAN:6:5 The days of stillness were followed by a time when the noise of trumpeting and shrilling was heard in the Heavens, and the people became as frightened beasts without a herdsman, as asses when lions prowl without their fold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have noticed an increase in miscarriage but I assumed it was because of early pregnancy detection and a miscarriage that early in the past would most get written off as a late period. I know a few people that have had later second and third trimester stillbirths which is upsetting. One was twins at 37 weeks discovered still at her scheduled csection. </p>

<p>California is an interesting state and if you aren’t living by the coast and absorbing magnesium in the air regularly I would say look into environmental toxins. Try some gentle detox baths with magnesium salts, betonite clay, drink alkaline water with a higher pH and NO fluoride. Get spring water if you can... </p>

<p>I would also add maca root into your diet. One way i do it is to make a superfood snack with a banana with chia (soak them first so they don’t absorb your nutrients once inside), hemp (plenty of protein!), nut butter (try Nutso or Trader Joe’s has a nut blend without peanuts) and I sprinkle around a tablespoon of maca on top and drizzle some honey. This snack is actually more like a meal and give you plenty of energy. </p>

<p>Maca is known to increase fertility and balance hormones. Do not continue to eat after you’ve conceived though! Do a search for “maca fertility” and you’ll see plenty of success stories... myself and friend included. </p>

<p>Avoid any vaccines before conception and while pregnant. </p>

<p>Best of luck to you and should you decide to get pregnant again, I pray it sticks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a friend who&#39;s been in the medical field for decades. She claims an increase in miscarriages (like an increase in most things) is due to improved diagnostics. Decades ago we didn&#39;t have easy access to pregnancy tests. Women didn&#39;t know they were pregnant and didn&#39;t know they had an early miscarriage, just a late &quot;period.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read that simple stressors can tell a body &quot;it&#39;s not a good time to have a child&quot; as a holdover from pre-historic humanity. Not enough food? Too many predators? Shelter insufficient? If that&#39;s true, modem day stressors (job uncertainty, political climate, terror threats) could have a similar biological response. Even if you&#39;re not directly subject to that, you could be subtly influenced by others around you emotionally with similar results.</p>

<p>I read a great article on the early 90s about pregnancy rates dropping globally, sometimes in clusters. Their analysis revealed a chemical found in urine that lowers fertility rates. It normally occurs something like 1 part per billion in drinking water, but because of increased population it&#39;s occurring more like 10 parts per billion, enough to affect fertility. Simply put: the more people on the planet, the lower the fertility rates. It&#39;s kind of a self-correcting system that inadvertently prevents global over population. </p>

<p>Not to mention food preservatives, additives, artificial sweeteners, air impurities, water, etc.  Even good portion size could be a factor. A trace amount of x in a bagel 30 years ago doubling because the bigger size of a bagel today could be enough to throw off fertility.</p>

<p>You mentioned in another comment that you drink filtered water. What about the plants and animals you consume, did they? </p>

<p>Sorry if this isn&#39;t directly helpful. </p>

If not for those two moms hounding the CDC we probably would still be calling Lyme disease rheumatoid arthritis. The doctors or maybe you might want to make a report to the local health department, or the CDC. This seems to be a localized cluster of cases.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have info on miscarriage statistics, but I&#39;ve been looking into our diet and environment and believe these could 100% effect the ability to carry. </p>

<p>If you eat non organic and processed food you consume a lot of glyphosphate and other poison that puts your digestive system  in a defensive state where it lines the intestines with mucus. That allows harmful bacteria to culture while your body can&#39;t pull in vital nutrients. </p>

<p>If you drink and bathe in fluoridated water it is neurotoxic and effects the endocrine system</p>

<p>I&#39;ve become  convinced that constantly being around high frequency microwaves from phones and towers damages the body. </p>

<p>I&#39;m in the process of mitigating these things as much as possible!  I hope I put down some useful information that you could look into if interested.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/vaccination-possible-safety-signal.html">A CDC-funded study found that women vaccinated early in pregnancy with a flu vaccine containing the pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) component and who also had been vaccinated the prior season with a  H1N1pdm09-containing flu vaccine had an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) in the 28 days after vaccination.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Water or soil pollution may be an issue, especially out there with the pesticides. I&#39;ve heard accounts of elevated miscarriages in migrant workers from that, but nothing to back it up. </p>

<p>If you filter water, I suppose the best you could do is thoroughly wash your fruits and veggies in something other than tap and maybe have your water system tested for toxins. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for your losses. My ex miscarried a couple of years after my daughter. It can be an emotional time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Filters don&#39;t really get everything out. You need to spring for the expensive reverse osmosis things or buy spring / distilled water.
All filtering does is take the hardness out (minerals and stuff) it doesn&#39;t take out chemical additives like flouride and pesticides </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right about it being localized. I very much doubt anything fishy at your doctor&#39;s office. Usually when you see highly localized rates of miscarriages and birth defects it&#39;s an environmental pollutant. See things like Erin Brockovich discovering PG&amp;E&#39;s chromium dumping through localized miscarriage and defect rates. When it happens it&#39;s usually heavy metals contamination of the water. If you can get a hold of your local water works or an inexpensive independent laboratory you can have testing done. Unfortunately some heavy metals bypass a lot of filtering processes and are unchanged when lightly heated or boiled i.e. cooking.</p>

<p>Good luck, I hope you find your answers.</p>
