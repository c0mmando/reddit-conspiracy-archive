    <div class="md"><p>Hey you might be right after all, maybe the US is being hammered by chemtrails, but personally i reckon you&#39;re a bit off with thinking its global.</p>

<p>Or maybe, and just hear me out here, geoengineering in certain aspects might not actually be a bad thing. Certain area experiencing severe drought? Lets make a fuckin storm, severe frost killing a farmers livelihood? Fuck that shit off.</p>

<p>Maybe your scared because you dont understand, thats ok though, because someone cherry picked some info and put it on a website so it must be true. So when you found out about these chemtrails did you do a lot of extensive research? I bet you did, but did you research any positives that could come from it? Did you try and prove yourself wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up near military bases and saw heavy bombers, tankers and fighters all flying at all kinds of different altitudes producing contrails. It was something I always kinda paid attention to because it was sort of interesting. You could learn to tell apart the planes by the contrails. </p>

<p>The contrails they produced look nothing like the chemtrails you see now.I still see real contrails from airliners but it&#39;s maybe only 2/3 of the trails I see that look legit to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can tell the difference of you pay attention, I have lived next to an airport for thirty years and this is how it works. Contrails dissipate at a very fast and predictable pace.  The f16 fighters that used to be based here would make actual contrails of the tips of their wings that would persist longer then engine contrails would and I could actually tell you a contrail was made by a fighter jet because of how it persisted. I can&#39;t do that anymore because a lot of the &quot;contrails&quot; now persist at that rate or much, much longer, turn into a small cloud formation then dissipate and form a hazy mess. I myself saw a plane abruptly start then stop a big fat noxious trail it was making at cruising altitude in stable clear sky. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been admitted to by someone in the US government as stratospheric aerosol injections. My kindle even wanted to autocomplete aerosol after I typed in stratospheric for the first time in my life, so there&#39;s some more food for thought.</p>
