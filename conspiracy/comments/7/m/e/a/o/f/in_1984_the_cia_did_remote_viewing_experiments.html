       I was stunned when I read this document a few months ago. However a few redditors said that the CIA may have manufactured fake documents in order to see who might be leaking information. Given the nature of this document, it almost seems too good to be true. Personally I hope it's true.

       If you were capable enough to understand how roads are built, you would know that you’re driving on roads that have been paid for in full 10 times in the last 10 years  but haven’t been redone for 20-30 years so yes, muh poorly spent tax dollars are in play here

       Thanks for this. Another wonderful example is the current CA gas tax law. The people of CA voted an overwhelming 78% against the newest tax on gas which was for schools and roads because of one reason, the last 2 times the tax on gas was applied the funds didn’t go where they where supposed to (schools and roads). Jerry dick-ass Brown signed it into law anyways and guess what, he already proposed a bill for this new gas tax money to be spent elsewhere. You can’t make this shit up, this is all 100% non-disputed fact

       Right?! Literally an entire population voted no to a law because it has failed the people before, the governor signs it into law because he’s an ass-hat who knows re-election is not possible, that same governor abuses that laws fiscal integrity the same way the people witnessed first hand repeatedly and literally jack shit will be done at all. I run with a typically more conservative crowd as a general contractor but still even my friends are not that bothered by it. Everyone says that’s the usual or well that’s pretty typical but no one wants (or even knows how) to change that. Crazy shit in CA. I hope the mad max shit starts here.

       Hahah but really... how would we know? I've tried to look for discussions online but can't really find much. Is it unreasonable to expect an intelligent civilization to have evolved, gone extinct, and then been buried by volcanic activity given the age of mars? Is the level of volcanic activity required to cover the surface of mars not realistic?

      <p>
       But if it really was all buried... how would we ever find out?

       Hmmmm... The only time I can specifically remember children being used for remote viewing was in FBI files... there was some school to teach people to see through walls (even if they were blind) and do other similar tasks and the FBI though it would be good to find out more about it cause it would be awesome for reading people's mail... I think in the end they determined that it was just a parlor trick the instructor was really good at.

       I think it's interesting that the monitor in Paper 1, at one point, says the subject appears to be losing his ability to accurately place himself at the provided coordinates. Does that mean for the first few coordinates,
       <em>
        he was actually giving them answers that reflected what those coordinates actually contained?

       I don't know if anybody can really explain this, a lot of it is theory and remains at this point purely empirical. The document does a good job in doing that really, the author is pretty clear this isn't a subject that one can grasp with pure linear thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would begin by digging into Quantum Physics and the concepts behind them. Possible explanations into how and why it works. It might key you in on some far eastern philosophies, that is, it can explain the phrase 'one with the universe' potentially.

       Erwin Schrödinger
Werner Heisenberg to name a couple theorists - they're not the only ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most curious thing about this topic is this - now, keep in mind I'm not a meditation expert, I don't practice it, but I've had strange experiences with the use of it. I'm not special.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, if I can do it then anybody can. Step one is believing you can - myself or anybody else can't tell you what you're capable of, ultimately that's decided by you. The best way to understand some of it might be to experience it for yourself.

       That first paper reminds me of the spirit science videos on humanity's hidden human history, and trust me that gives me no great pleasure to draw a connection between the two.

       Well, as when you ever draw a link to Spirit Science, the connection is tenuous at best. The man undergoing the altered state in the CIA doc is describing, well, basically aliens living in hibernation on Mars. Their planet is dying (the environment was "corrupted" as it were i.e. they destroyed their own planet, although this wasn't stated explicitly, I've inferred it from his unconscious choice of word here). They are looking for a new home or a solution to some kind of problem, some amount of their people went a great distance to find a new home.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the spirit science hidden human history video, the Martians destroyed their own planet through pollution and war. They "blew up their own atmosphere". This all occurred after what was described as the "Lucifer experiment" which basically made Martians evil. To escape their own demise, they decided to leave Mars around one million years ago, shortly after the Lucifer experiment and subsequent destruction of their civilization and environment, and came millions of years in the future to Earth via space and time travel using a technology of some sort referred to as a synthetic Merkaba. They supposedly arrived 65,000 years ago, during which time the Martians came to Earth and invades the Atlanteans. The use of this Markaba destroyed what remained of the Martians on Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       To summarize, the subject in the CIA doc described intense geological activity that seemed to have destroyed large portions of Mars. Megalithic structures seemingly rose and fell from the planet's crust itself, and then mounds of dirt covering everything. Sounds like the Mercaba machine described by Spirit Science. There is on particular part of that "experiment" that stands out-a description of a tesseract, also known as a hypercube.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       From the document, "The cluster of squares up and down. Um…..it’s like you want to make them square anyway. They’re almost flush with the ground and it’s like they’re connected….Something very white or reflects light."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some images and videos that might make this connection apparent.
       <a href="https://vimeo.com/79702430">
        Example one
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQrKPIXPPkM">
        example two
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x4P65EKjt0">
        example three
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/HypercubeGraphUnitDistance_1000.gif">
        example four
       </a>
       . This description most fits the hypercube in the cult classic "cube" horror series, which is a cube consisting of thousands or millions of other cubes that are shifting around within the larger cube, traveling through both time and space as the hypercube constantly re-arranges itself, perhaps outside of our reality itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in the CIA document, the subject references a "globe inside of a comet's tail" or a river. In Spirit Science's video, the Martians wanted to shoot a comet on a collision course with Earth out of the sky with laser technology. The Atlanteans protested, then the comet hit the martian-atlantean civilization and destroyed large martian settlements, which they made the martians make another merkaba, tear open holes in reality etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again super tenuous, but, come on, it's spirit science.
