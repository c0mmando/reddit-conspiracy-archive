        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m writing this because I started noticing parameters at the end of certain post URLs on Reddit, which seem to get added in a sneaky way. This makes me think it is a sneaky tracking mechanism, for what purpose I can only speculate...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what happens - I find a post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> front page I want to read, so I click the link to the comments and it opens the full post. In the browser address bar I notice two parameters at the end of the URL that should not be there - st and sh. I say they should not be there because the comments link does not contain those parameters when I hover the mouse over the link. It seems that the parameters get added on click (via Javascript), and the parameters appear to be randomized each time you click the link. This is similar to phishing tactics. It&#39;s rather sneaky they are doing this sort of URL manipulation, but in the age of advertisements and analytics and tracking, this is par for the course. So far.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem I have with this.</p>

<p>Assume you now decide to copy the URL and send it to a friend, or paste it into a Tor browser. <em>You just exposed your anonymity.</em> That URL, with the unique st and sh parameters, has now been visited by two people (or two web browsers), and they can link those two together easily with the st and sh, creating a group of both identified and anonymous users. If they wanted to identify the anonymous user they could ask/investigate one of the identified users in the group.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Reddit is doing this to expose hidden user groups and Tor users, but it is possible to exploit this in such a way in my opinion.</p>

<p>Researching this issue I found the following post which includes a statement from a Reddit admin:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/help/comments/4qbtd1/why_reddit_recently_started_adding_parameters_at/">https://np.reddit.com/r/help/comments/4qbtd1/why_reddit_recently_started_adding_parameters_at/</a></p>

<p>(Funny thing is, the URL above had the st and sh parameters when I pasted the link and I almost forgot to remove them)</p>

<p>So according to that post, Reddit was &quot;running a small test&quot;. <em>But that was a year ago...</em></p>

<p>Further down the comments you will find a user struggling to disable this behavior. He includes a user script (Javascript) that may be useful to some people. Anyhow, moving on...</p>

<p>The admin included a link which explains the test:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/updates/81c57a78-3cb5-11e6-84fb-0e395ea06b87">https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/updates/81c57a78-3cb5-11e6-84fb-0e395ea06b87</a></p>

<p>Pretty vague. Keep in mind this was a year ago. What was the result of the test? Why is the test still in place? Will the test ever end?</p>

<p>Then this part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When viewing a link&#39;s comment pages, a small percentage of users will notice a short parameter appended to the URL. This will allow us to understand what happens after the link is shared somewhere</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand what happens? Well that&#39;s vague. I can tell you what happens, the link gets clicked by people. So why do they need to &quot;understand what happens&quot;? And why is this done only to a small percentage of users? Why does this happen even when the user has tracking turned off in preferences? What the hell is going on here?</p>

<hr/>

<p>TLDR; Reddit is using stealth tracking on some users, even when tracking is turned off in preferences. This theoretically could be used by an engineer or analytics algorithm to reveal hidden user groups and expose anonymous users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the fuck would I lie about that. Trust me, I nearly had a heart attack and thought my card got skimmed. It was a payphone with a credit card reader and didn&#39;t have the posted rates. For some reason the &quot;fee&quot; to use a credit card was stupid expensive (I called them...) It&#39;s brilliant on their part. Phones are in a noisy ass place and you can&#39;t hear the rates being stated at the beginning of the call. They refused to refund my money so I did a charge back on my amex. So no, not made up bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. This is just A/B testing. Email marketing campaigns do the same thing. You split an email that’s being sent out to masses into different batches/groups. Each group is then compared to each other. Could be one group reviewed the email at 2pm and another at 6pm. Sometimes the emails have slightly different content. This helps determine what contents performs better. </p>

<p>In this case it’s unlikely that the user has the suffix tied to their username. More likely a wide group of users see the same suffix. Realistically though, you would be placed into a group because of information/data they already have on you.</p>

<p>Really, adjusting your privacy settings is somewhat useless in the big picture.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/115483/htg-explains-learn-how-websites-are-tracking-you-online/">one article</a> that just touches on how we&#39;re tracked (2016). There are more unique identifiers and tracking systems that have and are being developed and it will continue. As soon as we are able to foil one, sure as shit, a more complex system/method prevails. </p>

<p>Imagine all your FB messages/posts, phone texts, emails, doctor visits, tax issues, reddit posts, search inquiries, sites visited, text (comments, personal data, whatever) typed into some text box but then deleted or abandoned, anything you&#39;ve browsed or entered online. Words spoken around your devices, things visually done in range of your device camera lens (oh!). Imagine it&#39;s all in the process of being captured and eventually fully aggregated under your unique user id.  </p>

<p>The only way to reduce the continued leaking of your private information/habits/contacts is to quit using your computer, phone and any other &#39;smart&#39; devices. Not even a VPN or TOR is failsafe. Not saying it doesn&#39;t make sense to initiate any precautions you can right now.</p>

<p>However, since 99.9% of every entity we do some sort of business with is already spewing all your personal data out to the online world, well, we&#39;ve all already been pretty much exposed and there&#39;s really no going back.</p>

<p>Indeed. I have though maybe the &quot;way out&quot; would be to spill the data openly to the public. Give up on the idea of privacy and make it all public. Obviously nobody is going to do that when they have everything to gain from said data, but just aswell as &quot;they&quot; can monitor us, there&#39;s a lot we could monitor too.</p>

<p>As an example, only a few people per a small city participating using software defined radios to monitor &amp; triangulating signals could give away the locations of people. Would need to be correlated with some other data to make sense who&#39;s who, but doable nonetheless.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that&#39;s illegal in many places or if not in everywhere. But so should be this one sided data collection too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Want more privacy? Create an account! Heh heh</p>

<p>With an account they get to track every device and browser you log in from, your authenticated email address, etc etc.</p>

<p>So imagine logging into your account on computer A with Chrome, then logging into the same account on computer B with Tor browser. Now they know who you are :) They got your IP address, location, device, and all those other lovely user fingerprints from that one time you logged in with Chrome. You don&#39;t even need computer B for this to happen. Log into computer A with Chrome and then with Tor browser. Hello this user likes to use Tor browser and we know a lot about him/her based on that time they logged in with Chrome.</p>

<p>Take this a step further. Say you&#39;re browsing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in Chrome while logged out. Then you find a post where you want to comment. You open up Tor browser and log into your Reddit account. You copy and paste the link from Chrome, which happens to contain those random st and sh parameters. BOOM you just blew your anonymity.</p>

<p>So why is Reddit doing this? Is it for their advertisers? Is it to prevent brigading? Is it to identify anonymous users? Maybe a bit of everything?</p>

Inside that PDF would be a little JavaScript code that reports your IP address to someone. There are plenty of ways. These are things Tor browser users are aware of, and work to avoid. But now we have Reddit stamping links with unique tokens which can be used to correlate and identify anonymous users and it has been going on for at least a year without much explanation. It&#39;s rather curious.</p>

<p>There is a constant battle raging for businesses to deliver targeted ads. This is done by tracking people. They can only do that by defeating your anonymity. So it&#39;s kind of a big problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good sleuthing OP, some things they might be doing with this... &#39;subtle&#39; tracking feature:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brigade tracking, seeing when a link is bringing in a bunch of users from different subs to sway the opinion of a sub (down/upvote). Makes it easier to ID the &#39;problem&#39; subs.</li>
<li>Bot tracking, similar to brigading, the bots swarm on a post from a central link. Easy to track down the whole net and ban them.</li>
<li>User tracking, association of alts with mains</li>
<li>Origin tracking, having a more solid grasp of userbases and demographics</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand...</p>

<p>OP is trying to find meaning in the china pattern on the RMS Titanic, positing that the pattern was so expensive that it must mean that corners were cut in construction. </p>

<p>OP wonders this in a dining room ankle-deep in freezing cold sea water. OP is angry that  the sounds of panicked passengers trying to throw women and children into life boats that have already launched is distracting them from the thought that maybe some aspect of this ship won&#39;t make it as seaworthy long term as was first touted.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a &quot;we can run but we can&#39;t hide&quot; thing at all - it&#39;s that OP is wondering about tracking when Reddit has been tracking all of us for <em>years</em>, and literally tells you this when you go to the website for the first time. This is about people doing some amateur hour navel contemplation and if we&#39;re all supposed to be here clapping for them while they do it because other people weren&#39;t even that observant. It&#39;s common on Reddit - <a href="/r/moviedetails">/r/moviedetails</a> is a prime example. People get buckets of upvotes for noticing things like <em>the point of the plot</em>. Why waste all these resources on circle-jerking when you&#39;ve become desensitized to the reality that&#39;s worse?</p>

<p>My &quot;run but not hide&quot; comment was a generalization. Of course the cow was out of the barn long ago.</p>

<p>There are a myriad of ways that agencies and other entities can track, obfuscate and manipulate online activities.</p>

<p>I was telling people about it 30 years ago and when I got to trying to explain Alice Springs, people&#39;s eye&#39;s glazed over, right before they spewed, &quot;well, if I&#39;m not doing anything wrong.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a couple of big changes to Reddit from this month that haven&#39;t been mentioned in <a href="/r/announcements">/r/announcements</a> or <a href="/r/blog">/r/blog</a> as far as I know. </p>

<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2017/12/07/reddit-sprinklr-sold-its-soul-to-brand-engagement-customer-care/">Reddit partners with brand engagement platform Sprinklr</a>. From the <a href="https://www.sprinklr.com/pr/sprinklr-announces-strategic-partnership-drive-customer-engagement-care-reddit/">presser</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sprinklr, the most complete social platform for managing customer experiences at scale, today announced an expanded partnership with Reddit, allowing brands to access historical and real-time Reddit data, send and receive private messages and publish to any subreddit all within Sprinklr’s platform. Global companies can now use Sprinklr to listen to what customers are saying, analyze trending topics and manage Reddit customer care directly through the Sprinklr platform.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/13/microsoft-looks-to-make-bing-results-smarter-with-a-little-help-from-reddit/">Microsoft looks to make Bing results smarter with new AI-powered features and Reddit partnership</a>. To quote, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the company announced a partnership with Reddit to surface results from the site more effectively. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian announced that the two were collaborating to integrate Reddit content more directly into Bing search results, funneling info from Reddit crowd-sourced AMAs and other posts into Bing. You can ask Bing things like, “How accurate is HBO’s Band of Brothers?” and highly up-voted responses will be right there for users on Bing.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The partnership is also focused on taking the detailed, highly-localized info from Reddit posts and funneling it into Bing searches so that users with similar prompts can be given more nuanced answers. Reddit’s UI is famously not that great on desktop, so Microsoft distilling the wall of text in a more effective manner is pretty essential.</p>

<p>Maybe Reddit admins have decided to enforce their ToS against people who use the site for organized PR campaigns? Probably not all of them, of course, since certain organizations clearly have implicit permission to operate on the site, but maybe they&#39;re going to use this kind of tracking to identify unwanted shill organizations to shut them down? </p>

<p>It&#39;s very good marketing material and would be useful for knowing what users want.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty suspicious though, they would have done a little more talking in the post about what they&#39;re doing with the material if they weren&#39;t being shady.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was using the official Reddit app for mobile, until the spyware made it unusable. After I subscribed to this sub and commented and viewed the post about the Vegas shooting being tied to Saudi Arabia, the record/body sensor light on my phone kept turning on for no reason. The app started slowing down, then started mixing up links that I clicked on. Finally the app refused to load most everything and drained my battery within minutes of use. After I deleted the app and started using a third party, everything stopped, the sensor doesn&#39;t go off randomly anymore either. Be careful out there. Don&#39;t draw too much attention, or they will re-assess your metadata.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend, as a software engineer and web developer I can tell you that this tactics have been done now for over a decade.  URL is one technique but cookies are another. Here is what makes your browser activity unique to us even if you block cookies and ads.  Browser window size, OS, browser, browser version, location, region, ISP, DNS, IP, even the hops you make. </p>

<p>People have predictable browsing patterns that can be tracked even without cookies. You just have to track everything and you will start to see patters.</p>

<p>url params are usually used as a way to track back the link in order to pay out the refer. Those IDs st and sh are probably the affiliate IDs and a some unique identifier to track the link hopping activity. </p>

<p>What you need to understand is this. If you click on a link it is stored somehwere with all the details I have specified above and even more data that you probably would not even think of, but they track it. Not because they are actively tracking you, but because they will eventually use it to find patterns and trends for advertising reasons or what ever they like to do with it. There is no way around it, unless you are doing things to keep them from doing that.  Which I will say, it is also tracked as a pattern. If you go out of your way to stop these tracking mechanism, that activity is also tracked and stored as a pattern.</p>

<p>If you log in with a VPN, tracked, if you block cookies, tracked, if you have an ad blocker, tracked, if you block cookies, tracked, all of those &quot;security measures&quot; create a profile on you as well.</p>

<p>There is no place to hide, the only way to hide is in plain sight.</p>

<p>So, I went to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and clicked on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7mwcoo/buddy_of_mine_took_this_amazing_picture_in_south/">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7mwcoo/buddy_of_mine_took_this_amazing_picture_in_south/</a> , and it changed the link to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7mwcoo/buddy_of_mine_took_this_amazing_picture_in_south/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=all">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7mwcoo/buddy_of_mine_took_this_amazing_picture_in_south/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=all</a> . After the page loaded, the url in the title bar switched back to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7mwcoo/buddy_of_mine_took_this_amazing_picture_in_south/">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7mwcoo/buddy_of_mine_took_this_amazing_picture_in_south/</a> . Because it kept erasing the parameters, I had to re-click on the page a bunch of times trying different ways to capture the whole url before the tail of it vanished. I finally got it with ctrl-A ctrl-C.</p>

<p>So... whatever you&#39;re seeing is not happening on my account.</p>

<p>I have seen what you&#39;re describing happen on other websites, though. I&#39;ll be on some website, and it&#39;ll add ?=29fsauifyhv9 or whatever at the end. So I test it a few times to see if the link works without that bit, and it does. So, the extra bit must be for tracking who came from which link posted by who. I always strip it off at the end - even if I didn&#39;t care about tracking, it just makes the link look ugly and unnecessarily long. But I think if I see that again, I just won&#39;t link to those sites.</p>
