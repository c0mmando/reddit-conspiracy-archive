        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So in the mornings, I have no choice but to listen to MSM (Fox News) while I work. On my break, I like to browse the news to put their propaganda in context. Without hearing both sides, it&#39;s hard to determine the truth.</p>

<p>Right now Fox News&#39;s anti-Mueller has rhetoric reached a fever pitch. To any remotely unbiased observer, it&#39;s clear as day that they are scared of something. <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/12/28/why-are-all-these-florida-republicans-attacking-bob-mueller/">And I would be money that the conspiracy described in this article is what they are worried about:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In just the last few weeks, his prosecutors have begun questioning Republican National Committee staffers about the party digital operation that worked with the Trump campaign to target voters in key swing states. They are seeking to determine if the joint effort was related to the activities of Russian trolls and bots aimed at influencing the American electorate...</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s a coincidence that so much of the [stolen] information in question was republished on a website called HelloFLA by a Florida Republican and former congressional staffer named Aaron Nevins, who was connected to Trump associate and longtime political operative Roger Stone. It could be completely random that among the core group of Mueller antagonists, those calling the probe a &quot;coup d&#39;état&quot; and demanding purges of members of the &quot;deep state&quot; are Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who proposed that Mueller&#39;s funding be cut off, and the aforementioned Rep. Francis Rooney, who&#39;s been all over TV talking about purging the FBI.</p>

He specifically references a meeting with, obviously, AM (Andy) discussing an insurance policy regarding the election.  It’s highly suspect and not simply personal opinion.  At a minimum the language is referring to a joint effort by members of the agency, discussed on agency property, to interfere with some level of democracy.  Please, come to terms with the fact that, as most veterans here know, the government is always up to something fishy, and here we caught some red handed.  Hate Trump all you want, but these agents were up to something.  </p>

<p>Lastly, what baseball player playing the Yankees would want all the umps to be former Yankees in a World Series game?  I get it, political affiliation is everywhere but saying “Trump should want this because it clears him” is moronic.  He should want an independent and fair investigation, yes - we all would.  That’s not necessarily what he’s getting.  Yes, some of these agents on the investigation have been purged but what damage have they already done?  Will Trump be able to challenge the results based on this? - potentially yes!  Thereby prolonging this madness at the financial and mental well being of the nation.  </p>

<p>You can still be all of those, and still be super dumb and feelings based liberal logic style. I don&#39;t know you personally, I was generalizing that most libtards have gone off the deep end and/or are very low IQ. If that&#39;s not you then don&#39;t worry about it. If it is, I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t help you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you say is suspect. Especially because you are starting with the premise that there are only two sides. Ever heard of good cop, bad cop? When you realize that there are more than two sides to any issue, that red vs blue is a silly distraction, to keep you distracted then you might be on your way to the truth. Your post is very politically charged for someone who claims to be unbiased, you are going to have to try a lot harder to be more believable. Sorry and good luck if you are on a quest for truth, you have a long way to go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump and several members of the gop swear up and down they are innocent but they act so guilty pretty much all the time.  </p>

<p>If this investigation concluded today and trump was found completely innocent, the American people would feel like they coukd trust him and his approval rating would skyrocket.   He knows this.   So if he were innocent he would just go with the investigation until it were over.</p>

<p>But no.  Instead they  call people names, try to discredit,  lie, lie, lie, lie, try to confuse, and misdirect.  What does that sound like?  The behaviour of a guilty party.  Facts.</p>
