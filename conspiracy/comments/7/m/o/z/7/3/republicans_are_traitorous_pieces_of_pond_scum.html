        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Republicans sold their soul to the devil and worked directly with Russia to hack our elections and elect Trump. He didn&#39;t have the most support, he was not the democratic choice, he only won because of Russian hacking sponsored by Republicans.</p>

<p>Republicans are traitors that should be punished for this, but they own congress and the presidency right now and are protecting themselves. If everyone bands together and votes democrat we can expell them and try them for their crimes. The problem is the damage has already been done. Trump has run this country into the ground in less than a year. Even though he was fraudulently elected, he still assumed office and has taken a wrecking ball to this country. Economy, taxes, debt, deficit, environment, foreign policy, foreign relations, police shootings, minority rights, LGBT rights, all ran into the ground and down the tubes.</p>

<p>No mention of the DNC plans to rig the general election by Creamer and Foval? No mention of Hillary&#39;s campaign stealing the nomination away from an opponent that probably WOULD have defeated trump? No mention of the numerous ways the Clintons abused their positions of power to enrich themselves? We won&#39;t even get into Benghazi or the people around them that die in mysterious ways because as she said &quot;what difference does it make?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol no.</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t have jack-shit to do with the establishment politicians ruining this country and in fact, is reversing the damage done.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Eliminating ISIS - there is no doubt that Obama not only allowed ISIS to continue existing, he actively funded them along with the other usual suspects - HRC and McCain. Syria owes a great debt to us otherwise they would be overrun by extremists by now. HRC would&#39;ve completed the extermination of Syrian-Christians, 100%.</p></li>
<li><p>Pulled us out of globalist plans including NAFTA, TPP, and Paris Climate Accords.</p></li>
<li><p>Securing the border which was left open by TPTB to allow unrestricted drug flow, human trafficking, and unfiltered illegal immigration.</p></li>
<li><p>Pedo-rings being shut down. Thousands upon thousands of pedos have been arrested in Trump&#39;s first year - verging on what, five, even ten-fold to Obama&#39;s 8 years.</p></li>
<li><p>MSM Mockingbird exposed, funders exposed, Google exposed, globalist companies exposed with multitudes of CEOs &quot;stepping down.&quot; Lol &quot;Trump&#39;s another puppet&quot; except the status-quo&#39;s been blown to shit. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I could go on but you get the point. Future events will further solidify Trump&#39;s legacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the united states is defined as a corporation, not a sovereign nation, that makes jesuit educated trump the president of a corporation, not the owner</p>

<p>so america is a crown corporation, and in 1215 king john signed pope innocent III&#39;s magna carta which made the vatican the feudal overlords of england, and nothing has changed since</p>

<p>so trump is just another roman puppet like all others they allow on our ballots, presidents/leaders were never elected, they are selected</p>

<p>trump has ties to the black nobility, the sovereign military order of malta, jesuits and the italian mafia</p>

He has superior intelligence on nearly every front, it&#39;s why he&#39;s always managed to be ahead of the game, whatever it may be.

<p>NK&#39;s Kim jong Un can be seen doing the masonic hidden hand gesture in many photos, suggesting he is a freemason, he was also educated in Switzerland which borders Italy(rome), Switzerland is basically a papal state, which is why hitler never invaded it, even though it borders Germany</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freemason is not the correct term. He&#39;s just a puppet for the deep state, allowed to exist for strategic tension and act as the detonator for war.

Comey was asked if Trump pressured him to not investigate the Russian Hacks and Comey said no! The only thing Mueller has learned is that the reason Flynn contacted Russia after the election was because Kushner asked him to on behalf of Israel.  Stop with the spam!</p>
