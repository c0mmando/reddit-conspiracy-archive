It was a slap in the face, but I finally had to come to terms with the fact that there were groups of people apparently paid to influence the direction of those discussions. s/conspiracy is just a broader springboard for these groups, apparently. Anyway, it&#39;s good to know I&#39;m not crazy. Thanks.</p>

Trump is clearly <em>doing things that accord with much of the r/conspiracy discourse</em>. That is it.

<p>Also, where were your protestations about the integrity of the FBI when Comey announced the investigation into Clinton&#39;s emails? No one said shit about the integrity of the FBI back then. Now, when there&#39;s not only credible evidence that points to possible treason by the POTUS or his staff, that&#39;s when you choose to talk shit about the FBI. Ok, sure.

    <div class="md"><p>Help me understand. What is your criticism of what I said? You originally said my statement (that attacks on the integrity of the FBI were a setup to dispute the findings of the Mueller investigation) was weak and easy to criticize because American intel agencies are notoriously corrupt. </p>

<p>I asked &quot;what specific criticism(s) do you have about the Mueller investigation?&quot; </p>

<p>You said &quot;that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m saying you should be critical of the FBI because this is r/consiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>And I said &quot;Ok, the FBI and other intel agencies have done shitty things. So what?&quot;</p>

<p>Now you say I&#39;m not engaging with you honestly. So, please clarify: what the fuck are you saying? If you don&#39;t have a criticism of the Mueller investigation, then attacks against the integrity of Mueller and the FBI in general are indeed a clear setup to dispute the results of the Russian investigation. Are you under the impression that the GOP suddenly chose this moment in time (as the Mueller investigation gets several big guilty pleas and at least one to flip on the POTUS) to criticize the integrity of the agency randomly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is prima facie absurd, given the traditional collective narrative of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, and the close connections between that narrative and Trump&#39;s words and actions, to think that Trump support on a conspiracy forum would be surprising, and hence need to be explained with &quot;Trump loonies!&quot;. Without considering anything specific, this is what we are looking at. So unless you have a dazzling insight that explains why conspiracy theorists wouldn&#39;t naturally support a politician that is speaking there language, then it is highly likely that you are 100% full of shit. That is all there is to it. None of your water-muddyings matter to the basic, obvious reality.</p>

<p>For one, it&#39;s irrelevant to me and to this discussion what a first glance of the relationship <em>should be</em> between the POTUS and r/conspiracy. That is a lazy argument if ever there was one. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whatever it is you think you see as a &quot;given&quot; is not shared. It&#39;s not a &quot;given&quot;. What words and actions of the POTUS are playing into the &quot;traditional collective conspiracy theorist narrative&quot;? What the fuck is the &quot;traditional collective conspiracy theorist narrative&quot; anyway? Is that what you&#39;re hanging you&#39;re entire understanding of this argument on? Some armchair sociological theory that you made up by reading the r/conspiracy sub? What nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without even needing to consider anything specific...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s rich coming from the author of a purely emotive argument. So again, if you don&#39;t have a <em>specific</em>  claim of impropriety or corruption of the Mueller investigation, why is it you think the GOP chose this moment in time to try to impugn the integrity of the FBI? Because they&#39;ve done corrupt things in the past? OK, but that doesn&#39;t answer the question of why now. </p>

<p>The real absurdity is acting like the attacks on the FBI from only one political party are happening in a vacuum, without regard to the Mueller investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both sides of the political dialectic have been dumped into the conspiracy world.  The right is being brought in by Trumpism and the left is being brought in by Russagate and other anti Trump conspiracies.  Both of these sides crashing together in the conspiracy world has muddied the waters for true independent thinkers.</p>

<p>Politics and Media is as real as WCW wrestling.  It&#39;s all an act with narratives and story lines.  People that don&#39;t release this are part of the problem.</p>
