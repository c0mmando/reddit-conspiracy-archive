       Whenever I get downvoted for saying something fairly rational and uncontroversial (like the attempts to smear the FBI are a setup for the conclusions of the Mueller investigation), those users opposed to this often have comment karma in the 20k-40k range and corresponding post karma, and have been here for a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's suspect as shit. Can't prove they paid for karma, but it's suspect.

       The botting is limited to upvote/downvote manipulation. Here are some links to python scripts on github that do exactly this :

      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind what is available on GitHub is likely not as powerful as private scripts that have never been released to the public. What really sucks beyond vote manipulation is when your reddit account gets put in a dictionary and these scripts just attack your account every time they run.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont believe that bot AI has reached a point that it can effectively assess a comment and begin to astroturf a given comment. We are getting close to that but you still the spontaneous wit of a skilled propaganda artist/forum slider to be a truly effective control of discussion.

       Apparently you have. I'm just a student of propaganda. I jumped into the 9/11 fray in 06 and watched strategies of thread derailment evolve over time. It was a slap in the face, but I finally had to come to terms with the fact that there were groups of people apparently paid to influence the direction of those discussions. s/conspiracy is just a broader springboard for these groups, apparently. Anyway, it's good to know I'm not crazy. Thanks.

       But if you're posting in a subreddit with a particular history of discourse, which of course r/conspiracy has, and you post "rational and uncontroversial" things
       <em>
        that contravene that historical discourse
       </em>
       , then you are completely disingenuous if you pretend it's suspicious that you get voted down. Trump is clearly
       <em>
        doing things that accord with much of the r/conspiracy discourse
       </em>
       . That is it. All this huffing and puffing in an attempt to flip that into its opposite is so strained and unconvincing, that it is ridiculous.

       How does framing an attack on the integrity of the FBI right during a major investigation into the dealings of the POTUS as a setup to dispute the results of the investigation "contravene historical discourse"? What exactly are you talking about?

       Do you have any evidence that Mueller is corrupt? People have been implying that all over the place but I have yet to see a single bit of credible evidence to support that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, where were your protestations about the integrity of the FBI when Comey announced the investigation into Clinton's emails? No one said shit about the integrity of the FBI back then. Now, when there's not only credible evidence that points to possible treason by the POTUS or his staff, that's when you choose to talk shit about the FBI. Ok, sure. Let's put all of your questionable timing to the side and examine any evidence for corruption in the Mueller investigation. I'm all ears. What have you got?

       I never said Mueller is corrupt. You are ranting bizarrely.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your implicit reasoning here is obvious and idiotic. It is a fact that "conspiracy theorists" traditionally view intelligence agencies warily. That is the fact I cited. Nothing you've ranted even bears on that.
      </p>
      <p>

       Help me understand. What is your criticism of what I said? You originally said my statement (that attacks on the integrity of the FBI were a setup to dispute the findings of the Mueller investigation) was weak and easy to criticize because American intel agencies are notoriously corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked "what specific criticism(s) do you have about the Mueller investigation?"
      </p>
      <p>
       You said "that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying you should be critical of the FBI because this is r/consiracy."
      </p>
      <p>
       And I said "Ok, the FBI and other intel agencies have done shitty things. So what?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you say I'm not engaging with you honestly. So, please clarify: what the fuck are you saying? If you don't have a criticism of the Mueller investigation, then attacks against the integrity of Mueller and the FBI in general are indeed a clear setup to dispute the results of the Russian investigation. Are you under the impression that the GOP suddenly chose this moment in time (as the Mueller investigation gets several big guilty pleas and at least one to flip on the POTUS) to criticize the integrity of the agency randomly?

       False. If you don't know how to read, then I am not interested in trying to "help you".

       Trump has acted in a way that has given hope to "conspiracy theorists". This simple fact renders all your puffing moot. You can't browbeat people into disbelieving what they see with their own eyes. The active push to muddy the waters on this sub only reveals the workings of the propaganda state.

       It is prima facie absurd, given the traditional collective narrative of "conspiracy theorists", and the close connections between that narrative and Trump's words and actions, to think that Trump support on a conspiracy forum would be surprising, and hence need to be explained with "Trump loonies!". Without considering anything specific, this is what we are looking at. So unless you have a dazzling insight that explains why conspiracy theorists wouldn't naturally support a politician that is speaking there language, then it is highly likely that you are 100% full of shit. That is all there is to it. None of your water-muddyings matter to the basic, obvious reality.

       Whatever it is you think you see as a "given" is not shared. It's not a "given". What words and actions of the POTUS are playing into the "traditional collective conspiracy theorist narrative"? What the fuck is the "traditional collective conspiracy theorist narrative" anyway?

       That's rich coming from the author of a purely emotive argument. So again, if you don't have a
       <em>
        specific
       </em>
       claim of impropriety or corruption of the Mueller investigation, why is it you think the GOP chose this moment in time to try to impugn the integrity of the FBI? Because they've done corrupt things in the past? OK, but that doesn't answer the question of why now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real absurdity is acting like the attacks on the FBI from only one political party are happening in a vacuum, without regard to the Mueller investigation.

       Argument, justification, whatever you want to call it, it's the reason you think the things you think. And I'm pointing out that your logic to get to that conclusion is flawed. Ignore it if you want; misunderstand if you want. Not my problem. That's on you.

       Both sides of the political dialectic have been dumped into the conspiracy world.  The right is being brought in by Trumpism and the left is being brought in by Russagate and other anti Trump conspiracies.  Both of these sides crashing together in the conspiracy world has muddied the waters for true independent thinkers.

       Explain to me what kind of bots the CIA has if Russia has bots everywhere. Is the CIA good at using covert technology? Is the CIA Russia's bitch?

       It's possible, and there certainly those types. The loudest accounts that I've seen in favor of Trump however tend to be new, less than 6 month year  old accounts that post almost exclusively in T_D and here
      </p>

       Could be a case of people making new accounts I suppose
