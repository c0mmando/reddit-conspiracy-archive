       Simple, the global elites hate Trump.. Bushs hate Trump, McCain hates Trump, Clinton's hate Trump, and most MSM hates Trump (fox just doesn't want to lose ratings,  but we see from primaries they hate Trump too).
      </p>
      <p>
       And furthermore YOU hate Trump! WHY?
Ask yourself which of his policies negatively affected your life. Was it the travel ban? The tax relief and cutting of subsidies for major donors? This hate I guarantee comes from the vomit MSM is spewing daily towards Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       What to do? Look at press briefings with Sarah Sanders, look at news articles about Trump that aren't bullshit doomsday warnings. You'll see that he's not a rich monster and that the real monster is the communist nazis who dream of the day where Eugenics and basic income for the little people is a reality. If you think socialism can exist without the govt controlling everything you are blind.

       Lets examine that statement.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is he a globalist?  Yes he is. He also seems to have some nationalistic ideas but he is happy for the US to compete on a world financial stage. So he is a globalist, no question.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is he Elite? Yes he is. He is the president of the US and an extremely wealthy business man. So he is elite, no question.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is he NWO? Since Kissinger has played a substantive roll in Trump's foreign policy, you could argue the case to an open mind.  You could argue that case even stronger if you entertain the idea of differing factions.

       As I have been told on this subreddit having businesses in other countries isn’t globalism, or importing cheap products from other countries to undercut the American workers, it’s wanting to bring in people from other countries. Hiding money in tax havens doesn’t make you a globalist, it makes you smart! Buying Chinese steel is just being smart, not
       <em>

       They care about lobbying because influencing policy helps the bottom line and allows them to fund more lobbying and influence more policy and continue to concentrate wealth like has been happening for something like 40 years now.

       Marx was Socialist, Lenin expounded on those ideas and kind of became a Communist; (but only sort of?).

       Why do I dislike Trump? Because he's a law and order candidate who continues to get us involved in the Middle East, continues to kowtow to Israel, and who continues to militarize the police. The "communist nazi's" aren't the ones with the power to quell dissident speech, they aren't the ones who direct the military, they aren't the ones who are currently in office!
      </p>
      <p>
       He will continue to allow the CIA and NSA to have the powers to spy on us and will continue to allow our rights to erode. He isn't fighting for you or me, he's fighting for himself and his donors.
      </p>
      <p>
       He isn't going to decrease the size of the government that matters, because that would decrease his own power. He's an egotistical, power hungry billionaire (anyone who runs and thinks they can actually be president is egotistical and power hungry. It's the nature of the game). They aren't the type of people who are going to relinquish their own power, they want more. They always want more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump might be different in ways, but he's the same in the ways that matter. Whether it's democrat, republican, red, orange, black, trump, Clinton, or bush: They want power for themselves. They don't care about us. They won't give us back our rights they've stolen or scale back the military or police. Those are the front lines of government power, and the government will never willingly give them back.

       Based on my observations, this sub is anti-establishment which Trump appears to be as corroborated by your opening statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the T_D'ers that are here, most users appear to be cautiously optimistic that there is some good in him(at least at the Patriotic level) and that he isn't just another elite vying for the Iron throne to replace one form of tyranny with another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I've always had a good feeling about him, at least on an intuitive level although I do keep my hopes in check because I have been burned many a times.

       I have a good feeling too. I’m usually pretty perceptive about someone’s overall character and motivations.

       Trump is very hard to figure out I think. And he’s funny.. lol I think it’s good people are starting to pay attention to politics and world happenings. Albeit the insanity of both sides attacking each other.. I don’t see that ending any time soon.

       I'm not a US citizen and I hold no vote in the US. I hate Trump because of his abrasive personality, the guy rubs me the wrong way. I didn't pay too close attention to his policies, not being a US citizen and all, but I did like some of his foreign policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'd like to think my hatred for Trump doesn't block my judgement. It's pretty damn obvious that the MSM hates him and will smear him every chance they get, but let's face it, that abrasive personality of his just keeps on giving people more reasons to hate him.

       I would like to see information on Russiagate before I jump on board with that crowd though. So I think this message isn't really directed towards someone like me...

       I agree with all of this. If you already like him, then you love his personality. If you didn't, then you probably won't like his personality. That's the sort of person he's been his whole life, he's always been divisive and an abrasive asshole. That's his shtick and what made him famous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention a fraction of the MSM hate for him is the fact that he fights back. I said this before as to why the MSM always attacks him and people acted like I was a loon. What do they expect? Most presidents took their lumps, maybe said a comment, and moved on. They didn't try to actively wage war against the news outlets running negative news on them. They didn't take to twitter calling them fake like Trump. CNN hits Trump, Trump hits back, and so CNN his back again. Of course they would, why do people think the liberal media outlet isn't going to take shots at the Republican president
       <em>
        who is actively fighting them back
       </em>
       ! And why wouldn't people expect Trump to fight back himself? That's been his whole career! Fighting publicly in the news and not taking shit. But suddenly people are surprised that the abrasive reality star known for tweeting his opinions is fighting the media outlet who is used to not taking shit.

       To be "Pro-Trump" is still drinking the kool-aid, just a different flavor. No "leader" is going to save the country. The people have to be involved.
       <br/>
       It's funny that you call the left "Nazis" when many that actually call themselves Nazis support Trump albeit as a temporary measure.
       <br/>
       Last time I checked the government already controlled everything and there is enough money unaccounted for by the military to give every US citizen $65,000 so universal basic income might not be a bad idea. We're getting to a point where robots and automation will take more and more jobs, not counting the jobs we have sent overseas. I don't see anything wrong with people going to university for free if they keep up their grades.
       <br/>
       The government keeps records of your phonecalls, monitors your emails, and can read your mail if they want to. Listening devices and cameras are everywhere, even in children's toys. Do you think the Trump is somehow fighting that? I haven't seen any sign of him wanting to close down the TSA or the NSA.
       <br/>
       But it's not about Trump. Clinton, then Bush after 9/11, and Obama have all taken away our civil rights bit by bit and people go along with it because they're worried about terror. But Trump
s whole thing about building a wall is just more fearmongering.
       <br/>
       So if you want to get your forehead tattooed with "Pro-Trump" that's cool but that just makes you a shill of a different sort.

       I'm pro Trump but I don't find this sub pro Trump. Id say it's 50/50 , but most of the people here express their pro/anti Trump opinions in a way the promotes discussion. Go on ANY other sub where politics can be discussed and you'll see the type of comments that are causing this website to fail.

       I believe the support for Trump here is two fold. First, there are people like me who are avid Trump supporters. However, the main so called support for Trump comes from people frustrated by the fact that most of the anti Trump posts aren't conspiracies. They are merely political posts. So people attack it because this is a site for conspiracies not politics. So its not really that they support Trump, its more of a take that crap elsewhere. So they are quick to jump on anti Trump posts and try to debunk it.

       this is a good post.  Too many people confuse this sub as being pro-trump though.  This sub isn't technically pro-trump at all.  It's just that most of the ideas we have are in-line with trumps presidency.  Being "pro-trump" is just a side effect of that.

       Nice incoherent mess you've posted OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump IS part of the global elites. He's a rich guy who isn't really that interested in what's good for the country. He talks a good game, but when things don't go well, he denies, makes excuses and talks a good game. It has nothing to do with MSM. Trump's own tweets show this to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if you'll be surprised by this, but Trump's actions don't have to directly affect someone for them to be concerned about them. It may also be a surprise that the effect of Trump's polices may take years to become apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, let's please do look at the press briefings. To Sanders, lying and misdirection are as easy as breathing. Trump can tweet something stupid and she'll find a way to tell the press that he didn't mean it. She'll try to peddle whatever her boss tells here to peddle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want. But you need to realize that Trump doesn't care about you. If he can benefit from fucking you over, he'll do it. Because that's the Trump way.

       Trump hasn't been accepting a single paycheck from his Presidential work, and we all know why!
It's because Trump only accepts rubles as a form of paymenf!

       Marx was Socialist, Lenin expounded on those ideas and kind of became a Communist; (but only sort of?).
