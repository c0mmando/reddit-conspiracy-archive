        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Republicans hate anyone who isn&#39;t a straight, rich, white, cis, christian male. Their end game is to make life so miserable for anyone who doesn&#39;t check off all 6 of those boxes(YOU MUST CHECK OFF ALL 6 - 5 of 6 won&#39;t do) that death is preferable to living. That&#39;s why all of their policies are aimed at killing these people - for example, the tax bill is aimed at killing off the poor because the lost revenue and spending cuts that will come with it will lead to tens of thousands of deaths. Just like benefit and entitlement cuts lead to many deaths because so many rely on it. Healthcare and ACA cuts lead to deaths because of those who use ACA/Medicaid/Medicare. </p>

<p>Bathroom bills and anti-gay marriage laws exist to kill off the LGBT population. Killing them off by getting a portion of the population angry at them to where they take it out via violence, or by causing depression and oppression that leads to suicide. </p>

<p>Bills like anti-choice laws and denying access to contraception are aimed at killing off women.</p>

<p>Supporting police and drug laws and doing nothing about police killings exist to kill of minorities. Also minorities are large users of social programs that Republicans want to cut which lead to more minority deaths.</p>

<p>Spreading Islamophobia and anti-semitism that leads neo nazis and racist to go violent against non-Christians and kill them off as well as travel bans and denying refugees. This doubles at killing off minorities as well.</p>

<p>Republican policy literally exists to kill off everyone they don&#39;t like. Why do people keep voting for them?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Guess what, it didn&#39;t work. There were some decent plans the first year, but after that they were either almost useless or WAY overpriced. And the prices rise more and more each year. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats are the ones who want to expand social programs like welfare, Section 8, SNAP and more that benefits millions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And how exactly are we going to pay for it? In case you didn&#39;t notice, the old checkbook&#39;s a little out of balance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats want to take in refugees to help millions of disenfranchised around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above. Maybe if we stopped this stupid mindset we could actually improve the standard of living in this country. Instead we open the floodgates. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats want to pass common sense gun control to protect millions from guns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My firearms are much more reliable protection than the &quot;police&quot; What part of &quot;shall not be infringed&quot; are you having a hard time with? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats want to pass common sense immigration policy to protect those here without papers as well as allow more immigrants in to give them a better life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again with this crap. Fix the country first. Then maybe let more folks in. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats want to protect the environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one thing I can agree with without exceptions. I don&#39;t know how to get through that this should be the #1 priority.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did someone give you a simple outline on how the democratic party is supposed to be represented? There is talking points for people who buy into full blown republican identity politics. You are no different than them. You gladly wear the blindfold and pretend the world is black and white and good or bad. How can you not see how absolutely ridiculous it is to pretend American politics is that simple and also that radically divided that you actually believe republicans want to kill everyone who isn&#39;t straight white male. You are probably trolling and in real life you are able to discuss these things without being divisive and sheepish</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Detroit has been Democrat run for decades and it is basically a 3rd world country.  It has all the hallmarks of what Democrats love: Tons of government, waste, corruption, immigrants, refugees, abortion clinics, and everything else.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re just dying to move there, right? No, cause it&#39;s a hell hole.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for legal immigrants, and religious refugees too, but their goal should be to assimilate, just as mine would be if I were to move to a new country.  </p>

<p>We cannot continue to take in the numbers we have while our own people suffer.  We have a huge homeless population but we give other countries billions.  We have vets that can&#39;t deal with the aftereffects of war but the VA is awful.  We have so many needs here without bringing the needs of the world here as well.  We have for too long neglected our own people in favor of saving the world.  There must be balance but the dems want more, more, more. More money for entitlement programs, more money to bring in undocumented immigrants and allow them to stay indefinitely, more money for refugees, more taxes to pay for all that, and on and on and on.  </p>

<p>It has to end sometime or we will end.   </p>

<p>Please explain to me how an American political party will lift up somebody living in a country thousands of miles away?  To be honest we&#39;re lucky we have no oil or they&#39;d be trying to fuck us in the ass too. </p>

<p>Anyway... You&#39;re blinded by trinkets, so enjoy your left/right bliss.</p>

<p>Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act to give millions access to healthcare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess what, it didn&#39;t work. There were some decent plans the first year, but after that they were either almost useless or WAY overpriced. And the prices rise more and more each year. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats are the ones who want to expand social programs like welfare, Section 8, SNAP and more that benefits millions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And how exactly are we going to pay for it? In case you didn&#39;t notice, the old checkbook&#39;s a little out of balance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats want to take in refugees to help millions of disenfranchised around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above. Maybe if we stopped this stupid mindset we could actually improve the standard of living in this country. Instead we open the floodgates. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats want to pass common sense gun control to protect millions from guns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My firearms are much more reliable protection than the &quot;police&quot; What part of &quot;shall not be infringed&quot; are you having a hard time with? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats want to pass common sense immigration policy to protect those here without papers as well as allow more immigrants in to give them a better life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again with this crap. Fix the country first. Then maybe let more folks in. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats want to protect the environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one thing I can agree with without exceptions. I don&#39;t know how to get through that this should be the #1 priority.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats don&#39;t want to funnel more money to the rich at the expense of the middle class and poor.</p>

<p>Spare me the whole &quot;democrats do nothing to lift me up&quot; garbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did someone give you a simple outline on how the democratic party is supposed to be represented? There is talking points for people who buy into full blown republican identity politics. You are no different than them. You gladly wear the blindfold and pretend the world is black and white and good or bad. How can you not see how absolutely ridiculous it is to pretend American politics is that simple and also that radically divided that you actually believe republicans want to kill everyone who isn&#39;t straight white male. You are probably trolling and in real life you are able to discuss these things without being divisive and sheepish</p>

<p>Democrat policies have proven to be a failure in every major city where they&#39;ve had control. Detroit, Baltimore, Memphis, Chicago, and on, and on, and on.</p>

<p>Federal, racist policies aimed at keeping minorities down, as well as union busting tactics that drive away business and industry from those cities are to blame.</p>
