       Personally, I think most people come here to share interesting articles or to read articles others have shared. They don't come to argue about it. Some might call it 'discussion' but when one does read through threads it's 99% arguing and name calling, not 'discussing'.

       Submit a statement to show you aren't a bot.  It's not a hard concept.

       Well, the fact that there seems to be a lot less bots now that an accompanying statement is required seems to prove that some portion of them were bots, but believe what you will.

       Bots are a very minor problem compared to the spammers &amp; trolls from tmor and  conspiratard who have nothing better to do than copy/past stuff from what they're posting. Their entire day is dedicated to it.

       Not only has it cut down on spammers, it has improved discussion. No more links to just youtube videos with no idea what they're about. And it starts a thread out with a basis for discussion already there.

       And yet it's the people I have tagged as spammers and trolls that are doing the SS thing and arguing for it. It's only the people that are truly dedicated to destroying this sub that have the time to do that shit. Well, and the suckers that have fallen for the mods' claim it'll "make things better". It clearly hasn't but the only people that won't admit that
       <em>
        are

       the spammers/trolls mentioned above.

       So you are admitting to being "truly dedicated to destroying this sub"? I mean, here you are proving that

       I miss the days of actual internet discussion. It did used to exists. People still had actual dialogue once upon a time. A troll was the rare exception, not the rule. I still come to reddit hoping to have an interesting discussion but few people ever actually respond to my posts with a response that would require further conversation. No follow up questions on further illustrating a point alluded to, No "I agree and also to your point". Mainly just likes, people personally insulting you, or flat out telling you you're wrong without actually articulating what they disagree on.

       You're right. It's really too bad too. This sub used to have quite a bunch of respectful and thoughtful discussions, after Rule 10 was first initiated. It's apparent that over the past couple years selective enforcement by the mods has resulted in the same kind of flame wars that existed here prior to Rule 10.

       That's the point, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       These complainers are harvesting karma by being the first to post important articles, denying people who actually care enough about the article the chance to make a submission that everyone reads rather than skips over as a repost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at OP - 11,779 post karma, 1,184 comment karma, redditor for 7 years
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy barely ever comments on his submissions, it seems. In fact he's only made 22 comments in the last week, an average of three per day. In the same time, he's submitted 15 posts to various subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he averages less than 2 comments per submission, and in fact that average has been increased by
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       post.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the karma whores that are complaining... not the people with genuine opinions to offer.

       I posted this morning without writing a sub statement, the mods removed my post, but i let them know just how dumb of an idea the sub statement is. This idea may be good for other subs, but here in r/conspiracy, it is simply another outlet for possible disinfo. It amazes me that the mods don't see how this can hurt the sub more than help it.
