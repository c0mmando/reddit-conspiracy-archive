    <div class="md"><p>That is part of the point, from another point of view. Your scientism prophets have complicated math to patch over holes in theory after theory, of everything from unprovable dark matter to multiverses in multiple dimensions like the beer bubble anology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t take complicated math to debunk flat earth. Let&#39;s use Sun rises and Sun sets, and Sun angles.</p>

<p>Every single flat earther that I&#39;ve come across claims that the Sun is close. If the Sun is supposed to be close in the flat earth &quot;model&quot;, why doesn&#39;t it change in angular size or angular speed over the course of a day when viewed through a solar filter?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4</a></p>

<p>This only gets worse when you take into account the equinox Sun rises and Sun sets. Explain how the Sun would rise due east and set due west regardless of your latitude on the equinox.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/lKipXJf">http://imgur.com/lKipXJf</a> </p>

<p>An experiment has already been performed on the equinox with over 20+ participants. The results support the globe earth and matched predictions, while it made no sense on a flat earth. Unless you believe that there are multiple Suns at the same time. Flat Earth is broken to the point that Sun angles are all that&#39;s needed to debunk it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V03eF0bcYno">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V03eF0bcYno</a></p>

<p>What type of relevant model, map, or predictive power do flat eathers have that compares to the globe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I give you credit for picking one of the few problems that are too complicated to have one easy answer- other than simulation theory, of course. </p>

<p>The problem with this, is the same problem with the argument about things like ships disappearing over the horizon, or proving gravity or the Coriolis effect. For every claim there is evidence that seems to contradict some other part of it.</p>

<p>There are videos of the sun appearing to change in size, videos of the moon in daytime with the sun at the wrong angle to iluminate the lit side of the moon. </p>

<p>Again, said reasons are why I&#39;m leaning towards simulation theory, but <a href="https://youtu.be/Bbn3-L8Db0A">this Australian guy</a> demonstrates another decent hypothesis.</p>

<p>Also there are things like the eclipse going in the wrong direction, and <a href="https://youtu.be/B8U5OGACyes">NASA explaining it as the moon revolves around us twice as fast,</a> b/c we all know the moon passes by twice a day.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s seasons, where if the sun is 93 million miles away, why does the slight change in axis make such a drastic difference in temperature, and not just heat the earth evenly? The radiation made it 93 million miles with no problem, but a slight lean by the earth somehow makes a huge difference. I know, I&#39;ve heard the atmosphere bubble somehow deflects and traps at the same time.</p>

<p>Then you get into angles of the sun in general, and how some are possible at all if the light is always coming from a 90° source. Of course you&#39;ve seen people do the geometry of the light coming down from clouds in triangular shapes, which is what they base the close proximity from.</p>

<p>Also there&#39;s the issue of the sun and moon appearing to be the exact same size, and lining up perfectly together like predictable clockwork, when all objects in question are millions of miles apart, and moving at incredible speeds in multiple directions at the same time. One isn&#39;t slightly up, or down, larger or smaller. Would you bet on the odds of the two most prominent objects in our sky, two objects millions of miles apart, made billions of years apart (at least, last I heard) lining up in such a way on pure coincidence? That&#39;s a hell of a coinky dink.</p>

<p>You can also still see the same constellations as all of our recorded ancestors, and navigate with the same tools and means such as the ancient Greek astrolabe, which still works to this day.</p>

<p>Again, I digress that all these anomalies are the reason I currently go with the easy route, and throw my lot in with people like Elon Musk on simulation theory. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a theory that the sun moves in other patterns other than just a revolving globe, but admittedly I have a problem with that one in that it looks like the sun would have to change speed at some point. Of course you&#39;ve covered the multiple sun theory, but one such as the one I linked where some people are actually seeing the sun, and others just a reflection, such as what can be seen on a glass light fixture are more plausible. If we are again assuming that everything is solid, tangible objects.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always curious about this one. Is it about the claim that zooming into an object that has gone over the horizon will bring it back? If so, it is false. No amount of magnification can bring back  the bottom of objects that have gone over the horizon.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/4p00j3a3zvty.png">https://i.redd.it/4p00j3a3zvty.png</a></p>

<p>This also applies to the Sun, as zoom/magnification has no effect on Sun set times.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The ones that I&#39;ve seen don&#39;t use a solar filter, and confuse the Sun&#39;s glare for its true angular size. Can you show me one done with a solar filter so the Sun&#39;s glare is removed?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Are you referring to the Moon&#39;s orbital speed compared to the Earth&#39;s? You can make a model of this, and you&#39;ll see that its correct.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is this about the crepuscular rays of the Sun? They&#39;re parallel and it&#39;s, ironically, due to perspective. Parallel lines that are slanted towards you will appear to converge even though they don&#39;t. Kinda like looking at a straight road.</p>

<p><a href="https://ibin.co/2NKPsMZFgJvu">https://ibin.co/2NKPsMZFgJvu</a></p>

<p>As for the Sun and Moon being the same size, they really aren&#39;t for most of the year. The size of both the Moon and the Sun will vary throughout the year. It&#39;s the reason as to why we have annular eclipses.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen any ancient star map which shows that the stars have remained unchanged until today. Even nowadays you can see the drift of stars, such as the Barnard&#39;s star.</p>

<p>As for the astrolabe, is it accurate for all latitudes, or does it need different plates for different latitudes? What about the difference in angles of celestial bodies which correspond to a sphere, such as the celestial poles appearing at a height angle equal to your latitude?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what I believe anymore.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so many contradictory videos about the ships disappearing, or not disappearing though. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM9JeYQ2CW4">This one</a> is one of the first to come up in the search. </p>

<p>Also in your video about the moon orbiting speed issue, he uses <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/11971">this</a> video by NASA of the alleged real photo of the moon over earth. I see and get the debunking of the difference in speeds for an eclipse, but still don&#39;t get that the clouds in the time lapse video of hours how the clouds don&#39;t move, and there are no stars.</p>

<p>Again, I have seen big problems with NASA&#39;s work and claims, ranging from bubbles in space, to suspension wires slip ups, to green screen glitches, not to mention the hours of problems with the moon landings.</p>

<p>You make a compelling argument to counter some points/questions I repeated, I just don&#39;t trust NASA for reasons we can further debate if you wish. But that is veering off subject, and admittedly doesn&#39;t in itself prove any flatness of the earth.</p>

<p>I still have some hangups with things like water curvature, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-motorola&amp;amp;biw=360&amp;amp;bih=263&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=1&amp;amp;ei=T_5HWozIEerPjwSIzqiACA&amp;amp;q=world+record+distance+photo&amp;amp;oq=world+record+distance&amp;amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-img.1.0.0l2j0i8i30k1j0i24k1l2.3468.10425.0.11892.24.17.1.5.5.0.532.5258.2-7j2j4j2.15.0....0...1c.1j4.64.mobile-gws-img..3.21.5939.3..35i39k1j0i67k1.398.gTbxMgcZnmE#imgrc=OsAatFe38nOEsM:">the world record distance photo,</a> that allegedly defies the curvature math.</p>

<p>Regardless of the true shape of the earth, I&#39;m still leaning towards some version of creation or intelligent design. Even if our existence is some sort of simulation or matrix.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on water curvature, or if the earth is 70% water, how does gravity hold it in a sphere, and upside down? Gravity itself is a whole can of proverbial worms.</p>

<p>As for the constellation and star movement thing, it is still confusing and I don&#39;t fully understand each model. I keep visualizing being in a spinning chair. A dot on the floor would still appear to be moving the same direction, as a dot on the ceiling, even if you are upside down. </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m seeing problems with both models, and find myself back to being in a matrix with everything moving according to how it is set to that location and time.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m still just another crazy guy on the internet:D</p>

<p>To be fair, it doesn&#39;t seem that the ship has gone over the horizon. Even at the end you can still the ship as a white speck. I&#39;m searching for videos that can demonstrate that zoom/magnification is capable of bringing back the bottom of objects from the horizon.</p>

<p>I can agree with that. Space agencies are not really relevant to the shape of the Earth, unless you&#39;re discussing motivations/goals that they have IMO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I still have some hangups with things like water curvature, and the world record distance photo, that allegedly defies the curvature math.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s also models made of this one. Such as this:</p>

<p><a href="http://walter.bislins.ch/bloge/index.asp?page=Curvature+App%3A+Simulation+of+Globe-Earth+and+Flat-Earth&amp;amp;demo=Canigou#App">http://walter.bislins.ch/bloge/index.asp?page=Curvature+App%3A+Simulation+of+Globe-Earth+and+Flat-Earth&amp;demo=Canigou#App</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t understand. Are you saying that gravity doesn&#39;t behave as a force so that it can&#39;t attract water, or that it doesn&#39;t make sense that it can attract water to the Earth? In the globe, water will be level towards the Earth&#39;s gravity.</p>

<p>Flat earthers version as to why things fall down, the most common being just density/bouyancy, don&#39;t make much sense to me. Seeing as how objects of different densities will fall at the same rate in a vacuum, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkhxPm15PFo">that you can measure the difference in weight according to your location with things weighing less at the equator and more the further north/south you go, which fits with the globe model.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for the constellation and star movement thing, it is still confusing and I don&#39;t fully understand each model. I keep visualizing being in a spinning chair. A dot on the floor would still appear to be moving the same direction, as a dot on the ceiling, even if you are upside down. The only way it makes sense and goes in opposite directions is if you are on opposite sides of the light. It moves right to left looking from one side, and left to right from the other/out/inside. Just being upside down doesn&#39;t make something spin a different direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess the best way for this would be to play around with a model of the Earth. Such as playing with a star chart and spinning the sky.</p>

<p>Or maybe even stretching your arms (one all the left, on all to the right), rotate both of them in the same direction, and then move your head to see them both. One will go clockwise, and another counter clockwise which will give a crude demonstration as to how the celestial poles behave at the equator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, I&#39;m seeing problems with both models, and find myself back to being in a matrix with everything moving according to how it is set to that location and time.</p>

<p>That&#39;s fine. I can see where you&#39;re coming from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re looking at this from the wrong point of view. If I came up to you and said I could jump over a 10 foot high basketball hoop. And then I showed you video, that looked sort of fake, of me jumping over a basketball hoop. You should not be asking what my motivation for lying about such a feat is. Who knows, and who cares what my motivations are?</p>

<p>You should, instead, focus on whether my evidence for being able to jump over a basketball hoop is sufficient to believe I have that ability. </p>

<p>Regarding NASA, look into their claims and then look into their evidence. There are plenty of youtube videos showing they have undeniably been lying about their abilities and accomplishments. While you&#39;re at it, you can watch some videos explaining the Flat Earth model, and answer these questions for yourself. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally believe it is flat because I haven&#39;t been seen any models that make sense geometrically. I believe there is a small chance that the Earth is flat, concave, or some other shape. I don&#39;t believe NASA is a trustworthy source, so I plan on running some experiments to determine the shape for myself. </p>

Trust me I don’t doubt NASA has lied. But people discovered the earth was round way before NASA. And why don’t people fall off the earth? Is every pilot, and ship captain in on it also? Wouldn’t they know from traveling around the world?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude, I believe it, and here&#39;s something you should know. A couple years back, when I went to a private highschool, we had annual IQ tests. I had a very large friend group. The people who thought flat eart was idiotic(and conspiracy theories in general) had an IQ between 115 and 125. But you know what the IQ was of people who DID believe it? A few from 110-115, but almost everyone from 125 to 145 AT LEAST considered flat earth. I believe it and my IQ is 141(or at least was back then). And these weren&#39;t some autistic geniuses. It was a very prestigious school and most of the kids there were children of actors, bankers, ambassadors, etc.</p>

In it, is a cut from that showing them removing the covers from the other windows, showing that it is a camera shot through a round window.</p>

<p>If you can watch the whole thing, and still be unshaken that we went to the moon... You have cognitive dissonance to a super saiyan level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think flat earth is meant to distract from the glaring lies and fake video&#39;s from space agencies. I&#39;m on the fence if we can really go to space or we are only capable of launching satellites.</p>

<p>Both sides pose interesting questions. I am more able to believe a hollow earth or secret cave systems that connect the whole earth underground. Too many people can just buy planes and check this for yourself, the money involved for proving flat earth would be worth the risk. Human greed is one of the biggest motivators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend of mine started getting into it by watching YouTube videos. He has a pretty poor understanding of science.  He once asked me &quot;the bible says there are four kinds of flesh, birds, humans, fish, and animals, but what does that make insects?&quot; </p>

<p>I was annoyed when he started going on about a firmament and saying thousands of scientists around the world were in on the lie, and GPS and satellites and airplane travel were all a hoax or illusion. </p>

<p>I showed him David Butler&#39;s YouTube series How Far Away is it?, and he stopped talking about it over time. I don&#39;t think he watches flat earth videos anymore. </p>

<p>Another guy I spoke to online about flat earth kept insisting he could see Venus at night. I&#39;m like,  here&#39;s a star chart app, quit misidentifying Mars. </p>

But again, it doesn’t matter, because it has nothing to do with what I’m talking about. I have a system where I completely let go any debate where the other person who “talks about how smart they are”. I’ve known a lot of very smart people. You know what none of them do? Talk about how smart they are. Because someone who is truly intelligent will understand that there’s always more to learn, and always someone smarter. By the way you never answered any of

<p>I&#39;ll argue in favor of flat Earth with you or whomever, just b/c can, and to show there is way more merit to the conundrum than is given credit for.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve debated starting another post about this myself, honestly in hopes that one of you glorious bastards will destroy this meaningless in real life account, and I regain some real life faith back in at least one part of the system that I once believed in, like everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, for starters, I can&#39;t add water to a cup that is already full. You have to first have some question, or seed of doubt and wonder for you to have any change in perception of your/our existence.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;ll try and answer anything I can, based on my couple months of dabbling in this, trying to tear it apart myself.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll talk science, and you can type and link any science you think have. My point was/is with that statement is that the vast majority of said science, is/was proposed and pushed by Freemasons... A group of people few here hold a very high trust in.</p>

<p>You travel around a flat earth just like you travel around any other circle or pie. Left to right = east to west, center to outside diameter = North to South.</p>

<p>No one is lying except for the Masters that started it all in motion, and the men who said they actually put their boots to the moon. We&#39;ll a small handful beyond that, but for the most part, everyone just does their job, and believes what they are taught and told- just like the predecessors before them.</p>

<p>As for, &quot;we clearly see planets, etc.&quot; We see CGI images of things like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-motorola&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=1&amp;amp;ei=VRJHWqWjBIi3jwTd-JJI&amp;amp;q=real+stars+amateur&amp;amp;oq=real+stars+amateur&amp;amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-img.3...16546.23700.0.24350.20.9.0.0.0.0.968.2841.0j3j3j5-1j1.8.0....0...1c.1j4.64.mobile-gws-img..13.2.1638...0j35i39k1.2475.ZX7Dlo9AMrA#imgrc=JD2MbJBVGr4juM:">this,</a> which are all that can/has been proven without the Freemason controlled space organizations.</p>

<p>As for why are they round, and us flat, I can refer you to same such pictures that question that certainty as well, and will repeat the billiard ball analogy. The billiard balls are round, therefore the pool table must also be round.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol dude... none of this at all argued for your point. When you’re debating something especially something that is a fringe thought you can’t just “they are lying”. So are you saying Space doesn’t exist? And why? Why would the Freemasons make this up and lie about a vast conspiracy for years? So your saying 100’s of years ago the Freemasons had developed projection science that could cover the whole world? And again why?  But answering we go left
To right north to south doesn’t answer my question. Boats and planes circle the Earth all the time. I️ can fly west from California and go to Japan, then Russia, then Europe then back to the Us. All by going west. Other then all pilots and ship captains are lying, what’s the explanation for this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t actually reply to me, just to yourself... but we&#39;ll go round and round this plane again. You can always keep going left, or right, and end up back where you started. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re walking in a circle, on a boat, on a goat, or on a plane. </p>

<p>&quot;I&quot; never said anything about projections or holagrams. </p>

<p>As for, &quot;why would the Freemasons lie?&quot; The most popular theory is that they are devil/sun worshippers, and this is the best way to make a system that doesn&#39;t need a good or Creator.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m only moderately religious- well would fall under more, &quot;spiritual, non religious&quot; type of category- but am most interested in Gnostic Christianity, as far as religions go. I&#39;ve been a Satanist, who could tear apart most Christians on the Bible, so I&#39;ve come a long way around, but that&#39;s another topic.</p>

<p>Captains and pilots fly by computer, just like everyone else who drives, and types in their destination on a navigation app. They just follow directions. It&#39;s not lying, if you&#39;re just doing what you were taught in simulation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re not religious, so the Biblical explanations, predictions, and revelations go out ye old window... So let&#39;s stick to science. The earth is roughly 70% water, so roughly at least 70% flat. Unless you can show some demonstration in a lab or experiment of gravity making a mass of water a bowl- without putting it in a bowl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, passed out. Yes I do find a few things weird that happen when you get down deep in these rabbit holes. </p>

<p>There was a post on the front page on ask Reddit (iirc) asking for things that are believed, but can&#39;t be proven. I scanned over controversial, looking for gravity. Of course the people that said it got down voted to such a degree it looked like other people were scanning, looking for them to, to do just that.</p>

<p>The immediately up voted replies that I saw just made me shake my head when they started speaking of experiments done on the international space station, and NASA cosmology as real evidence. </p>

<p>I started to chime in there, and try and pull the curtain back on the international fake station, and link them video of everything from bubbles, to suspension wires, to green screen glitches, but knew it was pointless.</p>

<p>As been said, it&#39;s easier to fool people, than to prove to them they&#39;ve been fooled. Last time I tried to red pill somebody on the front page, I just got down voted with such a quickness that it wouldn&#39;t let me reply but once every 10min. Then people started taking advantage of that, by tag team hitting me, so I had to pick and choose which one I was going to address, and it took an hour to throw out a few retorts. </p>

<p>Ultimately it wasn&#39;t worth it, and they did the same thing they do here- just walk away when you can answer them. Except everywhere else people just keep down voting you to oblivion, while up voting what you just debunked, and nobody new steps up to take on the argument.</p>

<p>I <em>want</em> to lose this debate. I <em>want</em> someone to hit me with something I haven&#39;t thought of yet, or already used to try and debunk this myself. I <em>want</em> to realize I fell for a psyop, or disinformation, and get my old, simpler conspiracies back. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to make it easy for them though, b/c this <em>is</em> a much more complicated problem than anybody realizes until they really get into the deep end, and I want them to grasp the gravity of the situation- pun intended. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So pilots wouldn’t notice they weren’t flying over landmarks and cities that they were supposed to? It’s just such extreme stretching that I don’t understand how this is the easier concept to understand for people. Also were the Freemasons magic? Because they would need to to project like you say especially 100’s of years ago. What about planes before computers? Plenty did it  without computers and plenty of ships. That captains notice driving past countries and islands so they couldn’t be going down to the poles and around like I guess is what they would do if they couldn’t go around the earth like a globe. Also neither would ever have to notice the sun. Even on a flat earth the sun would help people know their directions and Star their location. And they sun worshippers so they try to convince the world planets are flat? That doesn’t answer anything. Why? What would the purpose be? And how? They must have serious magical skills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, there are a few possible scenarios for this, and even multiple may be true at the same time.</p>

<p>Firstly, the globe was proposed before anyone could go high enough to actually verify that it was in fact true. Also all the big names that were involved in it also happen to be blatant and proud occultist/sun/devil worshippers, which gives credibility to the notion of a cover up, or attempt at destroying the idea of God or the creation that virtually every main religion accepts some version of.</p>

<p>Back to the introduction of the globe, it was so prevalent, that it was even adopted and used for things such as the Universal Studios logo before we even had even done any actual space missions or experiments, to fly up high enough to see that. Incidentally there&#39;s a man by the name of <a href="https://youtu.be/YIFYiHGqshc">Auguste Piccard</a> who before NASA, or US military missions, flew high enough to report seeing the earth as a, &quot;flat plane, with upturned edges.&quot;</p>

<p>There are other reasons, but this comment is already pretty long, so I&#39;ll go with what I think is the next best argument. What do you think would happen if everyone suddenly found out we were essentially in a giant aquarium together- a cage, and couldn&#39;t get out? </p>

<p>Do you think there might be a panic, or a prison mentality take over if everyone realizes we are trapped inside together? As long as the animals don&#39;t know the edge of the reserve, they feel a sense of freedom. Space gives us possibility of wonder, to be able to travel endlessly if we so wish, all we have to do is work hard enough to get there. Most people don&#39;t. There&#39;s no need to try to escape from the cage, as long as you don&#39;t know you are in one.</p>

<p>Also the moon appeared to be translucent, and showing the color of the sky in the unlit portion. Also the sunlight, and moon light were different colors. I know, they are outside the atmosphere, but the light reflecting off of the moon would have to travel through that same atmosphere, so logic would say should still make it the same color as other reflected sunlight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude, I believe it, and here&#39;s something you should know. A couple years back, when I went to a private highschool, we had annual IQ tests. I had a very large friend group. The people who thought flat eart was idiotic(and conspiracy theories in general) had an IQ between 115 and 125. But you know what the IQ was of people who DID believe it? A few from 110-115, but almost everyone from 125 to 145 AT LEAST considered flat earth. I believe it and my IQ is 141(or at least was back then). And these weren&#39;t some autistic geniuses. It was a very prestigious school and most of the kids there were children of actors, bankers, ambassadors, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, I suggest you just look it up. If you want me to take you deeper just say so</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The belief comes from people trusting their own perceptions over the words of NASA and scientists. </p>

<p>The Earth looks flat. Even from high up. That&#39;s the main motivation.</p>

<p>From there, it&#39;s a deep rabbit hole that you&#39;re going to have to research yourself. Your questions are easily answered by any youtube video or <a href="https://wiki.tfes.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions">flat earth site</a> . </p>

<p>Flat Earth proponents will have their own similarly inconvenient questions such as &quot;Why aren&#39;t there thousands or millions of photos of Earth from all the satellites in space? Why doesn&#39;t the ISS film 24 hours? Why does the atmosphere appear to be mostly stationary / synchronized with Earth&#39;s spin?&quot; and so on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t take complicated math to debunk flat earth. Let&#39;s use Sun rises and Sun sets, and Sun angles.</p>

<p>Every single flat earther that I&#39;ve come across claims that the Sun is close. If the Sun is supposed to be close in the flat earth &quot;model&quot;, why doesn&#39;t it change in angular size or angular speed over the course of a day when viewed through a solar filter?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhNFoy2fAr4</a></p>

<p>This only gets worse when you take into account the equinox Sun rises and Sun sets. Explain how the Sun would rise due east and set due west regardless of your latitude on the equinox.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/lKipXJf">http://imgur.com/lKipXJf</a> </p>

<p>An experiment has already been performed on the equinox with over 20+ participants. The results support the globe earth and matched predictions, while it made no sense on a flat earth. Unless you believe that there are multiple Suns at the same time. Flat Earth is broken to the point that Sun angles are all that&#39;s needed to debunk it.</p>

<p>What type of relevant model, map, or predictive power do flat eathers have that compares to the globe?</p>
