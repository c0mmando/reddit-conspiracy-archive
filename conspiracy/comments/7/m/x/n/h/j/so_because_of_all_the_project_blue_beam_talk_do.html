There used to be a lot of talk around aliens on this sub but now the majority of posts are decrying sightings and disclosures (I&#39;m sceptical of these disclosures myself but don&#39;t discount everything)
So are we now too sceptical of things we see and are told and have convinced ourselves there are no potential aliens out there? Crying B.S. on everything and questioning everything, allowing ourselves to believe in nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Earlier this year I watched Steven Greer&#39;s film Sirius.  Regardless of whether there are aliens or not, while watching the film I got the feeling Greer puts himself first before the idea, and hence would not be beyond staging an event if it meant he got rich/famous off it.  </p>

<p>I think people are a bit skeptical of Project Blue Beam because the messenger has credibility issues that distract from the content and message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my own uneducated opinion that nobody asked for, I think it&#39;s because a lot of people in this community are just contrarians. As soon as something gains mainstream acceptance a lot of us will drop it in a heartbeat. Which I understand, how often are the masses correct, right?</p>

<p>That said, I believe in aliens (what that means however could fill volumes); but while I want to be excited/terrified by the recent disclosure, I&#39;m extremely wary and watching for some kind of bluebeam scenario as well. </p>

<p>I think the moral of the story is we should take EVERYTHING with a handful of salt, but don&#39;t throw the baby out with the bath water either. Which I realize is a shitty, middle of the road opinion to take but it&#39;s so hard to trust ANYTHING these days, regardless of the source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the options available to those in control (and speculation on what technology they may have...), using an alien invasion (read: genetically modified beings in terrestrial replica vehicles, perhaps nuking a few cities) to justify a space weapons system that can then be used to control what remains of humanity after they (magically) win (read: every alien movie ever) - is the &quot;logical&quot; choice.</p>

<p>Aliens can be real and visiting us while at the same time the cabal has a plan for a fake alien disclosure event of some kind to further their agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think there are aliens. But if they are coming here now? That&#39;s a hard one to answer. I think we have way more proof of an advanced civilization visiting earth in our past compared to the present. Once black project got underway full steam in the late 40&#39;s/early 50&#39;s is when the UFO phenomena really started to take off and I think most of these sightings are secret craft the US was developing.  </p>

<p>I do think there have been crashes and I think we got a lot of our tech today from reverse engineering those craft. Lets look at the 20th century. In 1900 most people didn&#39;t have electricity or a car. horse and buggy was still a very popular form of personal travel. We went from the industrial revolution to a full fledged futuristic society in less than 100 years. We &quot;allegedly&quot; sent men to the moon. I think we went. We developed stealth air craft and planes that can fly 2200mph. We have advanced computer systems, futuristic weapons, satellite communications/GPS network, fiber optics, crypto currency, clean energy, advanced medicine and many other breakthroughs have come about since 1947. </p>

<p>But as far as aliens here now? I really don&#39;t put much stock in it. But if Corey Goode is to be believed our solar system is filled with life and we have bases on Mars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there&#39;s more stars in the universe than grains of sand on earth right? Many/all? of which will have planets round them. Also you&#39;ve got other universes too. 
So, with all that inconceivable number of planets, you&#39;re telling me none of them have got life at least as intelligent maybe more than ours? </p>

<p>I think just based on probability, there are aliens.</p>

<p>Also, look into how much of what&#39;s actually around us we can see. Visible light, the frequency we can see, is a tiny, TINY amount of what&#39;s there. Like another fine Lord, Lord Snow, we know nothing. We see nothing, so is it too much of a stretch to think aliens could exist?</p>

<p>explain why probability theory tells you there are aliens, when as far as I know there is only one known place in the universe with life</p>

<p>you seem to be saying &quot;I&#39;ve found one instance of X. Therefore, there are definitely more instances of X&quot;. I&#39;m not sure I agree with the logic of that - there either is or there isn&#39;t other life in the universe, and until there is another proven example I have no reason to say that I <em>know</em> one way or the other.
