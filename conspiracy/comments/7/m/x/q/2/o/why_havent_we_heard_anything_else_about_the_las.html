    <div class="md"><p>Idk, that&#39;s the only thing I wouldn&#39;t claim I see... The MSM attempts to push gun control after LV was so flaccid, it never had any traction. Even mentions of banning bump stocks were met with pretty much zero interest. I think there&#39;s a truth to the LV shooting that everyone is agreeing to keep quiet... It&#39;s actually surprising how little it was used as leverage. It&#39;s almost like &quot;forget it ever happened&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happened before the vote to deregulate suppressor ownership, after the event they postponed the vote indefinitely. </p>

<p>Funny enough, this was the second time that they were supposed to vote on deregulating suppressors recently. Guess what happened the day before that vote? Someone shot at the republican softball game and they postponed the vote. </p>

<p>I feel like there is a focus on keeping suppressors hard to obtain. To me, this makes a lot of sense if they’re planning on pushing strict gun control laws. </p>

<p>Why would they care about suppressors? Simple. They’re deploying ShotSpotters in more and more major cities, suppressor ownership undermines this effort. </p>

<p>Why would they make a hard push for gun control before the ShotSpotters are in place? </p>

<p>TL;DR: The Vegas shooting indirectly canceled the vote to deregulate suppressors. Gun control was the goal. </p>

LVMPD does not fuck around at all. I had four guns drawn on me for complying with an order during a raid (no hostile mannerisms on either part up to this point, minus the whole raid scenario. They just knocked, no hollywood stuff).</p>

<p>I remember hearing about a kid (12y.o. or something) getting shot (fatally) for jumping a fence on his way home from school and surprising an officer who was conducting an interview on a woman&#39;s porch; the shooting was ruled officer justified. I think the war is already lost. </p>

<p>It seems like almost every terrorist that has committed an act of terror has been interviewed by the authorities at some point. In some cases multiple times. Makes you wonder how they slip through the cracks...</p>

<p>Imp not an official federal investigator. But to me it seems like Paddock didn&#39;t act alone. The room service bill, the missing hard drive, the supposedly top secret phone charger in the room, getting adjoining rooms, the photos of his body in the room with a rifle over his leg, the changing of the official story numerous times after holes kept getting poked in it. Not to mention the whole Jesus Campos debacle on Ellen. </p>

<p>I think we have become desensitized to it. Ever since 9/11 the American people and the west at large has been fed fear on a near daily basis. so when another shooting happens you watch the news, post something on Facebook and move on with your life. Not a lot of people truly care and the ones that do are in this sub. </p>

<p>You pass a background check and over the years you can easily buy hundreds of guns and no one will have any idea or a way to track it, and it in fact would be illegal to do so.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think that thousands of people own dozens or hundreds of guns in this country, you&#39;re being naive. People on gun subreddits here own dozens of guns.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t do mental health evaluations and everyone knows someone who can pass a background check. These are just the legal avenues. None of the law enforcement agencies deal with legal guns. They can barely keep up with illegal ones.</p>

<p>But, nobody talks about this, because some guys hundreds of years ago said we should have muskets and now it&#39;s apparently Wild Wild West or police state and all guns are magically gone. No inbetween.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for gun ownership. I&#39;m against the lack of mental health evaluations and registries. If myself as a responsible gun owner, I have to jump through some hoops or have some limitations in what I can and can&#39;t do, for the better and safety of society, it&#39;s a small price to pay for a hobby. Because let&#39;s be serious, other than a handgun or shotgun for protection, the rest is a hobby of toys or sport.</p>

<p>Registration is the first step to confiscation. Good thing I lost all my guns in a boating accident...</p>

<p>Guns are not the problem, society is the problem.  Ghettos are problems.  A lack of weapons training and education are problems.  Illicit drug trades are problems.  The only people using guns for illegal purposes are people who are, wait for it, breaking the law.</p>

<p>Movie theatres and schools are gun free zones.  Has that stopped shootings from occuring their?  No.  Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country but has that stopped the gun violence?  No.  We need to clean up out inner cities, legalize and regulatr illicit drugs, and train our citizenry on how to handle and respect fire arms.  Making &quot;assault rifles&quot; and &quot;large clips&quot; illegal does nothing to curb the violence since most violence is caused by pistols.  </p>

<p>There are answers to the gun violence in this country, but until we are honest with ourselves nothing will get fixed.  Just saying something about the 2nd amendment needs to change is not the answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Factor out gangs and regular Americans are no more likely to be shot than pretty much anywhere else. We need to clean up our gang problem. Better education system would do wonders. The next biggest is suicides, which could be helped with better resources.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I live in one of the states with the one of the highest density of legal guns and I live in a fairly densely populated place. I have never heard a gun fired in anger. Yet when I lived in CA for a couple years in a bad area with high gang activity yet strong gun regulations, I heard gunshots all the time... </p>

<p>It has a lot to do with where you&#39;re at, the reason a huge portion of Americans wont take it seriously is because it&#39;s literally a non-issue for them and never will be. So they hate when someone tries to limit their rights when they weren&#39;t effected in the first place. If we could focus on things that cause crime and gangs our stats would start looking like Europe, hell if you factor those things out we already do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair point. I agree. </p>

<p>I still think that the ease of acquiring a weapon contributes to the overall problem, and I&#39;m a responsible gun owner myself. I&#39;d be absolutely ok with better and more thorough screenings. Mental health evaluations. There is room for improvement there. Anyone who isn&#39;t a criminal should have zero problem with looking for a compromise there IMO, instead of just listing a worst case scenario as their reason not to.</p>

<p>But what I really.meant by &#39;weird way&#39; is we do it where it 4 or more victims. Don&#39;t even need to be killed can just be wounded. That puts a ton of gang violence on the stats. Adjust for gang violence and a lot changes. We have a serious gang problem. Point is though, no other country so easily counts things as a &#39;mass shootings&#39; as we do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off that’s two questions but to ur most recent demand -Ya they can. It’s called executive order and the fbi can certainly override the bs civil case in NV court because it’s specifically had to include legislation against bump stocks in addition to the legitimate civil claims against by victims. Why can’t it just be for their compensation-those claims are legitimate and every victim and family should be offered a settlement from the hotel no legislation needed. The fbi did this in the case of the Apple iPhone. Also if the reasoning is to preserve evidence why were pics of the crime “scene” /room -the crime actually was committed in allowed to be shown by the NYT (shocker) ? Or the video from 2002 at a different casino that actually involved a lawsuit he filed. Seems both of those would require at min. The same amount of confidentially as the surveillance tapes.  It’s not a legal case- if it is where are the updates? Indictments? It’s a pathetic attempt at gun control </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The irony is that the new anti-crime tech being gifted to LVPD is an acoustics-based package which will detect gun shots occurring in the metro and quickly process the location with great accuracy (and caliber). </p>

<p>Raytheon’s Boomerang is one such system although I don’t know if this is the one LV will be using.</p>

<p>I say irony, because, the FBI / LVPD ignored acoustic forensics when investigating the mass-shooting. In fact it’s not clear what science was applied by the FBI, if any. HealthRanger has a YT video on this which I recommend.</p>

<p>But the contemporary US anti-sniper tech, like Boomerang, emerged from the early Iraq war and used to defeat urban terrorism. So the principles and methodology are already well established and therefore no reason for it to have been excluded by the LV investigators. </p>

<p>And if LV is now embracing the system . . . then why not apply it now to the worst mass shooting that just occurred in your zip code ? </p>

<p>Sarcasm spoiler: “No, we don’t need to run the various iPhone recordings from the concert arena thru the acoustics software for filtering / processing / interpretation. But, starting next year, Las Vegas will make the system a standard feature of our anti-crime strategy for the city!” .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a feeling if we knew the truth there would be pressure from the American public to act.  I think those &quot;in the know&quot; have decided there was major international implications.  </p>

<p>For instance, lets say Paddock was a patsy and there were multiple shooters who have ties with ISIS.  If that were true, reporting it only strengthens ISIS in a time in which they are on the decline.  I don&#39;t think it would be that outlandish that the FBI, POTUS and mandalay bay decided to keep there mouths shut regarding any international terrorists group that could be involved.  And if that is in fact true, I might have to agree with their decision.  Because the goal of terrorism is not about the casualties.  Its about fear and knee jerk reaction that weakens our country.</p>

When you lie you have to have a very good memory. If you continually report on manufactured attrocities there is a high chance an error or mistake can bleed out in the reporting that the public catches.</p>

<p>The goal is to manufacture as much of these events as possible over the next few years to increase the ability to provide a compelling case as to why people should not be permitted to own firearms.</p>

<p>They have to make you think you have decided ots for the best to give up gun rights in the face of all those events so that when they eventually push for legislation to tale the rights away they can fall back on these attrocitied they are manufacturing to say its for good measure.</p>

<p>Lets not forget the use of propoganda was secretly legalized by the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a video (a REALLY grisly one) of a guy running around the grounds checking bodies and trying to help people. Towards the end of the video he goes over to the edge of the concert grounds and (paraphrasing) asks a cop/security to turn on the lights and asks where the help is. The guy responds &quot;Everyone out there is already dead.&quot; The guy video says no that&#39;s not true, and starts detailing the people he&#39;s found still breathing. At which point the cop asks who he is, the guy claims to be a civilian and that&#39;s the end of the video.</p>

<p>The point being, rescuers were NEVER sent out there to help save the wounded. No paramedics, no cops or firemen. Nothing. They just assumed everyone not moving was dead and left it at that. Which itself is REALLY weird. I&#39;ll try to find the video but it never stays available for long when I&#39;ve found it, and it&#39;s been edited down more and more. </p>

If you thought about what you were going to do  (shoot a bunch of people from a hotel room) and your worked out the problems you would have (gun jams, need to shoot different angles, move to new positions, defend from police coming through door), it comes to about 20 guns.

    <div class="md"><p>Did you think it through, or just listen to what people wrote on reddit?  Start with the basics.  Let&#39;s say his goal is to shoot a large number of people (roughly 500).  He knows he will need to shoot between 1,000 and 2,000 rounds in order to do this.  How many guns do you need to fire 2,000 without stopping?  You can put in additional magazines, but if a gun jams, you simply want to drop it and pick up a new one because you don&#39;t have time to fix the jam.  So, how many guns do you need to steadily fire 2,000 rounds?  Also consider heat and handling the weapons as well.  That&#39;s the first step, I&#39;m interested in how many you think is needed for 2,000 rounds. </p>

You should also expect other people to think you are ignorant.  When someone takes the time to work through a problem with you and you just insist that you are right and refuse to even engage in a conversation that would explain the whole thing to you, it comes across as willful ignorance.  You don&#39;t have to agree with anything I said.  What I did was ask you a question -- and told you I would walk you through to an explanation.  You don&#39;t have to engage in this conversation, and you made it clear you do not wish to.  However, that only confirms that you are willfully ignorant.  If you actually think it through, it makes perfect sense.  If you just want to spout off ignorant statements like &quot;it still makes not sense at all&quot;,  it never will.

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you mischaracterize my post. But you also continue to be very rude, so clearly this discussion is going nowhere. If you are ever ready to reflect on the fact that most of the guns that you so carefully calculated out as being necessary for the attack were not actually used in the attack despite the gunman having ample ability to continue to use them (which was my counter-point to your math equation on why the official story doesn&#39;t make sense to me) let me now. But you seem to know more than everybody else, so what point is there in talking to other people when we are all so clearly moronic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not being mean to point out the fact that I asked you a simple question to work through to a solution and you refuse to answer it.  Instead, you keep telling me exactly why it doesn&#39;t make sense.  I understand where you are coming from and I am telling you that you are not thinking it through.  There is no nice way to say it.  There is an explanation.  It makes perfect sense.  It explains why so many guns were there.  It explains why so many would not be used.  It is a fairly obvious explanation.  If you seriously thought through it on your own, you could easily figure it out.   Just take 5 or 10 minutes to work through the problem.  Think how many guns you would need to conduct the shooting the way Paddock did.  As soon as you actually think through what Paddock did, you will come to a number of about 20 to 25 weapons.  Give it a try and see how many you come up with. </p>

<p>Vegas shooting was a hoax!  A drill.  No one died.  Fed/State/Metro coordination.  150 + crisis actors in various roles.  Very convincing from live leak videos, but not enough to fool everyone.</p>

<p>There have been 0 grieving families of 58 dead looking for answers.  There have been 0 confirmed bullet wounds from ANY of the 600 injured.</p>

The casino is facing lawsuits, hundreds of them from all angles. I suspect they do not want to release footage, or even have their people talk - to protect them from litigation. Remember, when in a casino every square inch is covered with video, the hotel not so much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To your first question why would they? If they had nothing to hide they would have released them immediately since it’s an “ongoing investigation” right? The public could have helped provide evidence at minimum. Why does surveillance only apply to our citizens rights but not corporations.  Why would they though? The money they could be losing. Imagine if Americans still actually voted with dollars and boycotted all casinos owned by MGM it might make a small dent in their 9.8 B revenue but money/power is always the # 1 motivation for all of these false flags. They may not have a choice but to release it if one iota of gun control legislation is brought up right wing Trump supporters will go nuts. Trump will feel pressure to do something. Not saying he will but it is still America right? Can’t we as the public demand these things like basic proof this actually occurred the way the msm says it did? Seems a minimal request</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The irony is that the new anti-crime tech being gifted to LVPD is an acoustics-based package which will detect gun shots occurring in the metro and quickly process the location with great accuracy (and caliber). </p>

<p>Raytheon’s Boomerang is one such system although I don’t know if this is the one LV will be using.</p>

<p>I say irony, because, the FBI / LVPD ignored acoustic forensics when investigating the mass-shooting. In fact it’s not clear what science was applied by the FBI, if any. HealthRanger has a YT video on this which I recommend.</p>

<p>But the contemporary US anti-sniper tech, like Boomerang, emerged from the early Iraq war and used to defeat urban terrorism. So the principles and methodology are already well established and therefore no reason for it to have been excluded by the LV investigators. </p>

<p>And if LV is now embracing the system . . . then why not apply it now to the worst mass shooting that just occurred in your zip code ? </p>

<p>Sarcasm spoiler: “No, we don’t need to run the various iPhone recordings from the concert arena thru the acoustics software for filtering / processing / interpretation. But, starting next year, Las Vegas will make the system a standard feature of our anti-crime strategy for the city!” .</p>

<p>Every inch of the Mandalay Bay casino floor is covered by surveillance cameras. Not one fucking frame of Paddock released.</p>

<p>The only proof that he was even there is bank receipts and his dead body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wasn&#39;t it a year or 2 ago Isis supposedly took a picture while in Vegas? Its a huge city, I&#39;m honestly not surprised they&#39;d be setting up extra things around holidays. The recent shooting that we still have barely any details on certainly adds to that though. Also wasn&#39;t there a thread recently claiming the FBI won&#39;t be releasing many details until next year? The whole thing is bonkers and leaves more questions and than answers.</p>
