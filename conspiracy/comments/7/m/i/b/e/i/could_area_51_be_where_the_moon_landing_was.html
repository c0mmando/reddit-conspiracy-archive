       I was thinking, what if the reason it is so top secret is because they don't want people finding the spot where the moon landing was filmed.  The desert landscape seems like a perfect area to film such Thing. It's just a thought and wanted everyone's feedback. Thanks

       You are wrong. The amount of data needing to be faked would be astronomical.  And it would need to be sent from Mars as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like many people around here prefer to have these crazy ideas rather than look into the topic.

      <p>
       Go read about universities and others that utilize the Martian data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the moon landing. NASA wasn't doling out the radio signal from Houston, many independent people and countries captured the signal from the moon themselves.

       Source? Well first you wanted to have done really well in high school.  Then went on to a university degree. While there you volunteer to do mundane tasks at an observatory or radio telescope.

      <p>
       It is a well known fact of many ham radio operators listening in to the moon transmissions. Different parts of the world picked up signals at different times. But of course it was all being sent from a secret hanger in Nevada. That's how Australia picked up the signal while the US couldn't.

       No, source on the "amount of data needing to be faked would be astronomical."  You don't have a source. Nor do you have any substance about the "amount of data" that's coming from the mars mission.  It's not that much.

       I always wondered how the fuck people from the 60 could.go to the moon with computers that are slower than a $2 calculator, also how did they passed the radiation belt that surrounds the planet? They had a paper thin aluminum shuttle....

       Rocket tech and computer tech don't advance at the same rate. So aren't comparable.

       In regards to the belts, they went around the most dangerous parts - so were never exposed to the inner belts.

       It might be a reference from a joke started by a popular youtuber who had a video where he asked people to make up bullshit facts that sound real. One of them was that one in five Americans believe the moon isn’t real, it’s a hologram. I don’t think they were shilling.

       A sound stage might be more accurate. If you filmed out in the Great Basin Desert there would be mountains in the background, as well as wind, innacurate lighting, and stars at night. Such a stage could be located anywhere.

       Computer tech is multiple to the power ahead of rocket tech. It was 10 years after the supposed landing. And now where is rocket tech? 40 years of literally NO innovation in that category that we know of, in fact, the entire program was nixed. That's monumental proof!

       Putting pen to paper in figuring out trajectory in space is beyond tedious and time consuming. Impossible? No. Impossible on a time scale? Incredibly.

       We don't need a supercomputer from today, today a smartphone has enough computing power to allow us to travel the entire solar system. 1's and 0's do not take up a lot of storage. Shitty convoluted operating systems do.

       The SAME outmoded ships were used for years, decades, with the SAME, multiple, redundant computer systems that were as large as a VW Beetle; and the entirety of those systems cannot match a commercial computer system from even over 30 years ago now. Guess what, the lander wasn't much bigger than a bug.

       Plausibility factor Zero. If it were feasible, moreover profitable... because let's be real... every effort was attempted for sabotage, we would still be going there all the time and not just sending up satellites instead of simply NEVER going back.

       Does anyone believe Russia just threw up their arms when the US say/showed the moon landing? C'mon.
