        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Have you seen Paul the 6&#39;s Audience Hall in the Vatican?</p>

<p>The outside is reminiscent of a snake&#39;s head.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/0bOVm5e.png">https://i.imgur.com/0bOVm5e.png</a></p>

<p>The inside leaves no question.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kZaxVxM.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/kZaxVxM.jpg</a></p>

<p>In the center of the snake&#39;s mouth is &quot;The Resurrection&quot; by Fazzini.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/6iqpRX4.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/6iqpRX4.jpg</a></p>

<p>If you mirror the resurrection, you get a very clear image of Baphomet/Khnum.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/NK8ejtE.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/NK8ejtE.jpg</a></p>

<p>In fact, Khnum is from an ancient cult in Aswan, Egypt, where they used red granite quarries to build red granite obelisks. Eratosthenes used one of these red granite obelisks to measure the circumference of the earth, using it&#39;s shadow.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/79WOE2V.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/79WOE2V.jpg</a></p>

<p>The Vatican still has that red granite obelisk standing in front of it, today...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/30CMlHR.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/30CMlHR.jpg</a></p>

<p>The early incarnation of the Jesuits shaved off the writing somewhere between the 1400s and 1600s.</p>

<p>The red granite obelisk used to be in the Circus of Nero, where chariots would run people down in a track. This symbolism is referenced in a lot of places in modern times...</p>

<p>If they were banned they&#39;d show up here, this user was suspended. Usually when I see an admin take action in this sub the Trust and Safety account will show up in the mod logs or another admin account, I went pretty far back and didn&#39;t see any admin action in this sub like removing threatening or harassing posts like we&#39;ve seen before when they intervene. </p>

<p>Now, that&#39;s not to say I deny that at some point the Catholic church was infiltrated by the illuminati in order to destroy christianity. Which probably explains the OP article about the building and the sculpture. If babylon is the city of any religion it would be Rabbinic Judaism which arose out of the Talmud. </p>

<p>I agree that the Catholic Church is far from what they purport themselves as (the institution&#39;s greed and need for power is obvious), but I&#39;d like to know where the Serpent/Snake part is coming from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no solid source.  The meaning of Vatican is a studied subject.  You can find several sources of bible study enthusiasts breaking down the Latin and coming up with &quot;vatic&quot; and &quot;anus&quot; from multiple mentions in the bible of Vaticanus or Vaticanun.  The one thing they all have in common is future or prophecy.  Most interpretations involve an old woman or a pregnant woman (from the other interpretation of anus, making it the old woman of prophecy or fertile mother of prophecy).  Their minted coins support this throughout the years as the only the image on them as prevalent as the popes and cardinals themselves is a woman carrying a baby.  Further debate extends into if the building was named after Mary as the mother of prophecy for Christ, or if it is a future mother.</p>

<p>The only sources on interpreting it to mean serpent in any way all seem to be extremist sites and have no real backing but to say things like, &quot;Vatican, which is Latin for arrest Serpent, --&quot; and we know that&#39;s not true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for providing context.</p>

<p>The Catholic church certainly worships Virgin Mary, which may relate to this fertile mother of prophecy. I&#39;ve spoken to a fair amount of free-Christians (who tend to be anti-catholics), and they all seem to take issue with the church&#39;s literal interpretation of Christ&#39;s virgin birth and hence the entire virgin mary cult. </p>

<p>Not sure if the dispute goes any deeper than that though. Got any further insights on this?</p>

<p>Before the slave-owning, misogynistic and patriarchal kingdoms of the Aryans rose to power, our species worshipped serpents as symbols of rebirth. Joseph Campbell talks about this in all of his books and lectures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take with grains of salt.  I do not disagree with the post, but there are additional truths that add nuance.</p>

<p>Serpents represent Wisdom.  Wisdom was also repped by Sophia (female entity), so serpent and female became intertwined, but they are not one and same.  Serpents are present as symbols relating to birth and, in essence, DNA and breeding.  But these are not happy symbols of fertility and motherly love.</p>

<p>Tiamat is a great subject, violence and destruction, and as &quot;misogynistic&quot; as the Abrahamic religions (more paternalistic than misogynist, IMHO).  Tiamat will drift into planetary movements and history.</p>

<p>The Moon is a relatively recent addition to our mythologies.  Pre-Younger Dryas, there was no moon worship, so the &quot;older, matrilinear&quot; mentioned are not all that old.  Humans existed and worshipped stuff before the moon was in the sky.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Abrahamic religions, though later perverted, were initially a reaction to the Mother Goddess worship and the practices therein.  The practices include human sacrifice and non-consensual sexual rites.  The Abrahamic religions may not be perfect, but they at least removed human sacrifice.</p>

<p>To clarify:  Ancient human records do not mention the moon.  Relatively recent human records do mention the moon.  That difference of accounts seems to occur about 12,500 years ago.</p>

<p>I bring this up to show that pnut master&#39;s claim of &quot;older matrilinear&quot; religion taking sun/moon/stars as a symbol is relatively recent.  Older religions do not recognize the moon.  Those tend to recognize Saturn, but now I&#39;m drifting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do we know that the moon wasn&#39;t worshiped Pre-Younger Dryas?</p>

<p>The Goddess is both the Sun and the Moon, as Ma&#39;at is sometimes the Sun herself. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not dismissing all cases of human sacrifice, but I fundamentally disagree with the idea that a Mother Goddess demanded this of her followers. I don&#39;t see direct evidence of human or animal sacrifice in Minoan Krete, for example, until the Mycenaeans sack Knossos and misinterpret the mythology (i.e. the Mycenaeans didn&#39;t understand any of the Minoan rituals, hence their confusion with Kronos, Zeus, and all the &quot;deities&quot;).  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I suppose we don&#39;t know for sure, but from what I&#39;ve read/understood, moon worship is a relatively new practice.  Ancient texts do not mention the moon, but planets get tons of run.   Prior to moon worship was Saturn worship, and Saturn seemed to... wane in relation to moon worship.  Sun worship seems to exist alongside Saturn worship, tho which &quot;sun&quot; was the object of worship seems a legit question to me.</p>

<p>The Mother Goddess likely does not demand sacrifice.  Instead, the fertility cults that developed within, perverted, hid within, tainted, what-have-you, the Mother Goddess religion does demand the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Mother Goddess worship pre-dates Babylon by eons, but Babylon was a perverted form of Mother Goddess worship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, Thomas is a collection of Jesus&#39; sayings found with Nag Hammadi...  Is Thomas considered canon Nag Hammadi? </p>

<p>The Mysteries pre-date Christianity/early proto-Jews.  The Gnostics are a continuation of the Mysteries.  Upon Christianity&#39;s emergence/proto-Jew emergence, a new thing challenged the Gnostics.  The Gnostics then used their Mystery School powers and influence to bend the emerging religion back into the Mysteries.</p>

<p>This struggle continues today.  The Gnostics, housed by Mystery schools around the world, are focused on crushing Christianity.  Some even think Christianity is a perversion of the Mysteries... which means Jesus perverts the teachings of the Mysteries, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Leviticus is clearly reacting to the Mystery School culture surrounding him.  Gnostic and early Christians cannot be the same.</p>

<p>Is Sophia, Jesus consort, conceptual here?  The Sophia of the Demiurge concept?  Is Mary conceptual as well here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Gospel of Thomas is arguably the crux of the Nag Hammadi Library. But the Nag Hammadi Library has nothing constituting an official canon, as it is no more than a collection of ancient texts and Gospels. When read in a juxtaposition, they inform the reader as to what the mystical Jesus (i.e. the practitioner of a Mystery) and his living disciples probably said and believed.</p>

<p>&quot;The Mystery&quot; itself isn&#39;t much more than a shamanistic rite of passage for young boys and girls of Minoan Krete, Sumer, early Egypt, pre-Aryan India and Ireland. </p>

<p>Claiming &quot;Mystery schools&quot; exist is to admit that the successors of &#39;the Golden Age&#39; civilizations had no idea what &quot;the Mysteries&quot; meant (and still don&#39;t). Daimones, like Keres, are the souls of our ancestors or &quot;Demeter&#39;s people.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mary is the Sophia. She is also the Kore or the anima of the collective unconscious. Because she is a female manifestation of the Mother Goddess, we could say she is the Queen, where Jesus is the Consort.</p>

<p>I&#39;m as well-read as most well-read folks, and fuck me I have no idea what this sentence means, nor have even seen Daimones or Keres.  Can you break that down?</p>

<p>Back to Gnostic and Mysteries.  OK, yes.  THE Mystery we agree on, and that Jesus preached this.  Preaching THE Mystery to the masses was a break from The Mystery Schools (keepers of THE Mystery) and Gnostic tradition.  This is where Christianity breaks from Gnostics.  The Gnostics then/eventually sought to re-hide THE Mystery.  The Nag Hammadi was written by the Gnostics for this purpose.  The Gnostics pre-dated Christianity, cradled Jesus, and eventually used Nag Hammadi as part of the effort to squash Christianity and re-hide the Mystery.</p>

<p>With Thomas, I will amend my claim to:  Most of the Nag Hammadi is younger than most of the NT books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to understand &quot;the Mysteries&quot;, and this idea of &quot;Mystery Schools,&quot; it&#39;s imperative that you digest the <em>Corpus Hermeticum</em>. In the dialogues of the Hermeticum, the concept of &quot;the daimones&quot; (which appear in Platonic writings, from the mouth of Socrates) is fully explored, presented as an explanation for the complexity that is the individual, and collective human psyche. </p>

<p>Daimones, as you could surmise, pass down to the modern age as &quot;demonic&quot; entities. Assuming that daimones have negative intent is an Abrahamic prejudice that we&#39;ve inherited from our predecessors in the West. Being vassals of a federal government for more than a thousand years, most Europeans still haven&#39;t shed the thoughts and feelings that were conditioned on them by the Catholic Church. The Enlightenment, being Hermetic in its philosophies, reintroduced the idea of &quot;daimones&quot; to intellectuals--casting a radically different light on the idea of &quot;genius&quot; up until the 20th century. </p>

<p>In my scholastic research, I&#39;ve found evidence that the Pre-Hellenic &quot;Keres&quot;, &quot;Harpies&quot; and &quot;Daimones&quot; were analogous to the &quot;Bau&quot; of Egyptian mysticism (encapsulated in the Book of the Dead--which I have not read in its entirety). What&#39;s understood by this is that we once nurtured a close relationship with these entities, which peoples of the &#39;Golden Age&#39; regarded as the souls of the living and the dead.</p>

<p>In Classical Greece, certain Mystery cults preserved the beliefs and language of the &#39;Golden Age&#39; civilizations, often associating &quot;Keres&quot; and &quot;Daimones&quot; with the Chthonic, and the Grain-Mother, Demeter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid we can&#39;t agree on &quot;the Mystery&quot; until you understand its etymology. The Gnostics had no intention of keeping the &quot;Mystery&quot; underground, as clearly illustrated in this passage from the Gospel of Thomas. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(39) Jesus said, &quot;The pharisees and the scribes have taken the keys of gnosis and hidden them. They themselves have not entered, nor have they allowed to enter those who wish to. You, however, be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the Gnostic texts, it&#39;s repeatedly stated that Christians, like Jesus, must speak in riddles, out of fear for their lives, and the preservation of their teachings. Before Gnosticism (i.e. Christianity), these ideas were communicated, to a degree, within Zoroastrianism and mystical Judaism (i.e. Kabbalah). Where Gnostics differed from the Kabbalah was in their veneration of Sophia, the Mother Goddess of the &#39;Golden Age.&#39; </p>

<p>St. Augustine may be younger than the NT Gospels, but the Church has canonized his writings, where they&#39;ve ignored or suppressed an exploration of Gnosticism (preferring instead to disseminate disinfo, ala the <em>Da Vinci Code</em>). Because Gnosticism is merely a lens with which to interpret the sayings and teachings of Jesus, their dates of publication don&#39;t have any bearing on their authenticity or relevance in decoding Christianity. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll watch the Vimeo later.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Modern scholars such as Peter Partner and Malcolm Barber agree that the name of Baphomet was an Old French corruption of the name Muhammad, with the interpretation being that some of the Templars, through their long military occupation of the Outremer, had begun incorporating Islamic ideas into their belief system, and that this was seen and documented by the Inquisitors as heresy.[26] Alain Demurger, however, rejects the idea that the Templars could have adopted the doctrines of their enemies.[27] Helen Nicholson writes that the charges were essentially &quot;manipulative&quot;—the Templars &quot;were accused of becoming fairy-tale Muslims.&quot;[27] Medieval Christians believed that Muslims were idolatrous and worshipped Muhammad as a god, with mahomet becoming mammet in English, meaning an idol or false god.[28] This idol-worship is attributed to Muslims in several chansons de geste. For example, one finds the gods Bafum e Travagan in a Provençal poem on the life of St. Honorat, completed in 1300.[29] In the Chanson de Simon Pouille, written before 1235, a Saracen idol is called Bafumetz.[30]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The irony here is how this serpent representation has been built into our subliminal minds for thousands of years to correlate with religion. So it&#39;s not surprising that we are now wondering why this is. Given we have blindly followed, whether religious or not, we all have questioned, so now things are being revealed. This raises eyebrows and creates chaos in our minds. Now I&#39;m generally speaking and not singling out any religion or person. If you research and read about ancient religions there is a common thread of deities worshipped that follows human migration over the continents. The root is what I&#39;m interested in and you just need to follow the symbolisms, signs, gothic door frames (which look very much like abstract vulva art) - <a href="http://askelm.com/doctrine/d980928.htm">gothic</a>

<p>How do we know that the Moon wasn&#39;t worshiped Pre-Younger Dryas?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose we don&#39;t know for sure, but from what I&#39;ve read/understood, moon worship is a relatively new practice.  Ancient texts do not mention the moon, but planets get tons of run.   Prior to moon worship was Saturn worship, and Saturn seemed to... wane in relation to moon worship.  Sun worship seems to exist alongside Saturn worship, tho which &quot;sun&quot; was the object of worship seems a legit question to me.</p>

<p>The Mother Goddess likely does not demand sacrifice.  Instead, the fertility cults that developed within, perverted, hid within, tainted, what-have-you, the Mother Goddess religion does demand the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Mother Goddess worship pre-dates Babylon by eons, but Babylon was a perverted form of Mother Goddess worship.</p>
