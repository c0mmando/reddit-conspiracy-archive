<p>The obsession with Hillary Clinton/Podesta/Pizza/Pineapple is fairly obscene. There&#39;s more discussion here on a daily basis about Hillary&#39;s emails than there is about Paul Manafort, Donald Trumps former campaign manager, laundering money with the Ukrainians ( ya know an actual conspiracy!!!! )</p>

<p>Pedogate isn&#39;t a RW anything. This stuff goes back to the Franklin scandal, churches, colleges, and other institutions. Most people researching this come across plenty of republicans knee deep in this too. Its not a partisan issue.</p>

<p>This is the age of disinformation. Plenty of people here are quite logical and skeptical. You have to sift through bullshit everywhere on the web.</p>

<p>For example you DO have weird emails with podesta. You DO have themed videos on youtube targeting kids. You DO have absurd science experiments on rats finding the best way to decrease their population. You DO have a nanny-state that is making people more reliant on big govt. If anything this is a bipartisan issue given that Bush Sr, Clintons, Reagan, and Bush Jr are all apart of the same club.. and they were all EQUALLY PISSED when trump was elected. There is your NWO..

<p>The invasion of Raqqa was planned long before Trump became President.</p>

<p>I mean. Really man. What the fuck is this. How is Obama still &quot;going around&quot; him. The guy could barely get the Republicans in the House/Senate and Supreme Court to go along with him. I mean you do remember that Obama was the only Democratic part of that government right? </p>

<p>Do you think Trump will really hurt our relationships with third world countries where our leaders have manipulated them for so long? This is a new world, but its not one of fascist control like you seem to think..</p>

<p>Yes. Trump is a moron.</p>

<p>Mr Obama is scheduled to first make a stop in China, and then India, before flying to Paris, a spokesperson for the former president told The Hill.</p>

<p>The obsession with Hillary Clinton/Podesta/Pizza/Pineapple is fairly obscene.
