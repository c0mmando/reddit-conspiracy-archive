Because I look at history and can&#39;t find a period of time in which people where free. There&#39;s always existed power and all the wars we been through were sponsored to us by those that held the power. </p>

<p>What&#39;s it gonna be like in the future? 
Another war maybe a change in the system and back to the same story? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to understand and I guess it is obvious that they keep us under by using our problems and diversity against us.
The more problems we have the busier we are. We have all the same 24h/day but while we fighting to survive they keep working on their plans.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we can ever beat them at their own game but I strongly believe the truth has to come out no matter what and that is why I appreciate what you guys do here.</p>

<p>We can win but only love can set us free. Take care for your family/friends/community.
In my opinion that is the only way to make that happen mixed with the truth we know and the belief that we don&#39;t want that shit to happen ever again.</p>

<p>Peace. Love. Positivity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can&#39;t beat <em>them</em> because <em>they</em> are so much more than what you can see, smell, and touch. <em>They</em> are the foot soldiers of a powerful dark force that probably comes from another universe, acting as a parasite that feasts upon everything good and nurturing in our universe. The very nature of the cycle of life in the physical plane is disgusting and painful to begin with. </p>

<p>We are here for a reason. To isolate the good, worthwhile things and take them back to our spiritual home. </p>

<p>The point I&#39;m making is that, the victory we are searching for isn&#39;t within some kind of political paradigm shift, although those do take place and have some value, it lies within the individual lessons and understandings that we as enlightened men and women can transmutate into the Aether of existence.</p>

Being a useful idiot is each individuals choice. 2) If you are big into such things read about &#39;Eugenics&#39;, hinted by Darwin, championed by JDF the first, mirrored by Hitler, now back and in my opinion championed by powerful people to dumb down USA. (Maybe Europe too?) Very scary stuff. Whole big separate topic. </p>

<p>Yes - but likely not for a few more tens of thousands (or millions) of years.  We&#39;re not in the right yuga yet.</p>

<p>We just left the Kali and entered the Dvapara.  Extremely high levels of evolutionary development occur in the Satya...but that won&#39;t happen for a few more long millennia still.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain the last link real quick:  It&#39;s said we live in a binary star system - The North Star/Sirius A being the sister star to the sun.  Both stars are in orbit around one another and it takes about 4,320,000 years for the stars to make a full orbit around each other.  In that time, the proximity of the stars to one another effects not only the energetic signature of each star (since they&#39;re co-mingling and being influenced by each other&#39;s electro-magneto-gravitic energies), but the energetic signatures of all the planetary bodies associated with each star are being effected as well (along with the energies of all the beings living on each of those planets).</p>

<p>The further apart the stars are from one another, the weaker each star is as well as the planets around the stars.  The stars and their planets are at their weakest and darkest at this point.  We literally just came out of each stars&#39; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion_and_aphelion">aphelion points</a> - i.e. the points at which the stars are furthers away from one another.  They are making their way back toward each other now, but of course, these are stars we&#39;re talking about, so the journey toward their respective perihelion points (where the stars are closest to one another and their energetic signatures are at their absolute highest and strongest) will take a few million more years.</p>

<p>Yugas represent the different stages of human evolutionary development as influenced by the proximity of the stars to one another.</p>

<p>The closer the stars are to one another, the higher their energetic signatures and the more highly evolved and advanced are the beings (humans and non-humans) on the planets associated with each star.  The further apart the stars are, the weaker they are energetically, and the less evolved everyone is.  We&#39;ve been in the lowest, weakest, furthest apart stage for many thousands of years thus far, and are finally beginning to break out from it because the stars just past their aphelion points and are finally turning back to travel toward each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The revolution has to come at the individual level. That&#39;s how change at the macro level not only comes into being but can sustain itself.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t mean that every single person on the planet has to evolve into a more loving and responsible entity. A small community of 50-100 truly enlightened beings can radiate powerful ripples that can lead to the spiritual evolution of the entire globe.</p>

<p>I believe that time will come. The internet did its damage and truly #woke a lot of people up. In other words, this process has already been set into motion and though we may not see it yet, the seeds have been planted across the planet.</p>

<p>Though it&#39;s in the digital sphere, this is one of those communities that has reached critical mass and is starting to spread into the rest of the internet. We&#39;ve been slandered and been the target of numerous subversion campaigns yet here we are continuing to do our thing. This is a truly special place and the mods as well the users have every right to be proud of themselves.</p>
