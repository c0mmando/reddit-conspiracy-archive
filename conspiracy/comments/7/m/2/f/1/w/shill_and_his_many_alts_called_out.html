    <div class="md"><p>Ya no doubt. The entire Trump movement and downfall of Clinton started and materialized on conspiracy and pol forums. The left is scared that we memed and leaked Donald Trump to the white house. Trumps undoing 50 years of deep state plans. Now they are coming at us from all sides. Including on Reddit.</p>

<p>I knew he was our guy when he brought Clintons rape victims on national TV predebate. That was it. Any doubt that Trump was a plant was gone from my mind after that. He&#39;s our guy. </p>

<p>Think about the reality of what he did. He brought rape victims of one of the most powerful people on earth to a national debate platform. Called him a rapist to his face and told his wife that he was going to lock her up for her crimes. On national fucking TV. No doubt hes our guy and no doubt he believes in a purpose to MAGA.</p>

<p>Its sad. You know the conspiracy mods are aware of the brigading. The leftist here arent organic. Its organized. They are preparing for 2020, they cant let what happened in 2016 happen again. </p>

<p>Donald Trump is fucking the system thats fucked all of us our entire lives. I dont care who you are or what your hair looks like. If you take on the system, you got my vote.</p>

<p>Trump has also been accused of rape, you know. And he never followed through on his &quot;lock her up&quot; promises – instead he did a 180 after the election and said how the Clintons were good people. It was just politics as usual.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea how fucking complicated that would be? It&#39;s not about just showing up to her door with a few cops. Further more, doing so publicly could cause a collapse. You could have Clinton voters rioting, calling him a dictator, regardless of what crimes she was convicted of.</p>

<p>Hey, Trump was the one repeatedly promising his supporters that he was going to instruct his attorney-general to appoint a special prosecutor. He never indicated it was going to be complicated:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/thaNhEAKF_U?t=24">&quot;But, if I win, I&#39;m going to instruct my attorney-general to get a special prosecutor to look into your [Hillary&#39;s] situation. ... We&#39;re going to have a special prosecutor.&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?416754-1/donald-trump-campaigns-panama-city-florida&amp;amp;start=993">&quot;I will ask [my attorney general] to appoint a special prosecutor.&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/WhWoFen5wMs?t=105">&quot;The amounts involved, the favours done, and the significant number of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a special prosecutor immediately, immediately, immediately.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The simple fact of the matter is that he promised, but after the election he didn&#39;t deliver. He even said, in response to people chanting &quot;lock her up&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Ix49LjgaTaI?t=19">&quot;That plays great before the election. Now, we don&#39;t care.&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He later went on to say that the Clintons were <a href="https://youtu.be/qPK7uStv6zA?t=10">&quot;good people&quot;</a>  and he didn&#39;t want to hurt them and he said that he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hbWCggw2ss">had a lot of respect for them</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I never expected him to follow through on most of his election promises; I always just regarded him as yet another politician telling people what they wanted to hear. Rather than &quot;fucking the system thats fucked all of us our entire lives&quot; and &quot;undoing 50 years of deep state plans&quot;, Trump is just more of the same – say anything to get elected, then reward yourself and your mates when you get into power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, Trump is Donald fucking Trump. Look at the guy. You think that man is some tactical genius? </p>

<p>My best guess? And this is waxing very, very hopefully (but not without evidence) is that he&#39;s taking orders from some people in military. There are good guys out there who are far smarter than he is. They might be using him to carry out whatever plans they&#39;ve been working on. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see him as any sort of aspiration figure, or hero. I see him as Donald Trump, billionaire tycoon and James Bond like super villain. He&#39;s essentially a cartoon character. Which is why I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s behind the shit that I&#39;ve been watching go down right now. </p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t. My posts were made simply in response to u/AsaDouche&#39;s post, in which he/she claimed that Trump is &quot;our guy&quot;, that he is &quot;undoing 50 years of deep state plans&quot;, and that he is &quot;fucking the system&quot;. As I&#39;ve said, I think he&#39;s just another politician. I think people who believed his campaign promises about &quot;draining the swamp&quot; were just being conned (and being blatantly conned, in my opinion).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is &quot;my guy&quot; other than me. I hope that would be true for all of us. </p>

<p>Regarding &quot;draining the swamp&quot; though, I have seen a lot of evidence that this sort of thing is indeed taking place. There&#39;s a lot of layers to this though. It&#39;s complicated. It&#39;s not something that will simply be broadcast on the nightly news. We need to maintain some semblance of order, if we can. What would become of the US if we saw a collapse of government due to corruption? How would the average person react if someone they put their trust in was revealed to be not just a criminal, but a diabolical criminal? </p>

<p>We have to understand the fragility of the average person&#39;s mind, and I believe that there are plenty who do, and are considerate of it. </p>

<p>I can say this. What I&#39;ve been watching unfold has been in the works long before Trump was the Republican front runner. Years before. He isn&#39;t responsible for &quot;draining the swamp&quot;. People far smarter, and far better than him, are.</p>

<p>I have no political allegiance, and I don&#39;t vote. I just watch.The best I can say to you is, please, let&#39;s begin to let go of our partisan mindset. I&#39;m not your enemy, and you&#39;re not mine. And if you voted, the people who voted contrary are also not your enemy, nor are you theirs. </p>

<p>We all have the same enemy: fear, and greed. I&#39;ve always said, left and right can still be considered the bottom of top and bottom. All of us, you and I, we&#39;re bottom. And there&#39;s only a few people at top. My goal? Remove top and bottom, and left and right will likely follow suit. Cause the fact of the matter is, virtually every one of us wants the same thing: to live a happy and prosperous life. Now imagine what we could do if we were all on that same wavelength. We&#39;d conquer disease, death, and travel the stars.</p>

<p>That&#39;s our future, if we decide it to be. </p>

<p>That&#39;s so patronising. I really hate how people drag out statements like this or the conspiratists&#39; favourite excuse, cognitive dissonance, as a reason why their pet theory is not believed. The average person can easily handle terrible news, as long as the evidence is there. If people can&#39;t back up their claims, they shouldn&#39;t go blaming others for that.</p>

<p>Secondly, the tidal wave of sexual assault allegations. This is hypothetical, but lets say you have a senator whom you can prove has been involved in human trafficking. That&#39;s hard news to break to the people. But what is easier is to say &quot;Listen Frank, we know everything. Now, we&#39;re gonna give you an out. Ten women are prepared to say you assaulted them. You can take your lumps and resign, or, you can claim innocence when this comes to trial and likely spend the rest of your days in Guantanamo.

<p>Third, start looking into which political figures have been resigning, and why. There&#39;s been a lot recently, and there will be a lot more. </p>

<p>This is evidence that there is in fact a movement taking place to begin weeding our corruption. I don&#39;t believe for an instant Trump is the mastermind behind it, for what I hope are obvious reasons. I do believe however that there may be some good guys working behind the scenes. </p>

<p>What do you claim this has to do with draining the swamp?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the tidal wave of sexual assault allegations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you talking about the #metoo movement? That started with Hollywood and has broadened since then, but it&#39;s got nothing to do with &quot;draining the swamp&quot;. If anything, Trump is part of the problem – even if you accept his excuse for the &quot;grab &#39;em by the pussy&quot; comment as locker room talk, he still thinks it acceptable to joke about sexually assaulting women. And he&#39;s been accused of groping women in the past, and he&#39;s been accused of rape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is hypothetical, but lets say ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d rather stick to actual events and actual evidence rather than making up stuff please.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is evidence that there is in fact a movement taking place to begin weeding our corruption</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saying &quot;learn what happened in Saudia Arabia&quot; is not evidence. Making up a scenario involving a politician is not evidence. Saying &quot;look at which political figures have been resigning&quot; is not evidence. And a grass-roots movement of women standing up against sexual harassment is also not evidence of draining the swamp.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s hard news to break to the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s not. News like this is broken all the time. The public are not surprised these days by news of politicians behaving immorally or criminally. In fact, if the satanic moral panics of the 1980s have taught us anything, it&#39;s that there are people who are too ready to believe in conspiracies and outlandish allegations.</p>

<p>The first major scandal to hit the Trump campaign besides the typical “what a racist, such a sexist, yada yada yada,” came from a lawsuit stemming from the infamous sex parties held by billionaire and known pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your post. I&#39;ve been wondering why there was a huge uptick in leftist idealism in the sub. I think you&#39;re absolutely right. Ever since the last mod shuffle drama, theres been a concentrated effort and flood of Politics/ToPMinds/Resist shills here.</p>

<p>The same people that laugh at Pizzagate and ridiculed this sub for years are now trying to hi-jack it. They want to normalize corruption and instill false conspiracies to derail the narrative. Anything anti Clinton/Obama is instantly met with down votes like its the politics circlejerk or something. </p>

<p>Getting kind of ridiculous and the aim is to control the narrative of Reddit subs like this one. Reddit is leftism and spez cant let what happened in 2016 happen in 2020. Reddit was at the forefront of the battle to expose Clinton corruption. It wasnt Russia. It was pedes just like you and me. We derailed that DNC Clinton shit. Not Russia or Putin. </p>

<p>We used online outlets like Reddit to spread information and inform the masses. Expect a lot more shilling as we get closer to 2020. The DNC and RNC will try to steal another election.</p>

<p>I mean really man. If the Republicans in Congress were really against him, he would&#39;ve been impeached. But I guess it&#39;s easier to make up some persecution fantasy isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>And, if the argument is that Trump is some hero but the &quot;deep state&quot; is stymieing his every move and preventing him from carrying through on his election promises, then why hasn&#39;t he said this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is &quot;my guy&quot; other than me. I hope that would be true for all of us. </p>

<p>Regarding &quot;draining the swamp&quot; though, I have seen a lot of evidence that this sort of thing is indeed taking place. There&#39;s a lot of layers to this though. It&#39;s complicated. It&#39;s not something that will simply be broadcast on the nightly news. We need to maintain some semblance of order, if we can. What would become of the US if we saw a collapse of government due to corruption? How would the average person react if someone they put their trust in was revealed to be not just a criminal, but a diabolical criminal? </p>

<p>We have to understand the fragility of the average person&#39;s mind, and I believe that there are plenty who do, and are considerate of it. </p>

<p>I can say this. What I&#39;ve been watching unfold has been in the works long before Trump was the Republican front runner. Years before. He isn&#39;t responsible for &quot;draining the swamp&quot;. People far smarter, and far better than him, are.</p>

<p>I have no political allegiance, and I don&#39;t vote. I just watch.The best I can say to you is, please, let&#39;s begin to let go of our partisan mindset. I&#39;m not your enemy, and you&#39;re not mine. And if you voted, the people who voted contrary are also not your enemy, nor are you theirs. </p>

<p>We all have the same enemy: fear, and greed. I&#39;ve always said, left and right can still be considered the bottom of top and bottom. All of us, you and I, we&#39;re bottom. And there&#39;s only a few people at top. My goal? Remove top and bottom, and left and right will likely follow suit. Cause the fact of the matter is, virtually every one of us wants the same thing: to live a happy and prosperous life. Now imagine what we could do if we were all on that same wavelength. We&#39;d conquer disease, death, and travel the stars.</p>

<p>That&#39;s our future, if we decide it to be. </p>
