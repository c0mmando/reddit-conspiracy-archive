       I keep seeing Pai's image everywhere and it just so happens that most of the new images we see of Pai are "meme worthy." It's gotten to the point where it seems less coincidental and more deliberate. With so many groups/politicians fighting the FCC repeal of Net Neutrality, it's safe to say it'll most likely never actually happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Pai's face is now the new image to hate. In today's day and age with polarizing opinions and social media, when one group hates you - the opposing group will blindly support you. This has been part of Pai's plan the entire time. Whether the repeal actually goes through or not is not of his concern. He knew he'd be hit with heavy-handed backlash, he knew people would hate that stupid "popcorn meme" or that new image of him in a Christmas hat on and it's exactly why he did it. Now he'll forever be tied to the idea that he pissed off "Communist snowflakes" and "Liberal cucks." He's the new age Conservative, Trump supporters will rally around his "Capitalist values."
      </p>
      <p>
       So trust the paralegal, investigative, and journalist groups that are working tirelessly to make sure FCC's decision doesn't hit the voting floors of Capital Hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       So fuck the memes. Fuck this guy. Bury him into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I can see some people are only getting upset with this post thinking I'm in some.way defending/undermining the FCC vote to repeal NN. Which is not at all how I view this.

       It has nothing to do with Pai - it has to do with a censorship bill being called "net neutrality" and the entire internet falling hook line and sinker. There's your story.

       It does seem that the names of these proposals have little in common with their use. The Patriot Act was unconstitutional, but if you were against it you weren't patriotic. People claim Internet Freedom will be destroyed because of Pai, yet in the past few years we've amassed quite a list of voices censored that are ignored by outraged NN supporters/internet freedom fighters.

       I was simply provided an answer which fit your question perfectly. Censorship is already here which is the point, so NN may not do shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only censorship, but propaganda form the government is allowed:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the final hours before the Christmas holiday weekend, U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday quietly signed the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law—and buried within the $619 billion military budget (pdf) is a controversial provision that establishes a national anti-propaganda center that critics warn could be dangerous for press freedoms.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act, introduced by Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, establishes the Global Engagement Center under the State Department which coordinates efforts to "recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining United Sates national security interests."
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, the law authorizes grants to non-governmental agencies to help "collect and store examples in print, online, and social media, disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda" directed at the U.S. and its allies, as well as "counter efforts by foreign entities to use disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda to influence the policies and social and political stability" of the U.S. and allied nations.

       I respect and agree with everything else you're saying here, but repealing NN would only further censorship. Yes, we need to fight censorship in general but that also means fighting anything that would be a step back.

       Understood, kinda like when an immigrant rapes one of us and people say "well we do it here too".  Yea, doesn't mean we should bring in more rapist and allow them to commit 20 different crimes walking around Scott free just because some us do it.

       The Pro-NN freedom fighters were pretty quiet when Milo, Roger Stone, Laura Loomer and even President Trump's Twitter accounts were suspended. I don't understand how proNN supporters can claim to be for internet freedom when they declined to defend it over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the saying goes, "I may disagree with what you say, but I will violently defend your right to say it." Somehow we lost sight of that idea, NN or not.

       I certainly agree with those examples, but they are very
       <em>
        specific
       </em>
       cases and those people could be labeled as "hate speech mongers" in the right light. Having said that, repealing NN would only make even more of those cases common on both sides and that's a much bigger problem than a few people (while I still understand fully your point).

       What the internet will look like pre/post NN isn't important, and I say that because I don't think NN will be repealed. The FCC voting to repeal NN was soley to say that they'd support a repeal, the final decision is upto Capitol Hill who are now split 50/50 Republican and Democrat in recent midterm elections - almost no doubt a repeal of NN will happen. But now Pai is the face of capitalism and middle America loves him for it.

       Pre NN is simply what you see now. You pay your ISP a monthly fee and you have access to whatever is on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post NN would be a much different landscape. Let's say your ISP is Comcast and they are partnered with Facebook/Instagram, but not with Twitter. You'd have to pay additional fees to access Twitter.

       IIRC, it's something like 90% of television is under 6 companies and &lt;90% of the food industry is under Nestlé. NN is in place safeguard against the internet becoming monopolized.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look up the origin of the internet, in short it was in 1969 when the first host computer at UCLA was connected to other supercomputers of the time and this allowed for information and data to be shared instantly - this was essentially the internet. So the origins come from the idea that independent parties came together in order to share information and it has been that way for almost 50 years now. There's been an obvious growth in the way the world communicates and understands each other thanks to the freedom to share information online. This is threatened by an NN repeal because it opens the door for a monopolized Internet.

       Thank you OP, good response. But I kinda feel like the internet and mobile/data companies already have a monopoly. I'd want something to break up the current monopolies, something to fuck Comcast out of fucking there customers over.
      </p>
      <p>
       If NN were to be abolished and certain companies would make you pay more certain sites, why would I choose said company? It's already a monopoly, here in Canada we have BELL, ROGERS and TELUS who run the show. There more, but they use BELL, ROGERS and TELUS' towers... I switched to Virgin and it's basically the same as bell but cheaper.
      </p>
      <p>
       GoodLife has the middle class people going in for 50$ a month, but they also own FIT4LESS which is 10$s a month. I feel like I have 2 different options, but either way GOODLIFE is getting my money.

       I'll stick to two things you brought up that I feel are most important/relevant to NN.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'd want something to break up the current monopolies
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree! We absolutely should start looking into legal action against the bigger ISPs. So for example, let's say NN is repealed. Facebook is looking to partner with an ISP so what bargaining power would an ISP? Money, and who would have more money between let's say Comcast or Bell? Comcast of course. Repealing NN would be a massive step back because it'd be handing more power to the big companies and bar competition from the smaller companies.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If NN were to be abolished and certain companies would make you pay more certain sites, why would I choose said company?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because you use those sites/services.  When I say a certain site partnering with an ISP, I mean they may be giving better access to that site through an individual ISP or even just access outright. What that means more specifically, if you use Google+ and Google is partnered with Comcast but you have Bell as an ISP - well that means you'll have to pay a fee to Google in order to use their site because they're not a Bell partner. Your sites and services will literally be throttled.

       I wonder if monopolies can be fought without NN in place. I feel like were agreeing in witch direction we should go, but we aren't agreeing on NN, which is natural. I don't like the government being involved in business's business other than environment shit, which even then is based on lies. If our internet does go to shit once it's replaced, may the dark web become more common to the average Joe? If everyone used the dark web, would this be a problem?

       You're starting to reek of horseshit. You realize at one point in this thread you're stating your stance on NN and another you're asking civil questions like you don't fully get NN?

       You still can't prove that post NN will be different from pre NN, which is my biggest peeve with this shit. Thanks OP, we were being nice and disagreeing, but I guess that's that.

       Tell me witch other account you think I am. I'm french so it be pretty easy to find my similar errors you fucking TWAT.

       Don't believe lies such as this.  Every time anything of this sort has occurred in the past, the FTC has stepped in and a pro consumer resolution was made.  There is no reason to think there will not continue to be remedy in the event of abuses.  Piper relies on the very presupposition of inadequate remedies, that providers can simply run roughshod over the public without consequences.  The narrative is childish in that it represents a fantasy!
