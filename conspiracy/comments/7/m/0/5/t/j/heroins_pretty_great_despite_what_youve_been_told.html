       The future is inevitable and the past has been written over and over again. The folks that hold evolution as their one religion are blind to it not realizing that the human condition is extremely retched. How is it that we can be such great creators yet take the beauty and design of the world around us and treat it like a it is some sort of unwanted reflection we see in the mirror.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the advent of technology we’ve become greater at destruction than peace and overall improvement of life, were fixated on modifying nature to be more suitable to our own desires, its like those folks that are addicted to plastic surgery or most recently. We are self mutilating and are unaware of it. Were like gods, just extremely irresponsible and selfish and we, like those before us, will become crushed under our own weight.
      </p>

       There are many depictions of this. The system will reboot and maybe another trial run will take place. I used to care about the ultimate truth, ascension, etc. The firm realization is that I signed up for this. Im not sure other than there was some lesson or experience I was keen on, i believe were given the option. Maybe were in a live simulation to see what we would do if given free will, to experience the vastness of humanity, its strengths and weaknesses as to not see them as the being completely chaotic and bizarre.

       This place is a trip and its certainly not as random as one would think.

       The earth goes through periodic extinctions, but that's because the old models are phased out in favor of the new. Currently, humanity is in a state of amnesia as a species, and "magic" is at its lowest point prior to the end of the kali yuga. The old artifacts encased in stone are legitimate, and may or may not have been made by humanity as we know them now. We're on a test planet, an experiment. It does not end at high technology, divine beings are real. We write about them in a secular way when people talk about energy based beings. The reason things are exploding right now is because humanity is about to go into space, this is why you see simulation theory pushed and why Nasa has not done manned missions since the Apollo programs. When you get far enough away from the earth, the dampener on "magic" ceases. You can see energy beings outside our atmosphere, as has been attested to both in video evidence and astronaut and government disclosures, however hushed.

       Honestly and ideally, the much more. 
    I'm aware of energetic beings which exist outside of our perception, and I'm well versed on "theories" of nasas secrecy. 
     Though our interpretations may be different, or not, I have come to similar conclusions thus far.

       The composer could have gone by many names. I'll use the biblical terms here. YHWH was a real entity, and is said to be synonymous with new testament God, he's not. The religion of YHWH was subverted by the story of Jesus. The idea was to get humanity out of the trap we're in. Magic isn't the only thing diminished with our current situation, souls may be trapped here between incarnations until they manage to connect to their higher selves.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been tampered with and infiltrated by many different entities. When all you have are names to go by, it can be very difficult to distinguish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much more of inport: Ships will show in the skies around the world to signal the new age. This is coming very soon. My spiritual awakening was related to the events upcoming and I cannot describe to you the absolute depth of it, it seems to have echoed backwards through my life rather than being born with a destiny. People will begin to rediscover their psychic powers in more fullness of manifestation if they have not lost their connection to their higher selves. There will be a layover period where the conditions on earth are raised to the point that everyone is free, truly free, to discover themselves. After this period ends, the earth will likely be wiped again to make way for a new test.

       The Gnostics are on point with a lot of their work and reasoning. The work of John Lamb is good as well, more modern and consumable, as well as speculative when he needs to be. I don't take too kindly to his lucifer/Gaia sympathy since that's his ultimate conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still undecided if there is an ultimate morality separate from the two divine principles of freedom, and love. This is all supposedly a game. However, in this life and in this game, I will oppose what I consider evil, and it's things that horrifically violate either of the two divine principles.

       I'm not sure I'm familiar with the work of john lamb, I'm bad with names. 
    Agreed on the divine principles. 
    Agreed that it's a "game". 
    I find common usage of certain terms as slang ("the game" "it's all good") 
   To be indicative of a greater expression trying to make itself known. 
    There is a plan, and though I'm uncertain if you agree, there is a plan to make it mainstream to subvert this greater plan. 
      Do you take interest in symbology, sacred geometry, or specifically the svadistka and the reversal of it as a symbol of control and technology?

       I am the same. 
   I take interest in all things occult, but am not a practitioner. 
   Most take up occult practice to gain power. 
    In my opinion, there is no need for power when a divine plan exists. 
     This would be my bullet point on mans attempt to subvert the greater plan. 
     I have no specifics over the divine plan, as I prefer to leave that to faith. 
     I do believe man currently exists in the majority in a place of fear, and hopes to create a plan, out of worry of chaos. 
   This, to me is a lack of acceptance of, and subversion of the divine plan, which allows for chaos. I interpret this to be clearly defined in genesis.

       How would you, as an observer, come to know what men are made into instruments of the divine, and which are not?
      </p>
      <p>
       I treat theories as quantum potentials. Though I have a chosen faith, I also admit that its prophecies could have been seeded by non-divine aliens or mankind itself when it has the capacity for time travel. The prophecy fulfillment is the point of interest, the originator is a myriad of potentials. I rank things in probability, and give opinions or statements coherent with what I find most probable.

       With every act of exploration into the hidden knowledge and history of mankind, you are altering your destiny. If you educate others, you alter the destiny of man potentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       My position is not one of neutrality, this is why I'm not going to be coherent with Buddhism and the like. I'm actually concerned that their spiritual practices do not lead to ascension, but to dissolution of self into constituent parts to be recycled. That's not what I plan to do with my eternity.

       If I could save man from evil without becoming it myself, if I had a real shot at it, I would take it.

       Spirit does what it wants, all are free, that includes our influence on the divine plan. We are accounted for. So that leaves me to question: What do I stand for?

       Study, and guidance. I have identified the subconscious as being either directly the holy spirit, or a conduit for the spirit to connect to us and communicate. I have been following its guidance for about two months now, but I have prior research in many fields over my lifetime. Nothing "speaks" to me, I have feelings and I follow them. That's after a lifetime of strict left brain thinking for decades.

       I became a bit erratic for weeks but had friends I could just say all my thoughts to. I did lose my mind for a time, a couple of times. If I did not have the support of a couple friends willing to listen, and the undying support of my wife who believes everything I tell her when I consider it truth, I may not have made it. Worse yet, I could have been medicated in a handicapped state and set to languish as a half awakened person. The stories that come from failed kundalini awakenings are really fucking tragic.

       You can acquire consent. You can do so overtly. Asking someone if they will listen, or accept help, is no wrong. If you have ill intent, that's another matter.

       It is my place to judge the actions of others by what I consider to serve mankinds good in the game. I do not export ideas or statements foolishly, but I will always stand up for what I believe in. This is becoming more true with time. When the world is very evidently changing due to conditions looming, I will bring all I know to all in my life who will listen. If you want to see what I'm about, it's blue ray, throat Chakra, archangel Michael, etc. There's many different names for the archetype.

       I will do the above sooner if I obtain manifest powers. It's actually not a strange idea to me now after all I've experienced. I was tested thoroughly, and at this point I believe I'm in a near constant state of hemisphere synchronization. I can access my subconscious directly, and even reprogram it. It's anologous to operating with two simultaneous trains of thought, but it's all "me".

       Spontaneous, slow onset and then sudden explosions in experience. I approached it with the concern that it may have been possession. I don't meditate, I found it masturbatory as it was very easy to induce pleasure (which I now see is actually a deeply meditative state). Since then I have been physiologically reacting to things. My subconscious can react to stimuli before they occur, it has a different perception of time than I do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Physical symptoms built for a while until I had a spontaneous NDE, nirvana, feeling and knowing God. After that was the synchronization of my brain. When that occurred is when it tried to subject me to fear as my spirit was not yet cleansed, I still had junk that it needed to throw on me. I rolled with it, didn't accept anything as fact, and knew I couldn't be harmed. The phase passed but I still have physical reactions to events in the world I know are ongoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see how it has shaped my life in some regards, some things going deep into my past. Time is simultaneous, changes in the present can affect the past as well as the future. This is as true for timelines as it is individuals.

       Smithsonian: Yes, they have been complicit. Much like academia at large and the NWO protocols to diminish the population. Science used to know its role regarding the spirit, but then came materialism. Materialism asserts that unless something can be proven, it is false. This is not in the spirit or definition of science. This is dictating world views, and using cradle to grave propaganda as well as a federally run public school system that likewise removes all spirituality. It makes aberrant product.
      </p>
      <p>
       Removing people from spirituality is a surefire way to be able to make the state, or to make your figureheads of science, politics, media, or Hollywood fill the role of God and prophet.

       Agreed. 100% 
    Spirit is infinite, in and creator of an infinite universe which superceeds the parameters which people have decided exist. 
    In infinity, possibility is infinite. 
     Seems to be the goal of man to control, which starts with controlling the paradigm, and in doing so, the limitations of mans spirit.

       Don't think it's population control. I've been involved in the "research chemicals" scene for about 20 years. At first it was novel new psychedelics that Shulgin had cooked up and published in TiHKAL and PiHKAL, then came a vast array of stimulants (McAffee was a big proponent of anally inserting MDPV). The past couple years and, to this day, you can somewhat legally buy fentanyl analogues from labs in China on the clearnet. The fent analogues are 1000x as potent as morphine. A kilo of H wholesales for around 50k. You can get a gram of a fent analogue very cheaply, mix it with 999 grams of inositol and Bam! you've got a kilo of "China White."
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the people mixing it aren't proficient in what they're doing leading to inevitable hotspots and fatalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm neither a user or advocate for heroin either, but now, especially, I'd advise staying away from it bc of this.

       Never found much use for research chems, though I have looked into the FMX groups, as well as the psychedelics.
