        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think about what slaves were.  What they did.  Who they did what they did for.</p>

<p>Slaves were owned by masters who used them as free labor to make themselves rich.  Was that labor actually free though?  Not really...</p>

<p>Slave owners still had to pay for thier slaves housing, clothing, and food.  Some might argue that the slaves had it better than some do today.  Guaranteed work, guaranteed shelter, guaranteed food and clothing.  Right?</p>

<p>Speaking of people today.  What about you?  How are you living?  Got a house? a car?  food on the table?  I hope so, but how do you have those things?  Oh, you have a job?  Who do you work for?  What do they do to make money?  hmmmm.  do you guys see where Im going with this?</p>

<p>Slavery still exists.  It wasnt abolished.  It evolved.  </p>

<p>Instead of living under our slave masters roof and eating his food we are given money to provide for ourselves, but is that freedom?  </p>

<p>Who makes all the money off of our hard work?  How many of us live at the poverty level?  How many struggle, suffer, and sacrafice just to get by while our owners make all the money?</p>

<p>What&#39;s worse than being a slave?  Not knowing you&#39;re one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh this is the dumbest shit I have heard in a long time. Yes many of us have to work for a living and do not have a choice if you choose to live in a populous location. Take your ass to the backwoods, go completely off the grid, and pay a minimal amount of taxes for your land for the safety the government has provided you.</p>

<p>There is a clear choice in your decision to go to work. If you don’t like your job take your ass to somewhere cheap, start growing your own food, collecting your own water, get a source of electricity if you would like. You will not be living like you’re in the 21st century but you will not be a slave to anyone.</p>

<p>Comparing working to slavery is idiotic at best and flat ignorance of slavery at worst. You actually said some would argue they had it better, some argue the earth is flat but you call them dumbasses and ignore their opinion due to the mountain of evidence stating otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, slavery was a hell beyond hell. I&#39;m pretty sure that even if you can&#39;t afford to quit your sucky retail job, your boss can&#39;t have you flayed if you don&#39;t sell enough clothes. Or ban you from reading / getting educated in your free time to try to better your situation. Or physically confine you to the mall grounds 24/7/365. Or sell off your children to the highest bidder, ensuring you&#39;ll never see them again...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. But if you&#39;ve ever run a farm, or tried to be super independent, or off-grid, you would know it&#39;s a lot more work (and expense) than you realize. And it&#39;s a lot less stable. One year of bad weather can ruin a whole crop and your income, putting you near starvation (if you didn&#39;t have access to bank loans), which is what happened just 100 years ago. Which is why many people choose to work for someone else. IMO this instability was one big reason people ran farms less and less and moved to the city for jobs. The city jobs were just more stable.</p>

<p>But do what you have to do. A creative person can use the system to their advantage and choose not be a victim of the system. It&#39;s not easy, it&#39;s really hard. But a few manage to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a freelance motion graphics artist (honestly it&#39;s hardly a job and I&#39;m actually one of the people creating the hypnotic images that seduce the public but that&#39;s a different matter) I work remotely from home and have the choice of which projects I choose. My last two projects have been PSAs about foreclosure and healthcare, and I took those on after quitting my job which sold million dollar apartments to rich people.  I make maybe half of what I did at my old job, but I feel a lot better about it and that makes everything else easier.  During my old job I&#39;d get home exhausted, angry at my situation, and would blow some cash on substances or go out and throw away what I just &quot;earned.&quot; Now I live much more peacefully and work at my pace with people I enjoy working with. Work = slavery because money is the ball and chain we can never remove, but some masters are nicer than others at least...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, slavery exists in many forms.</p>

<p>Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, “If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples, <strong>and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.</strong>” They answered him, “We are descendants of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any one. How is it that you say, ‘You will be made free’?”</p>

<p>Jesus answered them, <strong>“Truly, truly, I say to you, every one who commits sin is a slave to sin.</strong>The slave does not continue in the house for ever; the son continues for ever.  <strong>So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.</strong> I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.”</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>Damn straight, brother/sister, and it&#39;s a rude awakening once you figure it out. It gets even worse, once you look into what a &quot;citizen&quot; is, as well. There is a reason for the 13th and 14th amendment, and it was never for our benefit. It makes all of us debt slaves, to a quasi corporate-governmental &quot;entity&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still do you hear self? Do you know our political history or do you just stop at points the fit to you own psychosis? Pedophilia isn’t legal, the people who are indulging in pedophilia aren’t good people. You’re comparing apples to oranges at this point.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson wasn’t for the centralized bank, he wanted to break up the federal reserve. He was a fairly decent person who stood for more than decent beliefs, but he owned slaves. So you shut yourself off to the possibility of him being a decent human being. Do you know how he treated his slaves? Were you one of them?</p>

<p>Your entire hang up on the slave owning in which you weren’t apart paints you as trying to play a victim card to which your only association with is the conceived notion that you feel obligated to relate yourself to it because it’s you were taught as a kid. It was legal, it was a business, whose profiteers and benefactors were that of people of the same colored skin, it’s not justification it’s  a fact. </p>

<p>They were good people born in a different time. Take the good and leave the bad behind, at this point we are all slaves to the corporate capitalist greed of the world. We all have a common enemy who is subjugating us into perceived freedom so that they can reap the benefits. Between all the disinfo, false flags and proxy wars your main concern is slave owners from 200 years ago. The quote makes sense for the times.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m in my late 40s. I lived through different times and <strong>very</strong> different economies. I think the OP is referring to the fact that wages have not been keeping up with out-of-pocket expenses for nearly 20 years and this has put most Americans in a more financial precarious position than ever in the last 60 years. One survey found that most people (can&#39;t remember the exact number) cannot come up with $2000 cash for an emergency.</p>

<p>Back between 1945-1980 one could have just a high school degree, and get a high enough wage to get a fairly nice house. Now the house they can afford is cut in about half, or even less! 1945-1980 were unusual growth years for the US and now we are in a more typical economy, with wages low, and expenses high. The elements of the CPI has been manipulated to remove some items so much that it is now useless and no longer reflects reality.</p>

<p>OTOH people just won&#39;t admit they are bad at managing money. One can&#39;t manage money like it&#39;s 1970 anymore because the whole economy has changed quite a bit. There are fewer jobs, wages are not keeping up with expenses, and many employers require a person to have at least 2 years of experience to get a job, but they can&#39;t get that job to get any experience, because they don&#39;t have experience. It&#39;s a vicious circle.</p>

<p>The people who suffer the most are the lesser skilled, and the people who will not or cannot adapt for some reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. If there&#39;s any time to learn self sufficiency, it&#39;s now. You can save so much money if you know how to shop smart, cook, sew, woodwork, and do your own carpentry and home repairs. Even more if you can properly manage your finances and be smart in what job you get, and how you optimize your work hours and time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to live rich on little money, and that&#39;s by making your luxuries yourself. I can build a bed frame for $100 that would cost me $1000 from Pottery Barn. Cook a steak dinner for $30 that would cost $120. If I so desired, I could start my own herb and pepper garden in my backyard and not have to purchase spices and seasonings from the grocery store, and it&#39;d taste a lot better. </p>

<p>Becoming skilled in all these things will improve your life severely. If you see something, think &quot;Can I make that myself?&quot;. If you can, learn and do your research, and do it. The ability to create what you need from scratch is extremely empowering, and lesses your dependency on modern society. If you have to buy something, do your research, save your money, and purchase it from a reputable company that treats its employees ethically, as well as the environment. If you can&#39;t do that, buy used. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, it&#39;s called wage-slavery, more colloquially known as &quot;living paycheck to paycheck&quot;. This is a tough pill to swallow for most living in the US where the mythology of the rags to riches story is so central to the (deliberately manufactured) national identity.</p>

<p>Look at any developing country where they assemble products for consumption in the west and it becomes pretty clear. They <em>do</em> get paid, but they have no agency over their lives. We&#39;re the house workers, they&#39;re the field workers.</p>

<p>Edit: Just thought I&#39;d throw this in because it&#39;s a hot topic. I do not think that UBI, or getting paid without working is a solution to this problem. It&#39;s not that I think it would never work, but implemented tomorrow it would just exacerbate the problem; keep people consuming while eliminating their ownership/stock in society.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called wage slavery. The solution is worker owned business like co-ops. I&#39;d recommend looking into syndicalism as a good alternative to the current system. </p>

<p>Who said anything about not contributing to the system? It&#39;s not slavery because you have a say in how the business is run and what work you do. You also get to share all of the profits with other people who are working instead of sharing it with some slave master who does nothing but claim ownership. </p>

Learn the difference between what a privilege and a right is. They are no where close to the same. However that is all the federal government is allowing us, is a privilege.

    <div class="md"><p>I can still:
- start a business
- choose who I work for
- live where I want
- get an education of my choice
- say whatever I want
- get a fair trial
- vote
- defend myself
- quit a shitty job
- practice whatever religion I want
- not follow a religion
- own private property
- etc
Your point is a stupid argument people make all the time. Just because things cost money doesn’t mean you’re enslaved to a system. Everything costs something. To say I’m enslaved to money is like saying I’m enslaved to oxygen or water or food. Stop victimizing yourself and appreciate the freedom you have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slavery will always exist because low-skilled labor is always needed and there is always a supply of low class people.</p>

<p>To think everyone is meant to be an intellectual is the illusion that America imposes on society. Some people are meant to be slaves. Some are meant to be managers of slaves. </p>

<p>But it should NOT be based on birth. It should be based on qualification. The problem in America is that we say &quot;Everyone is qualified at birth&quot;</p>

<p>NO.</p>

<p>You are not qualified or disqualified because of birth. You are qualified based on your qualities. This egalitarian society is just a huge fantasy that we can all potentially be kings at the same time.</p>

<p>The fact is, we are all born without equality. And it is not birth that determines anything, but the choices we have made in the past that led to that birth, which leads to good or bad situations, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a black pill few people will swallow, but its the ultimate truth. I wouldn&#39;t go so far to say some people are meant to be <em>slaves</em>, that&#39;s a bit too sociopathic, but certainly some are best at following and leading simple lives, and others are best at leading and managing and pursuing higher visions.</p>

<p>Most people confuse this ideal meritocracy with oligarchy which is complete idiocy.</p>

<p>Have you pondered what happens when robots make low-skilled labor obsolete? What will happen to the simple people?</p>
