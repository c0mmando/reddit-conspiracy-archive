       I've searched, but still can't find a thorough, sourced, red pill list on Sandy Hook. I'm convinced, I've watched the docs but was kicked out of family Christmas for suggesting kids didn't die.

       Working with impatient CNN minds so an infographic, article, sourced comment is better than a long video.

       I second this!!  I was making some comment on Xmas about draining the swamp or something, and my mom did the "you don't even believe anyone died at that school."  Needless to say, I went Gene Rosen on her ass...  But seriously, I too could use a brief video or infographic to help with the red pill process.

       Not really. The entire incident was sketchy. Fishy even. Combined with the fact that there was a FEMA drill for children I disasters. Let me guess, you've literally done 0 research into this? Did you get this viewpoint when the media told you how horrible Alex Jones is? "Think of the children!!1!1" Seems like this likely psyop worked on you as intended.

       I've read everything that is out there on this issue. It's fucking stupid. Alex Jones is a fucking fruitcake, and nothing he says makes any sense.

       There was no psyop and there is no evidence of a psyop. None. Not a single piece of evidence. That's why I don't believe it.

       Since you have been so insistent, I listened to the audio you linked. I heard nothing suspicious. The dispatcher clearly does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       say that the incident was fake. As others have said, someone clearly says that there "is a rumor" that the incident is fake, but that is all.

       I just looked through it all and the words "fake" or "drill" were never said. I guess you can just claim its fake news. So please provide a source.

       Man. One operator say this to the other operator:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Jen, hang up. I need you to get off that phone. Alright Rick? . . . Rick?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Where does she say it is fake? Where does the operator say its a drill? They're literally on the phone with the head custodian (that's Rick) who called from inside the school.

       Got it, you continue to only read the transcript instead of listen to the audio yourself. Right. You have access to the audio but you continue to believe what others tell you instead of investigate for yourself. I have heard the audio. I heard her say fake. 1m53s

       Someone in the background says "There is a rumor that it is fake." How the fuck does that lead you to believe the whole think isn't real? Lol. God, you choose this and the car as your hills to die on? There are so many other weird things surrounding that event, yet you choose two of the most easily debunk-able things. Lazy.

       It's more about the fact she says it's fake and then immediately is berated loudly on a professional radio system. If it's so obviously not important and is no big deal that she said it's fake when they are discussing the Sandy Hook incident, why don't you go ahead and tell us what she meant by that. It's really easy right?

      <p>
       First, if you think its a big cover up then why would they leave that fucking audio in there?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, who berated her? The person that said "Hang up, get off that phone"? How do you know that the person that said "there's a rumor its fake" and the person being told to get off the phone is a different person? You don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, I think its perfectly rational to understand that Jen, if she was the person who said it might be fake, was probably on a phone call that was inconsequential during a time when the station was being bombarded with calls. Therefore, her services were needed elsewhere. Like answering the flood of phone calls that the station was getting.

Or the fact that he went to the front door with a camera system installed yet there has never been any photo or videos released of him approaching the front door.

       Do we have any proof that the camera was working? Also...not suspicious. Footage from a crime is not going to be released unless there is a reason to.

      <p>
       Why? The fact that there is a camera system but no picture or video is not suspicious. I wish I had a $100 for every case I've ever prosecuted where there was a camera in the building that was turned off or not working.
      </p>
      <p>
       So--none of that indicates conspiracy. That indicates someone borrowed or stole someone else's car and that a camera system or single camera wasn't working or the police just never released the footage, which is normal.

       your narrative actually supports my position that there was most likely a mass casualty incident going on at the boston marathon, because thats when and where mass casualty drills normally take place

       do you have any actual evidence that would convince a reasonable that the Tsarnaev's were guilty of any of the crimes they have been accused of?

       no, you are playing stupid, trying to ride a fine line between making mass casualty drills seem completely normal and expected at the boston marathon, but also trying to convince us that there wasn't one happening at this particular Boston Maraton, in spite of the incident being planned, and the plans even including the use of backpacks with explosives.

       its evidence that there was a mass casualty drill going on at the exact same time as the fake bombs were set off at the boston marathon

       even the american pyrotechnics association called bullshit on this fake bomb

       I'm not playing stupid. What you're saying makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It might make sense to you, but it makes no sense to me or most intelligent people. So if you want to argue it, fine, but
       <strong>
        you need to actually make a fucking argument and not throw a bunch of links on the page and tell people to put it together
       </strong>
       . That is your way of avoiding making claims, and therefore avoiding accountability. Your entire method of argument is designed to escape scrutiny, and I'm afraid you picked the wrong target for that nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is precisely nothing suspicious about Serino--a Boston native--being present at the race. If you want to argue it is suspicious, then you need to explain why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you're incapable of creating an organized argument, we're just doing this one thing at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Explain why Serino being at that finish line was suspicious.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And I will cut off a few threads immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       His job is irrelevant, and does not make him being there suspicious.

      <p>
       Go.

       Fair enough, I have not seen information debunking this. But instead of having to look it up myself you could have easily linked to information debunking my assertion, instead of spending your time typing insults. As usual, I did the work and I was wrong, the license plate ending in Yeo does appear to belong to Lanza's mother. Doesn't explain a lot of other things, but at least that part is cleared up.

       Dude, we were having two separate discussions here. One about the car, and one about the police call. Both of my original comments to you about those topics were immediately downvoted to zero by you. I don't know why you made the assumption that I think you're following me around, as I already acknowledged that I know you aren't. Because I replied to you. Which would ping you. Which wouldn't require you to do any following.

       That is a thought terminating cliche. It's funny that someone who should supposedly care about truth is resorting to thought terminating cliches. Rofl.

       But you don't care about truth, as I stated. And no, I didn't look at your video. My link previewer shows a kid's show, and I'm not a child.

       The point of this article is to discuss disaster readiness. The article is trying to show the police in a good light--showing that they are preparing for these sorts of things. It's meant to be reassuring and calming.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a typical sort of news item you see after disasters like this. It's supposed to make people feel good (which sells--it's infotainment).
      </p>
      <p>
       I see nothing suspicious in this article. It seems like a typical feel-good piece that you see written all the time after a major attack like this.

       in the 2nd pic we have a screen shot of the FEMA profile page for Deputy Director Richard Serino, where they talk about him doing 35 mass casualty drills, including drills at the Boston Marathon
      </p>
      <p>
       his FEMA page was quickly scrubbed after Boston Marathon bombing but fortunately it was archived before it disappeared

       lets see:
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Serino has long history of being incident commander at mass casualty incidents, and specifically at the Boston Marathon
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Serino was placed at the Boston Marathon finish line before and after the bombs went off

      <p>
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/w7zf6r3x8rsy.png">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       they had already planned a mass casualty drill which include the use of backpacks filled with explosives
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/rm5i7yi3pn401.png">

       we know resources were deployed to the Boston Marathon prior to the bombing

      </p>
      <p>
       what was Richard Serino doing at the Boston Marathon finish line April 15, 2013 if not a mass casualty drill?

       None of that adds up to anything. It's not even indicative of anything suspicious or pre-planned.

       so, as a professional evidence analyst
      </p>
      <p>
       what do you suppose FEMA deputy administrator Richard Serino was actually doing at the Boston Marathon finish line, at the same time as other agencies resources were also deployed to the Boston Marathon area?
      </p>
      <p>
       was Richard Serino innocently having a beer, celebrating a non-Federal holiday, watching also-rans finish the Boston Marathon,
      </p>
      <p>
       and also inexplicably NOT doing a planned mass casualty event, as he had in previous years?
      </p>
      <p>
       or was Richard Serino actually on-the-job, as a Federal employee, doing his job as incident commander for a mass casualty drill, as he had in previous years?

       So, having discussed this with you and learned what the key points seem to be for you...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you do an FOIA request for 1) the Lietenant's logbook for that precinct and 2) any email with the word "drill" for the 2 weeks leading up to the marathon?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is standard procedure to inform the police if you are running a drill. Also, it is standard procedure for the supervisor (a Lt.) to mark in their logbook that a drill took place, who ran the drill, what time it started, what time it ended, and what time a verifying officer gave the all clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea how much those will cost. The logbook for the day will be cheap relatively. The emails may cost more.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you really want to prove there is a drill, just do an FOIA request for those items.

       You know, this is a great example of why you should learn to rely on evidence. If you had some, you could actually stand a chance here. But you have none, and so you have to hide behind a thin excuse of "I have it, but I'm just not going to tell you."
      </p>

       That stopped working on the playground. If you have evidence, supply it.

      <p>
       So far, I've done nothing but express skepticism. That's hardly a claim to be all knowing.

       really? you don't think the people in the photo know that they are being photographed, in spite of a cameraman being crouched in front of them pointing a camera at them? do people usually stand around looking off into space while photographers invade their personal space?

       you can't exactly say "cheese" for a photo of this gravity

      <p>
       so what did the photographer say to them?

      <p>
       ok mom, here, hold this photograph and look off into space and pretend like you don't see me or that you are aware that your picture is being taken
      </p>
      <p>
       and dad, you look off into space in another direction, so that its obvious that there is nothing interesting enough for both of you to be looking at, while you pretend to be ignoring me

       I could grant you all of those things as true, and it doesn't make it staged...have you ever been around photographers? They are taking pictures constantly.

       Probably nothing at all. Photographers are usually snapping pictures in rapid, silent shutter mode with telescopic lenses. They usually are sitting in a group, so they are out of the way but so they can get their pictures. This looks like they were getting ready for a broadcast of some sort. Maybe an interview with the media.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Skip to the 1 minute mark. That's what photographers are normally doing. This looks like a candid shot taken by a kneeling photographer with a telescopic lens (you can tell that by the flatness of the picture).

       Yes, I've considered it. It's irrelevant. Whether that is happening or not, evidence analysis and the law of parsimony remain the only valid method of researching claims even if that is true. In fact, they remain such
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       it is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again, there is nothing in that photo that is suspicious. If there was evidence that it was suspicious, we wouldn't be having a discussion about void spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put simply: if it is true that I am projecting my own assumptions into a void space, that means that there is a void space, and if there is a void space, that means there is no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, please explain what is suspicious about that photo in 50 words or less real fast. What about it seems off to you?

       Yeah, not buying that happened. So far, his "side" seemed more convincing than yours. BUT, you are here and he is not, which means you are going to have that home field advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus far, that formation appears natural to me, and it appears natural to experts who have talked about it. And holes like this aren't always filled. Filling costs money. You only fill if you need to. the fact that it was empty and the fact that the towers stood just fine seems to indicate that it didn't need to be filled.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, convince me. I'm open to hearing you. But so far, I see nothing that would indicate that that is not natural.

       if you are going to be building a heavy structure, typically you will dig down to at least below the frost line, to prevent heaving
      </p>
      <p>
       also, typically the bigger and heavier a building is, the more they will excavate, so while a house may have a one story basement, a skyscraper may have a 10 story basement
      </p>

       also, typically if you are going to be building a big, heavy building, you will excavate down to the bedrock if possible, to start from a nice solid base

       you may remember the parable about the man who built his house upon the sand?

       No. That does not logically follow. You're skipping steps.

       Premise 1: Skyscrapers usually excavate down to bedrock.
Premise 2: The pothole was in a structurally significant position.
Premise 3: The pothole was not filled in.
Premise 4: Potholes like this would normally be filled in.

       Premise 5 is simply wrong. Nukes of any size would not make the ground warm for months. That is simply not true.

       Wrong. That rock does not appear molten. I claimed that it appears natural. I don't need evidence to make that claim: rock being natural is the default unless shown otherwise.

      <p>
       There is doubt. That doesn't look molten to me. It looks like ice-weathered rock, which is what all the experts I've read have said. And as for why they would not fill in the pot hole, I've answered that already.  Filling it costs money. That means that unless there was a reason to do so, they wouldn't do it. That means that the empty pothole is the default assumption sans other evidence.

       Those are what we're dealing with. Let's take them one at a time. I added #7, and we know that #5 is false to begin with. That is fine, it's not critical to your argument, so your argument endures regardless of that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take this one at a time. Let's start with 1. That one I don't find unlikely, and indeed a quick search supports it.

      </p>
      <p>
       So, premise 1 is verified.  We can move one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can find no evidence for premise 2. Perhaps you can show me evidence that indicates that this pot hole was in a critical location.

       Exactly - it's shocking what gets accepted as "evidence" here. People severely underappreciate the skills, processes and science that professional investigators learn and use. My brother in law works in the police investigating syndicates and the way they work is far more complex than people give them credit for.

       I agree with you although I don't mind looking into it and having an open mind. It becomes a problem when everyone is so damn convinced becuase of some half assed "evidence" of parents smiling, or porta pottys. They won't look at things like that parent who used to be a conspiracy theorist until he saw what happens when people start creating these theories and now people are accusing him of being an actor. It's quite sad really that these same people who are all for "open mindedness" are never open to the idea that this might have actually happened.

       There is in fact. This comment alone is enough for me to assume you to be the caricature you insist you are not. It's foolish, arrogant, and dismissive. I would give you a video to watch, but like everyone else who says this, they never watch it. I would also offer all the inconsistencies as well, but as many who make your claim will refute each and every one as coincidence. I would point out Gene's prep video, the dad smiling at a press conference, the overhead chopper footage, so on and so on goes all the nonsense involved in trying to tell the story and stick to a narrative that has been picked clean apart. So for you to so arrogantly sit there and write that there is ZERO evidence shows me that you have done ZERO research in to the subject and are simply trying to sandbag this entire conversation regarding the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is zero evidence to show that it happened. Show me the dead kids, adam lanza, and his mother and we'll begin talking further.

       However I feel like you are going to play a game of word association, because you want EVIDENCE that it is a hoax. That's what you will rest on, I know it's coming, so i will save you from that by saying EXPLAIN the inconsistencies.
      </p>

       Also by using your game of word association, you show me EVIDENCE that it happened, start with by showing me the pictures of the dead bodies...

       Negative. I don't have to explain anything. The burden of proof is not might. That's not how this works.

       Again, that is not a burden I have to meet. I don't have to prove it was real. You have to prove it was a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. The fact that this was a real disaster is the default position. It is true until
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       prove otherwise.  I don't have to prove it really happened. You have to prove it didn't. It's a one way street.

       I'm heading to bed. I will save this post and head through it in the morning. It should be short work. A short look at it shows that most of what you posted has already been debunked (e.g., the facebook page listed as #1 never happened--it was fake).

       Weakness in debate is when someone refutes a claim with a claim and then cries for burden of proof without showing their own burden of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not playing a game of verbal gymnastics. You have nothing to stand on regarding your claim other than to cry "NU UH!"

I provided you the evidence that creates the conspiracy and you could only respond by saying that all the discrepancies are explainable.

       I debunked the first question. I haven't gotten to the rest. Don't worry. I will when i have the time. I'm probably going to do one section a day, to drag your humiliation out over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, number 2 on that list:
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a standard, normal, typical, happens every day, inaccurate google time stamp caused (most likely) by incorrect metadata.

      <p>
       The same applies to #3 on the list--it's just another google timestamp error.

      <h1>
       4 is easy. He just fucking started the fund. I recently had a friend who died. I started the fund for his wife and kids within 30 minutes of receiving the phone call. Not hard.
      </h1>
      <h1>
       5 is easy. People move into new areas all the time. There is nothing suspicious about people moving into a neighborhood.

       6, the script

       LOL you linked huff post. Get the fuck out of here.

      <p>
       You did not debunk the first question.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (e.g., the facebook page listed as #1 never happened--it was fake). It is most likely that someone took an already existing and unused facebook group and renamed / repurposed it.

      <p>
       That is not a fact, you are speculating.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, not a fact, you are speculating. A billion dollar corporation have bad meta data and a time stamp when it's 99.9% in fallible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with your answer for #3, you don't provide a fact to a bad timestamp, only speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for #4, I came to the same conclusion, it's still very shady for a bank manager to be the first one on it. This is probably one of my least concerns on the list, congrats, you found one you could "debunk" with a logical explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are speculating again on number 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       You page debunking number six omits a lot of detail. Also the person who wrote it up debunking it does not explain how the written time stamp reports don't match the video timestamps. I guess in your case you just don't think timestamps are accurate do you? Your dunking page is a load of bullshit, they were picking and choosing what help drives the narrative. Did you find that page from a google search? You probably did.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far you did not debunk anything, I am not squirming, because you have offered no facts, only speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proof of you not doing any research over this and not reading any official documents if glaring at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh how I eagerly await you next round of speculation.

       That google timemarks are not valid is a fact. It is speculating to say it was accurate here.

       Wrong. The list you gave me is speculation. I gave not only reasonable, but most probable, explanations for all of the issues to show that none of them are suspicious, and have very simple, common explanations.

      <p>
       1-6 are debunked. If you are going to claim otherwise at this point, the burden of proof is over to you. I showed that they are debunked and gave evidence for each one of them. None of them is speculation. They are all verified facts. Google timestamps are not accuarte. That is a fact. I proved it. The man handling the aid is normal and not suspicious. That is a fact. I proved it. People moving into a neighborhood is normal and not suspicious. That is a fact. I proved it. The script is bullshit. It is continuously wrong from point to point. And further, there is no evidence to prove that it existed prior to the event. There is no evidence it is a real document. As it stands, it is a document that did not appear until after the fact and it is full of errors, which I've proven. In terms of probabilistic explanation based on current evidence, it is orders of magnitude more likely that the script was a forgery by Halbig, and a poor forgery at that. The script is bullshit. That is a fact. I proved it.

      <p>
       "Is the cheese on the moon green or blue?"
      </p>
      <p>
       That question makes the claim that there is cheese on the moon. Questions make claims, make arguments, make implications, and make thesis statements.  In fact, a question is called a thesis. A thesis statement is the answer to a thesis (aka, question).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why was a Facebook webpage for the alleged dead teacher Victoria Soto of Sandy Hook Elementary School posted before the event occurred?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is the first question. That question makes the claim that that page was created before the event happened. It is speculating that that is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is not evidence that it is true. The only evidence is a FB timestamp, and
       <strong>
        I have proven that a facebook timestamp does not prove when a named group is created
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This question makes two claims.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Facebook time-stamps prove when groups are made.
       </li>
       <li>
        The facebook time-stamp shows this group predates the attack.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Based on these premises, the following conclusion is reached.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Because FB time-stamps prove when a group is made, and because the the time-stamp for this group predates the attack, this proves that the FB page was made before the attack.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I proved, beyond any dispute, that that time stamp does not mean anything. That means that means that premise 1 above is not true, and that means that there is no evidence to support the conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, 1 is debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing above is speculated. It is all verified fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only speculation that exists is "despite time stamps not being an indicator of when a named group is created, I believe that in this case the time stamp is correct."
      </p>
      <p>
       That is your speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, 1 remains debunked until you come up with a new argument.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I can't take you seriously, especially when you claim failing timestamps with no proof, then call it proof and fact.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I proved with evidence that timestamps are not accurate. And because they are not accurate, they cannot be used as evidence. That is proven. I used evidence. If you wan to argue against that claim, then you need to do so. You don't get to just keep claiming that time stamps are valid when I've proven with evidence that you can check yourself that they are not accurate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       We're not to that yet. You still haven't gotten past 1-6. So far they all stand debunked. You disagree. You need to prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hangup at the moment is 1-3. I've proven that the timestamps are meaningless. Either you give up 1-3 and we move on (after all, you have 30 left), or you need to prove that the timestamps should be considered reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've proven that 4 is nothing. You've agreed. So we're down to 32.
      </p>
      <p>
       You haven't gotten to 5 yet, but that is not one you will win.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 will be a long argument I think. We'll take it when we get to it though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, let's focus on 1-5.  You've conceded 4, so really, 1-3 and 5. Before we can proceed, you must defend the following arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Despite
       <a href="/u/nologicjustpathos">
        /u/nologicjustpathos
       </a>
       having proven that the timestamps on FB and google are notoriously unreliable, the timestamps in this case should be trusted because of
       <strong>
        X
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, you have to provide
       <strong>
        X
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       2) It is unusual for families to move into a neighborhood OR into neighborhood
       <strong>
        Y
       </strong>
       in manner
       <strong>
        Z
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You of course choose Y and Z.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you cannot defend those arguments, then you cannot sustain 1-3 or 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please again, no more than 50 words for argument 1 or 2 (excluding links, etc.).

You have to go WAAAAY out of you way to fake a timestamp, and for a timestamp to fail, you are talking about a serious hardware failure or a failing code, which would create a huge slew of failed timestamps. It cannot be correlated to that day they were claimed to be created. There are no other existing timestamp errors from that day on google or facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess since a redditor told you that makes it a fact. If you don't have experience in what I am talking about, you have no experience, and someone claiming unreliability is lying. Bottom line, there's no debating it away, they are lying. Errors occur, this is given with technology, however the percentage of failure is incredibly low.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point you are just rehashing your insistence that you are not speculating to garner favor to your points. You have not disproved anything so far, you have a long way to go down the list and if you are going to just circlejerk over your claims without going through the rest of the list, and also watch the video, then I can see where this entire thing is headed and I am just not interested in your opinion. I am only interested in fact, and you have yet to provide a single that that as you claim, destroys everyone on this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can claim how much your facts are verified, this doesn't make it a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see how desperately you want to be right, it's quite sad. You are desperately are trying to push the official narrative, and it's sad. You want to desperately deny any and all inconsistencies, and that too is very sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder, how long did it take you before you believed that 9/11 was not an actual terrorist attack and was a controlled demo?

       Focus on Boston Bombing it is way easier to see/show. Sandy hook research is a dead end imo. I am not so sure anymore what happened there. It was a cover up but of what I don't know. It is interesting for people who like to go down rabbit holes but hard to convince people something was covered up. I trust Fetzer about as far as I can throw him. His pdf got a lot of stuff wrong, his claims of Carver being at the school prior to the shooting are easily debunked if you have watched all the shadow analyses videos.

       Some stuff to look into with SH.  Purple van with priests and nun(costume) BOLO, poorly photoshopped images of many of the children like Ben Wheeler and well the entire Parker family as well as Viki Soto, Green screen at firehouse, pedophile and meth head priests at st rose of lima, Gene Rosin or his doppleganger photographed at a fema event, Google and Bing cache of united way charity page, Dawn Hochsprung writing a Newtown Bee article from the grave and Newtown police dept selling coke, steroids and weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Youtube channel Aryan Empires's Reich watch videos. That guy has read and done videos on an impressive amount of documents in relation to SH. His research makes me question some of the more mainstream SH theories.

       look again at the video of the woods, the two exercise observers on the left watching the action.
      </p>
      <p>
       the Newtown cops (first responders not CT state troopers) also chased past that opened shed that morning, the day before (12/13/12 afternoon) the CT state troopers had opened that shed for the aerial footage.

       ditto the pizza being photographed being delivered to the fire people on the 13th.

       Any possible link to the Capstone Drill &amp; SHES is likely long dead and buried, along with the fact that the entire building was leveled, so any physical evidence from the crime scene is long gone.

       The other mass shootings that took place during Obama's second-term are what you want to focus on.  And then...they suddenly pretty much stopped in 2017, outside of the major one in Vegas, which is clearly not what we're being told.

       I can personally vouch that not all school things are online, as I work in a school. This can be due to many reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Laziness on the part whoever runs the school website (or being busy, cause if you have a kid you know how much unplanned shit can happen)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Privacy for the kids
      </p>
      <p>
       3) No need to be advertised/shown. We don't have choir boosters at our school.

       im leaning more toward the idea that the choir never actually existed except for the strange appearance at the Super Bowl

       Wow. So you think that, not only are the police, parents, doctors, school officials, neighbors, dentists, family friends, relatives, etc. complicit in faking this event, but the children are as well? That’s a pretty big stretch.

       after the Sandy Hook fake shooting happened, a bunch of kids showed up to sing in a choir at the Super Bowl, in front of the whole world, perhaps as a proof-of-life idk
      </p>
      <p>
       but the kids at the Super Bowl were aged a few years older than the kids who were allegedly killed at Sandy Hook, leading people to believe that the supposed victims were prepared well in advance, their pictures taken, and the kids allowed to age a few years, to later help hide them in plain sight, in places like the Super Bowl.

       There are tons of photos of blood. Maybe spend 1 minute of research instead of spouting nonsense? Funny how little hoaxers research - because any amount of it quickly proves how much BS they were fed

       5th deadliest mass shooting in US history and out of all the scene photos linked there is only one small spot you actually see blood.  what?  all the 'splatter' references in the article you linked is clearly just small nicks in the ceiling, that is not blood. i see why people are concerned or skeptical with the evidence presented on top of all the weirdness regarding the parents, newtown, shoddy timeline, aggressive gun control remarks, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       ask yourself what you've actually seen, not what story they want you to build in your head.  it definitely does not look like a small boy killed 27 people in 8 minutes in those photos

       Uh, try looking more carefully. Thats not the blood. If you had even looked at the few specified photos, you'd know the blood is on the orange/red-bordered paper taped to the wall.

       Look. Do you really think your family is going to be convinced by an "infographic" that contains a bunch of pictures and words thrown together with innuendo? Assuming your family doesn't believe that no one died--which is reasonable . . . --and you want to convince them otherwise, you need to show them actual proof, and somehow convince them that every single person who claims to have had a family member die, or know someone that died, is lying.

       Bingo. I'm a skeptic to lurks here because--let's face it....loony as they are, sometimes the conspiracy nuts are right. MK Ultra was real. Area 51 was real, and it had some really crazy shit (although not aliens).

       But this conspiracy is bonkers.

       what if I told you that kids did die, but the fbi threw in extra fake kids to boost the number and lied about what guns did the killing to further push their anti-gun agenda?  Would you have an easier time believing that?  I'm seriously asking, not trying to be an ass

       What the fuck? You can't just throw fake deaths in with real ones. It's a small town and a small school where everyone knew each other, there is no fucking way a parent of a child who was actually murdered would be okay with "some fake child murders being added in"

       You sir are not very well thought out. No one is "barred" from examining Sandy Hill, isn't that exactly what we are doing now? Do you expect the FBI to release all their info to you so you can become a detective and bother the families of dead children.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could they not know the numbers are inflated? You have no idea who knew who so stop assuming. I went to a school that had 300 people from K to 12 and I know every single one of them still. My grad class had 25 people. You are talking out of your ass about a place you don't know. You don't think that if they threw actors in the real parents would wonder who the fuck these new people are?

       Hahaha it's always the people with absolutely 0 real argument that go after punctuation and spelling mistakes. The absolute lamest argument on the Internet and I'm actually a little shocked that's what you chose to use. But of course you are from there and knew Adam Lanza, there's always someone in this small ass sub from one of those hick ass towns that claim they knew someone who was affected. So in the whole area of 11,000 people, you saw Adam Lanza, remember seeing him for some reason, and still think the parents of school children wouldn't know the other parents in the school? Can you reach anymore? And you know the cops who were first on scene? Oh well of course you do. My uncle works at Sony and just sent me a PS5.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are so friendly with all of these first on the scene police, why don't you have any extra info? Not many people make the huge claim that they know the first cops on the scene. I'm pretty sure they would ALL know an exact body count, and being small town cops and knowing the families why would every single one go along with a fake story about child deaths in their town?

       trust me, i'm not one that goes after punctuation or spelling mistakes...i make a ton of my own.  You got the name of the subject wrong...you didnt spell it wrong, you got the name wrong.  That would be like you trying to school me on "coke" being better than pepsi and calling it sprite.  How does someone that knows what they are talking about get that mixed up?  They dont...
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, my story has been the same on here. I dont care if you believe it or not that wasn't my intention.  The point was that you dont know what you're talking about but are pretending that you do.  You clearly dont though.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, back to the topic.  The records are sealed.  We get what they tell us regardless of if its true or not.  We never got to see photos of the classroom, the guns, lanza, the kids, autopsy reports, police recordings..nothing.  That is enough to know something is afoot.  My own personal stuff doesnt matter.  What I just said is enough.

       Yes my phone auto corrected Sandy Hook to Sandy Hill because there is a town near me that I've typed alot more than Sandy Hook and my account is only a month old. Must mean I'm a shill or a bot or a Trump supporter or something else you can conjure up from literally 0 facts.

       Can you please show me a mass shooting where the police have given out all of their investigations, crime photos, statements and whatever else to the public? I'll wait patiently but I already know there is no precedent for that so it's such a ridiculous argument to use.

       So I'm correct that you cannot show another mass murder where all the things you are saying were released essentially making your entire argument based on something you can't prove or defend ad there is no precedent where it has happened before.

       You have been asking for crime scene photos and autopsy reports and pictures of children's dead bodies. You didn't even come CLOSE to proving me wrong, the only thing you proved is that you can't stay on point with an argument. You've been all over the place and can't answer my one question, which other mass murder in history has released all the info you are asking for to the public. Absolutely none. You are arguing in circles and I feel you're not nearly as intelligent as you try to front.

       This line of thinking always leads me to the question...WHY?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would it not be far easier to have someone (in one way or another or another) carry out such a heinous act and use it to further whatever agenda it ends up getting hitched to, rather than totally fabricate/hoax/fake whatever is being hypothesized, and have to rely on dozens (or even hundreds) of people to keep quiet, and comply with the fakery?

       You're literally doing the thing people are talking about. You're shifting the burden of proof instead of providing proof for an outrageous claim. I don't care what anyone believes, the burden of proof in this case is clearly on the side of people who think it was all a hoax. I'd love to see some proof, but this kind of proof shifting or "look for yourself" is all I ever hear. Which it's why it's easy for most people to instantly dismiss any claim that it's a hoax. Because their desire to believe it's a hoax seems to be far greater than the ability to provide evidence.

       What would convince you? Someone saying they know someone who died doesn't convince you. A parent on TV saying their child died doesn't convince you. Would a death certificate convince you? I doubt it--you'd just say it was a fraud. So tell us what your burden of proof is.

       better yet, why not find obituaries at the Newtown Bee?

      <p>
       well this particular detail about the obituaries is a bit obscure, and you will probably not hear anyone mention it outside of this thread, which is why you were probably taken aback by the argument
      </p>
      <p>
       i actually used to believe that the sandy hook shooting was real, and didn't question it too much
      </p>
      <p>
       but then the boston marathon bombing happened and that was obviously fake
      </p>
      <p>
       and the some of the same crisis actors started showing up at different events
      </p>
      <p>
       one "false witness" showed up in 3 different places, and her acting skills are very bad

      <p>
       Ok. So here's the thing, purely in the interest of clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say 'fake', you are referring to the fact that at Sandy Hook (and other such far-to-common false flag violent events), people weren't killed, and it was purely a fabrication, acted out like an avant-garde theatre piece, packaged with a bow, and delivered up by Anderson Cooper, yeah?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, i disagree with you there, and i'll come back to that, but i don't contest your right to believe it (of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where i think we can agree;
      </p>
      <p>
       You referenced other events, and generally believe in a massive shadowy corporo-military-industrial-mass-media-complex that behind the scenes is controlling/exploiting/doing/faking (as a single example of many and more) these ever-frequent displays of grandiose violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this is a tiny shred of the explanation of all the global connections of something we might as well refer to as the 'New World Order,' only because many in the moderately-recent past have accurately foretold what was to come and they oft referred to it as such. We are seeing it manifest now more than ever. They are getting sloppier and less shadowed by the day, and are throwing our world into chaos with a specific purpose -- to have dominion over our hearts and minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly believe that there are some startling similarities in many of these cases (the aforementioned Boston event, the Colorado Theatre Shooting, etc) in the way that they are presented, packaged, swiftly swept under the rug of our collective saturated media feedback-loops. I could go on forever. That's why were here, in the conspiracy sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, we see the same enemy. However, one of the tactics i've seen used over and over again, and far more frequently as our world has evolved into this hyper-connected, post-modern social hellscape is on display here, coming from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, i won't claim to know if you are directly and deliberately steering these conversations down these obscure and twisted rabbit-holes with the specific intention of pulling the wool over others' eyes distracting them from the ever-reaching scale of the current political/socioeconomic/etc landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor will i say with confidence that your nitpicking and misdirected focus on small details of specific events is more of a compulsion, because the powers that be have deliberately led
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       (and others) there, with the same intentions and result of distracting the rest of us and keeping our focus within a severely limited spectrum, while
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are gallivanting around scorching the earth, hoarding the wealth, and pillaging resources to prepare for the coming collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, whether you personally believe that people died or not shouldn't logically be the topic of discussion. It's this alone that leaves me suspect to your intentions. I've believed for years (i've been here quite a long time, on sequential accounts) that the cry of 'SHILL!' is far too common (now more than ever) on this board, and often comes with no explanation other than a disagreement, more often than not on small details of specific events that, in the grand scheme, are irrelevant. However, it's hard for me to feel like i couldn't make a good argument for that very declaration.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true, critical argument lies on an entire dimension higher than the 2D eternity of these disputes. We need to be exploring our common held beliefs, and i posit that they exist in a 3 dimensional universe. The shadowy, 'NWO', 'illuminati' (whatever you want to call it) exists. They are fighting harder than ever in a war for our minds, attention, vulnerabilities, souls.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must stop this descent into madness. The absolute best weapon TPTB have in this war is their ability to keep us squabbling over crudely drawn lines. So long we remain under their boot shaking fists at each other, we will never see who really weighs heaviest on the scales of modern society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our numbers will never be realized. Our common goal of exposing, stopping, spreading awareness, WHATEVER of those that would exploit, control, deceive, MURDER us to further their goals of absolute totalitarian rule, maintain the integrity of their hierarchy of absolute violence, and distract us from the fact that none of us are getting tickets to the Denver Airport doomsday bunker when they decide to start firing nukes at each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Sandy Hook another in a long list of suspicious PSYchological OPerationS of the powers that be? Absolutely. We could go deep into every event, and find a million little connections, deliberately false COunterINTELligence PROgramming, etc. But what is common about them, who is ultimately perpetrating these operations, who is benefiting, how, and why? These are the questions we need to be exploring.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you may believe in your heart that Sandy Hook (and possibly others) was merely an act of theatre, with no victims. I would suggest that you don't scream that at people who believe that kids died. I know this could be spun out of context to sound almost preposterous, but honestly the event, 'real' victims or not, is used in THE EXACT SAME MANNER, regardless of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you can see how, for those people who believe real bullets tore through the real flesh of real children that day, might mistake this barrage of an ultimately irrelevant argument as a deliberate method of keeping the conversation on specifically mega-obscure singular points of contention. To further the agenda of, AT ALL COSTS, impeding the ability of the common, working class, ninety-nine percent of us uniting against them in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's actually up to you, what other people believe in the end. Are you working for them, and is this on purpose (kids died)? Or have you been led down this path following the dangling carrot of sanctimony (there weren't victims)? It doesn't matter either way, you are a shill, or you have been misled deliberately by those that would have you distracted. It's up to you, really.

       of course this creates a conflict because i prefer not to assume people are stupid, but the alternative is that they are a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       but then again, its hard to believe that some people can be so stupid as to how they process facts, data, evidence, etc that you almost have to assume they are just pretending to be stupid. again, the alternative is shill

       Obituaries routinely have small changes from site to site. It seems like I found an example of something that goes against your narrative, so now you have to switch your narrative. You said, "find me an obit that isn't written or copyrighted by the AP" and I did.

       No it doesn't. That "obit" is clearly different and actually quotes the original obit written by the family.

       I don't see your point about "plagiarizing." It's an obituary.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the original, what do you mean? The obit would have been printed in dozens of newspapers over the course of several days, with various changes added by the different newspapers.

       they insert these little clues to mock the masses,

      <p>
       and perhaps as some sort of psychological trick where people think the opposite of what you say, for example heres some things that fake witnesses will say

       Not unheard of as coping mechanism. There are quite some studies about it and if you have some life experience you would know that people behave a lot really awkward when processing something horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean if he was an actor I somehow doubt that he would fail to do his job right then when it counts, even though he knows exactly that cameras are there.

       However if the conspiracy theory is that someone did this to cover up something then they would hire some actors, right? However that goes rightly against what we just saw: someone behaving seemingly totally irrational in probably the most extreme situation of his life. An actor would stay in persona. Even a mediocre actor would be able to do that.

       no, the conspiracy theory is that they were crisis actors from the get go, not people brought in after the fact to hide something.

       Good actors go to Hollywood. Mediocre actors become crisis actors. if these crisis actors had any real acting talent, they would be on Broadway or Hollywood, not pretending to be grieving parents at a fake shooting

       You dont need to be a talented actor to be a what you call a "crisis actor". As I said even a mediocre actor can do that. Its the fundamental of his job. Furthermore the assumption that all good actors end up in broadway or hollywood is ridiculous. There are a shit ton of actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just makes no sense that this conspiracy theory revolves around some huge cover-up that if real, needed several hundreads of thousands if not million bucks. But then of course they are gonna pick the one actor that cannot stop smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think its a huge cover up you need to give them some credit. Otherwise you are just cherrypicking in order to believe a fantasy.

       so still a shit ton? And with all that money you think its plausible that they find that one actor that doesnt even understand the fundamental of his job? t makes no sense to me how one can think that this is a super organised conspiracy but then somehow fail massively on the simplest part of the job.

       Its not about having too much money. Its about either believing this is a full-scale conspiracy but then you also got to give them some credit. It just makes no sense to believe they undergo this huge operation but then fail at the easy step. After all this isnt just failing at his job. This would ne straightout not doing his job. Not doing the preparation in any kind. Furthermore also this press conference would be organized. Dont you think there would be an organizer to tell him: htey get in persona?

       Again you just give nobody else credit, but somehow think you are more educated on this stuff. Thousands of people have come into contact with this subject. Thousands of educated people who really know about this stuff and are obsessed with it. Yet you, who for sure has no educational background in this, are the one that uncovers this with some of the most basic law of physics.

       You cant think people are supermind, orchestrating conspiracies in plain field but then fail at the basics.

       You said its a hoax with the goal to make americans dumber. I still dont realize how that would work, but thats quite the definition of a conspiracy. But its right: as of now its just a conspiracy theory at best. I mean taking irrational human behaviour in an extreme situation as facts... come on.

       whataboutism at its best. I dont say actors are unfailable. However if you assume this is a thoroughly planned show there obviously went a lot of ressources into it. And if thats the case then mistakes are quite rare - they can happen, very rare though. On the other hand you have studies or life experiences of people in unfamiliar or extreme situations acting irrationally. I think we both know which case is more likely. So taking this as an evidence for smth is absurd.

       Do you think they didnt know that there were cameras right there in his face? See thats the problem. On one hand you think its a big hoax, that obviously needed carefully planning, but on the other hand you act like they are stupid dorks. Choose.

       No I said that one would have told him to fucking get in persona and he would stay in persona from then on. He wouldnt break out just right before delivering his lines.

       yes, this is a well known phenomenon thats been going on for generations

       pay attention here this next part is important:

        the Chicago Tribune opined, "it would be more tactful to say that some members of the radio audience are a trifle retarded mentally, and that many a program is prepared for their consumption."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       those members of the audience who are mentally retarded...
      </p>
      <p>
       he's talking about you,
      </p>
      <p>
       and your parents, and your grandparents, and everyone else you know
      </p>
      <p>
       but of course, since you are stupid, you will immediately translate this uncomfortable revelation into:
      </p>
      <p>
       "those members of the audience who are mentally retarded...everyone except me... because I'm smarter than the other audience members..."

      <p>
       you don't realize how it works, because you are dumb, and you are dumb by design. your education is designed to turn you into a complete idiot
      </p>
      <p>
       and belief in men walking on the moon is all the proof you ever need to know that your education is working just as it was designed to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, because a crime matches the description of a conspiracy, it must therefore not actually be a crime, because every conspiracy is just a theory, and every theory is baseless and wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       the mental gymnastics you must go thru to keep this all straight in your mind must be olympics worthy
      </p>
      <p>
       lets see:
      </p>
      <p>
       Nazi's doing a Holocaust sounds like it matches the description of a conspiracy, so therefore the Holocaust must be a conspiracy theory, which means the Holocaust is baseless and never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       help me out please
      </p>
      <p>
       help me understand why the holocaust is NOT a conspiracy.

        whataboutism at its best. I dont say actors are unfailable. However if you assume this is a thoroughly planned show there obviously went a lot of ressources into it. And if thats the case then mistakes are quite rare - they can happen, very rare though.

       there is an entire subculture dedicated to finding plot holes etc in movies. if Hollywood can't even make a movie without an error in it, why would you expect B grade crisis actors to do any better?

       and what do you base this opinion on? your personal experience in fake crying on camera?

      <p>
       have you ever noticed that "normies" tend to imagine something and then blurt out out as fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, a normie might hear about a human trafficking sting on his TV news, but then he immediately thinks to himself,
      </p>
      <p>
       "its too big of a conspiracy! someone would talk!"
      </p>
      <p>
       and then presents to the world his un-supported opinion as if it was fact, and expects everyone else to follow along and agree that its too big of a conspiracy and that someone would talk, and so therefore the human trafficking sting must just be another wild-eyed conspiracy theory, and why is this nonsense on my TV?
      </p>
      <p>
       you see? you "imagine" that someone would tell "Robbie Parker" to get into persona, but you don't actually have any evidence to support that

       Conspiracy and conspiracy theory arent the same. And just cause there are a lot of conspiratards around who smell conspiracies at about everything even though it doesnt make sense or there is no evidence or indication, it doesnt mean that all conspiracies are just by definition fake.

       im not making this up, this actually happened to me at school
      </p>
      <p>
       7th grade, Mr Brown's class. we are studying science? social studies? or whatever
      </p>
      <p>
       and we are learning about the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, a tribe of ancient hunter gathers who exist to this very day, by living like savages and eating ostrich eggs as snacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       the tone of the lesson seems to have been that white people were advanced and civilized, and black people were ignorant, illiterate savages who live in mud huts and wear loin cloths to work ...
      </p>
      <p>
       and then later the moon landing myth comes up ...
      </p>
      <p>
       and Mr Brown told us, and i quote "some ignorant African's think that the moon landing is a hoax"
      </p>
      <p>
       what would you say to Mr Brown if he told your kids that?
      </p>
      <p>
       so, just to summarize thus far
      </p>
      <p>
       you are NOT in a majority of people who believe that men have walked on the moon. the vast majority of people have never believed this absurd myth. it is only a small handful of people who have been fooled into believing this myth in the last 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       compare this to the Jesus myth which has been believed by Billions of people over thousands of years
      </p>
      <p>
       are you the genius for figuring out that Jesus is a myth? I'm sure you tell yourself that

      <p>
       maybe you should re-consider your strategy of arguing on a topic that you know nothing about, with someone who has spent the last several years researching it?
      </p>
      <p>
       i used to believe then what you believe now, because all i knew then is all you know now.
      </p>
      <p>
       but when i actually looked at the evidence, i had to admit i was wrong, and admit i had been fooled, and admit that my media and government has been behaving badly, using staged, scripted, fake news, propaganda to push an agenda of shifting public opinion on certain topics like gun control or foreign policy

      <p>
       what has happened is that you have spent a lifetime of watching TV and have been brainwashed to assume that mass shootings are commonplace, because they stage mass shootings so frequently, and hype them in the news like a boogie man to scare the people into complacence with things like the PATRIOT act
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know the evidence they had, I just commented on the video that you presented as your evidence, which certainly isnt that.

      <p>
       actually, it was the other way around. i began by "imagining" that this man was a grieving father who lost his child in a mass shooting, mostly because thats what the media wanted me to imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       but then later it become obvious that this was just another active shooter drill, like those that happen every week in schools across America
      </p>
      <p>
       so when you figure out that nobody died at sandy hook,
      </p>
      <p>
       that the supposed "kids" who were killed were actually just photographed years prior to the event and allowed to grow into a different looking kid, usually presented to the public as an older sibling, such as those who were presented at the Super Bowl

       yes, an inexplicably high number of these "families" moved to the area in the years preceding the incident, and many have left the area since then. many of them had closing on their house on the same day. the people were brought in to do the job
      </p>
      <p>
       the thing that you really need to understand is that you will never figure out Sandy Hook, because its so far in the past and too much of the evidence has disappeared
      </p>
      <p>
       but the good news is, that the next time they stage a mass shooting, you will automatically know its a fake news event, and proceed to scrutinize the evidence much more closely than you ever have before

       So they cut all their ties? I mean their families must have saw them. Or friends or whatever.

       So this clever, stupid dorks (sorry I am getting confused signals if they are smart now or not) hired a shit ton of people, whom they all had to pay. All
       <strong>
        huge
       </strong>
       liabilities, since any of them could speak up. Or any of their families. But they go along with the plan, paying each and everyone of them lets say... 100k bucks. Not only them: also police officers, the ones who would need to fake documents and what not. Several millions.

       The motive is still unclear. Just
       <em>

       Why not pay one single crazy man to really do it? To go around a school and shoot up some kids and teachers? Then let him escape and accuse the guy that they accused anyway and is innocent according to you.

       A few states implemented tighter gun measures following Sandy Hook. I live in MD and remember the gun ban announcement after SH happened. The line for guns was huge and the wait list was the longest the state has ever seen. Not saying that was a conspiracy or anything to effect of a national wide thing... but it did impact some states.

       By that logic it makes more sense that gun manufacturers commit mass shootings to sell guns. The mas shootings never get your guns taken - they improve gun sales. (I don't believe that but there is more evidence for that than any mass program of false flag attacks that don't achieve any gun restrictions)

       Agreed, proof is every time a 'mass' shooting or other event happens - certain people across numerous spectrums state there will be a gun grab. I'm sure those yelling about a grab are deeply invested somewhere.

       This response doesn't mean anything. I took an hour to respond and so you commented with "crickets" implying that I had dodged my duty to respond. I'm informing you that not everyone is on reddit 24 hrs a day available to respond at a moment's notice.

       No I wasn't. Lol what the fuck. I was eating dinner. Anyway, I already responded to you. I don't care about Adam Lanza and I don't have any particular proof that he committed those crimes, although I'm sure there is tons out there. What I'm concerned with is whether or not the massacre actually took place. I think it did and if you agree, cool, we move on. If you disagree, say so, and I will provide evidence. I'm going to bed now however so I will get back to you tomorrow

       Interesting. So I am the Judge of this case? And my opinion decides his fate? Never knew I had such power. Either which way, I never said I think Adam Lanza is guilty. Like I
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       said, I just don't give a fuck. I don't exactly go around telling people he's a child murderer and I don't really think about it.

       Also that whole example was a clear false equivalency. I do see the point you're making, and it's valid, but let's not pretend these two situations are equivalent. Adam Lanza's presumed guilt has an FBI investigation behind it.

       How do you not see the inherent fallacy and farcical nature of your supposed attempt at an argument here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's me, doing what you are doing:
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you did it. I think you went into Sandy Hook, and shot up a bunch of kids. That's what i believe. It doesn't matter why i believe it, and i don't need to provide you a single shred of reasoning or evidence. So how, and with what evidence, can you change my belief that you alone are responsible? I bet you'll just tell me you were somewhere else that day. And i'm supposed to believe that? From some post on reddit? Pffff please you're so dumb (ad hominem argument X1000 etc etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need to provide any reasons or evidence as to why i know for certain that you did it, and since I choose not to believe any other explanation, then case closed. You did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, you are the absolute shining example of what is wrong with this community and it's severe lack of analytical and critical thinking. I guess you never took a debate class in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are here. We are open minded. You are telling us/others something that doesn't align with what we believe. It's up to you to provide a compelling argument and evidence to change our minds. Yet you refuse. This is a red flag. You can't argue against the official story simply by saying 'how dare you believe the official story'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, and i'm no longer being cheeky or sardonic here, i honestly believe that this is a specific tactic to discredit this entire community. By posting extraordinary claims/hypothesis' and refusing to provide the tiniest amount of reasons for doing so. So often the simplest explanation is the correct one, and it seems to me that the simplest explanation for this is to come on here, post nonsense, and then continue on refusing to argue your supposed theory/hypothesis with anything other than ad hominem bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, when others come around and see how fucking insane this is, they just assume that everyone here is equally batshit. Thus, in one fell swoop, discrediting every single argument/theory/hypothesis anyone proposes here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all 'conspiracy posters' are just loons.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because of cointelpro ops like this that the majority of people presented with questions about the legitimacy of things like the official story of 9/11 not necessarily adding up immediately reject it, and assume that someone asking questions about 9/11 also believes the earth is flat, the queen is a lizard, and Alex Jones is Bill Hicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       So either you're cointelpro, and this is a deliberate op to discredit (which is an extremely common tactic and has been for quite some time) or you're just a complete fucking moron.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way though, it doesn't matter because YOU DID SANDY HOOK.

       I'm not contesting any of that, nor am I trying to convince you of anything about that day. Your focus is misdirected, my friend.

       It would bother be greatly because I'm appalled by the spread of falsities. And it bothers me because denying the massacre occurred is denying the legitimacy of the victims' suffering.

        how about that. you can prove Sandy Hook victims are real by producing an actual obituary that was NOT written by the AP.

       I don't see how that would be proof. I really don't. What does this suggest? Does it suggest that the children didn't actually die and they're still completely alive and well? So why haven't any of the many hundreds of relatives/acquaintances come out and said the kids are still alive? And even if I produced one, how does that prove anything at all? Writing fake obituaries would be one of the easier portions of this so-called "hoax."

       good. then you should be aware that nobody died at sandy hook, and that the whole thing was fake news, just like Boston Marathon bombing and many other fake news atrocity propaganda pieces.

       they were fake victims. there is no legitimacy to their suffering. the real victims are the fools who believe whatever the corporate media and government tell them

       People's minds changed. People rely on the government for protection out of fear more, quicker to relinquish their freedoms. Many copy-cats have happened since. Schools have massively changed their policies and become locked down security theater. Some have dumped lots of money on security industry products, training, and other services. Schools are head over heals to directly partner with and be direct by police now, even in the face of reason. Teachers and principals are more often armed now. Everyone is uptight and afraid and willing to give up all freedom.

       They were hoping for more change, there was a UN vote coming up, all timed perfectly, fortunately Sandy Hook wasn't as effective a catalyst as they'd hoped.  There have been many more fake shootings since then to keep chipping away.

       This.

       They started by inducing fear at the movies...a shooter at the dark knight midnight showing?  my kids went to see that!
      </p>
      <p>
       that didnt work.
      </p>
      <p>
       so they tried to get the lgbt community on board by shooting up a gay club.
      </p>
      <p>
       that didnt work.
      </p>
      <p>
       so they pulled the big guns and went after actual children.
      </p>
      <p>
       that didnt even work.
      </p>
      <p>
       we havent had a large scale mass shooting since....we did have vegas but until more info comes out I will not count it.  Especially since that looks to be an arms deal gone wrong rather than a planned attack on gun rights

       I got kicked out of a friend's house when I admitted I didn't believe Sandy Hook as we're told it. I was out of town and a guest at their house, and they did let me back in, but it was kind of scary, the guy was shaking and really agitated and looked like he might want to hurt me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ended up showing him the Super Bowl video and taking it face by face and comparing it to the photos of the dead children. That made him even more angry but he started asking questions, going "WHY WOULD SOMEONE SET THIS UP?" and I just said I didn't know why, and I told him that I had believed it and was also extremely upset and scared when I started to realize it wasn't real.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then I showed him Gene Rosen, Robby Parker, the McDonnell's interview with Anderson Cooper, and teacher Kaitlyn Roig's interview--specifically pointing out that no actual tears are cried.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was pissed off but I think he actually believed me.

       Right, I generally dismiss that sort of thing myself. A lot of people look like a lot of people in the world. But there's at least 7 people involved in Sandy Hook who are supposed to be dead yet look eerily similar to the children at the Super Bowl choir, and the fact that the Soto and Phelp's families have such striking resemblance to the Greenberg/Sexton family photo album.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's isn't just two people who look similar. It a dozen people.

       If Sandy Hook was a false flag, why is the assumption that nobody died in that conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       For TPTB to encompass all the occulted practices and string pulling assumed of them, but they stop short of mass murdering children and create an elaborate hoax instead, feels like mental gymnastics to allow the TPTB to be corrupt enough to fake killing children, but never actually do it (in the public eye at least).  It feels like this line of logic let’s the conspiracy theorist follow the narrative without having to confront actual dead children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historical false flags have let civilians die repeatedly, why would this be any different?

       these stories are scripted well in advance
      </p>
      <p>
       if the script calls for 20 dead kindergartners, well then you need to find 20 kindergartners and their parents, etc and get things set up well in advance.

       I honestly don't think anyone can be convinced of this if they aren't seeking truth for themselves.  If you are dealing with people who read mainstream magazines and watch CNN they have been programmed to not be capable of entertaining a thought like this.  All you will get is an extreme emotional (usually anger) response.

       If I were to commit a false flag at Sandy Hook, I'd actually kill kids. Why not kill them? You're risking the whole operation by hving actors and photoshopping stuff and blah blah blah.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why Sandy Hook false flag people seem so insane. If some secretive shadow government wanted a false flag to take people's guns...they'd just go kill the kids.

       This is consistently the most empty strawman argument people bring up. It's like simply shitting on all the discrepancies and oddities as to what occurred just because you can't seem to understand why they wouldn't kill kids.

       WHELP they didn't kill kids, so it must be real! Even though the list of inconsistencies is a mile long.

       Sandy Hook was such a horrible production that they couldn't even deliver us a picture of a dead Adam Lanza and his mother.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing was one big production to push through gun control and to push through legislation to hide information from the public, one passed, the other didn't.

       So, the all powerful TPTB can plan a mass shooting but couldn't plan a picture of the perpetrator dead?  And that is enough for you to think that no one died?  If it was planned, why wouldn't they plan every aspect to keep you off the trail?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what rights do you have to these pictures?  Are they owed to you?  By whom?  Why?  I think the police have these pictures, but there is no reason to release them just because you want them.  The government doesn't bend over to your twisted whims of wanting pics of dead people.

It's freedom of information. You don't like it, so what. What right do you have to judge how a person learns or comes to accept something that happened and prevent them from it?

       THERE IT IS! Like clock work, the insult because I want the government to be held accountable to me and I want all the details of crimes committed. Crime does not have a right to be hidden from the public. BUT now all of a sudden I'm "twisted" because I want to see the dead bodies. I've heard it all; sick, fucked up, disgusting, deranged, and on and on just because I have a morbid curiosity. What right do you have to judge a person's morbid curiosity? You don't. What right does the government have to not bend to my whims? They don't, but our society has exalted them to make people like yourself think that we are servants to them, when in fact they are servants to us.

       Yes, yes you do.  Why do the families have to suffer because you want to see these pictures?  Did you take them with your camera?  If not, you don't own the pictures.  Also, I'm free to judge you all I want, just as you've judged others as well.  I can't induce any punishments because that would be wrong, but I can personally judge you all I want.  What we think of each other plays no bearing on the events.

       Arrest records and indictments are public records, forever, whether guilt or innocence is determined.  Clearly the public ethos feels knowing that a mere possibility of a crime occurring is more important than the accused’s reputation.  Why should the evidence of actual crimes be relatively devalued?  What possibly damage can the victim of a crime sustain by showing the public irrefutable proof of her victimhood?

       His assent to the veracity of the crime, which entails his approbation of the rule of law.  That answer is obvious.  A compliant, faithful citizen is more valuable than a dissenter.  And I’m not even a conspiracy theorist.

      <p>
       But since you claim there are no inconsistencies, there is one you cannot deny, the police report stating the time the children were evacuated, and the video that doesn't show them evacuating at the time recorded. Matter of fact, there is no video of children evacuating.

       kids did die, just not the amount stated and not via the weapons we have been told.  the false flag portion of this event is how the fbi stepped in and twisted the situation to suit their agenda

       There was a well-written documentary on Sandy Hook done by active Youtube researchers. It was deleted quickly, but I think you can still find it on the web. Titled
       <em>
        'Let' s talk about Sandy Hook'
       </em>
       as far as I remember.

       You really can't convince people, they have to accept it for themselves, there's no two ways about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people who think there is fuckery afoot will listen, and read, and watch videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else who doesn't believe it give these answers ALL the time:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If no one died then it had to be real.
       </p>
       <p>
        If they wanted to do it for gun control, they would have just shot the kids.
       </p>
       <p>
        You want to see pictures of dead kids? You're sick, twisted, fucked up, etc...
       </p>
       <p>
        How could they keep it quiet with so many actors?
       </p>
       <p>
        You tube videos are not proof.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The problem is, I think there are fewer people who actually really believe it happened and get incensed over someone questioning the narrative. What i think is that the people rummaging around
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       refuting the narrative through personal attacks are in some way shilling for the shadow government that put it all together, they are on the take. Just notice the pattern of those who refute it, they always call people names, every time. It's like if they go about it in such a dissonant way they eventually turn the whole thing in to a joke.

       Great. 20 full minutes of video. And in it you'll see an officer being an officer, which means not every officer does their job exactly perfectly every single waking minute.

       I never try to red pill anyone.  I just always try to plant the seed of doubt. Like if someone is talking about 9/11, I'll say isn't it crazy that just the day before it happened Donald Rumsfield announced that 2 trillion dollars is missing? You follow this question up with more "coincidental" things and voila...doubt has been planted.

       Sorry dudes, but most of the stuff i read here reminds me of the stories a good friend, who works as a psychiatrist in a mental hospital, tells me sometimes. The obsession and persistance is remarkable.

       Dude, we were having two separate discussions here. One about the car, and one about the police call. Both of my original comments to you about those topics were immediately downvoted to zero by you. I don't know why you made the assumption that I think you're following me around, as I already acknowledged that I know you aren't. Because I replied to you. Which would ping you. Which wouldn't require you to do any following.

       This.

      <p>
       They started by inducing fear at the movies...a shooter at the dark knight midnight showing?  my kids went to see that!
      </p>
      <p>
       that didnt work.
      </p>
      <p>
       so they tried to get the lgbt community on board by shooting up a gay club.
      </p>
      <p>
       that didnt work.
      </p>
      <p>
       so they pulled the big guns and went after actual children.
      </p>
      <p>
       that didnt even work.
      </p>
      <p>
       we havent had a large scale mass shooting since....we did have vegas but until more info comes out I will not count it.  Especially since that looks to be an arms deal gone wrong rather than a planned attack on gun rights

       Right, I generally dismiss that sort of thing myself. A lot of people look like a lot of people in the world. But there's at least 7 people involved in Sandy Hook who are supposed to be dead yet look eerily similar to the children at the Super Bowl choir, and the fact that the Soto and Phelp's families have such striking resemblance to the Greenberg/Sexton family photo album.
      </p>

       It's isn't just two people who look similar. It a dozen people.

       It's right there on video. There is nothing abnormal about that. I feel like 90% of the problems in this group originate from them not being able to recognize perfectly normal human behavior.

       Good actors go to Hollywood. Mediocre actors become crisis actors. if these crisis actors had any real acting talent, they would be on Broadway or Hollywood, not pretending to be grieving parents at a fake shooting

       you really can't know how people react to grief. This is a weird ass reaction, I agree, but it's not proof something happened.

       so still a shit ton? And with all that money you think its plausible that they find that one actor that doesnt even understand the fundamental of his job? t makes no sense to me how one can think that this is a super organised conspiracy but then somehow fail massively on the simplest part of the job.

       Its odd, not to say implausible isnt it?
