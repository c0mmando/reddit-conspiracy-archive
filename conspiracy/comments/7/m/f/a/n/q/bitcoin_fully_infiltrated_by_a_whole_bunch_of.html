(The community on reddit for the most part, not the actual coin itself)</p>

<p>The reason i am putting this here is also to bring awareness to people of dis information agents aka (shill) which is also actively happening in the bitcoin community and here for the longest time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never said it was going to pop soon. I&#39;d expect BTC to be 1 million. But eventually it will and people will move on.</p>

<p>If the economy crumbles trump gets impeached. If it doesn&#39;t he gets reelected. I agree with that. Hope for that lol. I make a lot of money. </p>

<p>You should do some reading on blockchain technology and what it has to offer. Bitcoin is just the first major player. There will be others.</p>

<p>Other than that I think your predictions are low. BTC could easily hit 250k by the end of 2018. Dow jones depends heavily on trump being impeached or not. So we will see what happens.</p>

<p>Trump will step down or get assassinated before he&#39;s impeached. The guy is squeaky clean, too clean, obviously dirty, but damn he&#39;s a boss and is MAGAing.</p>

With alot already lost , owners dying, and fees eating it up.  pump and dump doesn&#39;t really work when bitcoin is becoming really rare day by day .

    <div class="md"><p>No, I’m not talking about the people who buy at the bottom of the dip for the discount, I’m talking about the people who FOMO at $19k right before the dip and watch it hit $11k a day later and don’t have the mental fortitude to just hold for the rebound.</p>

<p>Those are the people getting fucked.</p>

<p>I’m well read on crypto technology, and I stay away from BTC because there are a handful of coins that do what it does, but way better. </p>

<p>Just banking on the fact that the global community begins to value function over name recognition, which I think is slowly starting to happen.</p>

<p>First of all, you need basic 8th grade math, to see that what bcash is doing, will ONLY work in the short run. </p>

<p>Then, if you would look a little deepeer into the problem, you would see that, what is being developed now, has to be developed careful. I for one, I&#39;m ok with the slow development. this things require testing, they require bug fixing, it&#39;s not so easy. And when you only have one change to make it work, and the development community is not under a central authority (like a boss telling each one what to work on) , things tend to not go as fast.</p>

<p>Also, you say you&#39;re here since the beggining, but , you don&#39;t seem to undersand how fees work..Blockstream dosen&#39;t get those fees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly how fees work, and they have reached $100 per transaction on the BTC chain which is crazy.  There is no testing a bug fixes needed to change a single number to upgrade the block size.  Several chains have large blocks with high volume and are not seeing a problem.  BTC though is failing NOW, reaching 200k waiting transactions in the mempool and insane fees.  Even a 2mb or 4mb upgrade would help relieve the pressure but when people see that on-chain scaling works it will threaten your precious lightning network that has been just around the corner for years.</p>

<p>The fact that you are spewing the same tired propaganda about it makes me believe you are either severely ignorant or a Blockstream shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could get banned for calling people shills in here, it&#39;s against the rules btw.</p>

<p>You should know that , firstly:</p>

<p>1) several chains with bigger blocks, have not seen stress tests as Bitcoin. Not even remotely.
2) SegWit does exactly that, upgrades the size of a block, by making transactions smaller...and Guess what? Big exchanges that cry &quot;high fees&quot; are also the ones that refuse to implement SegWit (which takes like 2 days tops) .</p>

<p>Chain scaling dosen&#39;t work in the long run. I&#39;ve said it, I&#39;ld say it again.</p>

<p>Btw, you should check the Stanford marshmallow experiment, hopefuly it will give  your some insight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say the poster was a shill.  I said that <em>I believe</em> they are <em>either</em> ignorant or a shill.  It&#39;s an important distinction.</p>

<p>In any case, you can keep calling the sky purple and it won&#39;t make it true.  These are undeniable facts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">BCH is in the top 5 coins by market cap</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/network-hashrate-charts/bitcoincash-network-hashrate-chart">BCH has a massive amount of hash power</a> (currently 2500 PH/s)</li>
<li>BCH has run into zero problems due to its 8MB block size</li>
<li>Litecoin has been running for years at 4MB/10 minutes without problem</li>
</ul>

<p>The supposed goal of people like you is to keep transactions available to the general public, but your &quot;solution&quot; is actually doing the opposite.  You&#39;d rather restrict BTC growth and keep transactions for the wealthy and powerful, and make everyone else use a layer on top of it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason why you couldn&#39;t have block sizes much larger than 8MB and prune the blockchain to support large transaction rates ON CHAIN.  The typical bullshit claim is that it would centralize nodes, but BTC hash power is already centralized, so that claim is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Tell me now what Blockstream&#39;s business model is if it&#39;s not to make money of the vaporware lightning network?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re changing a major component of that 7 year experiment without any perceived limits though. I&#39;m not saying the code will not work exactly as intended, because I agree it&#39;s a simple fork of the same basic language. What&#39;s &quot;un-crash tested&quot; about BCH is the unintended consequences that can come from an unlimited block size. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what scares me. 5, 10 years down the line we realize that the size is outpacing Moore&#39;s Law by a shitton, and I can&#39;t run my own full node anymore. When I have to trust my local financial institution to validate that everyone is following the rules with each block, because they naturally took on the huge financial task of doing so. Then one day when those financial institutions all continue to merge and become less and less competition, and we realize that bad actors have taken over all of the nodes, now there&#39;s nothing we can really do because the blockchain is already too large to store on consumer or hobbyist level hardware, and we&#39;re left with a digital form of our current banking system.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an entirely new experiment, that deserves to be called and entirely new coin. One that I&#39;m rooting for and wouldn&#39;t mind seeing it become the micro transaction form of bitcoin. But the divide that they are putting into the community to try and take over the name is what I have such a big problem with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing is untested or an experiment. Bitcoin Cash is just continuing Bitcoin as it was intended. Projections of why the fix that makes Bitcoin Cash work now won&#39;t work in 5 or 10 years are just silly. Of course other scaling strategies must be implemented in the next several years and there are some great ones being worked on,  but the fears are quite exaggerated.  Moore&#39;s law is a good reason why the exaggerated fear of network propagation times leading to centralization of miner nodes and the concerns of drive space needed to hold the full blockchain are just nonsense. Looking back that the standard Internet speeds and storage device sizes from just 5 years ago and comparing them will lead you to scoff at that concern. If network propagation times give that much of a miner benefit it will lead to centralization before there is a propagation time bottleneck and even if there is none.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Bitcoin Cash didn&#39;t divided the community. I think the community divided into Bitcoin Cash as a direct result of the one lopsidedness of the scaling issue. The loud few got their way with FUD, censorship, and relentless propaganda. Everyone was left with a bad taste in their mouths and many of us opened our eyes to how easily Bitcoin was taken over by corporate interests.</p>

<p>The only way to overcome Bitcoin with sheer force like that is to control &gt;50% of the hashing power. More than half of 13 million TH/s is quite a lot. The second that overwhelming hash power breaks the rules even in the slightest, everyone will know it though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding... First, you&#39;d have to design, test, and build your own hardware. I don&#39;t mean buying PC parts, I mean custom making application specific CPUs. Development of custom CPUs is quite expensive, costing several million for even frugal retail endeavors. So once you get some custom CPUs manufactured and working properly, you&#39;d have to start filling warehouses with them to compete with the thousands of miners around the world already running application specific processors (ASICs). If you didn&#39;t complete this plan within a year or two, then the whole game will likely have changed by then. So maybe a few hundred billion dollars, just to fake one transaction, be instantly caught, have your mining warehouses banned from the network and all of Bitcoin jump ship. They will begin using another crypto coins or hardfork Bitcoin to use a different proof of work algorithm, rendering all your efforts useless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been awash in the cryptocurrency sphere for the last 6 years or so...</p>

<p>There are many many shills surrounding Bitcoin. Bitcoin was taken over by the Blockstream company and over the period of 3 or 4 years Bitcoin was a victim of corporate takeover and a key decision about how to scale was manipulated to ensure private profits.</p>

<p>Bitcoin its self has great decentralized security, but it&#39;s online social communities are easily manipulated centralized targets like reddit, twitter, and the bitcointalk forum.</p>

<p>The discussion surrounding the scaling decisions were heavily censored by the same people who controlled <a href="/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> and bitcointalk. Censorship, bans, and heavy shilling/vote-brigading was used to suppress opposition. I was censored and banned multiple times as were many others.</p>

<p>A long time ago a specific abuse issue existed that required the block size limit to be created. This issue was to be increased as needed and be a temporary fix. Years later, the specific abuse issue is no longer feasible, yet the 1MB block size limit remained. People saw how if Bitcoin was artificially bottlenecked by this size limit, then it would need some serious changes to work reliably without huge fees. While raising the size limit just kicked the issued down the road, that was overwhelmingly the best solution for the next 10 years. Right then and there many people decided that Bitcoin was not a currency and only a store of value. They decided to leave the bottlekneck, instead of keeping Bitcoin useful. The Blockstream company developed a plan for Bitcoin to be a settlement layer for a more centralized banking-like system. Why fix Bitcoin, if it creates a profitable need for third parties and proprietary software? </p>

<p>The main Bitcoin &quot;Core&quot; developers, <a href="/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> and bitcointalk forum moderators slowly became co-opted over a few years to work for the Blockstream company. Very few actually influential and controlling parties in Bitcoin are not working for this company is some fashion. In the last few years of the scaling debate, the debate was banned and the full on censorship and propaganda campaign began. Most long time users were censored and banned. Opposition was giving a derogatory name &quot;big blockers&quot; and thought terminating cliches were developed to ridicule them. Focus on ad-hominid attacks of public figures who support scaling technological strategies became a huge focus, rather than the technological strategies themselves. The technical discussion was deflected from the technology into a squabble about cheerleading for either the &#39;small block&#39; or big block&#39; teams and support or ridicule for their associated public figures such as Andreas Antinopolous, Roger Ver, or Chinese Bitcoin miners like Wu. Divide and conquer, then steer the conflict to being about tribal and public personality issues, not a technology. Such a commonly seen tactic. A few opposer have migrated to <a href="/r/btc">/r/btc</a>, but the place was flooded with shills and trolls. Even being a user of <a href="/r/btc">/r/btc</a> is ridicule worthy to most <a href="/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a>&#39;ers. Gatekeepers began to pool and form guard on every community platform. If you spoke out on reddit, IRC, bitcointalk, twitter, or discord a swarm of Bitcoin protectors would come to flog you and force your banning.</p>

<p>In August 2017, a fork to Bitcoin Cash was made, just before the Bitcoin Core scaling solution was implemented. We know have both solutions. Unfortunately most of the skilled and trusted developers and community members fell for the Blockstream gambit. This has left Bitcoin Cash a great working currency, with a less than stellar group of developers and organizers. Yet, adoption of Bitcoin Cash is super fast. ATMs, exchanges, and payment processors have scrambled to support Bitcoin Cash. Its actual working currency will likely attract skilled developers. Conversely, Bitcoin is strife with in-fighting, while the usability of the coin as even a store of value is floundering unassuredly. Will Lightning Network ever come to save it? Will Lightning Network be as centralized as is predicted. Will Bitcoin become just a settlement layer for Lightening Network &#39;bank&#39; channels? Who knows, but right now is probably the biggest and most important push for adoption cryptocurrencies will ever have and Bitcoin is on the side lines looking like the benched fat kid with $30 transaction fees for absolutely no reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you go read up on what they say so far about quantum computing and realize that they never tell us the whole story so we are in the dark. And even if I’m totally wrong think about a natural disaster and getting at your “money” no power no money. Sound like a good plan for most? Doesn’t to me. You love crypto currency ok fine but you you have to stop and think that we don’t know it’s origin story enough to trust it at all. Bitcoin 2FA both rely on encryption, if all encryption is cracked, and that IS a possibility even if you don’t want it to be. All computing based currency and transactions can’t be trusted. The thing is with all of the cyber issues that have happened I can’t believe you can’t think one step further and realize we might be being fed the script for economic collapse with crypto as well.</p>

<p>one day crypto gets cracked</p>

<p>next day crypto gets forked with a patch everything back to normal</p>

<p>Lets take a look at &#39;bitcoin cash&#39; for instance 
They are a bitcoin fork which came to fix the high fees and transaction time, everyones wallet has duplicated there. 
But not everyone accepted it. If quantum decrypts the hash than everyone will simply move into the fork which works best. </p>

Very open very forward thinking. All I want is people to think about it I didn’t say do one thing one way or the other. I’m not jealous of bitcoiners nor do I wish to join something I don’t trust and can find many flaws with. But you make the wrong assumption as to what would happen if quantum renders encryption useless. It wouldn’t be “hackers” that had access to it it would be governments and intelligences agencies and they are probably light years ahead of what they are disclosing now. By all means keep believing you know it all, I KNOW I don’t and that is my strength as well as it your weakness. Also please note I didn’t “go personal” till you do because crypto is your deeply held core belief. Please read this:
