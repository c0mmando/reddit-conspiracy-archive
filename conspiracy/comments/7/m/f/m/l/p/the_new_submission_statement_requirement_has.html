<p>For example, in the past I&#39;ve see so many youtube videos with context-less titles in this sub...now we&#39;re getting summaries from OP, as well as links to extra material for those who are interested!</p>

<p>It appears to be leading to an increase in quantity, and most importantly, quality, in the comment sections...and the front page seems vastly cleaned up.</p>

<p>I will choose to remain cautiously optimistic about the new policy.</p>

<p>I truly look forward to a New Year...conspiracy theories are going &quot;mainstream&quot; and we must be prepared to assist others in regaining their footing once the veil is lifted...</p>

<p>Much love!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of self posts on the front page of this sub is higher than I&#39;ve seen it in a long time. And personally, as I&#39;ve said in another comment, self posts (with a link if one wants to add one) are so much better than simply links, just because you can&#39;t spam them and you have to give context and argument your point (which leads to better debate in the comments). </p>

<p>The same will hopefully happen on link posts as well (more discussion in the comments), with submission statements, but as I said, I think the best thing about this change was a large increase in self-posts.</p>

<p>So, maybe it&#39;s too early to say, but I think we did it. Or at least we are slowly changing the sub to a higher quality version, taking it back in time to the &quot;good old days&quot; one could even say perhaps.</p>

<p>*The only problem I can see in going forward is people making one sentence submission statements, which again is too easy, doesn&#39;t give enough context for the link and won&#39;t stop shills from spamming. I really think that there should be a minimum length for submission statements of at least a few sentences. But maybe we should just wait and see how this evolves and have that rule added later if problems arise.</p>

<p>Bingo.</p>

<p>Well done mods. Much needed change.</p>

<p>Jessie Ventura <em>did have an impact</em> on normals, but they viewed it as entertainment. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with you. But, why would you go back to tv when you seem to know that regular tv programming is aimed at the lowest common denominator?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pay for cable so when my father visits he has something to watch. He has no desire to learn how to use my kodi. Since I pay for it I watch from time to time. It is interesting to see since I have come to see things a lot differently. You start to notice the propaganda more. How they use the tv to skew the public. It is an on and off thing. I only really watch the science network, cause I cannot find it on kodi, but only when they are not having their 45th mythbusters block of the year. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t doubt for a second that marketing companies profile users by connecting data between TV history, browser history, and other info to serve relevant ads.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually surprised that we haven&#39;t seen x-files ads on this sub.  Fox would absolutely pay a premium for ads here.  We&#39;ve kindly helped out Reddit by segmenting ourselves in a neat package here.</p>

<p>This is something that has creeped me out a few times this year. I would be at work talking of a specific episode of the Simpsons an within a day or two that episode would be on. Now I know program line ups are created before my thoughts. but when it happened the third time it felt weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve experienced that too but I don&#39;t think different <em>episodes</em> are target-broadcasted to individual users.  I&#39;m sure there is a french word like deja vu to describe that experience.  Or it could be some sort of subconscious precognition / remote viewing.</p>

<p>I do know for a fact that different <em>advertisements</em> are target-delivered individually.  At it&#39;s most basic your IP address is being collected whenever you watch Netflix, search Google, and now everything you do since ISPs can sell your data, etc.  Mobile is a little harder since your IP bounces around.  Ever wonder why Facebook is so kind to let other companies use their authentication to log into third party sites?</p>

<p>Try and surf the internet with a VPN and a clean browser.  Crazy different experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly. What metrics would you like to see? Even as mods, we&#39;re somewhat limited in what we can view due to restrictions on reddit&#39;s API, but I might be able to find something if you knew what you wanted. </p>

<p>We also have to remember that the week after Christmas is vastly different than a normal week, on this sub or any website for that matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t know what&#39;s available - let me do some research into the reddit API and get back to you.</p>

<p>I think you are right that the seasonality will skew the data.  I&#39;ll set myself a reminder for a few weeks and PM you on suggested data to pull once we get back to &quot;prime time&quot;.  I&#39;m happy to do the analysis myself with the raw data and share the backup with everyone.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds good, man. You might find r/pushshift to be pretty useful in pulling the needed data that can be pretty hard to get directly from reddit. Keep me posted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually OP, it hasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>They are censoring everything that THEY think is not newsworthy. Look at the frontpage of r/conspiracy. Conspiracies that take away stories from what is happening right now that is very interesting. <a href="http://prntscr.com/ht61rn">http://prntscr.com/ht61rn</a></p>

<p>Therefore people need to realize this and make another conspiracy sub and move there. Sorry, this place has now turned into a shithole.</p>
