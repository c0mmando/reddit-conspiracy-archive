      <p>
       Last week the ACLU
       <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu-v-dod-complaint">
        filed a lawsuit
       </a>
       against the DOD to force the Trump administration to release their updated "rules" on the program to assassination American citizens without due process, an incredible affront against the entire raison d'etre of the US and the US Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two recent articles spurred the lawsuit:
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/16/magazine/uncounted-civilian-casualties-iraq-airstrikes.html?_r=0">
        first
       </a>
       , from the NYT, found that the US military killed civilians 31 times more than it admitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/12/isis-obama-civilian-casualties/548501/">
        second
       </a>
       , from The Atlantic, admits that the Obama administration was more of the same with respect to the War on Terror, and that "protections for civilians were inadequate, as were promises of transparency and reparations for victims."
      </p>
      <p>
       The author continues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Throughout the Obama administration the ACLU fought legal battles over the release of Obama-era documents related to the secret kill list.
       </p>
       <p>
        The kill list has been the subject of legal battles for years. New York Times journalist Charlie Savage sued the Obama admin an attempt to reveal the government’s legal justifications for assassinating terror suspects without a trial.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The author notes at how dramatically the language from the ACLU has changed with respect to Obama:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In their latest rebuke of the Trump admin, the ACLU takes a surprisingly strong stance against former President Barack Obama by acknowledging the role the Nobel Peace Prize winner played in establishing these dangerous programs. “He committed this country to ever more militaristic responses in ever more countries, regardless of whatever reluctance he might have felt,” the ACLU writes. “Wrongful killings and civilian deaths were the inevitable result.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The author concludes by opining:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Normalizing the use of drones – both at home and abroad – is just beginning to coalesce into the new standard for American warfare and daily life. What can we do about this illegal, immoral, and dangerous warfare taken by the U.S government? Is there any way for the people to reverse the course?
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Of course liberals were fine when Obama was doing it, neevr once beleiving that all of the extraordinary powers claimed by Obama woul;d fall into the hands of a mortal enemy.

       This is a very good thing, simply because the kill list is being talked about. Discloser of stuff like this is the purpose of Trump's presidency imo.

       Is it though? I'm the only person posting about it on

       I have a feeling they will use it to bash Trump in the near future because the opportunity is too good for the MSM. Idk though, we live in strange times.
