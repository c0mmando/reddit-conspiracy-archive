       Illustrator, not Photoshop. Anyone who has opened a scanned PDF in Illustrator can immediately tell that the PDF that was put up by the WH was not a scanned document. There should only be one raster object if that was the case, and the background image should not deform when the foreground objects do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should have created the thing and printed it and then scanned it into a PDF. Then anyone who had done any forensics wouldn't be able to use this document construction proof against the authors or publishers of the PDF. It goes to show that either a) they do not understand technology or b) did it on purpose.

       Well when the rules of the sub prevent this stuff from being called out in real-time it makes it very difficult to combat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus when normal people who just come on here every now and then and don't up or down vote every thread and comment we will
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       be overrun by the paid political and PR operatives who come on here everyday for the sole purpose of attacking people and hiding earnest discussions about conspiracy all according to the narrative they are paid to push.
      </p>
      <p>
       The peer pressure effect is so powerful and even people who have been on the conspiracy board for years can fall prey to this tactic. Thankfully there are still a contingent here fighting back but like I said before, its not our job to do this so we will always be outgunned and outmanned.

       Interesting, I’m sure you have some solid proof of all that then? As far as I was aware with simulation hypothesis there was some compelling evidence but it was still all speculation at this point as there are multiple competing theories.

       it's possible to know something is true thru personal experiences or phenomena you can't easily repeat, and have this knowledge without having evidence to provide to others.  as to the veracity of "knowing", one knows something is true thru the use of logical devices like deduction.

       well i'll give you an example.  someone tells you about pizzagate using that exact term a decade before it happens.  the same person, at the same time, tells you about donald trump being elected prez.  foreknowledge, in other words.  possibly coupled with additional information that they'd have absolutely no way to know.  things like that help to provide indicators.  and then maybe you have a bunch of other experiences like this that can't be had except thru the device of someone knowing the future.  elimination of the impossible to paraphrase Conan Doyle.

       When it’s a lot of lucky guesses we might consider that person wise, or insightful, but I think it would still be fallacious to assume the next thing they say is true just because the previous 9 things they said were right. Their track record can speak to their reliability, but it doesn’t necessarily establish truth.

       Someone can be objective to an extent. Assuming there is no flaw obscuring their perception, they should be able to do something objectively. However, people are inherently flawed beings and we are not in a good vantage point to judge ourselves. The only way I can verify that I was objective is to have someone else verify that. The more people that verify it, the more credible.

       for sure.  but requiring others to validate things you can logically discern to be true is not a requirement for a thing to be true.  truth exists independently of whether one can appease themselves that a thing is true.

       That sounds like multiple independent people verifying something. That certainly sounds like something that should be considered credible, although specific circumstances and facts would need to be assessed on a case by case basis to discern if there is enough evidence to conclude that the story as put forward by those people was true. For example, what they said might be true, but there might then also be evidence that someone planted the story in their minds and the reason they came to believe it was something else entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that’s convoluted, by the point is that just because something seems true at surface level doesn’t mean it is. There has to be some way of verifying things externally to actually ensure we are reaching the proper conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the second point, this is debatable on the field of philosophy but I personally agree with you that there is objective truth. However, I think this is also a separate issue, whether or not something can be objectively true is not the same as how o demonstrate or prove that truth to others. On the context of this discussion I was explaining that I consider facts to be a truth that can be demonstrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Internal logic is a method of discerning truth, not proving it. By explaining your reasoning to others and seeing if it’s repeatable and consistent that’s how you actually establish it as true imo.

       Why do you consider the absence of God to be factual then? Your definition of fact is just a loose as this users when it comes to your beliefs. i agree that what this person stated is NOT a fact, but the example you gave in this thread wasn’t a fact either.

       Not quite. It was explained within the thread referring to the god debate how I feel the two are consistent. I specially made a distinction between types of discussions. Some things would have no physical evidence by their nature (god) and thus would have different types of proofs presented. Other things (observable really) would have tangible evidence thus that would be the standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       This really gets into a philosophical discussion about the nature of logic and proofs though and it’s not a discussion well suited for a side tangent.

       I consider a fact something that is independently verifiable. I also did not say there is no god.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would consider it a fact that god as depicted in the major religious texts (my original contention) does not exist. It can be verified outside of my own opinion that the texts and their description of god either contradict themselves or describe an entity that is self-contradictory in nature.

       You can’t just make up what the definition of a fact is. i agree, that the odds of their being a god as depicted in religious texts is minuscule. But that is NOT a fact. its just not. A fact is something that you can prove, and that cannot be proven. That’s just what the word “fact” means.

       It's literally impossible. The texts are self contradictory, so unless you're operating from a point of logic not existing, then it could be argued to the point of fact that god cannot exist as depicted in said texts. You would still have to make that argument though. It can be argued, and the same conclusion can be arrived to independently, that what I stated is factual.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I disagree adamantly, but from two different points. 1) As long as the definition of a word is kept consistent throughout a conversation it is entirely appropriate for a party to the conversation to define what usage they are giving it. Words can have multiple meanings, and obviously will take on certain meanings given certain contexts. I have no idea what your history with formal writing or discussions of topics like this, but even at the highest levels of academia this is considered good practice. As long as the way in which a word is used is clearly defined and kept consistent then there is no issue with providing a definition that might not otherwise be universally shared.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might not like my definition, to which you are welcome to explain where you think I went wrong with mine, but I think my usage of the word is more than fair.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) My second point would be that aside from the above, I see absolutely no issue with my usage of the word, nor do I see any conflicts with the regular usage of the word. It is not contradictory to what one might normally mean when using it, it has only been further specified for clear usage in a complicated discussion that requires a certain level of precision.
      </p>
      <p>
       To show you to what extent I am not just pulling things out of thin air you can even follow my reasoning:
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the definitions of fact provided from dictionary.com:
a piece of information presented as having objective reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Definition of objective reality:
The phrase "objective reality" means that reality exists independent of our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a fair paraphrasing of that would be:
"a fact something that is independently verifiable" ( this is the same definition I provided earlier).
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, I don't agree that's "just what the word fact means". That may be how you typically use it, or how you were thinking of it when entering this thread or conversation, but it is far from the only usage.

       You can’t appoint your own meaning to the word fact. The “highest levels of academia” don’t use the word fact loosely. And if we use your definition of independently verifiable for the word fact, that still doesn’t apply. You can’t independently verify that there is no supreme being as stated in religious texts. If you could verify the fact that the god of the Bible/Koran/Torah was for a fact, non existent, we wouldn’t have religion today. It is impossible to verify the existence of god, hence the healthy debate about the subject now.
      </p>
      <p>
       ill admit that What you believe is overwhelmingly likely, and almost positively the case. But it is not a fact. There’s no debating that. You cannot verify that independently.

       1)You can, as I already explained, but I'm not here to play semantics. Aside from the fact that it is entirely appropriate in a given discussion to use an alternative meaning for a word as long as that meaning is provided and remains consistent, i think I demonstrated very clearly how the definition I'm using is completely accurate using even a generic dictionary definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whether or not you want to use the dictionary version of "a piece of information presented as having objective reality." or my version of "something that is independently verifiable" we are still talking about the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There absolutely is debate in it, we're having that debate at the moment if you didn't notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If objective means free from bias, then objective reality is understood to be that which can be demonstrated to be true independent of one's subjective experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we talk about applying logic to something what we're really saying is that we are using "valid inference and demonstration".
      </p>
      <p>
       When we say something is logical what we're really saying is that the specified subject has been demonstrated to be valid, or
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So to paraphrase that one more time, saying something is logical means that it can be demonstrated to be true. So if something is completely logical, then it is by it's very nature true.
      </p>
      <p>
       True of course means: "in accordance with fact or reality."
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you can demonstrate that something is logical, then you are demonstrating that it is factual.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I can demonstrate that something is illogical, then I can demonstrate that it is not factual. Something that is internal inconsistent, is not logical. Therefore, something that is internally inconsistent is not factual.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible, Koran, and Torah all have internally inconsistent depictions of god. Therefore they do not factually depict god. Therefore god as depicted by said books, can not be factual (or in accordance with reality). Therefore said god (as specifically depicted in aforementioned texts) cannot exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way of putting that,
      </p>
      <p>
       (NOTE: I did not say academia uses the word fact loosely, and you'll also note that I did not use the word loosely, i gave it a specific definition and stuck to that specific and narrow definition, what I said is that it is appropriate in formal discussions and writings to provide alternative definitions as long as a clear definition is provided and the usage is consistent)

       see the other thread for my answer on this.  if you're asking for what events i've experienced (ie. the incidences) and what i've deduced from these incidents (ie. my logic) then you're still not be satisfied as there will be no way to validate that these things actually happened.

       true.  it's a Godelian problem.  you can derive things from within the model but not be able to validate the axioms of the model.  anyway, boolean logic is pretty tight - about as tight as it gets.  is what it is.  we use the tools at hand.

       if you see a bird fly and you tell your friends you saw a bird fly, how will you prove it?  you know you saw the bird fly, but you have no way to replay the incident to them so they can see it too.  all you can do is describe what you saw.  yet it is true that the bird flew and you saw it.  the burden of truth and the burden of proof are entirely different things.

       Birds fly. Your friends will take your word for it since they have also seen birds fly. Your stuff is extraordinary, thus requires extraordinary proof. Your anecdote is a far cry from any proof let alone extraordinary proof. All of your talk of logic in this thread and you stumbled out of the gate.

       yes but the

       of the bird flying you cannot prove.  it's still true, just not provable.  and there's no flaw in my logic.  there is a flaw in your interpretation of what the difference between truth and proof is.

       I consider it a fact. I have yet to see a holy book depicting a deity that is not internally inconsistent. My understanding of god would require that such a being be perfect, otherwise they would not fit into my definition of a god. A perfect being would not produce imperfections by their nature. Thus I find the gods as depicted by major religions to be self-defeating logically.

       The absence of evidence does not prove/disprove anything. A perfect God created perfect creation and gave that creation free will. We are the ones who introduced imperfections into creation. God is not bound by feeble human logic and we are explicitly told it is futile to attempt to comprehend who God is. To deny his existence because He doesn’t fit your definition as you have defined him is incredibly hubristic and fallacious. The argument you are using doesn’t make any sense.

       Apparently it doesn’t make sense to you, but it is logically consistent. It’s not an argument I created on my own, simply one I found compelling due to it’s logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible is self contradictory, if it can be accepted as any form of evidence it must be faulty evidence as it was created by man, and the same is true for any other biblical text you might submit. If the text itself cannot be relied upon to be absolute truth then the foundation for the religion does not seem to be present.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not said that god cannot exist, but as depicted in the major religions he cannot exist. Any god that could exist would have to be altered from the texts in one way or another thus jettisoning the religion itself from any semblance of credibility.

       Just checked out the first 3 and Mr. Morgan seems to have a fundamental and possible purposeful misunderstanding of how to interpret Genesis. He makes the naive assumption that the verses describing creation after chapter 2 are to be understood as strictly linear structure even though the wording of the text doesn’t demand it because it makes it easy to say “see look, contradiction!!!” He has chosen to adopt this perspective to make his point. A brief examination of a study Bible will show you that for every supposed contradiction (at least that I have found) there is another equally valid (in my opinion) perspective to view it in which it makes total sense. To truly comprehend the Bible you must understand it’s history, the process by which it was written, and how translations can be understood and considered from the original language to English.

       I mean, of course you can stretch and bend it to explain things away. But if the word so so flexible it can keep being reinterpreted to fit whatever you want it to mean it doesn’t have any value.

       Interpretation is not the same as fabrication. It’s possible to interpret the Bible’s words in different ways depending on your perspective and level of knowledge. Even Christians disagree with each other on certain aspects of biblical doctrine, which is fine and unavoidable because the Bible itself says it’s not a comprehensive work of divine understanding. But it gives us what God decided we need to understand his omnipotent truth. The important part is that we all agree that Jesus Christ is the Risen son of God.

       Well the fact that the people who all believe it can’t even agree on what it means only seems to prove the point that it’s contradictory.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more to the point, if something can literally be interpreted to mean one thing or the complete opposite of that thing I find that to be contradictory.

       No, but there are clear measurements of how verified any specific claim is. For example you can quantify the number of times a specific experiment has been replicated, or how many times a paper has been cited (another way of community verification), you can even see what foundational basis any specific theory or hypothesis has.

       For some scientific claims that’s true, but there are other theories that are impossible to quantify. In those instances it becomes a matter of subjective reasoning and critical analysis. Same goes for biblical debates.

       Oh I thought you said quantify in which case I was referring to theories like the big bang theory or many aspects of astronomical theory; ideas that have become considered mainstream yet cannot be verified or replicated through experimentation. If you're talking about citations and foundational bases then its the same thing with biblical theology. You can assess your own opinion based on what past theologians have put forward and generally agreed/disagreed upon same as you can with scientific literature. The big difference is that theology deals in arguments and logical deductive reasoning almost exclusively (empirical archaeological evidence does come into play for certain topics like confirming that certain people or places existed in the past that the bible describes) while scientific literature, for some areas of study at least, deal in experimental data as well as deductive reasoning and generally agreed upon assumptions.

       Well in science it is generally accepted that whichever theory or hypothesis is currently the best explanation of given evidence is the most right. Science also has no qualms about allowing paradigms to shift and long standing beliefs to topple when the evidence points in a new way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If religion is using the same metric that seems problematic. If I believe the preacher that gets the most citations, then do I have to completely rework my faith every time
A different preacher rises to prominence?

       First off, scientific consensus is actually very rigid and highly resistant to change unless an idea is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt and still certain unproven assumptions persist despite an inherent lack of empirical evidence (evolution). So you’re not really dealing with a system of logical objectivity. Modern science resembles dogmatic religion more than most want to admit. But yes, consensus shifts but to characterize it as a toppling of beliefs is misleading. More like a chipping away. Just ask Galileo. But now your describing where science and religion (Christianity specifically) diverge. Whereas science is a process of evolutionary thought, subject to change as our collective human perspective changes, Christianity is a system of belief committed to cementing basic divine Truths into human consciousness based on a clearly defined set of assumptions gifted to us from God. We aren’t looking for Truth because we believe we’ve already found it whereas science is subject to the whims of incomplete and ever changing data sets.

       So one basis the conclusions based on seeking truth the other bends truth (interpretations as mentioned earlier in the conversation) to fit their predetermined conclusion. Pretty well sums up why I don’t believe in Christianity.

      <p>
       Also you are objectively wrong about evolution. There is a ton of empirical evidence, but I’m guessing that someone who would deny that well known fact is not someone I’m going to have a productive conversation with on the matter.

       Beyond a shadow of a doubt is your own terminology, not actually a standard used in science. The fact that you use it all shows you fundamentally don't understand the methodology used by scientists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm contesting the specific statement " despite an inherent lack of empirical evidence (evolution)". We have plenty of empirical evidence and certainly enough to prove Evolution as a valid theory with scientific certainty. There is a very comprehensive fossil record when you take into account the amount of fossils we'd expect to find given the rarity of them. There is also several instances of evolution that has been observed in modern day including studies with gnats developing different numbers of eyes over generations and mud skippers in the wild. Evolution specifically is has a very high degree of empirical evidence when compared with other scientific theories.

       Typically something that is proven is done so with 100% certainty. Not sure what you think I’m missing there. But basically there’s enough evidence supporting the theory of evolution for you believe it’s true. The rest you put faith into it being proven eventually. And I don’t contest microevolutionary processes. I contest the idea that all life stemmed from single celled organisms, if which there is no evidence. In fact there’s a insane LACK of evidence. But you’ve begun arguing semantics and attacking me personally so I think I’m out. Happy new year, God bless

       Not quite. I’m basing it on Logical reasoning. It’s more a philosophical matter, but there is an important distinction in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic can be independently checked, even if it is not tangible. I believe logical consistencies to be meritorious when it comes to matters about the nature of the universe itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a nuanced point and difficult to explain in this kind of format, but essentially there are certain claims that should produce physical evidence and thus that would be the standard for them. Then there are other claims which cannot be proven physically (typically matters of faith) and so logic should be applied in those cases in my opinion.

       1) The response I would provide to this is if God does not follow the same consistency’s we expect and find in everything else that truly exists, to what extent can we say he exists in our world? I will grant the possibility of the “God of the gaps” if you will, but this certainly does not seem to be the same god we see in religious texts. My specific contention was that god as described in the Bible (or similar texts) does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) basically the same as above. This could well be true, but specifically it does not seem to allow for any of the specifics Gods we see spelled out in those texts to exist as described in those texts.

       Not ignorant. They don’t want their worldview reshaped by inconvenient truths. Buying into the bullshit is way more comfortable than understanding reality and people tend to flee from cognitive dissonance. We were raised to believe authority has our best interests at heart and isn’t capable of purposeful evil. It’s difficult and unpleasant to come to terms with the fact that that’s really not the case at all. It’s easier to ride off than to take a closer look

       You should expect that and have answers ready, especially for very common questions. That's part of your job. If you're going to take it upon yourself to tell people controversial information, you need to be able to defend it properly.

       As of late it seems a ton of people are still hanging onto Trump Russia collusion like their paychecks depended on it. And with the revelations that a DoJ official's wife paid for the dossier with Fusion GPS and everyone in the FBI was in on it as well as Eric Schmidt and Google, there is more evidence that this whole story was completely constructed by the deep state for an "insurance policy."

       Facial Recognition Databases- Approximately half of adult Americans’ photographs are stored in facial recognition databases that can be accessed by the FBI, without their knowledge or consent; Facebook is expanding how it uses facial recognition to find people in photos. From today, the company will notify users when someone uploads a photo with them in it — even if they’re not tagged.

       The US Opiate Epidemic Was Engineered-Opium production in Afghanistan has been on the rise since U.S. occupation started in 2001; Afghanistan's opium poppy production goes into more than 90% of heroin worldwide; About 2.1 million people are estimated to have an opioid use disorder in America — and experts widely agree this is, if anything, an underestimate; Since 1999, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids (including prescription opioids and heroin) quadrupled.

       The Dodge Challenger did not hit Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, according to the video that is available. I have seen people get angry when told this and their response is "If that was true then the news would have said so." Even so, they refuse to watch the video themselves. And the "alternative fact" of that event, no one will believe that video evidence exists that the maroon van blocked that intersection for a long period of time beforehand either.

       It is a strange situation I see at times where a person will refute proof in this manner.

       Witches and vampires live among us. The vampires suck people’s bloods to stay young and the witches brew potions of youth. One of the ingredients in the potion is fresh baby meat.

       see the other thread for my answer on this.  if you're asking for what events i've experienced (ie. the incidences) and what i've deduced from these incidents (ie. my logic) then you're still not be satisfied as there will be no way to validate that these things actually happened.

       Just checked out the first 3 and Mr. Morgan seems to have a fundamental and possible purposeful misunderstanding of how to interpret Genesis. He makes the naive assumption that the verses describing creation after chapter 2 are to be understood as strictly linear structure even though the wording of the text doesn’t demand it because it makes it easy to say “see look, contradiction!!!” He has chosen to adopt this perspective to make his point. A brief examination of a study Bible will show you that for every supposed contradiction (at least that I have found) there is another equally valid (in my opinion) perspective to view it in which it makes total sense. To truly comprehend the Bible you must understand it’s history, the process by which it was written, and how translations can be understood and considered from the original language to English.

       if you see a bird fly and you tell your friends you saw a bird fly, how will you prove it?  you know you saw the bird fly, but you have no way to replay the incident to them so they can see it too.  all you can do is describe what you saw.  yet it is true that the bird flew and you saw it.  the burden of truth and the burden of proof are entirely different things.
