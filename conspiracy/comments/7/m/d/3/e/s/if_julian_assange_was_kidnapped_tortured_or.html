       After all the following and research I've done, my intuition tells me he was kidnapped by the good guys and kept under wraps/protected. He's been protected ever since and will soon help take down "the swamp."

       I hope you are right.  But my intuition says we'd have heard at least something from someone.  Its been nothing for over a year.  Not even on the chans of a anon saying they witnessed the raid or something,
      </p>
      <p>
       Your theory would tie up the bizarre happenings this past year but I just dont know.

       I feel like the swamp would also know about this as well and would leak it.

       I generally agree, but if this takedown/story is as big as we all hope it is, it will have to be done under air tight, zero-chance of failure circumstances.

       As FBIAnon said, if they do it slowly, "we" (anons/concerned citizens) will get frustrated and upset with how slow everything is moving. And I, for one, have been frustrated.

       This is what I believe. I think he's been working with the Trump administration behind the scenes to bring to light bullet proof dirt on many big guns in Washington and abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's taking a long time for obvious reasons, but when this stuff comes out, it'll completely up-end the globalists and change the world in a big way. WikiLeaks will essentially cease to exist (at least as it once was), but Assange + Trump admin are certainly making it a worthwhile sacrifice.
      </p>

       No proof, but this is my guess. It makes sense to me more than any other explanations

       I disagree.  If he was kidnapped or killed and WL announced that in October people would have gone absolutely nuts.  Similar to how they will react if Mueller indicts Trump and the theory that Mueller is one of our guys is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be the single greatest rallying cry by WL ever and would make Julian a martyr.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact as we know in the blockchain were messages from WL telling us our conspiracy theories about his health and what happened were detrimental to the movement and they told us to stop.  WL and Julians absolute silence to this day about what happened to him in October also suggests this.  He's never addressed those people on here and elsewhere who to this day are worried about him and genuinely want to see him freed and want to see him given a medal by Trump.  Had WL announced he was kidnapped in October it would have likely caused Hillary to be arrested I think.  WL would have posted the statement Hillary made about droning Assange, WL would release the proof the Trump Russia thing was a lie, and would say they murdered Assange.

       Assange also has appeared publicly, even on the balcony of the embassy. Any troll claiming he was killed last year is implicitly making wild, baseless accusations about body doubles for no reason.

       And by "soft-on-Russia stance" you mean Julian Assange was given a TV show on RT, Russia's government funded media outlet, and since has refused to say or release anything critical of Putin or Russia despite claiming to have compromising material “about Russia, about your government and your businessmen.”

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Система Оперативно-Розыскных Мероприятий, literally "System for Operative Investigative Activities") is the technical specification for lawful interception interfaces of telecommunications and telephone networks operating in Russia. The current form of the specification enables the targeted surveillance of both telephone and Internet communications. Initially implemented in 1995 to allow access to surveillance data for the FSB, in subsequent years the access has been widened to other law enforcement agencies.

        A ministerial order from the Russian Ministry of Communications from 16 April 2014 introduced requirements for the new wiretapping system SORM-3. Telecommunications operators were required to install compliant equipment by 31 March 2015.[7]

       Quit your paranoid delusional xenophobig ravings. Russia is not a great country. True. They have a very bad track record with journalists and enemies of the sate. But suggesting that Russia's transgressions somehow magically outweigh those of the United States is ludicrous.
      </p>
      <p>
       What actions has modern Russia committed that even remotely approach the death toll in Iraq or Afghanistan? What actions has Russia committed to rival the US based drone assassination program that murders people without even knowing who they are?

       Not to mention the fact that WL has released a lot of documents on Russian in the last year, but you don't care, because you don't read or know a single damn thing about other countries.

       Nobody has had any decent explanation for this very basic, incontrovertible fact. Uuntil this fact is addressed, it is impossible to trust wikileaks. Not saying it isn't important to watch what is going with them, but I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.

       Assange explained it during his AMA: he
       <em>
        wants
       </em>
       people to doubt him and be skeptical of WL releases because he realized how dangerous it is to have his online identity tied so strongly to something that isn't torture proof. If he's kidnapped and tortured into giving up his key, then whoever has it can assume his online identity without anyone noticing. Imagine the amount of damage they could do because so many people assume the key to be flawless.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the long run it's better if people constantly doubt Assange instead of taking his word (with the key verification) as gospel.

       The way i understand it, assange said never to trust WL if they couldn't dole out the authentication. Thats why the PGP was created in the 1st place. Seems silly to create an crytokey and never to use it.

       yes ,pretty sure about it. The story of ecuator its a big lie. If you know too much you are murdered and Assange know ( or used to know) the true about everything. A true that we are never going to know. I really hope to be wrong,we need more people as him...

       I agree on all of that and think Assange is probably alive and being kept in the embassy, but I would just like to say that most of the anons don't have any 'inside knowledge' they're probably neckbeards who want to kill some time and make themselves feel special or something like that, take Q for example didn't he predict Pelosi will get indicted or something a few weeks ago?

       That's a simple morph cut (a transition between two clips). They just used it because he probably paused for a while or say something they didn't want to air.

       It's not a simple morph cut you don't make cuts when a person is speaking that obvious small not entire frame glitch occurs in the middle of a word in the middle of a sentence you lying piece of shit.

       What's that download, and how is it related?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have years of experience in video editing and 3D animation. Show me another example of a human CGI recreation being that realistic. All current CGI humans look obviously CGI to the trained eye; the skin is waxy, the eyes are dead, and the hair looks odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say for the sake of argument that Assange is CGI in that video. Why would RT of all companies be interested in hoaxing an interview? Why would they let such an obvious glitch in the 3D rig into the final render?

       He's lying about being an expert and saying the glitch is due to a morph cut despite the fact that it happens in the middle of a word. No editor would make a transitional cut while someone was speaking unless it was to a different camera which is 100% not the case here.

       Not arguing that it is a hoax, but it would make sense for RT to be in on it if it was. The idea being that Russia took or killed Assange to gain control of wikileaks.

       I agree, but its still possible. Intelligence agencies don't always like to admit that other countries are out playing them. Personally I think Assange wants revenge on the US and its government or he got paid off, or a combo of the two.

       Imo it's a morph cut or a similar effect (depending on software used). The issue was he blinked and moved a little so the cut wasn't smooth.
