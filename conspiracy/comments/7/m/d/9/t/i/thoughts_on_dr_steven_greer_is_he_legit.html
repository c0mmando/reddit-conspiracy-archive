    <div class="md"><p>The guy&#39;s <em>super</em> legit.  You&#39;ll find many (like the previous user) who say what they say, but you don&#39;t get anyone who put together The Disclosure Project those years ago who <em>isn&#39;t</em> legit.</p>

<p>Does he know everything there is to know about ETs?  Of course not.  Has he been compromised?  Perhaps.  Does he at times act like he knows it all?  Sure.</p>

<p>Does that mean he&#39;s not legit?</p>

<p>Absolutely not.</p>

<p>The dude&#39;s more legit than almost anyone else who&#39;s popularized ET and UFO info in the last decade or so.  That says a lot.  Does he have haters?  Of course.  He has a shit ton of them.  Most of those people are simply jealous and butt hurt.  Greer doesn&#39;t do a great deal to dissuade such butt hurt jealousy, however, because - again - he does act a bit like a know it all sometimes.</p>

<p>He&#39;s legit though.</p>

<p>Just don&#39;t go toward him OR ANYONE thinking they&#39;re the panacea of all things ET/UFO.  No one on Earth is.  Dr. Greer is a valuable source of information on the subject.  There are other sources, however.</p>

<p>Study as much as possible.</p>

<p>Exactly.  That should tell you a lot right there.  Easy for someone to come on and say “Nuh uh!  He suuucks!”  Lot harder to do what he’s doing and bring up the sources he does.</p>

<p>Look into Dr. John Mack.  Amazing Pulitzer Prize winning psychiatrist from Harvard who did a lot of research into people who had contact experiences.</p>

<p>Yeah.  It can be needle in a haystack work at times.  Lots of stuff, lots of junk.  There are definitely nuggets of valid data in there though.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He’s compromised in the sense that he’s likely been fed some corrupt information that he’s then disseminated.  He’s super legit in the sense that he has promulgated the spread of valid ET/UFO information far more than almost any other figure in the last decade plus.</p>

<p>Both options can exist simultaneously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my mind, someone who&#39;s been compromised by intelligence or other nefarious parties is the diametric opposite of legit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A) It depends on how they’re compromised.  I don’t doubt that Greer has, again, been fed false information, and I also don’t doubt that he has an ego that has possibly got him to move toward certain bits of information that are perhaps not entirely accurate.  However, B) what he has legitimately does is about as legit as it gets.</p>

<p>An EMT worker who’s saved dozens of lives can also be an asshole who, for example, abuses his wife and kids.  In that sense, he’s a piece of shit asshole, but also a life saver - legitimately and both at the same time.</p>

I also find it strange that he has almost no bio before his early-mid 30s and I couldn&#39;t really find much info about his family either.  Just lots of red flags to me.  Obviously I could be wrong but over the years I&#39;ve learned to trust my gut in the majority of situations and that&#39;s what my gut tells me about him.

<p>when I look at Greer I just see &quot;spook&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if he’s a spook, he’s a spook that helmed The Disclosure Project.  That alone fully qualifies as what I said above in that he is/may be compromised (a “spook”) and yet has done a great, <em>great</em> deal for the legitimization of the reality of ET existence on and around this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To me he looks like a military guy and I don&#39;t trust his eyes or mannerisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not about trust.  Don’t “trust” anything or anyone.  That won’t get one very far when it comes to finding out the truth of matters as deep and important as this topic.  It’s about the legitimacy of one’s actions.  He’s done many things that are fully legitimate.  He’s also done things that various individuals have questioned.  Sure.  Again, I’m not saying he’s a saint for a minute.  I don’t think anyone is.</p>

<p>He doesn’t have to be in order to still have brought out more information relating to ET disclosure than almost any individual in recent times (if not period), however.</p>

<p>Additionally, and as I said in one of my initial comments above, he’s just one person.  He himself will tell you to research other figures in the field.  One would do well to research not only Dr. Greer’s work, but the work of as many other figures as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously I could be wrong but over the years I&#39;ve learned to trust my gut in the majority of situations and that&#39;s what my gut tells me about him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sift the wheat from the chaff is all.  Take what works.  Discard the rest.  Greer has a lot of valid information.  Take what works.  Discard the rest.  Almost any figure you research in almost <em>any</em> field is going to have both pros and cons.  The key is to, again, be able to sift the wheat from the chaff.  Greer has chaff.  Of course.  Everyone does.  There’s also a lot of wheat in what he presents, however.</p>

<p>Just sift properly is all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the entire UFO/disclosure community is full of agents and littered with disinfo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it is.  I certainly hope you’re not looking for a source that <em>doesn’t</em> have disinfo or dirt surrounding them before investigating further.  One won’t get very far that way.  This planet is controlled by dark figures invested in making sure that the truth and reality of ET existence on and around this planet does <em>not</em> get out to the masses - does <em>not</em> become mainstream.  They compromise everyone they possibly can - and those they can’t compromise? They simply kill.</p>

<p>That’s how they work.</p>

<p>Greer is not exempt from that.  No significant ET public figure is.</p>

<p>Again, sift the wheat from the chaff is all - in what Greer does, in what everyone does.  There&#39;s yin and yang in everything.</p>

<p>I disagree, if he&#39;s a spook it puts the entire legitimacy of the &quot;Disclosure Project&quot; in question.  It also does nothing for the legitimization of ET existence.  I&#39;ll use myself as an example: I personally think he&#39;s a fake, therefore his existence actually <em>de-legitimizes</em> ET existence in my eyes.  His being a fake (assuming he is) automatically makes me less trusting of anyone else who talks about aliens.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Like what?  That&#39;s what I have the problem with.  It&#39;s either he&#39;s a spook or he isn&#39;t, and if he <em>is</em> then how can he have done anything &quot;fully legitimate&quot;.  Basically the job description for an agent is to do many different devious things, none of them legitimate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One would do well to research not only Dr. Greer’s work, but the work of as many other figures as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this of course.  My problem with a lot of researchers in this topic though is so many of them seem suspect.  It&#39;s hard to find any good information, the vast majority just reeks of disinfo and propaganda to me.  Almost all information we have about UFOs and/or ET&#39;s comes from government or military guys, and the rest comes from guys like Greer whose personal biographies are spotty at best.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost any figure you research in almost any field is going to have both pros and cons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m with you on this too.  All I&#39;m saying though is that if the researcher is literally an agent, then the cons are going to far outweigh the pros.  There&#39;s going to be very little wheat in there, and if there is any wheat it&#39;s going to be tainted and corrupted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course it is. I certainly hope you’re not looking for a source that doesn’t have disinfo or dirt surrounding them before investigating further. One won’t get very far that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been investigating the subject for the better part of a decade now.  I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I think basically all UFOs are human military craft, and that if there are ETs or beings here (and there very well may be), they are benevolent and are basically just letting us do our own thing without involving themselves.  I think creepy guys like Greer do far more harm than good and if tomorrow I saw on CNN that there was some &quot;alien threat&quot;, I would instantly think it was fake a la Bluebeam.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The people in TDP did and said what they did and said.  They provided the evidence and the data they did.  It doesn’t matter what the auspices under which they did so were.  If you say 2+2 is 4, it doesn’t matter <em>where</em> or how you say it.  2+2 <em>is</em> in fact 4.  As such, Dr. Greer having gathered the truth tellers that he did is, again, more than anyone else has done up to this point - and it matters not if it was under the auspices of the Rockerfeller family or not.  It matters not that more could have been divulged.  It matters not that more data could have been divulged and may not have been.  The point is that what was divulged was more than any other public forum had prior accomplished, and Dr. Greer helmed that.  No intelligent, thinking mind can invalidate that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It also does nothing for the legitimization of ET existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems an uncritical, unthinking perspective to me - not a fault of TDP, but of the interpreter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally think Greer&#39;s a fake, therefore his existence actually de-legitimizes ET existence in my eyes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, that is the fault of simple lack of critical thinking, not of the presentation or the information itself.  Your unwillingness to sift the wheat from the chaff means that you discard chaff - sure - but you also end up throwing away much wheat as well.  That ultimately hurts no one but yourself because you deny yourself the wheat in throwing away the chaff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His being a fake (assuming he is) automatically makes me less trusting of anyone else who talks about aliens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re putting the cart before the horse, however.  Your assuming he’s a fake means means that you end up disregarding entire swaths of the dynamic that in fact very much aren’t fake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like what? That&#39;s what I have the problem with. It&#39;s either he&#39;s a spook or he isn&#39;t, and if he is then how can he have done anything &quot;fully legitimate&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The individuals gathered and that disclosed what they did in TDP is more than had occurred otherwise up until that point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically the job description for an agent is to do many different devious things, none of them legitimate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then by your very definition, Dr. Greer’s <em>not</em> an agent or a “spook” because he’s definitely done quite a lot that’s very legitimate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My problem with a lot of researchers in this topic though is so many of them seem suspect. It&#39;s hard to find any good information, the vast majority just reeks of disinfo and propaganda to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then it seems your only option is to simply stop researching ET information altogether since it seems that perhaps everyone is compromised in your eyes, and if someone is even a <em>little</em> bit compromised, then they shouldn’t be paid attention to at all.</p>

<p>This perspective seems a caustic one that eats itself up from the inside and ends up in a stand still based on its own foundational corrosiveness.  Perhaps I’m misinterpreting, but your base line perspective seems to almost assume that there can’t be anyone on the planet that disseminates valid info.  That predisposes all data gathered toward the negative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost all information we have about UFOs and/or ET&#39;s comes from government or military guys, and the rest comes from guys like Greer whose personal biographies are spotty at best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And much, <em>much</em> true and valid information and data can be gathered from the investigation of these sources - sources that are significantly compromised, sure, but that do nonetheless have valid data in them if one knows how to find and gather it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if the researcher is literally an agent, then the cons are going to far outweigh the pros.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not if you know how to intelligently gather the data from a possible agent.  You have to think about the fact that a vast and overwhelming portion of the most advanced technologies that all nations possess come from their gathering said technologies <em>from agents</em> that did not want said data divulged.  In other words, the information was gathered from agents that obscured and lied about the information gathered.</p>

<p>The point here is that even if a source <em>is</em> “an agent”, the idea that the source should be disregarded robs no one but you yourself of the potential of accruing great amounts of true and valid data and information if you know how to properly gather and interpret the information you get.</p>

<p>In other words, it’s not about whether a source is “from an agent” or not.  It’s about what <em>you</em> can understand from that source.  It’s about the data that <em>you</em> can gather and sift from the information you gather off that source.</p>

<p>Quite, quite incorrect, in fact.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There’s everything on this planet.  There are benevolent off worlders living here for sure.  However, there are other off worlders that are very much <em>not</em> benevolent.  A good portion of them ultimately (and unfortunately) actually run the planet in fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think creepy guys like Greer do far more harm than good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think information has to be understood and properly interpreted - and that is up to the individual themselves to undertake that proper interpretation.  I think that too many people depend too much on the information that others give, and take that information in without properly understanding the variegated ways in which the data must be filtered.  Too many don’t understand that data on this planet won’t get spoon-fed and must ultimately be properly interpreted.  People like Dr. Greer offer a great deal of valuable data that - if properly interpreted by a sufficiently intelligent mind - can offer a wealth of valid data that would not otherwise be able to be obtained.  For this reason, he is an extremely valuable asset on the path toward ET truth - certainly one of the most valuable that has come out in recent times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me preface this by saying that I always appreciate your perspective and the fact that you and I over the years have usually found common ground even where we ultimately don&#39;t agree - such as in this case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This seems an uncritical, unthinking perspective to me - not a fault of TDP, but of the interpreter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s actually the reverse.  It&#39;s a highly critical perspective, because I&#39;m interpreting the data he presents through the lens of my opinion about him as a whole.  I don&#39;t entirely dismiss it all out of hand, but I do analyze it critically in light of his being a potential agent.  If someone I trust tells me they saw an ET I would be far more compelled to believe them or investigate their claim than I would be if a CIA agent told me the same thing.  The uncritical thing to do would be to just take his words at face value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So then by your very definition, Dr. Greer’s not an agent or a “spook” because he’s definitely done quite a lot that’s very legitimate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well if he&#39;s working with or for the government then nothing he&#39;s doing is very legitimate, at least not the way I would define &quot;legitimate&quot;.  I guess you could make the argument that even intelligence agencies and propagandists put out &quot;legitimate&quot; information, meaning that they release truth mixed up with lies and disinfo, and in that sense I agree - but that isn&#39;t what I think of when I think legitimate.  Legitimate information to me is honest, truthful information with no spin and no agenda behind it.  Rare in the modern world to be sure, and even more so when it comes to the subject of ETs/UFOs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I’m misinterpreting, but your base line perspective seems to almost assume that there can’t be anyone on the planet that disseminates valid info. That predisposes all data gathered toward the negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well it&#39;s a valid concern on this subject because I think there&#39;s a lot of provable disinformation out there and a lot of the data comes from the military and government.  It&#39;s one of those few topics that just has a ton of white noise surrounding it, which makes sense considering the implications, people, and technology involved.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that no valid info can be gathered, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s very difficult to determine what&#39;s valid and what isn&#39;t when the people giving you the information are attempting to spin you.  But of course, sometimes the most valid info can be gathered from those who are lying, as they essentially reveal the truth through their lies and omissions.  You probably won&#39;t agree, but that&#39;s how I feel about a the UFO and disclosure communities - their lies have led me to what I consider the truth about UFOs: that they&#39;re human craft in all or mostly all cases.  Regarding other beings/ETs, that&#39;s a different conversation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point here is that even if a source is “an agent”, the idea that the source should be disregarded robs no one but you yourself of the potential of accruing great amounts of true and valid data and information if you know how to properly gather and interpret the information you get.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do agree with this.  But I guess what I&#39;m saying is that the &quot;true and valid data&quot; from guys like Greer is few and far between, at least from where I&#39;m sitting.  I don&#39;t claim to have all the answers though.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve had it sitting around for the last year or two but haven&#39;t read more than the first chapter or 2 yet.  Bramley is another one with no bio and no personal history/genealogy listed anywhere, but having said that I trust your opinion and will give it a chance before I say anything against him or the book since it wouldn&#39;t really be fair to judge it without finishing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your initial statements.  You are definitely a user that I have been in agreement with much more often than not.  Even with this Greer issue, I think that we ultimately are on the same boat and on the same team.  We both are moving toward the dissemination of ET truth.  That’s what we want and research on behalf of.</p>

<p>We obviously don’t agree with everything.  We obviously have different perspectives on Dr. Greer - though I don’t think as different as you might suppose.  Again, as I said initially, I don’t think he’s the panacea of all things ET.  I just don’t think he’s an anathema either as many do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a highly critical perspective, because I&#39;m interpreting the data he presents through the lens of my opinion about him as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But wait a minute.  It seems to me that you must first assess the validity of the foundational strata itself from which that opinion springs - i.e. the lens of your opinion.  Being your opinion, it may not be as valid as you might think.  This, of course, is the case with me and my opinion as well.  This is the case with all of us/everyone.  I’m just saying that perhaps you may not want to take your perspective for granted as the correct one (or at least the only correct one) in this particular case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t entirely dismiss it all out of hand, but I do analyze it critically in light of his being a potential agent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that you’ve been saying that if he’s a potential agent, then that <em>entirely</em> invalidates any data or information he might have.  I believe this might be the crux of your argument.  You and I are not in disagreement that he might be a potential (and thereby compromised) agent.  Yes.  However, we do seem to be in disagreement where it regards what his potentially being an agent actually <em>means</em>.  I believe you think it means that nothing he says can be looked upon with any level of validity, whereas I don’t happen to think that in the least, and feel that <em>much</em> of the information he has disseminated can be and is quite valuable indeed; valuable not only from the perspective of what <em>not</em> to do and what <em>not</em> to go toward and pay attention to and say, but also from the perspective of what nuggets of ET data are in fact potentially valid and truthful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If someone I trust tells me they saw an ET I would be far more compelled to believe them or investigate their claim than I would be if a CIA agent told me the same thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh most certainly.  Agreed.  We’re not just talking about something as simple as one single ET sighting claim here, however.  We’re talking about an absolutely voluminous amount of information over the course of almost <em>three decades</em> where it regards Dr. Steven Greer.</p>

<p>Singlehandedly discarding all that information with no regard for how much of it is valid will absolutely miss quite a lot of truth regarding the state of ETs and exopolitics on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The uncritical thing to do would be to just take his words at face value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But no one’s saying to do anything of the like.  Not in the least.  I’m saying the exact opposite of that as a matter of fact.  Taking in words at face value is uncritical.  Correct.  Discarding everything en toto is just as uncritical, however.  It’s just the opposite end of the extreme spectrum is all.  Both perspectives are imbalanced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if he&#39;s working with or for the government then nothing he&#39;s doing is very legitimate, at least not the way I would define &quot;legitimate&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who then would you consider legitimate?  Serious question.  I wouldn’t be surprised if every public figure that’s openly talked about ETs has had at least <em>some</em> contact or influence by the CIA, TPTB, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess you could make the argument that even intelligence agencies and propagandists put out &quot;legitimate&quot; information, meaning that they release truth mixed up with lies and disinfo, and in that sense I agree - but that isn&#39;t what I think of when I think legitimate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What <em>do</em> you think of when you think of legitimate then?  100% truth?  There is no such thing as “legitimate” on this planet then if that’s one’s definition.  One would never accomplish anything if they were waiting for that kind of legitimacy before they moved forward.</p>

<p>This is a civilization of lies.  That is the planet we live on, unfortunately.  The key is not to wait for full on truth, but to (again) sift the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Legitimate information to me is honest, truthful information with no spin and no agenda behind it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the CIA can (and absolutely does) covertly feed bogus information to honest, unsuspecting people who then report it to others in an honest and truthful manner with no spin and no agenda behind it.  These types would be disseminating bogus information, yet according to the standards you outlined here, you would end up ultimately believing their false data.</p>

<p>Information can be legitimate even if has spin and an agenda behind it as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I’m misinterpreting, but your base line perspective seems to almost assume that there can’t be anyone on the planet that disseminates valid info. That predisposes all data gathered toward the negative.</p>

<p>Well it&#39;s a valid concern on this subject because I think there&#39;s a lot of provable disinformation out there and a lot of the data comes from the military and government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a valid concern, but I don’t see it as one that necessarily ever has to prevent one from continuing to move forward with the gathering of relevant ET data.  One can still accrue quite a lot of valid ET information even going through channels that are questionable if they learn to properly discern what’s valid and what’s not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s one of those few topics that just has a ton of white noise surrounding it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  It’s likely <em>the</em> topic full of noise.  Why?  It’s because it’s possibly the most important topic on this planet.  I’d say it <em>definitely</em> the most important topic on this planet, and everything else is second to it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which makes sense considering the implications, people, and technology involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that no valid info can be gathered, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s very difficult to determine what&#39;s valid and what isn&#39;t when the people giving you the information are attempting to spin you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  This is why it’s important to do much ongoing analysis (comparative and otherwise) on every individual and topic investigated in this field.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But of course, sometimes the most valid info can be gathered from those who are lying, as they essentially reveal the truth through their lies and omissions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly this.  This is part of my very point with Dr. Greer.  I’m personally not saying that “all he does is lie”.  No.  I <em>am</em> saying, however, that even if all he does do <em>is</em> lie and even if he is a CIA spook, you can still gather a LOT from everything he’s said…because he’s said a LOT for 27+ years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You probably won&#39;t agree, but that&#39;s how I feel about a the UFO and disclosure communities - their lies have led me to what I consider the truth about UFOs: that they&#39;re human craft in all or mostly all cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s nothing about that that I would disagree with.  I imagine that <em>most</em> UFOs are indeed quite possibly human-made.  That doesn’t matter, of course, because the cases that don’t fall in the “most” category are still sufficient to show and prove that we are most definitely <em>not</em> anywhere near alone in this cosmos, in this galaxy, in this solar system, and on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the &quot;true and valid data&quot; from guys like Greer is few and far between</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possibly.  That doesn’t keep the data he’s given from being very valuable because there is a LOT of data he’s disseminated.</p>

<p>Let’s say only 15% of what he’s said is valid.  That’s 15% of almost three decades worth of ET information.</p>

<p>That’s a <em>lot</em> of ET truth in that 15%.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t discard that for even a moment.  I understand that many might simply want to throw out the baby with the bathwater, but I think that a lot of valuable information would likely be discarded if one were to do that.</p>

<p>His perspective that all ETs are benevolent is incorrect.  Definitely.  That does not invalidate everything he’s done or accomplished, however.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are confusing “new age religion” with the actual, bonafide, proven benefits of meditation - collective and individual.  This one’s not a fault of Dr. Greer, but of your own lack of understanding in this particular area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OH also, he wants money?</p>

<p>This is planet Earth.  Money is still a primary medium of exchange.  That he charges money for certain goods and services in no way invalidates him or the goods and services themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many others who can provide proof,</p>

<p>I am like you, I have seen almost every UFO evidence and documentary. I was so into it at one point that it became my life.</p>

<p>My conclusion now is that it&#39;s all propaganda, especially now that all the fake news networks (Time, New York Times, WaPo, etc.) are spewing the same shit. It is a very sad truth to realize but it seems that it is far more likely that we have all been duped. I mean.. look at &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot;...</p>

<p>Why? Because the powers that be have been hiding technology they stole from Nikola Tesla that would convince pretty much everyone that it is &quot;aliens&quot; if they came out with it.</p>

<p>They will use this against us. Pay attention, the red flag that will prove this theory is if the narrative becomes that &quot;we are facing an alien THREAT&quot;</p>

<p>Why would aliens be visiting us for 100 or 1000 years only to destroy us now? It makes no sense, hostile aliens would destroy us immediately and not give us the pleasure of flying around playing hide and seek for this long.</p>

<p>The alien &quot;threat&quot; is the propaganda, the new &quot;terrorist&quot; to continue their perpetual war game and to bring about the one world government that is so obviously what they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After spending countless hours watching his interviews, interviews conducted by him with his eyewitnesses, reading about his work and discerning the points of his critics, I can say that I personally believe him. </p>

<p>There is much more to his cause than just the UFO equation, as this ties into coverup across the spectrum of nearly every major institution. The suppression of advanced tech (which we&#39;ve both developed and reverse engineered), the suppression and destruction of consciousness (a massive topic in itself), the coverups in regards to weather modification and the grave implications of such programs, etc, etc. </p>

<p>Greer may come off as eccentric and strange but that&#39;s a trait that can be found in anyone. To completely discredit someone based off of this is petty. Hes a 6ft+, jacked, nerdy-looking former trauma dr, and has accumulated a hell of a lot of information about some very profound topics, not your average joe. His movies and well constructed media outreach is are done the way they are as people in today&#39;s society will not take anything seriously if it doesn&#39;t look at least half legit. Too many claim that he&#39;s just using these programs to make money, etc. when it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth as he has given up far more in earnings by leaving his former profession. The money goes back into the program and to help create more easy to digest information for the willing masses. </p>

<p>You may also claim that if he planned to fully disclose this new tech or all evidence on UFOs, then why doesn&#39;t he just do it. Well, it&#39;s not that simple. He and his initiatives are going about it legally. Dotting their i&#39;s and crossing their t&#39;s. Any slip up can get them or their witnesses in serious legal trouble, put under extreme duress or killed. Let&#39;s not forget, what he and others in different subject areas are doing is fighting against a deeply-rooted, deep-state system that does not operate within the realm of law in some instances. Which, also makes it very difficult to prove its existence to those who are uninitiated on the subject. </p>

<p>They have no need to eliminate him and others right away as it is easiest to hide truth in plain sight. There is so much disinformation and misinformation out there, side by side with factual truths, that it becomes next to impossible for someone who has not spent hours upon hours absorbing information and using sound judgement to draw logical  conclusions. There is far too much heresay and simple-minded people with little mental fortitude, egos that refuse to relent, and an inability to reach conclusions based off of true objective research, can very easily get lost. Lest we forget, this inability to properly comprehend is a case-in-point example of the success of the current and ongoing execution of social programming. </p>

<p>A war has been going on for generations and many haven&#39;t the slightest clue. But a war with guns and bombs but one in the minds, psyches of each and every individual. We can no longer think clearly as there is too much noise in the shape of official &quot;news&quot;, sports, entertainment, memes and other nonsense keeping us distracted, all the while we live with the completely ignorant belief that we are at the pinnacle of technological and socio-politocal advancement. We could quite literally be a trans-dimensional, infinitely renewable society at complete peace and with an overabundance of riches for all had our leaders decided to act in the best interests of humanity. </p>

<p>We do not display the traits of an intelligent race. This is why, in my opinion, many people have a difficulty in believing Greer and his claims because they dont have a full understanding of the MASSIVE overall coverup that spans so many of these different topics. I have seen elements of Greers claims validated through the work and exploration in other areas of study and the same goes for others.  When so many dots connect through so many areas, it becomes harder and harder to refute the facts. </p>

<p>Greer, his teams, initiatives, and witnesses all propose a very plausible scenario and I truly believe that there is far more truth to it than most people give it credit for. His CE5 Protocol for instance, ive seen so many clueless individuals attempt to debunk and discredit his efforts by saying that these are cash grabs or that they are completely bogus. That the idea that you can contact and summon ETs through meditation is complete nonsesene. These are the same people who have likely spent no time exploring and researching human consciousness and the purpose of our 4th dimensional sensitivity, and who didn&#39;t even have the gal to actually attempt the protocol. Having done so multiple times and having multiple instances of what I&#39;d deem successful contact, I can personally vouch for this claim and, coupled with my understanding of human and the universal consciousness, can see the deep implications of such success.  </p>

<p>I ask that if you are to truly try to judge Greer, spend the hours upon hours researching not only he and his cause, but look into the likes of Graham Hancock, Paul Hellyer, Dane Wiggington, Russel Targ, Rupert Sheldrake, and Tom Bearden to name a few. Really put the effort into understanding the big picture here and try to limit how much of the mainstream &quot;noise&quot; you let in. Really try to abandon all preconcieved ideas of truth, official narratives, fear-mongering and just flat out disinformation. Also, be able to entertain the possibility that beings from other realms could be very different from us and not just in a technological sense. For example, assuming highly advanced, transdimensional beings would have societies and thought structures similar to that of our divisive, arrogant and ignorant species is absolutely insane. In order to master transdimensional travel, a very high competence and awareness of consciousness is necessary and  this is not something that we humans can even lie about possessing on a whole. We are trying to comprehend something far beyond our level on understanding that we dont know how to make sense of it. </p>

<p>Kill your ego, do the research, connect the dots and wake the fuck up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, when I look at Greer I just see &quot;spook&quot;.  To me he looks like a military guy and I don&#39;t trust his eyes.  I also find it strange that he has almost no bio before his early-mid 30s and I couldn&#39;t really find much info about his family either.  Just lots of red flags to me.  Obviously I could be wrong but over the years I&#39;ve learned to trust my gut in the majority of situations and that&#39;s what my gut tells me about him.  I think the entire UFO/disclosure community is full of agents and littered with disinfo.</p>
