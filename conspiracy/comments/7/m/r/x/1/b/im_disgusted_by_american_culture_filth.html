       So I’ve been hanging out with my grandma every couple of days. It’s hard for her around Christmas time because my aunt committed suicide a few years back. I’m disturbed. I go over there and all she does
       <em>
        all day long
       </em>
       is watch revamped game shows. People like Alec Baldwin and Harvey Smith hosting. Absolute filth. “Family Feud” might as well be called “Family Inuendo”
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched some of the old school 
episodes from the seventies; it’s much more subtle, but the overarching theme of sexual depravity is still there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s insane to watch grown adults
       <em>
        go nuts
       </em>
       over a few thousand dollars they win for answering basic, sexual questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m with her right now, and Alec Baldwin asked “if milk and cookies were going to get married, cookies would say, “I knew milk was the one because milk always makes me...blank”
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely despicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forgive me if I’m being too zealous, but it struck a nerve.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other day I was babysitting my baby brother and one is his Disney Junior shows has a boy who had “two mommies”
      </p>
      <p>
       I have nothing against gay people, but really? We’re going to confront children with these sexual questions?
      </p>
      <p>
       He’s two years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       My father is a pastor. Greatest man I know. I’m not religious and I despise the church. He does what’s right though. However, sports
       <em>
        dominate
       </em>
       his life. My grandfather too. I like football, but I see it for what it is; a vice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twenty two grown men in tights on a field throwing balls around. It’s a child’s game. It’s unbelievable!
      </p>
      <p>
       These are our heroes! These despicable celebrities who push radical social change on us and these overpaid athletes who couldn’t care less about us!
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me want to throw up.
      </p>
      <p>
       What generation is going to save us? The baby boomers? Idiots. Gen X? Fools. Gen Y? Fools. My fellow millennials? ABSOLUTE GARBAGE
      </p>
      <p>
       At least it’s gotten so bad now that some people have woken up out of necessity, like myself and you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we millennials will pull it off. Whoever saves the world will have been born in the nineties. I don’t know how I know that, but I can sense it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s hard not to pray for an asteroid sometimes.

       Paradigms shift very quickly. Don't get discouraged. Figure out how you want the world to work and dedicate your energy to realizing that goal. I for example think that history is more fiction than reality and has resulted in some very big problems for our society. So I spend my time digging for inconsistencies in the narrative.

       Right but I feel as though it take something as intense as say
       <em>
        a lack of food, water, and basic necessities

       to even start the process of waking the masses up

       You need to watch the documentary century of self. We have entire generations of people that were brought up on consumerism. The corporation is a good documentary as well. Brainwashing has been around for a long time as it is self evident with our political process. There are good people out there but you will rarely see it in the media. I once cared about it like you do; however, as you get older and into your 30s you have to get a job to survive then the rest of society starts wearing you down. Our society is a throw away society.... narcissistic and selfish, all toxic traits.

       Just know that you're not alone in how you feel. Take a deep breath my friend. It's okay that you see through it all. Let these sweet old folks hold onto the last bit of light in this dark world. Let them have their distractions. Let them have their gameshows and their sportsball. It's okay. Just be glad to be here.

       Homosexuality has been discriminated against for millennia, and now that we’ve elected to condone it, it’s being used as

       Bias? I think you should look up that word. I'm neither "for or against" people being gay; it's literally none of my concern one way or the other who someone else loves/fucks. People are gay, bro. That's not a conspiracy, it's not wrong, and most importantly: it's none of your business.

       The fact that you have a problem with children seeing a totally normal couple on tv implies that you think of homosexuality as something that's wrong. Showing two moms is not, in any way, "sexualization" any more than it is to show a mom &amp; dad. Also: Victoria's Secret commercials are sexual to you because you see them that way; I just see fancy chonies on physically fit ladies. The human body can be beautiful outside of sexual context.

       Blind to what, rxactly? You may have left the church but the church didn't leave you. You sound like a sanctimonious old biddy. Not even your grandma passes muster with you. You're too young for this kind of nonsense, you have to learn to focus that energy into the actually important things.

       Are you worried about your own children or those in your family or all children in general? I can sort of understand if you're concerned for your own family, but there is a pretty easy solution to that and that is to not let them watch TV unless you've vetted the programme first. Like people who complain that their child isn't doing well at school, ultimately, it's the parent's responsibility to educate and protect them. If you're really worried then home-school and move to the country. Maybe do something with your kid, teach them how to fish, paint or cook. Just do something with them that means they don't need to watch TV
      </p>

       I definitely believe there are pedophiles who are using the same arguments that gay people used to ensure homosexuality was no longer a crime, but that isn't the fault of gay people. That is a group of molesters twisting an argument. While two gay people  in a relationship are both consenting adults there are pedophiles now trying to say that they want to have relationships with children, but only if they child "consents". What i never see anybody asking these pedophiles is if you believe these kids are old enough to be in a sexual relationship will you also give them power of attorney? Do you definitely trust them enough that if a kid at school says I'll swap you a Ninja Turtle for your house that they'll turn it down? If you suffer a head trauma and the final decision on if they should turn your life-support off goes to the kid, are you're confident that they won't miss your hands and eyes twitch because they're busy putting in your credit card number to get an upgrade on Clash of Clans then I'll at least be more inclined to believe you don't see them as a child, but I somehow highly doubt that any of them do truly believe it's consensual. Like the other commenter said above, I'd be more concerned a child being regularly exposed to violence rather than same-sex relationships, particularly, if those same-sex relationships are monogamous.

       Get over it. People need to eat, shit, sleep and fuck. To act like sex is somehow different from the previous three is absurd. Sex is part of human nature and so long as it's consensual, there's absolutely nothing wrong or sinful about it. Please realize that your puritan sexual guilt comes from how your parents raised you, and not some innate divine guidance on what's wrong and what's right.

       I turned away from the church at seven years old. I had sex at sixteen. I’ve had tons of sex with randos. As harmless as it can be, it’s done more damage than good. I spent a decade practicing black magick. I don’t care about the religions. I care about the children. They shouldn’t be having to be exposed to these things.

       Lol dude! You're on reddit right now—do you understand how many hundreds of virgins will read your post and cringe in jealously thinking "I wanna experience the damage!"? No one feels sorry for your choice to experience life.

       Get your head out of the sand. I doubt there are that many virgins here, they’re probably mostly male, and probably mostly adults.

       Because the likelihood of you actually being a brand-spanking new user is probably in the 5-10% range. With new accounts, it's far more likely (especially on this subreddit) that you're a troll, a "long-time lurker", a LARP, a burner/throwaway account, or a shill, than a legitimate new user who just happened to stroll into this corner of this website.

       I wish more people here would think about the children. I've had it happen to me before that people would downvote me just because I objected to pornography shown on a highway billboard that was hacked. The point is culture is slipping when we don't protect the children. "Oh but sex is natural!" Not for a two year old you sick pedos.

       We all, without realizing it, walk around all day expressing our options in various ways.
      </p>

       I’m just doing so in an honest, sincere way. The views that I’m expressing, I beleive, represent the minority, so it’s understandable that I’m being asaaulted.

       You really are full of yourself buddy.

       You simply focused on the gay aspect (a fairly moot point in my post) either A. Because you are gay and cannot be objective of B. Because you have gay friends and cannot be objective.

       I guess reading comprehension isn't your strong suit. That's OK buddy I'll walk you through this.

      <p>
       It doesn't matter what you do in your real life, I've only commented on what I've seen here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying you think society is overly sexualized doesn't actually demonstrate how that causes harm. It just shows that you think it does. See the difference?

       Actually I didn't only focus on the gay bit, I think all of your commentary is equally terrible.

       It's not subtle at all. Go back and re-watch some of the cartoons they were peddling us in the late 90s early 00. Check out some of the other content marketed towards "teens".

       We are experiencing a whole movement on sexual "misconduct" that was media grown. What did they expect to happen when they made everything hyper sexual?

       The #MeToo stuff going on right now is more a movement against entire misconduct then just "teen sex" but look at the age of the majority of the offenders.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be interested in your data on declining sex rates. All I can find is declining birthrates and if I had to bet that would be on better education and less on declining rate of occurrence.

       As for the #metoo I'm not sure I follow what you're saying. Most of the offenders are older celebrities who have been in the spotlight for quite some time. Exposing the misdeeds of the past would lead me to believe we are on a path to less of those same deeds.

       I read the article and worked my way back to the paper it was based on
       <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-016-0798-z">
        here is the link to that
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       My point in my posts are that media is entirely to blame for the culture we are trying to undo.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Popular media sources often assume that young people are having sex earlier than in past generations, and that casual sex is now more common due to new technology such as Tinder and other dating websites and apps (e.g., Sales, 2015). Observers theorize that the new culture of ‘‘hooking up’’promotes sex without commitment, leading to more sexual partners
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Based on the paper this is all media pushed misconception. What reason would they have to continue to try to hyper sexualize another generation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I tie this into the #MeToo movement and the age of the people involved because the media culture of the millennial (article you linked says 19-35 in 2016) would have been most impacted by the people who are currently implicated for sexual misconduct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't put forward any other point than the media is complicit in running these sexualized programs headed by offenders as far as they can as long as it doesn't hurt their profit margin. When it became too much they bailed out to save their money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire thing rests on people getting better educated by any means. For at least 2 generations big media have fostered a hyper sexualized and abusive culture while pretending to be culturally progressive and the #MeToo movement has exposed Hollywood to be as hypocritical as everyone already knew.

       maybe they are having less sex because they are having more sex with one partner instead of various partners.

       That’s not what the statistics show, as the study looked at sexual activity in general, not number of partners.

       I notice you didnt mention violence depicted in tv. That’s the problem when people like you think a child seeing two mums is more psycologically damaging than the violence in PG rated movies and tv shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing overtly sexual about someone having two mums and a child should be raised knowing that love is love and thats all there is to it.

       You’re focused on false problems. For example, children exposed to same sex marriages have not shown evidence of psycological damage. However studies show that Children exposed to violence in video games and other varied media, do exibit behavioural and psycological changes.
Im not standing around shouting, thats exactly what you are doing. You havent even identified what the implications are of all this supposed depravity you’re claiming

       “Well, you see, John, children are very succespible to auditory and visual stimuli, thus, if a child is exposed to such phenomena it will more likely contribute to the promotion of these attitudes in children who are simply confused. In the end, it appears that the species is dying out, as too many of its newer denizens are practicing homosexuality”

       Even tho what OP is saying is just a tip of the iceberg i'll say this... odds are if this continues america will end up just like Rome in not so distant future so the only question is, will they fade away and be just a memory of a sick civilization or will they drag the whole World with them ?!

       Who knows maybe in ~30 years it won't even matter how it turns out and China will just continue where they stopped (for better or worst)... this World has always been in a very subtle designed flux for a reason.

       I don't know if this is serious or not. You're really jumping around on the topics. I haven't really noticed that on game shows but I have noticed it on sitcoms. I agree that it's weird that they want to make jokes that rely on innuendo. It just seems like an easy way to get a laugh and it's usually not sexy or funny. It's like some pervert who never has sex but has to constantly turn every conversation into something "dirty." But I think it's because we're very repressed as a society.

       Moving on... some kids have two moms. Having that on a show doesn't raise any sexual questions. Maybe you're afraid it normalizes homosexuality but it couldn't be that because you just said you have nothing against gay people. So frankly I'm baffled.
       <br/>
       Your father is a pastor (now we're getting somewhere) and you despise the church (okay) and yet you are praying for an asteroid to save us from football players in tight pants. I'm no psychologist but this post here seems to be a rant about some of your personal issues more than it is about society.

       From what I've gathered, OP was raised in a religious household, rebelled and became a huge slut and practiced "black magick"... then appears to have suffered some sort of injury because of it and has now rebelled again by going to the other puritanical extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that OP need some help with those personal issues.

       the "programming" that is on tv is there to program people. they don't make shows that they think people might like, they make shows to introduce/reinforce subconsciously, whatever it is they want people to consume under the guise of shiny (whatever appeals to people). it's our job to not watch the tell-a-vision

       Millennials won't save shit, they're usually the first to give their freedom away. Older generations tend to believe the fear mongering from the legacy media and then they trade their freedom for false security. Millenials trade their freedom for conveniance and creature comforts which is far worse, and the smug fucks do it proudly.

       1) sexual innuendoes were way more prevalent back in the day
2) people like sex man, it sells and can be funny
3) two moms on a TV show is representative of real life, that child will see it in their life. Gay people exist, why hide them away and make them some weird things? Normalizing it reduces the risk of that kid being confused and angry as an adult. 
4) all that = the world should end? That's pretty dramatic
