       I live in CT.  I'd like to think on one hand who could considering this something ok to do if it was planned by someone other than the current official story.  But I really have to admit that there are some really crazy things going on if you look into what the web has been able to crowdsource its own investigations and evaluation.  Honestly I am not ashamed to say anyone can hate on me but I have seen no facts that definitely point me to it did really happen this way and if not who and why then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before anyone goes off... as I said. I live in CT.  I also have kids.  I was horrified that day that was breaking on the news.  We hugged our kids tight and said prayers.  I have never been to this town or ever seen any of these people that I know of so I have no direct connection.

       The very tired and easily debunked ignorant comment of "if it were for gun control they didn't do anything". Connecticut DID pass anti-gun legislation as a direct result of this media hyped incident as well as Obama signing executive order into effect.

       You are another person who would like all law abiding citizens to own nothing more powerful than a slingshot to defend themselves and their families, but you don't realize that criminals don't follow the law and thus will always have illegal weapons. DUH!

       How would you feel if you were the home owner in this video when four goons with rifles show up to your house and you only had a six-shot .22 caliber revolver to protect yourself? Probably not very comfortable. The home owner probably would have been murdered, but that would have been ok with you. GFY.

       One good thing about the creeps is they are always on the prowl for money based on their comments. The good thing to know is that they are ultimately traceable, whether the low level creeps believe it or not. They are legally on the hook for their actions, despite what their bosses are telling them.

       America’s drug problem is much worse than its gun problem.  Opioids kill more people and ruin far more lives than guns but you rarely hear people calling for more strict prescription drug laws.  Why is that?  Oh yea, all the politicians are in bed with the big Pharmaceutical companies.

       Many people forget to mention.  Despite being able to buy most guns still you are very heavily restricted on ammo now.  You are not just walking in and buying ammo without having paid the state of CT some money and let them background check you basically.  I know people who bought arsenals because they wanted the guns and knew they had to buy them before the changes took effect.  Real or fake this did have an impact on the average persons ability to purchase weapons and ammo, at least in CT.

       I'd counter that nothing about those two issues happening needed any sort event of any nature. CT is already near the bottom of the list of gun friendly states.
       <a href="http://www.gunsandammo.com/second-amendment/best-states-for-gun-owners-2017/">
        http://www.gunsandammo.com/second-amendment/best-states-for-gun-owners-2017/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So them going +1 on guns issues is just a given, no event needed. Being clearly the bulk of that state's population wants those controls or they would do something about it voter wise. Same for any sort of executive order that can be done at the whimsy of leadership for the most part, no event needed. When push came to shove and it was time for the big votes on federal gun control post Sandy Hook nothing changed. Dems could not even hold the party line on something as simple as federal back ground checks.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, this all powerful shadow like group pulls off a false flag etc but is totally incompetent at everything else? Plus lets be honest here about gun control and how a large scale shadow like group who is willing to kill, break any law, set people up false flag like etc would make it happen. There is NO reason to do any events. You would just pure Koch brothers like push for the agenda and kill/blackmail/force anyone and everyone who got in one's way. It would take 5-10 years to happen, if even that long. Yet that doesn't seem to happen either.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's why I'm firmly in the camp of Sandy Hook not being any other than yet one more solo shooter event.

       That isn't true. SH came with the new fear that people "on the spectrum" might shoot up a kindergarten at any moment. Also, an expansion of "the spectrum" and fed regulations for doctors to report in order to erode 2nd amendment rights. And most of this was built into the ACA.

       SH effectively disarmed every child on "the spectrum" for their future.

       The problem is, you’d be fighting to your death for cause that isn’t relevant anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       An armed insurrection against even a portion of the modern US military isn’t viable anymore. It isn’t 1776, man. Words
       <em>
        are

       the weapons now, barring the complete collapse of the US military.

       If nukes are flying (and EMPs are mostly commiserate with nukes) are flying, all of us have larger problems than small arms caches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leadership, local terrain knowledge, food and medicine, are
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       more valuable tools than bullets in a weapon-saturated post-nuclear American landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say, from my very original post, I don’t lack the small arms
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       the friends who
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       don’t lack them, either. But your guns don’t protect you from radiation or warn you of the impending nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relying on the hypothetical landscape that allows a small arm to reign supreme is supreme fallacy.

       I have known people who were killed or injured by small arms, my father was one of them

       My 'point' is that, a person is

        far more likely
       </em>
       to be injured or killed by 'small arms' than it is to be affected

       by a nuclear explosion
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe this will change in the future BUT for the time being, your statement is incorrect about 'more problems than small arms caches' ... as I write this
       <em>
        far more
       </em>
       , orders of magnitude more people have been killed or injured by 'small arms'. punkt.

       like have the government give them a billion dollars written off through nonsense, or have a fake company that does nothing but the government just keeps loaning it money

       They didnt earn money from the shooting. If anything it was hush money. Or they might have even all been operatives. Buy houses move em in for a few years. Etc. I believe almost all of the parents moved out f sandy hook after.

       Im not speculating that money was made from the actual shooting. Although there was definitely gofundme money floating around.

       There are a million different possibilities. There may not even be a financial benefit. It could have simply been an exercise to observe reactions or response time. They might have been trying to see how quickly/well they could control the narrative to a breaking story. There were gun laws passed due to this event and they definitely tried to steer the story as a whole toward gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean there are many possibilities. All I know is... there were no kids being evacuated on any of the tapes. The story changed several times and doesn't make much sense. SH appeared to be closed and damaged at the time of the shooting.... There is a lot of suspicious stuff. I'm not saying I could possibly know the motive; I just know that something is not right.

       The thing is, theres no way to know the motive without an actual criminal investigation. A homicide detective doesnt stop solving a case because the motive cant be determined through the physical evidence. Motive is seperate from suspicious activity and you dont need to know one to notice the other.

       The point wasnt to get money. The only people who got money were the performers, not the power players. I mean maybe money was made in school security related stocks or something like that but the whole point overall was not money. At least what i think.

       They didn't do it to enact gun control. That's misdirection that allows"people" like you to come and make comments like this. There were many goals with the Sandy Hook hoax and one of them was to sell more guns, not less.

       I tell that all the time to all the folks who argue otherwise re:gun control. The ones who are shills ignore me and the ones who fell for the misdirection are too numerous to count. But just because most of them believe that, doesn't make it right.

       come here and make a post about it. That way you can give your own opinion in a thread that actually fosters discussion. This post is very lazy. You're not going to get anything worth reading in this thread, especially when asking a close ended question.

       The local and state police seemed to be extra elaborate and very detailed in reporting on the entire event.

       The fbi time line of the morning in the docs that were generated by the fbi are very simple and direct.

       The fbi time line is out of sequence and in such a way that is a standout to the bullshit story from the state police.

       As a former military contractor for the department of energy it says to me that fbi is telling the world that everything is bullshit about the event.

       I used to do alarm response for an entire school district, and I never saw a functioning school look as run down, dirty and disorganized as the pictures taken of sandy hook. Some elementary schools that had been decommissioned and used for storage came close (every district has these) but even those didn't have the amount of dilapidation (water damage, mould and dirt) shown in the sandy hook photos. For this reason, I am certain that the school  had been decommissioned. I simply cannot imagine a schools staff letting mould grow unchecked on the walls for the amount of time it would have taken to get as bad as it appeared in the pictures. Not to mention the misnumbered  classrooms, piles of textbooks in hallways, many other small details  that indicate that the school had not been used in years and was being used for storage.

       I'm not going to give a full blown response because i'm tired, but i'll give a little insight and some background of the area.  It might be completely wrong but my gut tells me otherwise.

       I live in Mass, I went to school in Connecticut ages ago.  Connecticut is dirty fucking rich.  Not your average Joe but I'm talking the richest of the rich live in southern CT.  Half of the people you see on

       probably have a place in Southern CT.  It is literally a breeding ground for people with power.  Bankers, CEO's, Mob, you name it.  Go a little west and you have Chappaqua NY.  This is where the Clintons live.  Once again the richest of the rich in the world live here.  Look at the map and see how close in proximity all of this is.  The chances of it being linked to a dirty group of people is VERY fucking high.  The area alone has raised so many red flags in my head it's not even funny.  I might be completely off my rocker here but my instincts scream setup.

       It was never decommissioned, that's ridiculous. I live 25 minutes from the school. I had family moving into the state and they were considering moving to Newtown. Had they, their kids would've been transferred into the school a few months prior to the shooting. They found a better home in a different part of the state.

       When i saw that they gave xmas trees for the familys of the fallen i was spooked because The Christmas trees were already outside the school the same day it happened. 13 trees i think or twelve not sure and i think people shown in the death report wasn't actually dead or has been deceased for some time or recently .  it was along time ago but thats the research. I did on my own .

       I'll link it to you if I can find it but there was a website that had like 33 reasons why Sandy Hook was a Hoax and it was very compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a donations page for the "victims" before the "shooting" took place.

       The

       parents laughing it up right before interviews and going into full-on "so-sad" mode when the camera was on them.
