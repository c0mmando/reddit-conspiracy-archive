        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Aside from the potentially-coincidental circumstance (both timing and location) of this alleged attack, the event has made me reconsider what a terrorist action such as this right before a presidential election might accomplish in the minds of voters. Will they newly find Putin inadequate toward addressing terrorism? Or does he gain public sympathy points like the apartment bombings of lore? </p>

<p>Does this provide him an opportunity to show how strong he is against terrorism, after immediately ordering a state crackdown on terror suspects across the board?</p>

<p>Does he still have unique control of St. Peterburg, where he got his start in city government, and (according to the murdered Litvinenko) where he began his corruption schemes back in the day? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget that although 9/11 happened under the Bush admin&#39;s watch, with plenty of inside-job suspicions blooming in it&#39;s wake, the American public overwhelmingly supported Bush in consequence. We all know what followed...</p>

<p>More important for our purposes here, will this sub decide there is Nothing To See Here, as was the consensus after the subway attack and whenever the apartment bombings are brought up? Does the understandable backlash over the Russian boogeyman concept mean we are unable to view anything that occurs in Russia through anything but that lens?</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, you know, those attacks that rocketed the man to power in the first place.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putinâ€™s tradegy is that he cares a great deal about Russia, but cannot possibly abdicate power to anybody else until his death. Hence the murder of his own citizens to achieve and remain in power.</p>

<p>He simply does not trust anybody else to be in charge.</p>

<p>You need to groom a successor for the long-term survival of Russia, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. Otherwise, your rise to wealth and power would have been for naught but yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This attack was nothing compared to what happened in Kabul. It certainly didn&#39;t &quot;rock&quot; Russia. They spent more time commenting on the blue snow in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Also..are you referring to the &quot;thwarted attack&quot; in St Petersburg when you say...again?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this attack has nothing to do with rebels in Syria...yeah..right. I also wasn&#39;t posting in a private sub that another attack was eminent and that Egypt and Russia were my primary candidates..two days before it happened.</p>

<p>Egypt for hanging 15 and arresting 11 in connection to Sinai peninsula attacks..</p>

<p>And Russia because of the Sochi conference.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start asking the real questions...is the CIA still running the FSA as their own private terrorist group..or has their dog got off it&#39;s chain?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia is pretty obviously corrupt to everyone outside Russia. Putin isn&#39;t at risk of being dethroned anytime soon by the looks of it so I don&#39;t see it as a power play for the election. </p>

<p>Perhaps he wishes to increase military presence there given it important strategic location? In the event of a war many nations would likely use Finland as a base and St Petersburg is a massively important port to protect.</p>
