       This post is important because i have been very vocal on some political issues and garnered lots of intrest via twitter facebook etc. Very strange things have been happening to me ever since I questioned the legitimacy of sandyhook and have spoken about our politicians molesting children and bringing awarness to it.

       I followed politics and continued to have my political discussions as normal and then some time passed and pizzagate happened and I of course followed the story. I even asked john podesta where madeline mccain was via twitter.

       What is your logical reasoning behind that many people merely fucking with you? According to your experience there is a plethora of adversaries committed to rattling you. Don't those people have better things to be doing with their time? If there was that much money and manpower arrayed against you, wouldn't they just kill you? They have a friggen heart-attack gun, but for you they'll just play ding  dong ditch?.  You might want to talk to a mental health professional, mate.

       Because they might want to learn how to psychologically de-construct people in a plausibly deniable manner.  If thousands of dissidents all started to suddenly drop dead of heart attacks or ricin poisoning, people may just get the clue that something is up.  If they can convince a lot of people to kill themselves after they make themselves out to be crazy, then they not only have more knowledge of how to weaponize psychology, but also have some problem people cleaned up in a nice and tidy fashion.  We live in a country that spends more on war, weapons, and propaganda than any other country that has ever existed.  We also live in a country with a documented history of non-consensual human experimentation, false flags, lying to the public, and psychological warfare against dissidents.  That's why they may not necessarily think that they have better things to do.

       You ask the same ?'s as many do(me included).   One of the best vids I've seen that describes "why" the best, to me that is, is this video:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grdm2okSToQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grdm2okSToQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether that is all true or not, gives reasons for why someone like us(you) would get such attention.  The resources being used are going to be constantly refined.  They will us those like us to do that.   Am I special? Not in the slightest.  Do I feel that the time and resources that would be used for stuff like this is, is a wise use of those resources on someone like me.  Not in the slightest.  But then again those like us have no clue what the reasons are at all and most could just be a way to  test their tech and techniques to improve them for when they need to use against a high value target.  And I say all of this as someone who isn't being hararrassed, not like many describe, and still have doubts about the whole thing.  But then I listen to the vid link I posted above and it always makes me think, " maybe."

       If I were you I would start video-recording as many of these incidents as you can. Get a go pro and have it on you at all times. I say this because to many you sound as if you are having a mental-breakdown and the only way for people to take this seriously is if you have solid proof.

       Let me first say I believe you 100% (I knew a fellow pizzagate researcher that went through something similar).  I would recommend trying the Scientology approach; anytime you see them pull out your phone, hit record and confront them (record the license plates too).  If you notice the same person or car a few times, make a police report (for documentation only, I think it's unlikely they'll do much).  With video evidence and a license plate you should be able to get them into court, reveal their identity ( where/who they work for) and potentially even get some money out of it.

       I would chalk up the door knocking and sex moaning to living in a shitty neighborhood. Except for the fact you put this stuff to the test, leaving your car and phone in an empty parking lot and observing what happened afterward. Good on you for thinking of that.

       Yeah, that's what I was thinking. It's not like you were driving out of state to Sandy Hook to interview people or anything hard hitting like that. You were just sharing an opinion online like a million other people do.

       Nah. You don't sound like the typical delusional pulling connections out of thin air. If you're full of shit it's because you're a disinfo agent trying to scare people away from investigating Sandy Hook/Pizzagate.

       Not necessarily the best course of action.  They exist to make money off of you, not to help you.  If you are truly experiencing gangstalking at the hands of a hardcore agency like the CIA/NSA/FBI/DARPA, your problems go above and beyond what a mental health professional can do for you.

       You better pray to God that something like this never happens to you. And you won't have to endure the hardship and stigma getting called 'crazy'. I really hate this kind of dismissive behavior, it serves nobody and no, it doesn't make you look smart. It makes you look like you don't think very deeply into anything and have a rigid set of beliefs that -are not yours- and were force fed to you your whole life, opposed to making one yourself.

       Ya I do hope I never suffer from a mental illness, you act like one option is better than the other.  If this guy truly has a network of people stalking him to ruin his life he's fucked anyways, ruling out and seeking help for a mental condition is a good idea.

       Certainly it would be. I'm not seeing how this can be concluded through text. What if the 'ramblings' of a 'crazy person', that is, extreme paranoia, is sometimes warranted based on experience of a 'non crazy person'? That doesn't mean they're mentally ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, one option would be better than the other. An illness is treatable and healable. Do you know how to solve this kind of stalking? A shotgun? Note very state allows that unfortunately. hah. Maybe the solution is move to Texas?

       Logic tells me the simple answer here is mental illness.  It is extremely unlikely anyone cares about this guy's tweets or political views, there are how many pedogate morons circle jerking on Twitter, are they all being stalked?

       How can you possibly tell through text whether somebody needs help or not?

      <p>
       Don't you see the parallel? The slippery slope?
      </p>

       Isn't it possible that despite what 'may appear to be', this person could be telling the truth and isn't crazy at all? With this thinking that means anybody who suffers these experiences at the hands of sociopaths are therefore crazy and 'need help', maybe they do need help, but I don't think medication from big pharma is gonna help.

       And yeah, following you into the parking lot, sitting there for 20 minutes, and then following you when you leave seems too unlikely to be a coincidence. Particularly as someone who was by chance not going into the store, but not trying to follow you, would have noticed that it looks like they were and waited a few minutes after you left before they left. People get self-conscious about that kind of thing and try to avoid creeping other people out.

       It seems sometimes it takes someone willing to take a risk to bring things to light. Good on them for not getting caught. But since they've gone public, that means either that nobody is interested in prosecuting them, or the statute of limitations ran out. How long does it take for the statute of limitations to run out on something like that?

       So its very unique its like let me say something crazy really fast. Lets say there was an island where rich people had security posted on the island and lookouts to stop people from finding the secret child enslavement sex dungeon on the island okay. Lets spice it up a bit and make it sound like a blockbuster movie. A group of rouge vigilanties storm the island kill and take out multiple government agents record it all amd rescue all the captured children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like they murdered a bunch of government workers stormed and island etc and clearly broke countless laws etc but in doing sl validated and proved that select government officials were molesting and trafficking children in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like if something that crazy happened you would have to say well how is punishment decided when somebody breaks the law to expose those tasked with enforcing it of multiple human rights violations?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of mr forsyth and the citizens comission they do nothing as crazy as the made up action packed scenario i just used as an example but im sure they broke multiple laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Breaking and entering obstruction of federal property stealing classified documents etc the list goes on. However only by breaking the law did we all learn the fbi was breaking the supreme law of the land the constitution and violating peoples rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like they cant punish them because they were proven to be corrupt? Its very interesting to think about. Its actually what makes what they did so fascinating the fbi was forced to publically announce those operations were "supposedly" terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were only announced as terminatef i dont believe they actually were but announced as such because of what the comission did.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like if i broke into a police station and knocked out police officers to obtain proof they were trafficking weapons or drugs. Its like does somebody who does something that extreme or law breaking go to jail or face punishment for breaking the law to prove the enforcers of the law are doing such things?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr forsyth was pretty young when he did this i think he said he wasnt sure what would happen to them. I am still shocked they were brave enough to do it and actually find the evidence they needed and pull it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to watch the full documentary i dont know ALL of the details only some. I want to know how they knew what office and how they did it the whole process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just interesting to wonder what can be done to somebody by the law of they break the law to prove the enforcers of the law at the highest level are violating peoples rights. It in essence proves they should not be tasked with such responsibility while at the same time dont know its tricky.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been well over 40 years since the incident and well its not like they came back empty handed they came back with concrete proof. If there was a statute of limitations its likley it would be up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he came forward maybe he feels safe enough to do so or is getting older and is not afraid anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me the most interesting thing is i never thought avout that. How the law or government is allowed to handle somebody who breaks the law in order to provide the cou try with indisputable proof of its corruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats why nost journalists and people who try and testify to expose these things through the proper safe law abiding channels get "assasinated".
      </p>
      <p>
       Monica peterson was clearly assasinated to when these people take the law abiding approach they are eliminated it seems. So it would imply there would have been no other way for the commission to get the truth aside from breaking into the office.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they pressured the government wrote letters and garnered public attention they and there efforts would probably have been quashed.  By straight up ignoring the law and breaking and entering and obtaining proof they did what many who take the legal way are trying to do but cant by abiding by the restrictions of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like snowden he proved rights are being violated but hes still wanted. I like you wonder what the statue of limitations on that would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that they did that leta me know they are clearly very intellegent and capable people if he feels safe to come forward there must be a good reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any regard doesnt seem like they can touch him now. But we still have to remember not ALL the members have come out of the shadows so there is probably some other legal stuff in there.

       You realize both can be true? There can be targeted attacks, AND some people might be suffering from mental health issues that make them wrongly believe they are also a victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not mutually exclusive. Acknowledging that some people might need to seek medical attention does not mean you are denying any such program has or could ever exist.

       Yes, of course both can exist - my issue is why does the existence of one suggest the existence of the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could be correlated though, if a person is harassed enough times they might suffer from some trauma. But that does not mean what is being reported is inaccurate or that the person is unfit to report it, but that's not the paradigm, regardless of what you mean or intend. That's why it's a slippery slope.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's similar to what the official response to the Phoenix lights was. 'Mass delusion'? They were all unfit because they saw something strange? That's the problem I'm addressing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mental health and reporting harassment are two entirely separate issues and should remain completely separated, especially since the OP's story has **
       <strong>
        <em>
         NOTHING

       *** to do with mental health. YOU brought that up.

       One does not suggest the existence of the other, and I haven’t seen anyone state that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of mental health issues that can cause paranoia, delusions of grandeur, and hallucinations (both audio and visual) lets us know that some people suffer from these issues. When someone presents with these symptoms you have to consider the possibility that those symptoms might indicate that they suffer from the mental issues that can cause them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s all. No one is saying specifically because you claim gang stalking you must be crazy. However, believing you are the target of a grand conspiracy when there is nothing to suggest there is anything uniquely threatening about you, is a red flag. Asserting things that seem borderline impossible, or at the very least highly improbable, is a red flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are going to entertain the extraordinary claims that OP is putting forward, then we need to entertain them in a rational way. That means not blindly accepting them, and also considering other, more likely scenarios.

       If that's really your intention, for me it seems very dilute and these remain separate issues, then fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you must realize by even bringing this up here you're painting an awful picture. You're not helping the OP. Has telling a crazy person their crazy ever been helpful?? Haha Maybe it has, but I don't think it's appropriate here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anybody is really blindly accepting this, then, well, that's on them. Talking about the story, other similar stories, asking for photos and videos - this all seems relevant to the OP's story and intention here.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the hell does suggesting he has a mental health issue help? Which tv show did you get this from anyway? Why is the paradigm 'it's either a grand conspiracy or he's crazy'? The only craziness that I've witnessed so far is -this- insane conversation. haha.

       Again, I have not ridiculed anyone. Pointing out an obvious possibility is not ridicule. Conversation exists to try and seek truth and entertain possibilities. If you are not willing to entertain a valid alternative explanation then it’s not much of a conversation.  If you don’t agree with that explanation then you should make your case for the alternative, but trying to stop it from taking place or chide the people who present it is a very dishonest way to discuss things.

       I did not get it from a TV show, that is a bizarre assumption.

       targeting is not carried out only by government projects or police unions with lists of people they are ordered to eliminate but this could be carried out very easily by renegade employees in the government or law enforcement,
      </p>
      <p>
       I have relatives who used the same exact techniques over succession,
      </p>
      <p>
       They used our younger sister and her girlfriends to defame older brothers to their spouses/girlfriends relatives with out us all even knowing it was them until private investigators traced all the mambo jumbo.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not just rumors that they where HIV positive but worse like they had a history of violence with women., and they did it in a very clever way with the advise and help of boyfriends retired from the navy and worked for the police department.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their scheme would be to contact the relatives of their targets pretending their was a death in the family or something serious had happened so to make it appear as a panic situation., that the police are asking for their help and there is no time....once they get them into the mood to ask what exactly happened they would then ask them to promise not to reveal it to their target if where told, this worked 99 percent of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       from their they would claim their target had AIDS, a history of violence, claim to be direct victims of rape etc etc etc.., while telling lies to a 3rd party is called DEFAMATION, getting the suckers to participate in  crimes against the target is beyond that and criminal itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like a decent looking women telling a bouncer lies that she was groped by some guy to get him kicked out of a club but worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       the perpetrators (siblings and their attorneys)  knew that our older brothers in laws where a bit racist so after they used our younger sister to camouflage themselves as victims and then offer to lie in the family court about his past if they wished not to see him anymore and use their grandchildren as a tool to force their daughter to stay in their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       He got court papers for visitations even when his in laws can see the kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       but when he inspected the procedural history of the case he discovered that our younger sister used false allegations about our older brother depicting him as violent, claiming he also hit our sister including attacked me which i contested.
      </p>
      <p>
       by the time the case was closed we have found out my sister and her cop fiancee cheated us out of a will left by our grandmother..
      </p>
      <p>
       relatives in italy had told our sister that our grandmother died and all her grandchildren have to probate her will in the court of first instance after they publish it, so been we are all in the US if no one publishes this will a heir has two years to claim it which is why we had all been tied up in family court where they can file false allegations about anything including rape and sodomy yet its private and your gagged from reporting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When our brother tried to report it to the FBI he was threatened by a psychologist using the false allegations to assert he was mentally ill., so in fact you can gag anyone using the family court if that is the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all called targeting and its always linked to succession, whether its Saul cheating to take King DAVID's crown, a coupe or the destruction of other nuclear power nations to assure no one catches up with us in the arms race, targeting is part of succession.

       The issue with gang stalking is not whether or not it could, or ever has happened, it's that most of the people who think it's happening to them are far more likely to be suffering from paranoid delusions and need to be seeking medical attention not feeding their mania online with other people who are in need of mental health care.

       ditto this. if you are truly being harrassed, document it. Doing so can only help you! 1. if you are indeed being stalked/intimidated/etc, you can present evidence to the authorities, or to people you consider safe or on your side. 2. if you are suffering from delusions, revisiting the supposed documentation might provide you with an eye-opening realization that this is a mental construct and not really happening.

       The problem is that "they"(there are probably quite a few agencies worldwide who do this stuff) are quite adept at fucking with people in ways that are plausibly deniable.  For instance, say you looked at butt plugs on amazon last night or something.  If someone with intel agency resources wants to spook you out and harass you, they could very easily track your movement via cell phone the next day, and when you are at a public place hire a "surveillance roleplayer" to bug their eyes out at you and say, "What a buttplug", or something to that effect.  Even if you recorded that person saying that, try going to your local authorities and having them take you seriously.  They have thousands upon thousands of ridiculous scripts and plausibly deniable ways of fucking with you after decades of research by the Gestapo, Stasi, FBI, CIA, and NSA.  They have a thousand little scripts and tricks like this that can drive people nuts - like sloppy driving, flashing hi-beams, or belching diesel smoke at you.  The psychological effects of this sort of activity are cumulative, and if the psychological effects alone are not enough to get the job done, you'd better believe that they have EMF/scalar/Silent Sound Spread Spectrum weapons that are extremely difficult to record in the moment.  Most people simply do not have the resources to be able to contend with intelligence agency tactics that have been developed for decades and streamlined for plausible deniability.  I wish that it were just a case of people having mental illness, but that is simply not the truth of the matter.

       You articulate it better than me and yes the gestapo and the stasi did deploy similar tactics in east Germany. I don't know why its easier to believe a criminal institution known for criminal behavior is innocent and that I just must be mentally ill. Lol in any event if not me I truly have faith somebody will be able to expose this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like snowden exposed the surveillance and prism I believe. There are 3 ways to get the truth breaking into an institution and getting documents via the citizens commission way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holding one of the participants at gun point and forcing them to hand over their means of communication which may provide all needed evidence of who they are communicating to.
      </p>
      <p>
       or from one of the participants defecting and blowing the whistle to their own detriment. However the participants have no morals so a random about face and moment of whistle blowing is not likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not like the citizens commission and I am not an inside like snow den I don't posses any special traits or technological skills that would enable me to get damning evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can think is that when that person followed me to that parking lot if I held them at gun point and made them get out of there car and give me there phone it would have given me hard evidence as to who they were speaking with. Then forcing them to talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be breaking the law to get the truth but the citizens commission did it and with my talents that's the only way I see myself able to get my hands on non plausibly deniable evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is the perfect terminology you used to explain their tactics. They make sure everything they do to you can be plausibly denied.

The damage and vandalism was viewable. The doj told me over though phone they are getting an increasing anount of calls in regards to the isssue and its a covil rights violation.

       You described specific things happening to you that could easily be documented. You apparently have not documented them, and I have no reason to believe you are perceiving this experience accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of how it feels to you, the reality is that there are well known mental illnesses that can cause people to believe what you are experiencing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that mean that’s for sure what’s happening here? No. But, the options an outsider is presented with is believe some random person is being targeted for some conspiracy they believe in (Note: there are literally thousands of people who believe and spread the same kind of information on this very sub who aren’t my experiencing gang stalking) or some random person is simply not perceiving the situation correctly and actually is suffering from well documented and understood problems. There is just no compelling reason to believe you are part of some elaborate plot based on what you’ve provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing about what you’ve said or believe that seems worth this effort, especially considering how many people I know that have said similar if not worse things and are still running around just fine.

       Ok then share those things with us. I’d find that more compelling than anecdotal evidence. Right now there just isn’t much to entertain for me, or people who are skeptical.

       Basically we can take you at your word and that’s it. No offense but I need more than someone’s personal thoughts to believe something so unlikely.

       The difference is that there is some reason and point to do this. There is no point in choosing some random sandy hook denier and following them around.

       Non-consensual human experimentation has been a thing in this country for a long time.  Tuskeegee, MK Ultra, mosquito and radiation experiments, it's a long list.  If they can learn better ways to plow the underclasses under in a covert way, and maybe kill two birds with one stone by disrupting some dissidents, why not?  It's not like the intelligence/military community doesn't have money to burn or doesn't have a history of doing things that seem really evil and screwy to the average person.

       A LOT and I mean a LOT of what you see online relating to gangstalking is misinformation.  The military/industrial/intelligence complex has invested incredible money into learning how to disrupt peoples's lives/making them miserable/convincing them to kill themselves.  Just as with any sensitive subject, the shill and misinformation brigade is out in full force when it comes to this topic.

       Yea I gotta say, the cries of telling him to get mental help when the ulitmate goal of gangstalking is to pin you with a documented mental disorder so they can "suicide" you. It doesn't take a genius to figure out the only way to test crap like this in a true test is on someone without their knowledge.

       You strike me as a person that doesn't think very much for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine for a second what this person said is true. And some terrible shit is going down around him. He or she tries to tell people about it. And this is what he gets from those he's talking to? If this is what a person can expect from supposed 'good people', eesh, why even bother? Between the logical fallacies and lack of wisdom, my goodness, what is your point?
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're doing doesn't help, there's no love in what you're doing and saying, it's very UN American, it's NOT a Christian approach either. I bet you even think you have the moral high ground. Please, stop this. Pray on it or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worlds lies have clearly tainted your mind and heart. It's not up to him to change your mind. You have to actually think about something for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he didn't ask you to believe the words. Go read more carefully, he thinks it's important to share the story. My goodness, how can you possibly be this thick and dense?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your only response to this story is 'he's crazy'? Nothing else?? Why are you even here? Do you have a point? If you think you're a good person, why act dismissive? How could you possibly think it's helpful, if your concern is his mental health?
      </p>

       3) sometimes people need tangible help and not useless thoughts and prayers. I’m offering insight that hopefully leads people down the road to actual healing, however there are unfortunately people like you who will fuel people’s attempts no matter how misguided with your “good intentions”.
      </p>

       4) what if he actually is suffering from delusions and the only thing people did was feed the mania? That would be pretty bad wouldn’t it? I have never ruled out the possibility, you can read my posts and they clearly say as much, however the odds of probability certainly lean one way. Given the likelihood that this is a different kind of issue than OP wants to confront i feel all honest people Have the responsibility to acknowledge that poetical reality.

       Religion and faith are two different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe you if you say you mean well. But I also implore you to really look deeply into what you're saying to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no ability, I cannot - nay, I WILL not tolerate blind, sweeping statements about how 'crazy' somebody is because they have the courage to talk about something deemed taboo.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are acting stupid. There is NO LOVE IN IT. And I try SO damn hard not to be mean, but what you suggested? It's beyond mean, it's thoughtless, bland and lacks grace. Maybe there are people with mental health issues, probably are, maybe I'm even one of them(can you admit or acknowledge that for yourself, that YOU might have a mental health issue? How does that make you feel, when somebody blindly dismisses you?), but that doesn't mean I'm not lucid.
      </p>
      <p>
       This 'solid as stone' mentality, that you know more than others, that this person is lesser - it just has to stop. I suggest you research these topics, what the CIA does, what they have admitted they do, the documents and collaborating stories. You're ignoring more than just one human's experience, you're suggesting because a professor somewhere tried to tell you 'what is', that you know better? Give me a break. What a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the acknowledgement that these events could have taken place? That's what I say, it's all -possible-, I don't claim to know the truth like you seem to. And what more, you seem able to determine all of this through text? What a joke! You don't know the OP's heart or mind, just like you don't know mine and at this point you never will, it's the likes of you that prevent change in the world because you're tugging along the same bs 'party line' that has been force fed to all of us. Are you even aware of what I'm talking about? If not, -why are you here-???
      </p>
      <p>
       If love was actually behind your statements then you need to do some self evaluation please, maybe read up on leadership and the concepts behind it, because you don't know how to talk to people. And whether you like it or not, it's CHRISTIAN values that kept people behaving respectfully - as they fade, so fades wisdom, so fades love and what we get is dumb stuff like this that wastes our time ultimately and has us spinning our wheels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you even thought about where you got that response? Why is a dismissive response even an option for you? Was it from the TV? A movie? The radio? You don't know this person, right? So how dare you suggest you do? And based on what exactly? Text? His story? The fact you don't like it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll do everything in my power to make you and anybody else feel stupid when they act like this.

       Yes I am and I will continue to do so for those that make sweeping statements, those that neg others blindly, especially if the person's speaking of it has nothing to gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I copy and paste: 'it's that most of the people who think it's happening to them are far more likely to be suffering from paranoid delusions and need to be seeking medical attention not feeding their mania online with other people who are in need of mental health care.'
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what upset me. Most people? What's this based on? Why even bring it up, as if this is the issue? Why is there a perceived, tv-driven correlation between people that speak and think differently to mental health? Why did you suggest this? It's a perspective that's based on a lie.

       Being skeptical is one thing but to suggest mental health issues is such a dangerous slippery slope that even mentioning it is folly. Maybe I'm expecting people to act stupid, probably am, I'm compelled to respond, I can't help it. There are too many otherwise intelligent, good people that are too quick to dismiss others. But if I were mistaken, I apologize - but I do not regret anything, this culture of ridicule simply must stop one way or another.

       I never suggested anyone in particular has mental health issues, but pointed out the very obvious truth that most people who believe that there is a massive conspiracy to target them in particular are not mentally healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn’t mean all, but there is significant documentation of specific illnesses that lead to these exact beliefs and at times delusions, and the evidence that many of these people put out themselves is enough for a common person to see and realize that there is some confusion on the side of the person.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s simply the reality of the facts available. It is possible someone is the target of a grand conspiracy, however it is more likely that your average person is not. The fact that the symptoms also line up very closely with known psychological illnesses also is further reason to be skeptical when people claim things like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you like that fact doesn’t make it not true.

       What is this based on? For those who study the issue, it's not a mass conspiracy, that much is concluded. There are separate competing cabals, best described as a mafia or RICO, racketeering influence and corrupt organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the hell does research have to do with mental health?
      </p>
      <p>
       And all of this information, just like the rest of the controlled and filtered educational system, what makes you think that information isn't also filtered and skewed to suite this conclusion? How ever did this topic escape censorship when the rest of the west hasn't?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting there aren't cases of this and maybe there are a lot of cases, but these are very convenient 'facts' to lay out. There are a lot of intelligent people that have researched these same topics. And what I like or not isn't included here, the only personal opinion I've mentioned is about how this information is being used to discredit and ridicule good people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you like it or not, that's exactly what you're doing here. What are the fruits of this labor exactly? What is the ultimate goal here for you? I can tell you honestly I'm trying to push people to remain open minded and to yield from the western culture of ridicule. But I simply cannot understand what you could be gaining from this. Trying to steer people away?

       My goal is to speak truth and offer a voice of reason. Not that I have to justify myself to you. I find it strange when people try to gatekeep who should or shouldn’t post on a public forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I’m not ridiculing anyone. If pointing out the existence of facts is interpreted as ridicule, then maybe the problem is the interpretation.

       Yes, the problem is interpretation. Mine is irrelevant here. I'm stating to you the common paradigm and it's not helpful.

       Considering the nature of big pharma, other seemingly unrelated stories of 'crazy people', stating these facts as hard evidence to me also seems dilute. Nothing has escaped censorship in the west. And it's remarkably convenient that 'conspiracy theorists' are the crazy ones - of course that's what the media would talk about. What else would they say? These men and women are pioneers and will in the future be regarded as heroes? Hah.

       I TRIED to believe in this conspiracy, you know what I got? Over an hour of my life wasted of watching videos of crazy people (all ages and races) yelling at a variety of things: multiple cars pulling out of parking spaces in an obviously busy lot, neighbors being harassed and accused of being CIA, red cars being shown over and over again, non-sensical rants about a street vendor/begger being a provocateur. There was maybe one or two that looked somewhat legit but then they went off into a rant induced by their fading mental health. You're one to call somebody stupid.

       Those that outwardly and harshly ridicule their fellow man are people I generally cannot tolerate. So yes, I do do that, unfortunately, but I also do it thoughtfully. I don't need to curse, in other words and I haven't yet here, not at a person anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you know they're delusional? What I'm defending here is what's possible because you don't know what is or isn't possible with this person. I see a lot of judgment, speaking frankly, because of the typo errors. It's text, we can't hear -how- we're speaking so what we have to judge is grammar and spelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why didn't you post or write about it? It would be delusional to say you had people taking pictures of your house and to share your thoughts and experience? What part of that is delusional and how is this different from what this person did?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, if this person is lying, it doesn't matter. I put love first and love would say to believe him and offer support if you can. What it doesn't tell me is to paint a broad slanderous picture of this person based on text and what he says. So I really don't understand your point of view and I don't think I want to. It seems like you're trying to tight-rope an imaginary line, the tricky part is the line isn't straight, it's jagged, filled with contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not perfect either. And I was probably too harsh. I apologized for it too. I still stand by what I said, the whole approach is wrong and I implore everybody to look inside and figure out where that point of view came from. Did it really come from you? Is it used as a defense mechanism so you don't feel uncomfortable? Did you base this point of view on all that you've read? Because I've looked at a lot of bad youtube videos too, disregard the ones that don't offer insight or information, although I also try to remember them even if they don't make sense. And I never, ever commented on any of them slanderous, broad stroked comments or suggested mental illness. It's rude, inconsiderate and unwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, all of this discussion shouldn't be about belief. It shouldn't be about trying to change convictions or opinions. The whole point of a discussion is to throw around an idea - something that can be changed, to get people talking and thinking about it differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost everything I see here is about 'prove it to me', when it's not up to the OP to prove anything. It's not his job to educate you.  He's sharing an experience, of which does not and should not require anybody's slander to be accepted as what it is. This person's story, whether it's real or a lie, let's all hope it's a lie because that would mean a person isn't suffering inescapable torment in their personal life.

       How could you possibly claim to know anything about another person or their experience? And to think, you're concerned about being 'normal' here? On the conspiracy reddit? I think you're looking in the wrong place for that. Oh, just to verify, I'm not on social media. I don't post any shit online either. But if I were being stalked, by whomever, bringing it up into the light is a good way to make it stop.

       Says the one calling people stupid, inconsiderate, unwise, non-brave etc. I'm going to be redundant here, you're fucking weird. You spout off paragraphs of rambling defending obvious schizophrenics, all the while throwing out insults to everyone and then question why you get called weird. If you have evidence of actual gangstalking, let me know. Don't bring up John Lang either, he's close to home and was a hero. These mentally ill in youtube are, for the most part, just taking videos of normal people and cause a public disturbance.

      </p>
      <p>
       Its because its true that sadly im forced to confirm sandyhook is fake and pizzagate is real. Because if I am truly wrong about all the things attention and awarness i have brought to people I would be left alone.

       Its like the woman who leaked the panama papers who was killed. Was she killed because the evidence she had was fake or because it was real and she was right?

       Im worried about the future of this world I worry that nobody can see these things and that nobody cares.

       What I learned from monica peterson and the panama papers journalists is these people got there power because people are afraid to get hurt.

       When your afraid to get hurt i guess you let people rule over you and live in fear.

       Not that easy if you're up against pros.  Horn honks have been used to harass me, and I've recorded instances of it many times.  Presenting evidence of what looks like random horn honking wouldn't get me very far in a court of law, nor would it do me much good aside from preaching to the converted.

       There is a car that drives by my apartment every single day and, and every single time the driver honks his car as he's passing. It started shortly after moving my apartment three years ago. At first it happen every morning around 4:30 with the driver laying the horn for the entire time it took for him to pass the entire length of the apartment complex. Now it happens during the afternoon with a quick honk.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is they must have a friend or relative that lives in one of these apartments and they honk their horn as a way of saying hi. I could go around the complex asking if anyone knows the driver and if my guess is in fact true, but I'm too lazy to do it and it doesn't really bother me all that much.

       Your example is not the same as having a host of different cars with different drivers partake in orchestrated noise harassment.  As the video that I posted clearly shows, this sort of activity really does happen in the real world.  It doesn't tear a hole in the fabric of space-time or break the universe when people conspire to utilize CoinTelPro tactics against someone who they deem as vulnerable.  Your remarks are needlessly condescending and completely irrelevant to the situation.  Here is the video just in case you missed it:

       You guys who call me mentally ill and paranoid cant have it both ways. You want me to have been paranoid enough to be ready to record all of these incidents at a moments notice when i was still trying to connect the dots but sane enough to believe it must all just be coincidence lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing crazy has happened to me in the past 3 months a few minor things but nothing i would record. I aubmitted a complain to the d.o.j so whoever is involved with this is aware im aware for #1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number 2 anything i do record will be plausably deniable but as it stands i am always ready to record.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had i been as paranoid and dellusional as some of you claim i would have been ready to record anything prior to me going through everything that happened and tryi g to make sense of it not afterward.

       I am not saying that you are mentally ill. However, this is the internet with all sorts of bs claims. All I am saying is if it were me and I was going to the library with this sort of thing happening more than once. Even if I was not paranoid but I was seeing a pattern like this; I would have recorded it. If not just for the sheer factor of....no one will believe me unless I actually record this sort of thing happening.

       Yeah, I think the FBI killed MLK too. I don't know about what kind of secret operations they may or may not be involved in today, but I think they were definitely a party to that assassination after their attempt to blackmail him failed.

       This also may seem unrelated but in as far as personal protection goes, I would recommend looking into getting yourself connected with a network of whistleblowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a big one I can think of, the Sirius Disclosure project and although your story doesn't necessarily have to do with them and their goals, unveiling a pedophile ring the sandy hook gun control nonsense is probably as important as free energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, one of the kickers regarding the Disclosure Project is many of them were once Govt employees and contractors that signed NDA's. The reason they aren't in trouble(are ignored) is because people like the president and congress does not know about/has no access to/has no control over these projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm not sure if this would be appropriate but for your own sake I would contact them and share your story. The louder you are at this point the safer you're going to be and if you're connected with a network of people who would all move and act together if you are hurt or killed may be the wisest route.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, I don't know any of them. I just see what they have apparently done. It's worth a try, you never know, their issues may be different from yours but ultimately they are all branches connected to the same tree. I also say this cautiously too, keep in mind - I don't want it to seem like 'stated facts', but I would absolutely not go about this as a lone wolf if these things are really happening to you.

       Yeah because everything that has happened to me is in fact real and not at all anything to do with mental illness I realized that I do myself a disservice by speaking amongst those who don't understand the complexity of these things etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I was doing was trying to filter through the mentally ill who falsely believe they are being gangs talked and the ones who really are so we can compare notes etc
      </p>
      <p>
       so your idea is a good one there is a lot more I haven't even shared on here and I can see its probably for the best. I am trying to find a group like the citizens commission or people who know more and who are smarter than me that can help better connect the dots of these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as being hurt goes im not afraid of that. The reason these people have the power they have is because to many people are afraid to be hurt so don't act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not special and im not unique however one thing I am is unafraid. I wont live in fear of anything or anybody. I am armed and competent at all times should it ever come to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the people who scream mental illness paint me crazy no im not going on a random mass shooting spree lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hell im clearly just mentally ill what do I know lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways thank you I will look into those groups but right now I should probably go eat something im actually very tired and sleepy and hungry right now.

       I would recommend taking your time and carefully crafting your entire story. Lay it out, what people say and think don't matter, but getting the story out does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure you tell all your friends and family this stuff. That if you end up sick, in a car accident, 'committing suicide' that you didn't and there was foul play. Tell people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more you keep to yourself and the more you keep quiet the easier you will be to forget about. Make youtube videos. contact people, even if you don't 'join' their network(I actually have no idea how it works), inform them of what's happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contact news agencies. Independent news, all of them. Record who responds, report all of it, here and other places. You must be LOUD. Half the fight is already over if you have courage - these people who are doing this do not have courage, they need to stay in the dark and in the shadows because the light would reveal who they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inform the police you are being harassed. Inform the FBI. Tell everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly, highly recommend crafting your posts. As simplistic as it seems, people will regard fast typing and typos as a negative thing. It pays to think, speak and write like you have a brain. :)

       Cointelpro existed, and the FBI did try to get King to kill himself. And there may, indeed, be some modern examples of targeted gang stalking. But OP, from your story it sounds much more likely that you're experiencing mental issues. I don't mean that as judgment. I just ask you to consider the possibility and reach out for help from someone who cares about you.

       Nope sorry its not "mental issues" its true. The whole objective of cointelpro if you research it is to get people to classify you as mentally ill. Apparently its very effective becuase despite me telling the truth you people keep going back to mental illness which is not the case.

       You know you’re not mentally ill because.... you just don’t feel mentally ill or....?
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize someone experiencing any kind of neural abnormality is likely to be unable to tell themselves. Hence the reason you go to professionals who an conduct tests to determine your mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your brain is hard wired to make you feel confident that you are perceiving the world accurately, even when you aren’t. This makes it very difficult to tell when your perception starts to break down.

       It’s not a slippery slope at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is entirely possible that I could be suffering from a mental illness, but the way you check against that is to compare what you think you are experiencing with what can be easily verifiable by others.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, if I thought I was seeing a giant pink elephant I would ask the people around me if they saw it to.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the same token if I thought people were following me I would film them and show other people to have them verify that what I observed appears accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       We assess reality not by what we think is true, but by what is independently verifiable for this exact reason.

       A professional has told me im not mentally ill. I could ask him if its okay to share his name with you. He actually told me that I am highly intelligent and from his 25 years of experience that I am fine lol. So not only do I know there is nothing wrong with me an individual with 25 years of experience has agreed.

       Did you tell him about all of the people you thought were following and harassing you?

       Also intelligence has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you are mentally ill. In fact often those at the highest levels of intelligence suffer from one mental illness or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that your clean bill of health supposedly came with the reasoning that you are also intelligent makes me suspicious of that claim in general.

       except we don't actually know what the medical professional said do we? OP never even clarified whether or not he was honest with this professional about his symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most mental health based professions rely on self reporting out of necessity. If OP did not accurately disclose the circumstances what the professional did or didn't say isn't very helpful now is it?

       Again, I'm not denying that these things happen. I'm simply saying that there are far, far, far more cases where people believe these things are happening when, in fact, they are experiencing mental issues. I just want you to at least consider the possibility and talk to someone about it who can offer you help and suggestions.

       That's fair. The only reason I ask is because schizophrenic symptoms usually make their first appearance in that age range. And schizophrenics rarely think that they're ill. That's part of the problem with treating the disease in fact. They think everyone is out to get them. I'm not saying this is happening to you for sure, but it's a possibility that you should consider because if it is the case it will be good to get help sooner rather than later.

       An Army Intel officer gave an on-air explanation of gang-stalking some years ago. It wasn’t coast to coast show but similar in nature. I don’t think she gave another such update publicly and don’t recall her name unfortunately but Google search will reveal the interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       She said Congress is well aware of the issue but none are willing to tangle with it for several reasons. Basis her description, gang-stalkers are comprised of like-minded individuals who are outsourced for jobs/targets and using high-tech equal or better than most PD’s. There is also a “religious component” to many cases but the Army officer was wary of getting involved in the matter.

Screenshot things, so you have stuff to back claims up. Take pictures.

       That's a great point. And why I got so upset at a commenter who suggested 'mental health'. This is another CIA deception. 'Mental health' issues are going to be used as an excuse to commit a great number of crimes in the future.

       I thought I was being watched one time during a really stressful time in my life. Lack of sleep will do crazy things. I believe that you think this is happening and I won't tell you it's not. But
       <br/>
       First, about Facebook. What happened most likely is that someone got angry and reported you. Sandy Hook is a very touchy subject. People on Facebook get snitched on all the time for not using their real names and Facebook requires them to show ID to continue to use their account. Maybe Facebook did it themselves because, despite all the nonsense people post on there they do claim to be against "fake news."
       <br/>
       The other things you talk about just don't seem logical. Like someone else said they can just give you a heart attack if they wanted to. You don't have access to any secret knowledge so it's not like they would want to investigate and track the source.
       <br/>
       I think you are exhausted and you need a break. Try to get some rest and eat well. I do understand that what you're talking about is possible, but it just doesn't make sense that they would have a team of people stalking you. The cost would just be too much and there is no real reason for it.

       This post serves as definitive proof that pizza gate never happened and that sandy hook was real.  This is exactly the type of person that believes these kind of crazy theories.  Like true tinfoil hate type schizophrenics... everyone already told this guy he needs help but it isn’t my fault he’s not on antipsychotics... it’s ppl like this that give all conspiracy theories a bad name by promoting stuff such as flat earth, gang stalking, sandy hook, pizza gate etc

       It’s probably related to politics but I would bet money it’s unrelated to sandy hook or pizza gate.. it’s something you said earlier than that.  When it all seems to have started when X happened, you’re meant to think it was X that caused the program to begin.  That’s what they want you to think.  You’re falling for the false reality they’ve created and need to disengage from it and rebuild your conclusions from the ground up.

       Nope sorry its not "mental issues" its true. The whole objective of cointelpro if you research it is to get people to classify you as mentally ill. Apparently its very effective becuase despite me telling the truth you people keep going back to mental illness which is not the case.

       Citizins commission was mentally ill to i guess. Till they broke intto that office and proved to the world it was not in their mind it was real.

       Did you tell him about all of the people you thought were following and harassing you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also intelligence has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you are mentally ill. In fact often those at the highest levels of intelligence suffer from one mental illness or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that your clean bill of health supposedly came with the reasoning that you are also intelligent makes me suspicious of that claim in general.

       intelligence and mental illness are not related. Many people with mental illness are highly intelligent.
