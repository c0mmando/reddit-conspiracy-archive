        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As a Russian immigrant to US - I have access to both.</p>

<p>Russian news: positive stories about power stations built, churches restored, Russian sports teams winning. Of course they spin it in a positive way, but there is national unity, POSITIVITY, national pride, feelings of peace all over the world. It gets you in a better mood.</p>

<p>US news - NEGATIVITY, CONSTANT FEAR MONGERING AND TENSION - firstly IDIOTIC mostly sex scandals, other scandals blown out of proportion over nothing (like kneeling in football), reporting on someone going to prison (to instill fear into population), fear mongering, race scandals, wars, Russia bad, terrorism and DIVISION. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t sense any sort of unity in Americans, just division among lines of race, income, views, background/etc. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t see a SINGLE positive story about anything, like a bridge being built or something ... nothing. </p>

<p>US has turned into some kind of War and Fear mongering post apocalyptic MILITARISTIC shithole as seen in 80&#39;s movies like Robocop.</p>

<p>So sad.</p>

<p>EDIT: Watched Canadian news and they were somewhat similar to Russian news - happy people, Canadian unity, national pride. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone not from either country, honestly, yeah.  </p>

<p>America is the seat of corporate greed and military expansionism in the World.  Your export of capitalism to the rest of the world has caused untold pollution, waste, and inequality.  Your conquest of  Middle Eastern countries has caused human suffering on a scale far worse than Russia has done recently.  </p>

<p>Yeah, Russia has an authoritarian style ruler, but he works for the good of the country.  Look at Russia&#39;s national debt, it is nearly nonexistent.  The Country has really bounced back after the fall of the USSR.  America has croney sellout politicians who have already dismantled your government and sold it to the corporations.  Your country is teetering on the edge of debt collapse while the military contractors and financial empires are laughing.  </p>

<p>Russia has nationalized healthcare, while 45,000 people die <strong>EVERY SINGLE YEAR</strong> in the States because they can&#39;t afford healthcare.  </p>

<p>America appears to do well because the rich do very, very well, but your working-class wage has been stagnant since the 70s.  The corporate media convinced you dumb hillbillys that unions are bad, now you have no worker protections, pensions, and reduced ability to climb the salary ladder.  </p>

<p>We are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> here.. your country killed 3000 of your own citizens to start a war for oil in Iraq, you require endless war and suffering to feed your war machine, and your best friends are Saudi Arabia and Israel, two of the other most horrible countries around.  </p>

<p>Now you guys are mad because Russia meddled with your election.  The fucking MO of your intelligence agencies for the past 70 years has been to meddle in any election possible.  You&#39;ve gone as far as assassinating democratically elected leaders in South America, only to prop up ruthless dictators.  It&#39;s about time you got a taste of your own medicine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, my friend, <em>you</em> don&#39;t need to watch the media to cause division and strife.  No no no.  </p>

<p>The media helps drive culture which drives people.  <em>You</em> may not watch the media but others do.  You might see them protesting some politician, having guilt about their ethnic heritage, or hating those who make just a little more income.  One of them might call you a white fucking male, accuse you of having privilege, or express hatred for the country in which they live.  Perhaps you might even see them openly support mass migration to further diminish one&#39;s heritage and/or national identity.</p>

<p>America lacks unity by design, my friend.  It has little to do with you watching the news...</p>

So much this. The US is incredibly toxic...I also hate that it pushes a global agenda. I went to Europe a few weeks ago and felt appalled at the cultural erosion that has been happening in the past 2-3 years. The sickness is contagious.</p>

If you were to venture off this path you would quickly see the gross changes to many cities from the migrant influx. A few miles from the center of Paris there are neighborhoods that look like the Middle East. Woman don&#39;t even feel safe going out in their home neighborhoods after dark. The cafes tell woman to leave, they are not welcome. We have experienced this in Paris, Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Stockholm, and others. It sucks!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, man. So true. I traveled to quite a few countries in my younger days. There are really no words to express how different the people are and society is here. I stayed in a small town in Italy for a month with a friend from childhood.  I&#39;m normally an extreme introvert. In that time I realized I was actually enjoying people&#39;s company, and wasn&#39;t uncomfortable sitting in a packed deli, or a bar, or trying to talk to people even in my extremely broken Italian. People were genuine. Trying to find a genuine person here is like finding a needle in a haystack. </p>

<p>Point is, turns out I&#39;m not really an introvert. It&#39;s just that society here as a whole makes me one. </p>

<p>The thing is, they&#39;re privileged and don&#39;t know it. Russia is depressing as shit but everyone there is happy as clams. Or shit I&#39;ve been down to third world countries where most of the people have little land bridges over their own excrement that flows through their village and they don&#39;t have a worry in the world and their government is twice as corrupt and fucked up as America&#39;s.

<p>The advantage of the American way is that it seems friendlier at first (as a tourist, on your first day, you think you&#39;re just constantly making friends). </p>

<p>On the other hand, in Russia, once you get ast that initial ice-cold barrier (usually by dreaking vodka with the fellow), you&#39;ve got a <em>real</em> friend for life.</p>

Facebook pushed positive articles, Google deranked/altered searches, MSM shilled, everyone was mesmerized by &quot;her turn&quot;. Even in places in Texas people were against Trump all because of the negative coming from those interest groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But did she get elected. No she didnt. Dude you are making the same argument as me. Hollywood=liberals. Google=liberals. Facebook=liberals. Msm=liberals. Silicon Valley=liberals. All these are in California except wallstreet and msm. Which is in NewYork another liberal state. People in Texas where scared because of Trump talking of deportation, and the msm labled him a racist. Most apologist voted against him, why? because they are liberal. Reddit= liberals. Come on guy. I agree with you, do you not see this? Same thing i said the majority of Americans did not fall for that shit. Only a few states with a lot of people. These states have alot of delegates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my god man!!. Thats what i said!!!Except for a few liberal states. How many states where red? How mant states did Hillary win? Come on man. Better yet, how many districts did Trump win? And alot of people would have rather had Bernie that voted for Hillary. I didnt want either one of them. Im not a Democrat or Republican, but if thats my only two choices i will vote Republican ever time, all the way down to the smallest branch of government. Now give me a smart libertarian or independent and i will vote for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not have an allegiance. Its like i said dont piss down my back and tell me its raining. Obama talked good and did nothing. Trump talks like an idiot and has done alot. If a man beats a woman and tells her he loves her all the time does he really? If a person talks like an asshole to everybody but gives all their time and money to help people are they an asshole. Did i say Trump was an idiot, i said i didnt know. Do i think America  got to be like a shit hole under Obama. I know so. Do i trust Trump. No i dont. Did i hope Obama would do good while he was president. I did. This is a conspiracy sub. How many liberals are conspiracy theorist? Not alot because they believe any msm tells them. How many conspiracy theorist are conservatives? Probably alot. </p>

<p>But to say that a Russian news system devoted to promoting how well the country is doing, national pride, feelings of peace...I mean, this is a conspiracy sub.

Sounds like something of an inverse of how you view US news, but seems to achieve a similar effect (although in Russia, Putin ate up most major media over the past 15 years and now runs them ...why on earth would he then show anything but Russia doing super well (under his reign) while the world around it (and him) falls apart?)</p>

<p>Due to the fact that the US has a disproportionate amount of billionaires when compared to the rest of the world, we need to use median income, not mean. When you take the average, inclusive of billionaires, the numbers skew up significantly.</p>

In Canada (and Russia apparently, as per OP), the news doesn&#39;t focus <em>exclusively</em> on crime, sex scandals, war, violence, fear, etc. There&#39;s a bigger push to report actual news stories, not just the ones that scare the shit out of you.</p>

<p>Your arguments fall apart when you apply them to the free press in Canada, because the issue isn&#39;t Russian or Canadian, it&#39;s American.</p>

I&#39;ll admit that I don&#39;t come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> much—I mainly drop in to chime in on the Russia scandal—but seeing threads like this on its front page just make me sad. It&#39;s really not hard to understand why an authoritarian regime wants to portray a positive version of itself in state media.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll go one step further: news <strong>should</strong> be negative. Self-criticism is the only way a group of people can improve itself, and a negative press is the only way a country can work to remove its flaws.</p>

<p>BTW, for people who don&#39;t know I made the subreddit <a href="/r/RussiaLago">/r/RussiaLago</a> to discuss Trump-Russia. Collusion skeptics are also welcome (provided you&#39;re respectful and don&#39;t troll).</p>

&quot;and the fact that people on a conspiracy subreddit are upvoting a post in favor of government controlled media is mind-boggling.&quot;<br/>
Aaaand you missed the point. Stop gaslighting your agenda. People aren&#39;t upvoting it because they think it either has to be one extreme or the other. People are upvoting because it shows an alternate perspective.<br/>
You had the opportunity with your comment to really flesh-out the discussion on how a media organisation communicates information, but instead you went and responded reactionarily and made it more divisive.</p>

And by the way the reason the CIA had assets in domestic media was so that they could target foreign propaganda from  a more complete avenue. It wasn&#39;t about influencing the American people.</p>

<p>As for Obama changing the law against domestic propaganda, are you talking about <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countering_Foreign_Propaganda_and_Disinformation_Act">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countering_Foreign_Propaganda_and_Disinformation_Act</a> ??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, you are wrong. The OP reads Russian and I am sure he could tell you much about crimes that happen, urban issues and political disagreements. I read a lot in translation and learn quite a bit about problems in Russia, not just feel-good stories.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some advise for you (not that you&#39;d take it): you should listen to the full 4 hour press court where Putin gave answers to questions that ranged all over the map. From Russian regions not getting a fair shake, to dealing with an aggressive NATO to criticisms about not doing more for Donbass. Well, I did listen to it all and I can assure you many questions were so pointed and critical that I doubt you&#39;ll ever see any elected representative of the US being willing - and able - to withstand such a grilling.</p>

<p>So, go read something -other than your talking points, of course. who knows, you might learn a thing or two. not such a bad thing to do! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cold war ended during the dismantling of socialism in the USSR. Current hostilities between Russia and the US are not a continuation of the cold war, they began with Putin asserting that Russia would no longer bow to Western desires, making it an obstacle to US objectives in the Middle East and Central Asia after the invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p>The cold war was a struggle between socialism and capitalism/imperialism. It was not a struggle between competing abstract ethical notions of the &quot;good&quot;. That struggle still exists in a much different form between the west and China, Cuba, Vietnam, etc, but the current hostility between Russia and the US is of a fundamentally different nature. It&#39;s a conflict between the mutually exclusive interests of competing businesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.  The Cold War was indeed a battle of antithetical ideologies competing for dominance.  The current “war” (power struggle is more accurate) is two states competing for dominance under a shared ideological paradigm.  Vastly different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I think you don&#39;t get the difference between the two countries on a deep level (deeper than seeing propaganda there but not here). </p>

<p>What I believe we are seeing from the Russian side (which I can read only in translation) is a sense of a country on the ascendancy. Russia emerged out of the Soviet Union in an extremely bad shape, but much has been changed for the better. People&#39;s lives there are in the process of improving - talk to any older Russian person who&#39;s been through it all, and they&#39;ll tell you that (but forget about talking to the Russophobes and people like Gessen who have an ax to grind. Also too many of the Jewish Russians who emigrated to the US still nurture a bad case of Russophobia, but that&#39;s another story). </p>

<p>By contrast, the US is an Empire in decline. All the signs point to that. Of course, great things are not being built because the Defense budget eats up every spare penny of the discretionary spending. Sp people notice. F.35&#39;s that are, well, problematic and expensive on the one hand, crumbling bridges and failure to help Puerto Rico on the other hand. The inequality in the US is so staggering by now that it&#39;s impossible not to notioce the divergence of the workforce into at least three distinct classes, with 60% of the people bringing up the rear. So, no they don&#39;t feel good about things, and no, great things are not being built (I mean, just how many of the people ever asked for a self-driving car?).</p>

<p>Russia is celebrating a truly awsome campaign in Syria, executed masterfully, and getting ever closer to the intended goals. But America? what campaign execution? what strategy? what is all that huge defense budget producing other than jobs for aerospace (a form of welfare for the skilled) and a never ending chain production of weapons the military often did not even want and cannot use?</p>

<p>Russians get to read about the construction of the kerch bridge to Crimea. A truly awesome endeavor which engages over 10,000 people and countless companies. The project is being done on schedule so far, and the employment it generates is extremely welcome. So what&#39;s not to celebrate? I am sure that if someone wanted they could find negatives. Things not going well. Questionable contracts. But those things ARE being discussed in the Russian language media, just that it does not feel like problems are not being addressed.</p>

<p>PS I realize your job (self-appointed or not) is to question any positive narrative about Russia. But just so you know, many of us see the same picture the OP does, and your Debbie Downer input needed to be addressed, even if is directed from elsewhere.</p>

<p>After going over to Hong Kong (controlled by the Chinese), then Russia, and probably (definitely) giving away our secrets to them. Leaking the information about the NSA spying was justified, but just about nothing else he did was right.</p>

<p>Snowden leaked the information in 2013. It is 2017. He&#39;s alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of russia&#39;s censorship has to do with the fact that america is pouring millions into the country in an attempt to stoke political unrest. Russia isn&#39;t like most countries that the US seeks to influence because they&#39;re not 3rd world enough to just arm their separatists, but they also don&#39;t have the framework that western europe, canada, australia, south korea have that allows the US to buy ad space, do business, and promote NGOs such as Soros&#39;s Open Society. </p>

<p>It was revealed a while back that russia was taking out ads during the election where they promoted radical feminism/black lives matter in an attempt to anger people who see these groups becoming less about equality and more about female/black supremacy. Similarly, america has promoted feminism, atheism, and gay rights extensively in russia. In the same way that our companies like facebook and twitter are cracking down on russia&#39;s propaganda, russia cracks down on ours as well. </p>

<p>Best thing to do? Sell them chemical weapons and then pretend the world&#39;s policeman needs invade, killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people in the process and turning the nation into a failed state that remains a breeding ground for terrorism to this day.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really that simple. For instance a few years ago CNN was down in the ratings barely making it. 2017 has been the most viewed year ever for CNN and this is largely due to bashing the president. You only need ratings and the resulting advertisement money to realize why tv focus on it. People eat it up like cupcakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the difference lies in intrinsic cultural values that Americans no longer see any evidence of or reports about <em>by design</em> from a completely controlled mass media. </p>

<p>A lengthy and slow &quot;boiling frogs&quot; process that has reduced the United States to nothing but a corporate playground with the public rushing around willy-nilly from one thrill packed ride to another until they run out of tickets, like any other theme park. A break from normal reality that has actually become the present and only persistent reality they now know or experience. </p>

<p>Canadian and Russian cultures are both deeply affected by the power and unforgiving nature of the land and northern climates they happen to live in that is also true for Icelanders, Scandinavians, and other countries of the northernmost regions of the world.</p>

<p>They all have and appreciate a collective need to take care of one another that simply goes without saying due to that. One that they have always responded to... an ever-present &quot;life and death&quot; situation they are regularly and annually exposed to and reminded about that takes precedence over everything else. </p>

<p>So Nature&#39;s sometimes cruel and unforgiving nature is combatted by and with a more benevolent and forgiving human nature whose successes and survival against that are always important to report, celebrate, and be mindful about.</p>

<p>Since it&#39;s a such primary and elemental thing it extends into and is reflected in numerous other aspects of their cultures as well in terms of how they see and respond to one another&#39;s needs and circumstances.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not enough to simply punish what is bad or errant in human nature and simply expect what is genuinely good about it to prevail without any positive promotion and reinforcement. </p>

<p>The US has deteriorated to the point where there is more corporate money to be made from actually having the problems and villians to deal with than promoting the kind of general encouragement and attitudes that would reduce the number of them. They are in fact, gaming the system, and gaming their own society for private profits. Actually diverting revenues and resources away from positive actions to prevent and reduce those very problems as much as it is possible to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>do you know or talk to - in person - any russians? i work with several and am able to pick their brains about their view on putin, american politics. i talk in depth about russian history, politics, culture, economics.</p>

<p>you say this is propaganda and we&#39;re eating it up. i kind of think its an honest perspective based on the perspective i hear from my russian friends (in america).</p>

<p>they generally love russia and putin and i think their media is highly successful in influencing that perspective. think for a second, at 26, 27 their parents lived through the fall of the USSR, they were educated differently... their parents were highly propagandized. that and the rise in russian GDP since putin was declared prime minister in 1999. they attribute it all to putin and i think the media portrays putin well.</p>

<p>i love chatting with my russian (and former soviet union) friends. good folks :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My hometown paper is much like you describe Russian news. Filled with positive stories about the cities good points, features promoting businesses, etc. But it’s also crap for actual news. They all but cover up any negative stories that could blow back on a town business or prominent family. We have high crime rate and poorly run public schools, but the paper devotes barely even lip-service to these issues. </p>

<p>In short what I am getting at is, my town newspaper isn’t an actual source for news. It’s a PR tool for our region. Much like the Russian “news” you describe with such positivity.</p>

<p>News is verifiably factual information in the public interest. Propaganda is manipulation to control the public’s interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Russian news is state sponsored so that all makes sense. I’m no fan of modern American journalism but at least it isn’t overtly controlled by government. Not saying there is no influence because there is but it has to be secret. American news media is the result of a free press covertly manipulated by secret organizations to set an agenda. Russian news is state sponsored propaganda so it comes as no surprise that it attempts to portray the motherland in a positive light. Is that a bad thing, yes and no, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s power in information which means news media may not publish a story that damages the agenda they are pushing even though it may be good for business. They’re gatekeepers. The structure of the news industry allows them to withhold information because we don’t know what they aren’t telling us and they’re our only source of easy information about the outside world. Most people don’t realize the news is a racket so the networks can use that ignorance to their advantage to push narratives instead of objective information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most pro-Russia propaganda trash I have ever read. Supposedly the OP hates America and loves Russia but still chooses to live here. </p>

<p>OP whines about American media being negative yet spends most of his comments being negative and divisive calling America a shithole full of immigrant trash (not aware of the irony of himself being an immigrant). OP ignores the fact the the Kremlin kills and jails journalists for dissent and Putin literally just banned an opponent from running against him in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>Fuck you OP. I’m proud to be an American and I don’t know where the fuck you live, but most everyone I know here in America is happy and wouldn’t agree with your extremely divisive, negative, hate-mongering of the US. We enjoy friendly banter about football, basketball, baseball, and hockey. We enjoy fantasy football, golf, and this beautiful land with amazing national parks. We enjoy donating time and money and if Russia had a national disaster the scale of other ones like Tsunamis or hurricanes or earthquakes, we’d donate billions just like we do for other countries.  Most Americans wouldn’t care about your rosy-glasses, holier-than-thou Russian propaganda. </p>

<p>No one is forcing you to stay in this country that you hate and want to smear.  It if you want to, we’re not going to murder or imprison you like the Kremlin would for dissent.</p>

<p>Are you saying you take issue with them saying that Russia has spin and lies and the contrary is definitively true?</p>

<p>Or are you saying you take issue with Russia media typically being trife with spin and lies, which OP had recognized?</p>

<p>Because either way, acting like <em>all media</em> from a source such as Russia <em>or the United States</em> are spin and lies is simply ignorant. You have to view a single event from all sides to paint the most accurate picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the anecdote provided by the OP doesn&#39;t prove that the US media is all lies? You can take the exact same premise (US media is all negative, Russian media is positive) and draw totally opposite conclusions. </p>

<p>Conclusion one: Russian media reports positive stories because they aren&#39;t trying to terrorize their populace like the US media, which is being used by the Deep State as a weapon against it&#39;s populace. </p>

<p>Conclusion two: Russian media is government controlled and promotes puff stories to pacify the populace, the US media is free to report, which results in negative stories which aren&#39;t minimized by an authoritarian government. </p>

<p>Basically, the anecdote proves nothing on it&#39;s own. It simply confirmation your beliefs either way. </p>

<p>This is the most pro-Russia propaganda trash I have ever read. Supposedly the OP hates America and loves Russia but still chooses to live here. </p>

<p>This post whines about American media being negative yet spends most of the follow up being negative and divisive calling America a dirty, awful,miserable, horrible shithole full of immigrant trash (not aware of the irony of himself being an immigrant). My entire inlaw family would disagree with you so much. They came from India with literally nothing in the 80s and now are the American Success Story as business owners and they would laugh at folks trying to claim that America is shithole because we’re a first world country whose citizens can actually buy things.  the US ranks much higher on happiness indexes than Russia but totally believe This post that everyone in America is sad, depressed, miserable people who hate each other. And that Russians all love each other and are so happy all the time. Bull-fucking-shit. Pure pro-Russia, anti-America propaganda. Nearly the same as what is spewed in North Korea. </p>

<p>People seem to ignore the fact the the Kremlin kills and jails journalists for dissent and Putin literally just banned an opponent from running against him in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>I’m proud to be an American and most everyone I know here in America is happy and wouldn’t agree with the narrative that is extremely divisive, negative, hate-mongering of the US. We enjoy friendly banter about football, basketball, baseball, and hockey. We enjoy fantasy football, golf, and this beautiful land with amazing national parks. We enjoy donating time and money and if Russia had a national disaster the scale of other ones like Tsunamis or hurricanes or earthquakes, we’d donate billions just like we do for other countries.  Most Americans wouldn’t care about rosy-glasses, holier-than-thou Russian propaganda. </p>

<p>No one is forcing anyone to stay in this country that some residents seem to hate and want to smear.  And if people want to live here, we’re not going to murder or imprison them like the Kremlin would for dissent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Original Poster, you&#39;re missing one basic point: The Russian people control their own media. The American media is NOT controlled by the American people. It&#39;s controlled by foreign interests, who have an agenda to divide them along racial and gender lines.</p>

<p>You&#39;re assuming that &quot;You&#39;re not seeing unity among Americans&quot;. The reality is: Americans are incredibly peaceful and law-abiding. Blacks and whites get along together. In fact, when France was trying to promote multiculturalism, they used videos of harmonious classrooms . . . that turned out to be from California.</p>

<p>So America is a model of peaceful integration. We&#39;ve had centuries to get it right, whereas Western Europe&#39;s had about ten minutes.</p>

<p>So the average black gets along quite well with the whites surrounding him. Likewise, the average white gets along quite well with the blacks, Asians, Mexicans, etc.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re watching in the media is an alternate reality that doesn&#39;t reflect what&#39;s actually going on in the streets.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why George Soros and crew have to PAY protesters and create synthetic riots. If they weren&#39;t ponying up money, no one would come to these things.</p>

<p>Look at how when the Department of Justice froze George Soros&#39; accounts, all the ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter stuff stopped cold.</p>

<p>So none of these things are real.</p>

<p>The media is fake. As are the paid-for riots.</p>

<p>Remove them and you realize how incredibly peaceful and harmonious America is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unified in a way that Europe never was. Look at how America unified its culture in the fact that you can drive from Maine to California and encounter English all the way. In Europe, you can&#39;t drive five miles without having to switch into another language.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a level of cultural cohesion in America that&#39;s the envy of the world.</p>

<p>But the Powers That Be want that changed. Hence all the race-baiting from the top. The endless Orwellian TV coverage to divide us and pit us against each other.</p>

<p>Are they aliens?</p>

<p>Inter-dimensional ant-like hybrids?</p>

<p>(You seem to be missing my point. My point is not reliant on your democratic idea of &quot;the people&quot;. I&#39;m talking about something less hazy, idealistic, and utopian. I&#39;m not using &quot;people&quot; in a political sense, but in a literal sense. I don&#39;t give a rap about China&#39;s media. I think it sucks. But I don&#39;t deny that the Chinese are running China&#39;s media. Same thing with Russia. Whatever else I may think about their media, I don&#39;t deny that ethnic Russians are running it. When you have people who identify with the nation running the media, you don&#39;t get a press that attacks the nation, President or culture. Chinese media doesn&#39;t attack the Chinese President. Russian media does not attack Russian culture. . . . But contrast, &quot;American&quot; media does nothing BUT attack the nation&#39;s culture, President, people, etc. Their highest good is wholesale demographic replacement. They express nothing BUT contempt for the people in the nation. Only the foreigner is held out to be good--and held up as a contrast to the &quot;lazy, stupid American&quot;. This shit only happens when your media is NOT being run by your people.)</p>

<p>There was an opportunity in the 20th c. for humanity as a whole to make MUCH GREATER progress than it did, because it was intentionally held back. Think, for example, of every leader killed in the sixties. Literally every decent leader anywhere that came up from the grassroots and represented new energy was taken out.
