I was told that they went out for about twenty minutes and came back to the hills nearby totally ablaze and the winds conveniently getting wild. Unfortunately, they are at a high risk of needing to evacuate (again), but they were really insisting the notion that the fires were not naturally started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2004, the FBI came upon intelligence and issued an alert to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) suggesting that Al Queda had plans to start wildland fires in Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, Baird said, noting that all the material he was presenting was unclassified information and his interpretations and analysis were his own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how wildfires burn. They don&#39;t just have a line of burning. They are fluid and spread at different rates. A lot of it depends on the embers. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t control a fire in dry brush so saying oh there&#39;s parts that aren&#39;t burned means literally zero </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fair enough.  but what doesn&#39;t happen in a spreading fire is it doesn&#39;t select what it burns.  everything is burnt that is flammable, more or less.  and when you look at the pictures of these fires you see very selective burns.  not at all what one would expect.</p>
