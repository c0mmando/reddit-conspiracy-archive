       Just heard from family that the fires have started up again in the Sunland-Pasadena-Glendale area. I was told that they went out for about twenty minutes and came back to the hills nearby totally ablaze and the winds conveniently getting wild. Unfortunately, they are at a high risk of needing to evacuate (again), but they were really insisting the notion that the fires were not naturally started.

       In 2004, the FBI came upon intelligence and issued an alert to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) suggesting that Al Queda had plans to start wildland fires in Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, Baird said, noting that all the material he was presenting was unclassified information and his interpretations and analysis were his own.

       I remember reading that – but not on that site!! I had no idea we had a "wildfiretoday.com" to check up on wildfires.

       The FBI would know, since they're close friends with that organization. It would be interesting to know who's behind that site. Sorry not to spend the time.

       It’s a pretty easy  and effective way at causing mass damage.. and potentially never getting caught for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kinda scary. It could be a lot of different groups of terrorists maybe.. Left wing Climate Changers, al qaeda isis, or right wingers because they hate California?? Who knows

       Even just some random asshole could do it.  That's why there isn't a lot of media coverage on possible causes of those fires.  It would alert everyone, malicious or just stupid, to the inherent sensitivity of those area.

       There were a lot of reports of accelerants found in the debris of the Northern California fires (and possible the SoCal ones?), which could support this, although it doesn't rule out our own people (govt.) being involved.

       i was watching the cbc say this was climate change.  no fucking way this is climate change.  their example was a spontaneous (!!) fire that had just popped up while their crew was filming the damage.  totes bullshit rationalization.  there were spots right beside the burned areas that were untouched.  my thought at the time was we're in a quiet war, or at least a targeted burning by whatever tech.  strange days indeed.

       It sounds like the Santa Rosa fires (easy search on this sub, if you haven't seen the vids of that damage/accounts), and it sounds like California in general is being laid to waste – with all that and Fukushima on top of it. Fucking terrible. I'm sorry about what you're going through. I have family out there growing weed. Let me know....

       That's how wildfires burn. They don't just have a line of burning. They are fluid and spread at different rates. A lot of it depends on the embers.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't control a fire in dry brush so saying oh there's parts that aren't burned means literally zero
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wish people would do just a little research on wild fire burning patterns before commenting on wild fire burning patterns

       fair enough.  but what doesn't happen in a spreading fire is it doesn't select what it burns.  everything is burnt that is flammable, more or less.  and when you look at the pictures of these fires you see very selective burns.  not at all what one would expect.

       And mustard weed and other invasive species. My friend was telling me mustard weed back in the spring because everyone was posting picutres of how pretty the yellow was on the hillsides. But apparently it's been fucking us up too as it out competes local vegetation through shade and seeds for wildlife, and is very difficult/annoying to cut down and very flammable.

       Can confirm, it's mostly bums starting fires to stay warm. Husband is a fireman for LA City. With the Santa Ana's we were having this month all it takes is one little ember to get picked up by the wind to start a huge fire.

       Firefighters get caught setting these fires all the time. One guy admitted to setting over 30 of them to get overtime pay and respect from his peers. The forest service inexplicably refuses to use the largest water bombers and won’t employ satellites used by other countries to spot these fires in their infancy. It’s so obvious what’s going on when you follow the money.

       It really is. One of the major networks did a piece on just what an industry it has become and the war that ensues for federal money when the fire crosses state lines. 20/20 or 60 minutes. Some of those guys work a few months out of the year and make a very good living.

       Nothing about the fire cycle in the hills around LA is natural.

       It's a highly altered system contain a complex mix of fire surpressed areas, invasive species, and buildings.

       This will get downvoted, but its a land grab by someone for some reason. Fire also makes the land fertile, burn all the land, properties, etc, pay off "damaged properties/homes" and take control of the land, sell it off privately to people who are interested/or are in charge/etc.
