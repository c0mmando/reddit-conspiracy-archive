        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seriously, I just got into this show recently after having been a longtime lurker of this sub, and holy shit. Some of the episodes put a spin on conspiracies that I’d never even thought of before, or introduced ideas for future technologies that I never would have imagined. Anybody else think this show could be a psy-op to ease us into the idea of some of these technologies that world governments/the CIA have had since the 1900s?</p>

<p>I’ve had some thoughts that were very similar to some Black Mirror episodes while having intense cannabis trips (yeah, I’m a suuuuper lightweight when it comes to weed which is why I’ve always been afraid to try psychedelics. I sometimes feel like I’m going crazy because my high thoughts are so...”out there” in relation to normal everyday socialized thoughts). Episodes such as White Christmas, White Bear, and Playtest entertain the idea that what we perceive as reality could be a simulated reality where we are designed to carry out very specific tasks in an enslaved manner. The reason I can buy into this idea is because our reality is so ridiculously complex that we can logically deduce that any divine creator that could have created it would not have allowed us to experience such immense suffering and other negative emotions in our world...</p>

<p>I don’t know if it’s just me, but some episodes of this show have reeeeeaaaally fucked with my head. Sometimes I wish I’d never been redpilled by smoking weed, but it is what it is. That’s another thing though - the fact that the ingestion of combusted plant matter can completely alter the way I think about the world...there’s no way a divine creator would’ve added this into their creation by some sort of accident. It’s almost like psychoactive chemicals are there for us to explore the different levels, to “unlock” higher levels of consciousness that are imperceivable in our sober mental states...like “leveling up” per se.</p>

<p>Please tell me I’m not the only one...</p>

<p>I was actually reminded of it today when i caught my gf watching an &quot;Asia&#39;s got Talent&quot; episode where there are three judges and the people clapping after every comment in the background. It was unreal how fake it looked after watching that episode in Black Mirror.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for that compliment! I always ask students why they chose to take my classes (they’re elective history and English classes) and I feel kind of weird when sometimes the responses are, “because we heard that we debate whether prostitution should be legal,” or “because we heard that we argue about whether all illicit drugs should be legalized,” but then at the end of the year I realize that those who engage question everything and I guess that’s the goal of education. </p>

But yeah, Black Mirror really fucks me up.
Nosedive especially because in an age of social media and everyone living their egocentric lives, spamming each other with insignificant bullshit it can get weird to think about how much your virtual presence affects your actual identity.
Oh and that video game episode (playtest) is creepy as hell. 
Cant wait to dive into the new season </p>

<p>I watched the,. instantly knew it was metaphorical for a shut-off screen bringing personal meaning, and am not too involved in its propagation as a show. </p>

<p>My parents seem to not enjoy it.</p>

<p>My brother and his wife, both millennial aged in the year everyone got phones and wifi, seem to love it.</p>

<p>They, however, miss the nature of the name, miss the nature of all the dilemmas, and feel more than someone apt to not &#39;plug in&#39; for validation might have elicited a sensation from the content. </p>

<p>In other-words, I imagine out-doorsey people dont get as much into it as techno-addicts. Extroverted personalities, or those more prone to wifi-distractions more a-tune than those who sit on the deck and watch birds. </p>

We are now in the equivalent of Manhattan in Escape from New York.  A place for fallen creations of God.  The world is ruled by the biggest lying maniac fallen one there is (Lucifer) and the entire point of our existence now is to realize we are a fallen cursed creature and seek God and what he wants.  He wants us to realize we are fallen sinners and to repent of that state and trust in Jesus Christ&#39;s blood sacrifice (God come in the flesh) to wash our soul clean from sin so that we can be in his presence after our flesh dies.</p>

<p>Repent and believe this and you will be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>But a lot of people spoke about one particular episode and I&#39;ve got curious.</p>

<p>Man on Fire, S3E5 , is great on the theme of dehumanization. But has a bad ending as well (I guess it may be the series standard). Also.. the actors were cast to please the race baiting crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gosh I love Black Mirror so much. Season 4 starts tonight! EEEk!!!</p>

<p>But seriously, if anything I think Black Mirror would be more of a warning of where we could be headed as opposed to a sort of predictive programming type thing. It feels more concerned than fearful. The episodes are absolutely brilliant though and I don&#39;t feel stupid for watching it. It is, to me, what television should be. Not enough easily accessible television makes you think or challenges your perspective. So much of it is mindless drivel.</p>

<p>I recommend Black Mirror to everyone I meet. Truly. I do tell them to skip the very first episode of season 1 because that one tends to turn people off of the series. I usually start with White Christmas and sometimes Shut Up and Dance.</p>

<p>The reason I can buy into this idea is because our reality is so ridiculously complex that we can logically deduce that any divine creator that could have created it would not have allowed us to experience such immense suffering and other negative emotions in our world...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the fact that we are alive, and that we are growing, shows that if there is a God, he is obviously good. The reason is, if there is a God who has the power of God, he can do what he pleases. If he desired that bad would happen to us, then there is obviously much worse things that could be made to happen to us if he had the power to cause it.</p>

<p>of course there is also suffering, but suffering is different. Life and growth are intrinsic, they happen no matter what, they are the default settings of existence. But suffering is circumstantial, it only exists in a very compartmentalized way, it can be avoided. This shows that it is obviously not the purpose of our existence.</p>

<p>humans have the ability to make choices, it&#39;s part of being alive and being conscious beings. Our choices also have effects. For example when we will to move our arms and legs, it has the effect that our arms and legs actually move in reality, and thus reality is affected. If our choices had no effect on reality, they wouldn&#39;t really be choices, and we wouldn&#39;t really exist as willful agents. What I&#39;m getting at is this: it is necessary that everything humans do is allowed to affect the world, even if the effect is bad, even if it causes suffering. It is necessary because this is the only way that we can truly exist as willful agents and have existences beyond animal existences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s another thing though - the fact that the ingestion of combusted plant matter can completely alter the way I think about the world...there’s no way a divine creator would’ve added this into their creation by some sort of accident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there are all kinds of plants on the earth, some of them cause radical changes to our perception, in fact I&#39;m sure an even greater number will cause radical changes to our perception and then cause us to become sick or die. Likewise there are all kinds of animals on the earth, but not all of them are for eating.</p>

<p>God has his purpose for everything, but we as people confuse ourselves when we try to assume his thinking, ending up with a picture of God that does not reflect God&#39;s true goodness or his true providence. Most likely it is completely impossible for us to understand all the reasoning of God, since God is taking so many complexities into account that are so far beyond our ability to inventory in our own minds. So even as a thought experiment, stepping into the shoes of God and correctly understanding exactly what logic and what factors are informing his decisions will show itself to be a foolish and an impossible task.</p>

<p>God loves you OP. Jesus rose from the dead in real life. God authenticates himself to those who seek him, it doesn&#39;t have to be a mystery, you do not have to be confused about what is true, and you do not have to bullshit yourself. He gives you what you need, and you are intellectually satisfied, and poof, it&#39;s all good. I&#39;m about to leave for work so I need to stop typing. But I just want you to know that I&#39;m not just making up these things I&#39;m saying, I&#39;m saying because I have experienced that they are reality and I am confident that I understand what they are. Take it easy homie</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also just watched a few episodes from the first and second season. I also wonder if it&#39;s a way to fictionalize truth in a sense or as you put it &quot;ease us in&quot; to this self-enslavement mentality. </p>

<p>I live in a legal state and grow cannabis, I use it daily because it actually eases a lot of anxiety I have surrounding human interaction due to a very traumatic childhood. One thing I can tell you is that at C.I.A. charm school the beta slaves are trained to take any drugs offered to them with the exception of marijuana. 
I found this very interesting. Also SSRI&#39;s (anti-depressants) will effect or basically block the effects of LSD, psilocybin, MDMA and other psychoactive substances.
I think psychoactive are a good boat to take you outside the box  but once you are there you don&#39;t require them anymore. </p>

<p>In a spiritual sense I do believe we are already living in a simulation, this is the material realm, the world of the dead. I mean think about it there are a lot more dead people on this planet, i.e. ghosts, spirits etc. than living ones.</p>

<p>Anyway please keep your head up in these trying times, there is definitively some thing the PTB will never understand and it scares them. </p>

Also, The Waldo Moment is a perfect example of how we let memes influence our narrative and viewpoint and that most of the times, a movement may start with good intentions, but once it&#39;s being taken over by the Establishment, they can use it to further their agenda, since it already had a big following. The Nosedive episode also fucked me up, because I can literally see our World turning into that, with instagram, twitter e.t.c Btw, the new season just premiered today on Netflix. </p>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t know about ALL psychoactive substances. </p>

<p>But the human body has cannabinoid receptors, so it appears humans have either been designed for weed or weed for humans. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s why they call it weed. It just grows wherever humans are -- unless they make it illegal. People use the non-high type to assist with pain control. In Colorado, you can buy cannabis pain patches.</p>

<p>The ancient Sythians used to smoke weed. <a href="http://herbmuseum.ca/content/scythians-cannabis">http://herbmuseum.ca/content/scythians-cannabis</a></p>

<p>Try cleansing your system and fasting for a natural high. That&#39;s the real reason some religions suggest forgoing food. When you cleanse your system, you see the euphoric wonders of reality more clearly and you don&#39;t need to spend money or do anything illegal.</p>
