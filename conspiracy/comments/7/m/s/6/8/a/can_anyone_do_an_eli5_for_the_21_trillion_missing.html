       Seems like there is a big story here but I don't know much about it. Is it $21 trillion in funding that they can't account for in their records? Or do they have a debt of $21 trillion for spending they can't account for?
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it in perspective I looked at Apples yearly profit. The figure I saw was $88 billion. It would take 238 years for Apple to hit a profit of $21 trillion. So the pentagon can't account for a sum of money equivalent to 238 years of Profits by a major us company. Why the hell are we talking about who did or didn't collude with Russia when the pentagon can't account for a sum of money that would allow for the real estate purchase of the entire island of manhattan... 20 times over.

       And now supposedly 3800 or 2800 (honestly I can't remember) auditors are set to descend upon the Pentagon...and 3 years from now...the whole thing still won't make sense..so a firm like EY will be brought in and everything will be all better...because people will be too busy dodging bombs from Russia and China to give a duck about the missing money.

       The auditors have been descending on the Pentagon for decades. the DOD Inspector General was made an independent agency in 1978. This figure ($21 trillion) comes from
       <a href="https://missingmoney.solari.com/dod-and-hud-missing-money-supporting-documentation/">
        audit reports over the last 20 years.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that
       <strong>
        not one
       </strong>
       of those audit reports calls it missing money or unauthorized spending. That's what Mark Skidmore calls it without having any idea how the DOD accounting system works or what the accounting entries are.
      </p>
      <p>
       This fiscal year the Department of Defense hopes to actually
       <em>
        pass
       </em>
       a comprehensive financial audit for the first time (more than 20 years overdue), but there have been auditors looking at the books the whole time.

       Not really. All debts are paid in full, via the Chair of St. Peter. But, that is a little further down the rabbit hole. Let's just stick with, debts mean nothing when contracts have been made in violation of certain principles, such as if made under duress and/or fraud. The main pillar behind fiat International Commerce is: "Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur", meaning: "The world wants to be deceived, so let it be deceived".

       If they force it this generation as we’re seeing from the Catholic Church, obama and light and truth does not surface to the level of full enlightenment then it’s still debt.

       Corporations are under International Commercial Law (the US Government and you, are Corporations), and ICL is based in Roman/Papal Law. Has been since the Roman Empire. When the Roman Empire "fell", it became or restructured into the Holy Roman Empire - Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       HRE's rule comes from Divine Domain via the Chair of St. Peter. Fiat is: "Let it be". How is that possible? Because Rome says it's possible, so, if that is the case, Rome can say all Corporate fiat debts are null and void, or paid for in full (ie. never existed in the first place. It's like we are all playing a IRL game of monopoly).

       Can you expound on your comment please?  I've been looking into this recently and apparently the Constitution is suspended in rooms , including court, that fly the American flag trimmed in gold? Maritime law rules at that point. It has to do with the city of London aka the Crown owning the USA corporation via the Virginia company which was set up by the king of England after our independence was claimed. Basically America is still a British colony.  Not saying this is true just trying to find the truth. Thanks

       This is all nonsense, nothing trumps the rule of Law and the Constitution in America. There's no loophole to get you out of debt or put of jail. Before you ask me for proof in the face of something glaringly obvious like 90% of this sub, go look for proof to refute the current legal framework. There is none. Look at the countless videos of "sovereign citizens" getting fucked in court because what they believe holds zero merit.

       NESARA implements the following changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        1. Zeros out all credit card, mortgage, and other bank debt due to illegal banking and government activities. This is the Federal Reserve’s worst nightmare, a “jubilee” or a forgiveness of debt.
       </li>
       <li>
        2. Abolishes the income tax.
       </li>
       <li>
        3. Abolishes the IRS. Employees of the IRS will be transferred into the US Treasury national sales tax area.
       </li>
       <li>
        4. Creates a 14% flat rate non-essential new items only sales tax revenue for the government. In other words, food and medicine will not be taxed; nor will used items such as old homes.
       </li>
       <li>
        5. Increases benefits to senior citizens.
       </li>
       <li>
        6. Returns Constitutional Law to all courts and legal matters.
       </li>
       <li>
        7. Reinstates the original Title of Nobility amendment.
       </li>
       <li>
        8. Establishes new Presidential and Congressional elections within 120 days after NESARA’s announcement. The interim government will cancel all National Emergencies and return us back to constitutional law.
       </li>
       <li>
        9. Monitors elections and prevents illegal election activities of special interest groups.
       </li>
       <li>
        10. Creates a new U.S. Treasury rainbow currency backed by gold, silver, and platinum precious metals, ending the bankruptcy of the United States initiated by Franklin Roosevelt in 1933.
       </li>
       <li>
        11. Forbids the sale of American birth certificate records as chattel property bonds by the US Department of Transportation.
       </li>
       <li>
        12. Initiates new U.S. Treasury Bank System in alignment with Constitutional Law
       </li>
       <li>
        13. Eliminates the Federal Reserve System. During the transition period the Federal Reserve will be allowed to operate side by side of the U.S. treasury for one year in order to remove all Federal Reserve notes from the money supply.
       </li>
       <li>
        14. Restores financial privacy.
       </li>
       <li>
        15. Retrains all judges and attorneys in Constitutional Law.
       </li>
       <li>
        16. Ceases all aggressive, U.S. government military actions worldwide.
       </li>
       <li>
        17. Establishes peace throughout the world.
       </li>
       <li>
        18. Releases enormous sums of money for humanitarian purposes.
       </li>
       <li>
        19. Enables the release of over 6,000 patents of suppressed technologies that are being withheld from the public under the guise of national security, including free energy devices, antigravity, and sonic healing machines.
       </li>

       Meh, most are probably not real (intangible) assets anyway...but i've read the 21 trillion is mostly / partly balance sheet imbalances that they just need to offset to lower the the gross number down a few trillion.

       The idea behind your question is those that can't work will have plenty of resources to support them due to the shift in the system.

       Really, there are very few people who I'd take seriously when talking about this. It does take a level of expertise to untangle.
      </p>
      <p>
       My non expert opinion is that the $21 trillion number was used as an attention grabbing headline. I have no doubt there's a real story of government unaccountability there, but I don't believe the number is as clear cut as it's being made out to be -- not for a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this story would require many hours of heavy lifting to interpret correctly (boring analysis of financial records and government spending reports). This is why I take the shocking headline with a grain of salt. Again, I don't doubt there's wrecklessness in government spending

       Yes and no though right?  Wasn't it Rumsfeld that announced it? So was he announcing it because he was investigating or being investigated? If he was grabbing headlines, wouldn't he be one to scream the loudest and persist if there was something going on that he genuinely wanted to call attention to despite 9/11 or at least come back to it at some point after 9/11 war on terror settled in? Kinda seems like he announced it, knowing it was gonna raise holy hell and "lucky" for him 9/11 went down and became a needed distraction. If it hadn't gone down, or gone down the way they'd "hoped" (depending on ones personal views of the conspiracy), it would be a decent fall back. Like "hey, Rumsy did announce it but we had this 9/11 thing." If it wasn't 9/11 it could've still been a dozen other things and Rumsfeld is the kind of guy who knew something would pop up he could jump on and wag the dog for a distraction 9/11 or otherwise.

       I have to bow out due to ignorance on this one. I do feel my post is usually relevant, but it was a sort of generic criticism of stories like this I often see sensationalized to take advantage of the general public's lack of entry level finance/econ knowledge

       Yeah, I have to bow out to an extent too because, like I said, IDk if Rumsfeld was blowing the whistle or admitting to something he knew was gonna hit the fan anyway and 9/11 basically bailed him out of having to explain.  Again, strange he makes the announcement, but no follow up? I also don't know how he does financially these days, sure he's fine, but I'm pretty sure Dick Cheney, who was tied to Halliburton, benefited enormously from the no-bid contracts his company received during the response to 9/11. I'm guessing if there was spending discrepancy to the tune of 21 trillion, and much of that is supposedly due to contractor over-bids and Halliburton was plenty big into contracting before 9/11, financially speaking 9/11 was a win, win for HB. It would drop many of the questions of impropriety down the memory hole and/or  make them a pile of new cash. I'll have to do some more digging if no one chimes in.

       Donald Rumsfeld himself said the Pentagon was missing $2.1 trillion on 9/10/01.  We've had two major wars and a host of smaller one's.  We've had a government bailout of massive banks.  The collapse of our economy.  Obama was able to basically double the national debt in 8 years.  I don't think it's too far fetched to believe that $21 trillion can not be accounted for.

       There's only missing money when someone takes the time to look at it. There are people, actual humans, that can create the money and put it into circulation. It can go to whomever they want. This 21 Trillion in "unauthorized spending," which means they had that much to spend to begin with. If it wasn't in an authorized budget, then someone else gave it to them by adding 0s to the bank accounts.

       TL:DR It's not missing. The "scholars" doing the calculations and research do not understand government bids and cost overruns for projects. It's just the standard contractors over charging the government for bullshit like $50,000 screws or $5,000 washers.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this "discrepancy" is, is a alteration of contracts for various goods/services that have over runs which is a frequent thing aka all the damn time. The government authorizes a certain amount based on bids companies send in to do the thing the government wants. The company is awarded a bid and their bid number is set aside for paying the company. The company than finds out that they can't do the thing at that price and so request a price increase. The government authorizes it outside of the standard bid documentation(because obviously it's a different issue) due to it being easier/cheaper to just authorize the cost overrun than it is to close the program and open up a new bidding process. Every time the government wants to purchase something or needs something done, it must be done through a bidding process to be "fair" where they get offers from all the companies that find out about the bidding. There is significant amounts of collusion that go into it and of course collusion again with rigging bullshit costs/prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't have anything to do with "off the record" stuff because the money that is used for "off the record" stuff aka black budget, isn't recorded in the first place and so you cannot find the money being spent by the government due to the government not actually spending any money on it. Black budget programs are funded through various ways usually drug sales/distribution or weapons/technology sales. CIA and crack, CIA and guns in mexico, Iran-contra affair etc.... these are just examples of known black budget funding programs.

       What you say sounds close to how others have explained it.  But do you really think that companies that do the cost under bid/over bid shuffle, like you described, don't use that money to fund Black ops on the side? You think $10,000 toilet seat profits all go toward caviar and CEO bonuses? It must get divested right? Put some of that money into poppy or arms or training a certain group, whatever, for another return on investment?

       No. no. No. accounting doesn't work like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume when the say "missing 21 trillion" - that either the bank account is down 21 trillion with no inventory or expense - or accounts payable (contract accounts)- to account for the 21 trillion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the big point missed in the top two posts. The last time the government announced they would be sending in auditors to account for 11 trillion missing - a day later 9/11 happened with the middle that hit the pentagon destroying "" the boxes that were to be audited. How convenient.

       Basically the Military operates outside of any accountability, so we know they’re wasting a shit ton of our money, but it’s hard to say how much exactly, and what for. But, you know, this is Murcia, so we don’t ask too many questions.

       IDK, I'd say we ask more than most, but our politicians are used to it and have evolved to be  more adept at distraction under scrutiny. Either way, I suppose lack of accountability wins for tptb.

       Since it hasn't been mentioned and for those who may not have heard the story or for those like me who have and don't know, can anyone she'd light on whether or not the plane that hit the pentagon really hit the offices of the accounting team tasked with putting together the pieces of the 21 trillion? Thanks.

       No. There was no investigation being done at the Pentagon,it's an audit issue not a intelligence issue.

       I see it as a response to the withholding of resources which would lead to a paradigm shift in response to evils that exist concept.

       The idea behind your question is those that can't work will have plenty of resources to support them due to the shift in the system.
