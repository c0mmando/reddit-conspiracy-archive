       It seems to me like circumcision is one of those things where they were done and then they tried to find reasons that it's good. Instead of the logical way. I'm circumcised and hung no complaints from me but I think on a psychological level the effects are much more impactful.

       Edit: and of course there are obvious medical scenarios where cosmetic surgery is needed to correct something.

       I'm Jewish, circumcision is implied for any son I have (I'm a woman) but there's no way I'm letting any son of mine be cut as a child. He can have it done when he's a legal adult and if, which he probably won't do given the scenario, he chooses to have it done then that's on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumcision should be outright banned for infants unless an actual medical reason, not that debunked "it stops aids" idiocy, can be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that it's not a form of mind control. If anything, pain as an infant desensitizes them over the long term (like how Native Americans used to methodically harm their children to build up pain tolerance as warriors) and does the opposite of increase submissivess. But one incident would be negligible overall.

       Nope, you are scum, if I met you in real life I would not hesitate to call you scum, and I have met self hating Jewish garbage like you and I always suggest suicide or Christianity might be a better move for them
      </p>
      <p>
       You do you, but I pray ever evil in this life should happen to you, that god punishes you and takes from you anything you love and cherish, that from this day till your last days you experience only pain and Shane and humiliation- for you, your friends, your family, and your children
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope god ruins you till you are a husk sitting on a pile of ash begging for forgiveness but there is none to be found because you are beyond forgiveness- go seek redemption with false gods and lying churches, you have no place among anyone who loves god

       It's not hate, but mostly the trickery I see them employ. I've done business with several, and stayed friends with a couple of jewish men. They all know of my views and they know the extent of our relationship ends when it stops being good for the parties, and funniest thing, most of them are or say to be in agreeance of my views.

       It's not just the sexual pleasure for the male, but, also for the female (which makes it double evil, imo). When you're not cut, it's far more sensitive, and that translates over to the woman (so I'm told by woman from my experiences). They've told me, there was a huge difference between "cut" and "uncut", and the latter was far more sensational and better. Remember, men and women are yin and yang. Yes, my evidence is anecdotal, but still valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       There also is something very spiritual about orgasm. The ancients knew this. Which makes you wonder why they taught the plebs to mutilate their children, whereas, they most likely did not. Knowledge truly is power...

       There are plenty of arguments against circumcision but this just isn't true.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of sensitivity differences are random or what you do to your dick. I'm circumcised and still very sensitive. Every girl I've ever talked about sex with says it makes no difference to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the equivalent of saying everyone who isn't circumcised will end up with gross infections because it can happen. And no, it's not fucking mind control. Dear God, I'm missing some dick skin, hail the government

       If it’s not a forced procedure then what is the deal here? After your son is born just decide to not have him cut, that’s all. I’m cut and I don’t hate my parents for it, if they left me uncut I wouldn’t hate them for that either.

       it's understandable you're upset about what they did to you but that doesn't mean you need to rationalize it away. You could still be valuable to the next person or your children. and even if you are happy cut that's your decision and doesn't mean that chopping up baby dicks is any more reasonable than if you disagreed.

       Because eyelids are a mucous membrane but the foreskin and glans aren't. The glans only gets lubricated when aroused through fluid emitted by the penis. The advantage of the foreskin is that it provides mechanical lubrication by easily moving back and forth.

       Do you remember being a baby? Is a baby's mind even controllable? At what age can a mind be controlled? I mean, it might be painful to a baby, or anyone, but it's not like it's done multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       To control something, you need to train it, you need to remove elements and replace with your desires... wash the brain. I don't think babies have much to wash, except "Ow! That hurt!!"

       Now, I can't say if circumcision is good or bad. I never thought about it too much. Maybe ask an adult who decided to get circumsized and see what his thoughts were before and after. Does he feel better or worse? Would he do it again?

       So the nurse is controlling the babies mind by circumcising him, huh? So causing one instance of pain to a baby is mind control? One a scale of zero to ten, with 10 being complete mind control and 0 being no lasting impact, you give 2 minutes of pain what?
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly is the intention of the mind control? What does the nurse want the babies mind to to do? Be afraid of pain? Of scissors? Of sharp objects near his penis?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about all other pains that a baby might encounter such as falling in the crib? Or the mom accidentally dropping her baby? Or giving the baby painful shots (Ouch!)? Is that trauma based mind control? If so, why? If it's not, how come it isn't?

       :) I feel you. While I understand your desire of preventing harm and "mutilation" to young males, I wonder if you feel like there are ANY pros to circumcision? Or do you just feel like it's wrong to make that decision for an infant? Do you think it would be better to let the baby grow up with an uncircumcised penis, and if he wants to cut it off, let him choose to do so when he has a full understanding of the choice he is making?

       Yes I think it could improve someone's life latter on if they are having difficulty medically or aesthetically. I could even see it being good as a young adult spiritual right of passage with everything explained and agreed upon. My main problem with it is the lack of consent  as well as the possible subconscious damage.

       Gotcha. Basically, you feel like the mother is making the wrong decision by having her baby boy circumcised? You feel like the mother doesn't know what is best for her child? If there was a penile infection on the baby's foreskin, that caused the baby severe pain for several weeks, should the mother allow the baby to suffer traumatically for several weeks? Or, if it was possible to relieve that baby's pain with a circumcision that will hurt momentarily for a couple of minutes, should the mother circumcise the child?

       What if it was the mother AND father who chose to get the baby circumcised? Or what if it was primarily the father who wanted to get the circumcision? What if the father is a doctor who saw so many babies go uncircumcised only to have issue after issue with cancer forming on the foreskin of infants and adults who chose not to get circumcised. He was doing it as a precaution. Does that make them terrible parents?
      </p>
      <p>
       I get your argument. But, there are several reasons a parent might want to have their baby boys circumcised. It is not a major procedure, and doesn't have any lasting effects. It may reduce or prevent issues that may occur later in life. I feel like this is more of a medical based decision than a conspiracy.

       Generating psychopaths is the worst but also the head of the dick is no different than the clit. The clit needs to stay wet at all time last why not the mushroom tip? Glans need to be moist to be healthy.

       I think severe trauma can definitely fuck anyone or any age permanently. They don't use anesthesia in American or Islamic circumcisions IIRC. Jews use a bit of wine which is enough to put the baby asleep.

       Impact of actions during earlier development takes hold in the subconscious, and creates problems later in life. This is the meaning of mind control.

       I would recommend looking into Stanslov Grof's research using LSD psychotherapy. He would guide his patients while they were tripping to re-experience their past traumas. This was done to integrate the experience so that one can let go of the emotional baggage associated so as to better your daily life. As the sessions continue they would go further back into their history re-experiencing earlier traumas each session, even to stuff that they had hid deep inside their psyche. If they stuck with it all the way they'd always end up re-experiencing their own birth. The birth is the first trauma that is imparted unto everyone and after it is re-experienced by the patient they tend to have a much  healthier outlook on life and they rediscover their connection to the universe. Subsequent sessions will generally involve them experiencing other selves (some would experience being a princess, some a tiger, etc etc), this was what Grof called the "transpersonal" experience. So the fact that the birth being the original trauma is so impactful on a person's psyche makes me think that your experiences as a baby are crucial to your psychological development, even if you can't remember the experience in your waking life. The memories are there whether or not you can recall them.

       You don't need to consciously remember something for it to have a profound affect on you. I suppose its the same as we don't "remember" learning to talk or walk, but we do it everyday and how we learned can have an affect on how we perform those actions on a daily basis.

       Pretty sure the doctor framed your parents with the phimosis scarecow. Now phimosis is
       <strong>
        very rare
       </strong>
       and you didnt have that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody in your family knew how a normal penis develops and that some stretching during the first erections is normal. So they did believe the doctor and genetically mutilate you.

       Oh I'd Love to. So yeah This was an interesting thread. I've never thought what happened was out of the ordinary. But yeah so how the story goes. I was young. Like elementary/beginning of middle school. I got in a very bad accident. Like life threatening. I went to the hospital. I was in ICU for a few days and had a crazy surgery. Well when I got to the ER they intibated me.  They gave me a catheter. Now again. I was young. Pre Puberty and stuff. And so they pulled my foreskin behind my head but it wasn't ready for that. It was too tight around it and was cutting off circulation and my dick got super swollen. Phimosis I think they called it. They put me in for a circumcision. I went in and got it done. This thread was very interesting. Can they not put a catheter on an uncircumcised penis? I was fine with it. I was always self conscious about not having it cut. What do you guys think?

       The clamps used to pull the kid out sometimes pinch the brain; a few minutes later, the kid is slapped, needles are poked into it, penis skin is removed, then they get an eyedropper of chemical formula forced down their throat. All this happens before they reach Mom's loving breast.

       Not a long story. If the baby has issues like pre mature birth it's stuck in a pod that mimics
The womb. I've never been told a very detailed version of events but something must have gone wrong.
And my moms fried. Was like um should it be this hot? And the dr was like wtf no.

       None of what you just described happened with my kid.  I know clamps do happen, but they don't slap the kid anymore and I don't know what formula forced down their throat you are talking about.  My kid went straight from vagina, into my arms, and then immediately to his mother's chest for skin to skin contact.  I had to grab him again as my wife had a lot of tearing and she started to pass out from blood lose (super scary).  Then they took him to the measuring area which was actually just next to us separated by the curtain.  There was no point where he was taken away from our sight.  What hospital are you getting your kids delivered at?  They sound barbaric.

       Father of two, ages 3 and 5, and in fact can confirm BOTH of these sets of facts happened with my kids.  After Mom held our sons for a few moments, they were taken to the nursery where we were told they needed to do vitals and such and no I could not accompany.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in the paper work they had her fill out they slipped in the consent for circumcision.  We hadn't even discussed it.  This same hospital after her second delivery argued about tying her tubes - after discussing it with her doctor for months.  She was literally cut open (C-section) threatening to sue if they didn't carry out her wishes.

       Well it is probably just dependent on each hospital then.  I know the clamp thing is still a possibility, but I know they only use it if they have to.  Really they followed our wishes pretty well.  We were able to do a delayed cord cutting, they allowed skin to skin contact with the mother right away and even let me hand him to her.  The vitals and measurements were done in the same room as us.  Never had an eyedropper of chemical formula shoved down his throat.  Never had needles near him that I remember, other than a prick on his heel to get a blood sample.  To be fair I was running on like no sleep for a couple days so I could be remembering wrong.  Also our hospital had just finished a new wing specifically for baby deliveries, so they might have tailored it to eliminate things like taking the baby away for X amount of time.  They did fuck up some things though and their billing department is from hell.  Been almost 2 years now and we still haven't gotten them to properly bill our insurance yet.  Just a non-stop source of stress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have heard bad things about people who wanted their tubes tied though and the hassle they have to put up with to do it.

       Idk I'm uncut but I'm a sociopath and about as mentally ill as the average redditor.
      </p>
      <p>
       But technically I did have a much milder form of intentional ritualized trauma as a kid. Some Hindus do this thing where they shave the kid's head and pierce its ears at a very young age. I watched another one later on and it looked pretty traumatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there was an old hag at the one I watched that supposedly got possessed when I was there, I hope she was acting but fucking creepy either way. She was dancing around eyes lolling saying how the local god wanted a pig sacrificed instead of the goat. I wonder if pork was a euphemism for human like it was in Polynesia...

       shaving a 4 year olds head isnt traumatic. not even close. piercing of the ears isn't required.

       jews muslims - circumsised trash yeah.

       I didn't say it was traumatic, I said it looked traumatizing but in a milder way. Likely doesn't have the same permanent effects.

       lets just stick to the effects of trauma of circumcision which is awful shit. good you weren't cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       btw there is no animal or human sacrifice in hinduism it is projection by the jews and islamists to first blame the other for their own ills so that no one notices their shitty demonic paedophilia filled child sacrifice filled and trauma based mind control religion.

       Yeah but nowadays people masturbate enough to make the sensitivity equal between cut and uncut.

       Also I think most people my age are going to let their potential kids stay uncut so it should be out in a couple generations, at least for non-religious circumcisions.

       Don't you understand the difference in masturbating for 10 minutes and having every movement with clothes on brush up against the part that should only be exposed when erect? Not to mention how it is supposed to be moist, not the outermost layer etc.

       Maybe the traumatic part is that they just force the earring into your ear instead of a normal piercing? And hold your head down while shaving with a straight razor. Also the crowd probably isn't good for a 1 year old kid either.

       Because it always just turns into a circle-jerk of uncut dudes jerking off about how they are "intact" and cut guys are somehow lesser. Just look at some of these comments. "They were hurt when they were most vulnerable so they cling to authority to protect them". Whatever helps you sleep at night pal.

       I saw a video on the Sumerian creation story a while ago and this was  addressed. I have no way of sourcing this but I'm absolutely sure this is what was said.  According to the clay tablets that were found,  Enlil was a Sumerian god and he later became known as Yahweh. His half brother Enki created man through DNA manipulation (Enki's and a hominid) to be a slave race to do their manual labor on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The  Annunaki did not have foreskin and Enki's creation, man, obviously did. Enlil (Yahweh) commanded that all men be circumcised to constantly remind them of their slave status and the Gods that created them. Take that FWIW, I thought I'd just add to your comment. Again, I have no idea which documentary I saw it from and cannot source it. Maybe someone else can??

       It's not mentioned here yet but in ancient times the origin of circumcision was to mark you as a slave. If I remember correctly it was done to Hebrews but i may have that backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that it is still done to this day for the same reason. Kellogg tried to say it was to deaden a mans desires to make him less wanky and modern science says it is a hygiene thing. No matter which way you slice it is wrong and needs to stop.

      <p>
       Some one, some thing or some group has managed to keep the tradition alive.

       Follow the money. Who do you think uses the cut foreskins to extract cells from for experiments? Who do you think gets a bonus for performing these (cosmetic) surgeries? Who wants to keep this tradition alive and why?

       Besides 87% of the worlds men are not circumcised so perhaps if you are American/Canadian/Australian/Jew/Muslim then possibly.

       Sure but if we entertain the hundredth monkey effect essentially meaning that once  Michael Jackson did the moonwalk on stage every adequate dancer could do it twice as well.  Then we have to wonder what percent of people have to be traumatized to cause the world to be schizophrenic.

       I would go a step further and say Circumcision is full on trauma based mind control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men who are circumcised are capable of the most insane fits of rage especially when they are drunk. Why do European men get jolly when they drink while Americans tend to brawl and fight when they are drunk? This has been observed countless times when our soldiers and tourists are overseas. The European men can get drunk and it does not cause a problem but when Americans get drunk we get violent. Drunk men beating their wives is a uniquely American problem. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the circumcision. Circumcision is trauma based mind control. It is no coincidence that when circumcision rates started rising in the late 1800s it mirrored in the temperance movement for the prohibition of Alcohol. The temperance movement was largely lead by woman who were getting beat by their drunk husbands. This was never a problem before but when circumcision became fashionable in America our men started beating their wives. It is insane how this happened and how people blamed the bottle instead of the knife.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason Jews and Muslims aren't allowed to drink alcohol. It is affects them differently because they are circumcised and makes them lose their minds. Americans are the only people in the world who are both circumcised and drink alcohol. America was also the only Christian nation to ever take it upon itself to completely ban alcohol because something went horribly wrong with our culture in the late 1800s early 1900s. I will say it again. Drunk men beating their wives is a uniquely American problem. Other cultures have abusers too but they beat their wives when they are sober. There is a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumcision is the perfect crime. It is done to people at a time in their lives when they cannot remember it happening. However, the trauma never goes away. It merely gets buried in their subconsciousness. Alcohol brings the trauma to the surface where it is expressed as an incredible rage. To understand where this rage is coming from one has to understand that circumcision is torture. Circumcision is surgery without anesthesia. It is as painful as having your fingernails ripped out and is akin to be skinned alive. Babies have screamed so hard their lungs collapsed and have had heart attacks and ruptured organs. Around 200 babies die every year from circumcision. Those that survive the ordeal are scared for life and will never be normal emotionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we expect men not to lash out at the world when as their first experience in life is to be tortured just hours or days after being born. The extreme pain coming from having the most sensitive part of their body crushed in a clamp and then cut off without anesthesia rewires the brain. Go look up a few videos of babies being circumcised on YouTube. It will be a real eye opener from so people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumcision weaponizes the penis to make rape easier. The foreskin can tear during violent sex which would be very painful for the rapist. Removing the foreskin ie circumcision make rape easier. Foreskin makes normal sex easier but rape more difficult. A circumcised penis has about as much feeling as the forearm. Circumcised penis can be used as a weapon for violent thrusting during a rape that would be too painful for a intact uncircumcised penis. Circumcision perversely destroys the healthy relationship between man and woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumcision also weaponizes the male population in general to have a propensity for all kinds of violence from murder, to rape, to having a desire to go to war. It is trauma based mind control, MK-Ultra on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       On 9/11 the twin towers of the world trade center was a phallic symbol and when the towers were destroyed it triggered the MK-Ultra mind control of America's circumcised population to desire war. Seeing the destruction of the phallic towers was subconscious reminder of circumcision trauma. Every circumcised male has a biological desire to seek revenge for the trauma they received as babies but it suppressed deep within the subconscious. The destruction of the towers triggered the inner rage of America's male population and channeled it into a political agenda for the elite's war machine. When George W Bush invaded Iraq on false pretense he had an 80% approval rating. Where did that approval rating come from? Think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is it about 9/11 that injures America so deeply? It was an attack on America's number one phallic symbol. It triggered biological programming to seek revenge for our collective penis injuries.

       Again you are wrong.. intoxication is allowed on high holidays it is encouraged on holidays such as Purim and rosh hashana because they are festive and happy occasions. You are not allowed to be intoxicated during prayer. Your statements are very misleading.

       This is a well structures and thought out post, so I'll upvote. But I disagree with a lot of points brought up, mostly blurring the lines between circumcision and alcohol, both are bad but people get drunk and fight ALL over the world, alcohol is a shitty drug and easily abused no matter how much foreskin you have.

       From my understanding alcohol tends to bring any and all past traumas to the surface. Alcohol by itself isn't a problem unless there is an underlying problem in the person who is drinking and getting drunk. If someone has PTSD then alcohol will only make it worse. Circumcision is basically a deeply suppressed form of PTSD that can be brought to surface through intoxication.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I originally connected alcohol with circumcision is because of the temperance movement which arose at the exact time circumcision started to take off in America. Why is it that people have been drinking alcohol for hundreds of years suddenly become motivated to ban alcohol at the exact same moment circumcision became a routine practice. Also consider this only happened in America. America is the only Christian nation to ever ban alcohol and also the only Christian nation to practice circumcision on a large scale and both things arose at the exact same time. In Europe where there is little to no circumcision there is no temperance movement. That is in essence a triple correlation.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say correlation does not prove causation. However, a triple correlation proves a trend and trends prove causation. Society blamed its social ills on the wrong thing. We blamed the bottle instead of the knife. Alcohol only brought the problem to the surface so we shot the messenger and banned Alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throw in the fact that the temperance movement itself was lead by women to bring their abusive husbands to heel and that adds in a 4th correlation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The temperance movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries was an organized effort to encourage moderation in the consumption of intoxicating liquors or press for complete abstinence. The movement's ranks were mostly filled by women who, with their children, had endured the effects of unbridled drinking by many of their menfolk. source:
        <a href="http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1054.html">
         http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1054.html
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why did this only happen in America? Did European women enjoy being beaten by their husbands and how come women don't get violent when they get drunk. Neither women nor European men are circumcised. The timing of everything just falls perfectly into place. Add in the fact that circumcising Muslims banned alcohol centuries ago making Americans the only people on the planet to drink Alcohol and practice circumcision brings in a 5th correlation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be a very easy case for a historical scholar to prove if they wrote books and published papers about it. I don't have time to write books on this subject because there are literally hundreds of other conspiracy theories drawing my attention away.

       Americans getting rowdy or not being able to handle themselves while drunk has a lot more to do with the fact that they can't drink til they are 21. In Europe, a lot of families will give their children wine with dinner or sparingly starting at like 14 years old. This allows them to understand it better by the time they are "of age". In America, you turn 21 and it becomes a fucking free-for-all because you haven't gotten your feet wet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your other points are just you patting yourself on the back. So 87% of men are uncircumcised; and mainly American/European/Jewish men are. So are you saying those 13% cause most of the rape? Because their penis is a "more efficient
       <em>
        weapon

       "? What about all of the unreported rape or
       <em>

       rape in certain areas of the world.

       This is pretty much exactly the same as America. Most Americans tried alcohol in their teen years.

      <p>
       Where are you getting these statistics from? What about the 2 billion Muslims who are circumcised and the millions of traditional Africans who also circumcise. Do I even need to point out who is responsible for the rape crisis in Europe in recent years? In South Africa they kidnap uncircumcised boys and forcibly circumcise them. Africans actually invented it before the Jews and it was practiced in ancient Egypt.

       I think circumsision is a tool, used to increase the created duality between male and female.
      </p>
      <p>
       This duality has been and still is used in many religions and cultures to influence the natural balance. The un-equality and acceptance of females is enlarged so the male energies can get "the upper hand". This unequality/ duality card is not only played on the male/ female level, but on all levels and the result is an unbalance and chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would even go so far to say genetalian circomsisions are also used in the same way. Sexual energy is also part of the creating power we have and a very strong one. Circomsizing females results in the decline of the sexual creative energy of females. Circomsizing males on the other hand does exactly the opposite, leaving the tip exposed to constant stimulation results in a constant flow of sexual energy and therefor creating energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if some are able to steer all the extra male energy with fear and ego based propagande you have a lot of creating energy to controll our "reality" and drive many away from natural Love.
      </p>
      <p>
       Male and female energy resonating in harmony and Love are very powerfull and can create new life. But an inbalance and/ or miss-use of energy out of ego, fear, ignorance or being mislead can create chaos.

       I don't see that link, many circomsized males are very active. IMO it is only ment to decrease the pleasureble sensations of females, not to reduce the sexual act an sich as a form of population control.

       The main reasoning behind circumcision is the idea that men (the pharaoh) made a "better" man then god himself. An "improved" man if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a pharaonic practice to show alliance to the ruler. An ode to the 13th part of osiris, hence why all the obelisks are cut in a particular way at the top.

       I’d argue the entire modern birthing process would be the first trauma, not just circumcision. That said, I’m circumcised and was birthed pre-maturely and here I am, questioning authority and thinking independently. Idk, if birth is our first step in some trauma based mind control conspiracy it doesn’t seem very effective. Also childhood mortality rates are waaaaay down from even a hundred years ago so maybe we’re doing something right? Just my two cents

       Allow me to go really deep into the rabbit-hole for just a moment:
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's possible that circumcision does permanent damage to the subtle multi-dimensional body that is our fuller &amp; truer form. It rips the subtle matter of the delicate, developing auric field &amp; the etheric body, leaving a small hole in our toroidal energy body that can then be easily accessed by all manner of negative astral or higher-dimensional predators. This allows scavenging of the
       <em>
        powerful &amp; vital
       </em>
       male sexual energy throughout a male's entire life, as well as leaving them open to all manner of negative astral influence.

       If it’s not a forced procedure then what is the deal here? After your son is born just decide to not have him cut, that’s all. I’m cut and I don’t hate my parents for it, if they left me uncut I wouldn’t hate them for that either.

       The hard part to isolate is the parents. Parents that chose not to circumcise do so for different reasons in general I think parents that don't do something just because it is status quo are likely to raise their child to question the status quo about other things, leading to a kid that is less susceptible to following blindly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm uncut and feel like I am more skeptical of shit than most. But I was also born premature and C-section. Those are both factors too.

       I'd buy it though. Could be feasible.

       Where are you talking about? Why would protestants not get circumcised? It's the status quo among catholic and Protestant in the US. Never heard of it being a religious thing for anyone except for Jewish faith. Maybe different in Europe but never heard any religious reasons against it.

       I am older and I was raised on the east coast.. Circumcision was just normal. As an adult, it seemed to explain why men are more violent. The first thing they experience in life is this painful trauma. How is that a good start in life? I also wondered why it was necessary if it wasn't by natures' design.

       The medical industry profits greatly from the free flesh trade known as circumcision. Ironically, the parents are sold back their child's mutilated genitalia in the form of wrinkle cream for mom and an ulcer graft for dad.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of evil God demands a child to sacrifice his foreskin? I suppose He's a little better than the one that demands a child to sacrifice his entire body, but not by much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumcision has always been the mark of a slave. Even before there was a billion dollar industry profiting off it. The foreskin is the most sensitive part of a man's penis and provides the necessary gliding action for sexual intercourse. Americans are circumcised regularly for many interrelated reasons, such as: compulsory war-time circumcisions for draftees during the World Wars; Dr. Kellog and the rest of the medical community pushing circumcision as a cure for sexual promiscuity; puritanical American attitudes about sex; and of course, disproportionate Jewish influence in media, medicine, and politics.

       Hmm. I didn't get circumcised until I was like 7, my real Dad was a Marine and Sherrif, weird because my mom said he was the one who objected.
      </p>
      <p>
       He passed when I was 6 or so, and I got circumcised. I mean, I personally don't feel like I was victimized or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe its a cultural and societal thing, and I know for a fact my penis looks way cooler circumcised and more appealing for sexy times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weird that my dad would've protested? Considering he was directly part of the government.

       It's not perpetrated by the government it's the media. The problem I have is with babies. If it's done latter it should always be with the child's consent. This makes it not trauma.

       Father of two, ages 3 and 5, and in fact can confirm BOTH of these sets of facts happened with my kids.  After Mom held our sons for a few moments, they were taken to the nursery where we were told they needed to do vitals and such and no I could not accompany.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in the paper work they had her fill out they slipped in the consent for circumcision.  We hadn't even discussed it.  This same hospital after her second delivery argued about tying her tubes - after discussing it with her doctor for months.  She was literally cut open (C-section) threatening to sue if they didn't carry out her wishes.
