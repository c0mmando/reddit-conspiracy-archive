        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have never been one to support the conspiracy theories that say Assange is no longer at the embassy or that WikiLeaks has been compromised. However, after the recent weirdness around Assange’s twitter account and the Christmas Eve deletion/suspension - I have noticed a lot of weird activity from his  account.  </p>

<p>The first one being that he is now following a lot of Ecuadorian government officials. Whereas before he only followed the official WikiLeaks twitter, he is now following, and retweeting the Pope. He’s tweeting in Spanish about as much as he’s tweeting in English. And he’s also <em>much</em> less active than before.    </p>

<p>I could obviously be totally off base with all of this. However, all signs currently point to something fishy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It is a possibility. 
He agreed to stop making political statements about any country, especially about Spain. These days Ecuador&#39;s president is visiting  Spain so it was imminent that Assange would have to obey Ecuador&#39;s order. </p>

<p>My guess is Ecuador asked him to shut up as this was affecting its diplomacy with other countries. Otherwise he would be kicked out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn’t that sound a little <em>too obvious?</em></p>

<p>I mean, if you were the Ecuadorian officials and you want to keep the fact that you control his account under wraps, would you do all of these actions?</p>

<p>Now, if you wanted to make it <em>look</em> like they did... still obvious.  Right??</p>

<p>All really really weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the British and US govt would freak and complain via MSM if he had escaped the embassy. they would be whining like HRC&#39;s wuppets.</p>

<p>if they had him elsewhere they would have put him on trial , and it would be a MSM circus dawn to dusk.</p>

<p>the obvious is that he is still there.</p>

<p>Remember people, <a href="/u/Here4Popcorn">/u/Here4Popcorn</a> is the mod who went on a banning frenzy when people were worried that Assange might be compromised after the events of Oct. 2016.  He banned two of my accounts from <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> for comments that I made <em>in other subs</em> (whereisassange and conspiracy).</p>
