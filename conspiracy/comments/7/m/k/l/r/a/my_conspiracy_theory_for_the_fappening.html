       I found it extremely odd that the icloud accounts of multiple female celebrities got hacked all at around the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also odd that so many of these actresses had similar nude poses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is more plausible that someone like Weinstein had collected nude photos of women he had on his casting couch, to keep as blackmail material or just souvenirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then from there, either only his account was hacked and all these pics leaked...  Or perhaps he leaked them himself when he was starting to feel his power threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, many of the actresses whose photos were leaked had ties to Weinstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jennifer Lawrence - close ties with him and rumored to have slept with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Abigail Spencer - ties to Weinstein
      </p>
      <p>
       Alison Brie - complained about Weinstein after the shit hit the fan

       ...said like someone who hasn't seen many nudes.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       You have 4 limbs (with forearms/biceps and thighs/calves), your head angle, neck angle, feet, etc. ... along with the angle of the camera.  There's an almost infinite way to take unique pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're literally only looking at the "ass and titties" with zero regard to anything else,  that's sad and kinda desperate.

       It's amusing and as ironic as the devil that Hollywood actresses all turn out for their major awards events all done-up like high-priced hookers, while the ones in the porn industry turn-out for theirs' all looking like bashful teen-agers from the '50's going to their high school prom in something that looks like their Mom's old wedding dress.

       Yes, modesty and decorum are openly mocked by foolish people. Being human, we all perhaps, made transgressions in  indecent behavior. Still, I agree that considerations of the importance for self restraint and discretion is lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has most startled me is that the very wealthy are among the worst transgressors, and yet they seem to be quite ready to judge other, as though they are of a higher caliber, mostly because of their resources and propensity for hiding their worst behavior.

       "The Fappening" was just a huge leak of nudes that had been traded on the dark web for quite some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can it be an "icloud leak" when many of the photos were taken with Samsung phones? I mean i am sure some of it was acquired through icloud but i digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone told the whole story once I forget a lot of it but the gist was these photos were bought/sold/traded on the darkweb. Some dude got screwed over or something and just started dumping shit hoping to fuck up the underground market that existed or something like that

       I think you're correct. Back in the day I had access to over a million cel phone accounts, and all of the data was unencrypted. There are tons of huge companies with very bad security policies. I don't think my managers had any clue that I had access to every single customer's account.

       The DBA who set up the database used a unique identifier for each customer:
      </p>
      <p>
       Their social security number.
      </p>
      <p>
       This meant that anyone with access to the system could run a "select" statement and Hoover up over a million name, addresses, and social security numbers.

       This.

      <p>
       To take it a little deeper, from what I remember it was an invite only type of community, whereby you had to provide celeb nudes to get in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one who blew everything up - for whatever reason - was trying to tank the community. Since it was all based on trades, that's why you saw screenshots of folders filled with pictures that were never ultimately leaked. The people in possession of the photos wanted to prove there were more, but if they had leaked them they would have lost their value and couldn't have been traded for more nudes since everyone would have them.

       It wasn't all hacked at the same time. Iirc the was a dark market for those celebrity nudes and they were traded on the onion network.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nudes were hacked and collected over a long time frame. At first a few were posted but then somehow the floodgates opened and a massive leak was dumped.

       Mine is that Harvey released all the ones that people willingly took for him to show that he is serious with his blackmailing tactics. Oh yeah, you don't want to have sex with me now since you finished that movie? Ok I'll just leak the shit out of everything you sent me.

       i dont think its even close related to weinstein.  none of weinsteins allegations we're publicly known at that time imo, just rumors nobody cared about. it might be significant the hacking was done between 2012 - 2014 from chicago. did you bother checking the suspects ? 
i doubt you have. very lowbrow this...

       I do however still think theres more to this fappening story. It served a agenda, which one i don't know.

       One of the women would have spoken out by now if they believed the photos or the leak were linked to him. They'd have nothing to lose. Plus there is no way Apple would have taken the PR hit if they suspected this was an isolated single hack or leak.

       I think it was a young man working for the government - specifically a surveillance organization.  I could just imagine one of them being bored one day and deciding to use the spy tools he'd been given to see if a movie star he had a fetish for had anything interesting on her phone.   Once he found that hot pic, he decided to look for another, and another, etc...
