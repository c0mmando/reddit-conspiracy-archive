<p>Please read the links below and discuss your thoughts in the comments. Thank you!</p>

<hr/>

<p>To start everything off - </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a widely-reported study of orchestrated deception, the Center found that President Bush and seven top officials made 935 false statements leading up to the Iraq war — and offer them in a database for all to see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/06/24/14969/search-935-iraq-war-false-statements">https://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/06/24/14969/search-935-iraq-war-false-statements</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the program I mentioned:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_military_analyst_program">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_military_analyst_program</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>was an information operation of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) that was launched in early 2002 by then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke.[1] <strong>The goal of the operation is &quot;to spread the administrations&#39;s talking points on Iraq by briefing retired commanders for network and cable television appearances,&quot; where they have been presented as independent analysts</strong>;[2] Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Pentagon&#39;s intent is to keep the American people informed about the so-called War on Terrorism by providing prominent military analysts with factual information and frequent, direct access to key military officials.[3][4] The Times article suggests that the analysts had undisclosed financial conflicts of interest and were given special access as a reward for promoting the administration&#39;s point of view. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Here is the Pulitzer Prize winning article about it  - </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/us/20generals.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/us/20generals.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Records and interviews show how the Bush administration has <strong>used its control over access and information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse</strong> — an instrument intended to shape terrorism coverage from inside the major TV and radio networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is another article about it - </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pentagon military analyst program was revealed in David Barstow&#39;s Pulitzer Prize winning report appearing April 20, 2008 on the front page of the New York Times and titled Behind TV Analysts, Pentagon’s Hidden Hand</p>

<p>The Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld covert propaganda program was launched in early 2002 by then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke. The idea was to recruit &quot;key influentials&quot; to help sell a wary public on &quot;a possible Iraq invasion.&quot; Former NBC military analyst Kenneth Allard called the effort &quot;psyops on steroids.&quot; [1]
Eight thousand pages of the documents relative to the Pentagon military analyst program were made available by the Pentagon in PDF format online May 6, 2008 at this website: <a href="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/milanalysts/">http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/milanalysts/</a></p>

<p>By now, we all know that he talking points about Guantanamo Bay have all been shown to be lies -</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cia-torture-report">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cia-torture-report</a></p>

<p>That didn&#39;t stop the Administration from lying to the public about it. The below is taken from the dod.mil/pubs/foi link above</p>

<p>Here is a snippet speaking about detainee treatment at Guantanamo :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fox and Friends 6/26/2005 </p>

<p>Command Sargent Major Steven Greer</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What we have done to &quot;consistently ensure human treatment&quot; is amazing&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CNN 6/27/2005</p>

<p>Major General Donald. W. Shepperd</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gitmo &quot;bears no resemblance&quot; to how it is portrayed in the press. The guards are dedicated and doing &quot;an extremely tough job&quot; with dangerous detainees. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Article from 2006 -</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6100906.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6100906.stm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The newly-established unit would use &quot;new media&quot; channels to push its message and &quot;set the record straight&quot;, Pentagon press secretary Eric Ruff said.</p>

<p>A Pentagon memo seen by the Associated Press news agency said the new unit would &quot;develop messages&quot; for the 24-hour news cycle and aim to &quot;correct the record&quot;.</p>

<p>The unit would reportedly monitor media such as weblogs and would also employ &quot;surrogates&quot;, or top politicians or lobbyists who could be interviewed on TV and radio shows.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>So what do we have? We have the United States government, at the highest level, creating propaganda which was broadcast to the American people in order to create and influence public support for their geopolitical and strategic goals.</p>

<p>The final thing I will link to you is a report from Bill Moyers. Bill has previously written articles about the U.S. Deep State and other things that the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> crowd would enjoy. </p>

<p>In the video here, Bill walks us through how the United States government was able to sell and market the Iraq invasion/war through the media and the media&#39;s extremely poor job of just accepting, and then reporting, on what the government told them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Buying the War&quot; examines the press coverage in the lead-up to the war as evidence of a paradigm shift in the role of journalists in democracy and asks, four years after the invasion, what&#39;s changed? &quot;More and more the media become, I think, common carriers of administration statements and critics of the administration,&quot; says THE WASHINGTON POST&#39;s Walter Pincus. &quot;We&#39;ve sort of given up being independent on our own.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. I&#39;m old enough to remember this and how it played out. Bush/Cheney took the goodwill and unity of the people after 9-11, spun their web of lies and got us into an endless war in Iraq. Almost all of the media was pushing their propaganda and lies to get the people to go along with it. Anyone who challenged the narrative had their character publicly assassinated, fired and/or humiliated.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, at that time, there weren&#39;t many places like this sub where people could challenge the narrative, openly discuss it and try to make sense of what is really happening. I also see some striking similarities of the propaganda machine then to the Trump/Russia narrative being pushed for over a year now. Fortunately, now we do have this sub and places like it but that has brought a heavy dose of astroturf to do what the propaganda arm of the media did and still does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m old enough to remember parts and pieces of it as well. The propaganda worked too. I remember the fiasco with the Dixie Chicks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/14/dixie.chicks.reut/">http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/14/dixie.chicks.reut/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Chicks have the number one country album in the United States on the Billboard charts called &quot;Home&quot; and the No. 1 single with &quot;Travelin&#39; Soldier&quot;, which is about a U.S. soldier who fought in Vietnam. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Country stations across the United States <strong>have pulled the Chicks from playlists</strong> following reports that lead singer Natalie Maines said in a concert in London earlier this week that she was &quot;ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Station managers said their decisions were <strong>prompted by calls from irate listeners who thought criticism of the president was unpatriotic</strong>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yuup, I was young but I remember it well. They did a major character assassintion and ruined the careers of the Dixie Chicks for daring to criticize the narrative. And on top of that, they broadcast it as much as they could to show everyone &#39;this will happen to you if you step out of line like they did&#39;. </p>

<p>The time between 9-11 and the Iraq war was the most united I&#39;ve ever seen the people here. Religion/race/whatever is used to divide us, didn&#39;t matter back then. Bush/Cheney could have done so much good with that unity but instead did this travesty with the backing of Congress and the media.</p>

<p>I was a senior in high school when 9/11 happened. </p>

<p>For a few years before 9/11 I had stopped standing and saying the pledge of allegiance in the mornings because I realized how weird it was to have children do that every morning starting at the age of 5 or earlier and also because I realized they couldn&#39;t make me do it. No one ever said a word when I didn&#39;t stand.</p>

<p><em>After</em> 9/11, I got <strong>so</strong> much shit from my classmates for not doing it. It was absolutely insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was not anything new.  The tactics in the media and stuff is what I mean, your post is great. We already were sold on a pack of lies leading up to Desert Storm.  <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2014/06/27/the-first-iraq-war-was-also-sold-to-the-public-based-on-a-pack-of-lies/">Here is some stuff about this</a>.  </p>

<p>I remember watching the testimony of Nayira when it was aired.  I was 14 or 15 and didn&#39;t really understand the world around me, but I thought I smelled bs.  If she were on the streets, I would have pegged her as a narc.  A couple years later, this was exposed as part of a $10.7m campaign to gain American support for the war.  All lies.  Among other things, Nayirah was in fact the daughter of Saud Nasir al-Sabah, Kuwait’s ambassador to the US. Her testimony had been organized by a group called Citizens for a Free Kuwait, which was a front for the Kuwaiti government.  I was 17-18 by then and that was a real wake up call for me.  So when it happened again under Jr, I didn&#39;t trust much of anything in the media.  </p>

<p>You could say that the Gulf of Tonkin was similar.  If I researched more, I bet I could find similar tactics used in the lead up to many of our military actions.  I don&#39;t think was a new tactic in the 2000s.  The tactic is old, the only real change is the technology and how that technology is utilized.  Or should I say weaponized?  Propaganda is a powerful tool and it seems like we never learn.  In this case, Bush Jr just basically did what his dad had already done.  Either way, we are sold on narratives, lies, and half truths for all sorts of reasons not even limited to military actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was so clearly evident if you lived during and watch this play out over months. It was a 100% propaganda operation and Fox News was at the forefront of it. Judith Miller while at the NYT was likely involved in such paid propaganda. It seems Fox just can&#39;t get enough of authoritarian propaganda as evidenced by its latest behavior.</p>

<p>On that note, if Fox News has been shown to have colluded with the US government to engage in paid propaganda intended to change public opinion in support of war, should that site be allowed to be linked to directly from r/conspiracy rather than from an archive such as was done to CNN via an edict made last summer?</p>

<p>Bush alienate women by saying “grab em by the pussy”. In fact, Bush was the guy “you’d want to get a beer with” (to quote the endless programming by MSM). </p>

<p>Bush didn’t alienate immigrants. He didn’t alienate Muslims. </p>

<p>It’s a subjective conclusion when you declare one worse than the other. Trump is dividing a lot of people in the country. You may be unaffected by it and don’t see it. </p>

<p>I personally would still rank Bush near the bottom for what it’s worth but I can see why some feel passionately about Trump being worse.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why I do not trust any mainstream media to this day. </p>

<p>The idea that our media is made up of independent groups with independent motivations is laughable. They all sing the same tunes when they need to convince &quot;The People&quot;. </p>

<p>Our MSM is nothing more than an orchestra. Each constituent media conglomerate is merely a section. Sure, they may play different parts, but it&#39;s all to the leadership of a maestro. </p>

Much of my opposition to claims without convincing primary source material I can review comes out of observation of how much bullshit was thrown at the public during those years. The exercise trained many in the public how to spot the bullshit, raising difficulty for future efforts.

<p>This is why truth seekers do not trust the MSM or government.</p>

<p>Its interesting to watch how people will go from believing this is real to ignoring it, however, depending on which party is in power.</p>

<p>Now that the Don is in charge, there are many that heretofore would have believed this, but now wont.</p>

<p>There are many that would never believe this was happening under Obama, but are total, hard core conspiracy theorists now and totally believe this.</p>

<p>Folks, this has been going on for a long time even under the direction of the people you vote for. You contribute to this when you support the system, pay taxes, watch TV or otherwise participate in American society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the time Obama came to power social media had become very important. They used celebrities on twitter to help them sell obamas wars. All of the sudden people were getting there news from puff daddy and Rihanna. I think a deep study into the kony 2012 propaganda is needed for people to understand the shift in propaganda. From news media to social media. </p>

<p>Ask yourself this, &quot;how the hell did we get sold the invasion of Libya?&quot; I think a big thing is type of voters. For bush you have the classic MSM consumers, then for Obama you had the people who view celebrities as truth tellers. Two very different forms of propaganda for two very different types of citizens. Only a black president could sell black inner city voters on invading Africa. No way bush was getting away with that. </p>

<p>And the Obama Admin started ISIS. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>technically it was the CIA who  &quot;armed, funded and handled&#39; ISIS</p>

<p>Al Qaeda which translates as &quot;The Base&#39; was a database of &quot;CIA controlled assets&quot; that had been developed during the &#39;war&#39; in Afghanistan where &quot;CIA recruiters&quot; would penetrate various <em>fanatics</em> of various cultures and their customs and &#39;persuasions&#39;, religions with numerous &#39;factions&#39; who argued their  &quot;theosophical beliefs&quot; using AK-47&#39;s to get &quot;their points&quot; across!</p>

<p>People who would do the bidding of their <em>employers</em> (the CIA) who had manipulated and LIED to them <em>just as much</em> as they had to everyone else!</p>

<p>As R. Buckminster Fuller called the CIA way back in the 1960&#39;s!: &quot;Capitalism&#39;s Invisible Army&quot; . . . . . which it&#39;s becoming increasingly clear that <em>that&#39;s exactly what</em> it IS! US troops &#39;guard&#39; Afghan and several other&#39;s opium poppies crops And securing US oil production and delivery companies/facilities</p>

<p>Anyone remember Colonel Oliver North and Co and their/his being busted with hundreds of kilos of cocaine, which *he would trade the drugs for US army weapons which were then sold to rebels in South America (the Contras) to &#39;support&#39; their revolution ... and was convicted and imprisoned?</p>

<p>Not to mention the CIA registered plane which crashed  into the florida/miami everglades and if iirc full op with weapons and 4 TONNES of cocaine onboard</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Control of the media is an absolute need if you want to run a war.</p>

<p>Look back at Vietnam. There was a huge anti-war resistance back then that made the US public an enemy of the US military.</p>

<p>Major factors to the anti-war resistance was the draft, and free press.</p>

<p>Back then, reporters could report anywhere and not be censored. This left many Americans back home seeing footage of war. Dead kids, addicted soldiers, all the horrible stuff. It wasn&#39;t sanitized.</p>

<p>Eventually the US military quit because it was just too much of a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>Media changed between the 70s and 90s with cable becoming more popular. This led to the 24 hour news channel CNN coming on the air.</p>

<p>When the US invaded Iraq in 91, CNN covered the story. They weren&#39;t exactly impartial though. Critics claimed CNN was cheerleading more than reporting objectively. Other networks were reporting more fairly. The US pulled out shortly after the highway of death incident, where US troops killed a shitload of fleeing soldiers and civilians.</p>

<p>In 1996, the FCC dumped anti-monopoly laws which led to the oligopoly that runs the media industry nowadays.</p>

<p>I have no proof of collusion but there&#39;s totally collusion between the network owners and the US military.</p>

<p>After the US invaded Iraq, the media worked with the military to impose a ban on war coverage. Nowadays, the only time you see war footage is if it&#39;s being used as propaganda. The military had a list of words to use and the mainstream press used those words to shift people&#39;s attitudes.</p>

<p>Kidnapping became rendition, shell shock became PTSD, rebels became insurgents, and anyone who didn&#39;t like it became an enemy combatant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont remember it that way. US MSM definitely pushed a narrative and generally didnt do their fucking job. That said, they were giving people exactly what they wanted. There was a metric fuckton of press from around the world who were a lot more professional about their reporting. There was all that shit that happened at the un, all that shit with inspectors, tons of experts immediately calling out the bullshit around the aluminum tubes and powells speech at the un. It was covered. All over the place. </p>

<p>What i remember is a public that went absolutely rabid with war fervor. People were excited. Do you remember the shit with frenchs mustard? That wasnt the media stirring people up. That was people who wanted to fuck up some arabs and get some payback. Anybody who disagreed was a coward and a traitor. They werent &quot;tricked&quot; into it. The media is a menu. Most people ordered little flags and dead arabs in some far away shithole they couldnt find on a map. The evidence and reasons were flimsy as fuck. And then, when they couldnt find any wmds, and the war was turning into a quagmire, bush got fucking re elected man. You going to put that on the media too? </p>

<p>Nowhere in this story is the american people taking responsibility for making shit choices. Thats bullshit. The american people should be talking about how they fucked up, not how they got tricked. Because they werent tricked. As long as they got some dead arabs out of the deal, nobody was asking too many questions. They got exactly what they ordered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well think about it. The war was viewed as America getting revenge for 9-11, which was still fresh on everyone&#39;s mind. Everyone was patriotic as fuck in those years. So it made sense the declaration of war, which everyone was shouting for immediately after 9-11, would get extended coverage when the time finally came.</p>

<p>The first war in &quot;modern times&quot; with a ton of spanking new weapons no ones seen before. F-117s. B-2s. The tomahawk being shown off for the first time. Guidance weapons were new. &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; </p>

<p>Combine all that and it really was an event or sorts. It was like the begging of a new era. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m wrong, it&#39;s been a while, but I do remember the impact very well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too few mentions of Israel here; the &#39;Iraq was a war for oil&#39; canard gets pushed around too much. Neocon lobbying to take down Saddam had started in around the late 80s or so and continued full swing throughout the 1990s. This was a war for, primarily, Zionist geostrategic interests. Refer to the Yinon Plan and the political activities of the neocons leading up to the Iraq war, as well as the country who provided the false intel on Iraqi officials &#39;providing Mohammad Atta anthrax&#39; at &#39;Prague&#39; or obtaining &#39;yellowcake uranium&#39; from Niger. </p>

<p>Should probably follow Ryan Dawson&#39;s work on this, guy&#39;s been an anti neocon since the 90s or something. Check out his YouTube channel?</p>

<p>she was doing a show on a medical and was going to cover lack of healthcare coverage ( before obamacare) and was called into the producers office and aid they may have to change the show coverage to something else because the “ the white house was reviewing our show to approve it. “
this was at time when obamacare/ single payer was in the news and it was getting partisan during he Bush years. </p>

<p>white house  called back and nixed the show. </p>

<p>they did some other show entirely and she never was able to finish her show that day. </p>

<p>tldr: where house had to approve a show for tv because it covered a controversial subject . </p>
