    <div class="md"><p>I did a lot of research on Seths death. Nothing links him to the DNC emails apart from Julian Assange&#39;s &quot;winks&quot; and Kim dotcoms fruitless publicity stunts. Rod Wheelers retracted claims and Ed Butowskys flawed &quot;University report&quot;.</p>

<p>Seth was likely murdered in a botched robbery, his brother still runs an as yet unfulfilled go fund me campaign to privately find new leads. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You did literally no research. Kim Dotcom directly connected him. Assange connected him. Seth&#39;s girlfriend connected him. In fact, the only sources that do not connect him are the very media sources that were exposed by the leaks themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My research is in my post history. </p>

<p>Kim dotcom said someone named &quot;panda&quot; used mega upload. He doesn&#39;t know who the person was. He <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4563700/amp/Kim-Dotcom-wants-deal-DOJ-Seth-Rich-testimony.html">delivered nothing</a>. He advertised his new album between posts about Seth. </p>

<p>Assange has never said Seth was the source. </p>

<p>His gf never said he was the source. She spoke to him on the phone just before he was shot. </p>

<p>Officers found him conscious and &quot;quite talkative&quot;. </p>

<p>Seths own family have asked people to stop pursing this red herring and instead focus on the real murders, alas, here you are.</p>

<p>“Only to [her friend] Elaine could I say that I felt some responsibility for Seth Rich’s death. I didn’t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights,” she wrote. “With all I knew now about the Russians’ hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in his unsolved murder. Besides that, racial tensions were high that summer and I worried that he was murdered for being white on the wrong side of town.”</p>

I also have a lot of concerns about complex interdependence.  After looking at your posts I was actually very impressed by your technological knowledge. You&#39;re obviously pretty young and somewhat intelligent. Maybe, instead of playing Pokemon Go and obsessing over your next phone, you should start thinking critically. As modern westerners, we are the most lied to people in the history of the world. And, despite your obvious capability, (based on your many posts) you seem to just gorge yourself on mainstream, materialistic crap. Looking at all the trivial, mindless shit you concern yourself with, I actually started to feel sorry for you. I suggest you turn the Pokemon video games off and re-educate yourself, because (especially in your case), personal freedoms are under attack by the left and the right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the flattery, but since i mostly reddit in my free time about my hobbies, you can figure out why it&#39;s mostly mainstream and Pokemon.</p>

<p>And I agree that personal freedoms are under attack left and right, but since I am (as you can figure out by my posts in r/de ) in Germany, I can watch the shit show across the pond with relative ease after the last election. And the most pressuring matter for me is not my personal freedom since that is pretty safe, but how we deal with the past refugee influx, both refugees and retarded scared germans, and the Brexit probably.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI just ran years long investigations into Hillary Clinton because the Republicans were determined to use Benghazi and the email server issues to destroy Hillary&#39;s presidential run. There was the Weiner investigation which had nothing to do with Clinton but was used by the right-wing media to paint the campaign as depraved anyway. There were frequent leaks from Republicans in Congress and the FBI New York office to damage her campaign. </p>

<p>They should still have cooperated with the FBI when they found out it was likely Russia who hacked them, but it&#39;s not like there weren&#39;t reasons for them to be wary, but more importantly the Hillary Clinton campaign turned out to be a bunch io idiots who aren&#39;t as streetsmart as they pretended to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And they relied on reports from crowdstrike, who not only falsely laid blame on Russia for another hack around the same time frame: &quot;December 2016, CrowdStrike released a report[22] erroneously concluding that Russia had hacked a Ukrainian artillery app and caused large losses to Ukrainian artillery units via the hack. The app (called ArtOS) is installed on tablet PCs and used for fire-control.[23] Yaroslav Sherstyuk, the developer of the app, called the report &quot;delusional&quot;. The International Institute for Strategic Studies, whose data was misused by CrowdStrike to reach the conclusions of the report, rejected CrowdStrike&#39;s conclusions of Russian hacking causing losses to Ukrainian artillery units. &quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike</a></p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the &quot;official report.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On March 15 that the Department of Homeland Security released just two heavily redacted pages of unclassified information in response to an FOIA request for definitive evidence of Russian election interference allegations. Leopold wrote, “what the agency turned over to us and Ryan Shapiro, a PhD candidate at MIT and a research affiliate at Harvard University, is truly bizarre: a two-page intelligence assessment of the incident, dated Aug. 22, 2016, that contains information DHS culled from the internet. It’s all unclassified — yet DHS covered nearly everything in wide swaths of black ink. Why? Not because it would threaten national security, but because it would reveal the methods DHS uses to gather intelligence, methods that may amount to little more than using Google.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/03/23/cybersecurity-firm-that-attributed-dnc-hacks-to-russia-may-have-fabricated-russia-hacking-in-ukraine/">https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/03/23/cybersecurity-firm-that-attributed-dnc-hacks-to-russia-may-have-fabricated-russia-hacking-in-ukraine/</a></p>

<p>And they&#39;ve also retracted and revised parts of their statement since then: &quot;U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has revised and retracted statements it used to buttress claims of Russian hacking during last year’s American presidential election campaign. The shift followed a VOA report that the company misrepresented data published by an influential British think tank.&quot;</p>

I&#39;m not very educated in computers and hacking, but wouldn&#39;t it be far easier and faster for someone to download those files directly from there source rather than hack from across the world? I think it&#39;s highly suspect that Crowdstrike was the only company allowed to look into the hacking. Especially considering their ties to Eric Schmidt, the very recently resigned head of Alphabet Co, parent co of Google, who worked with Clinton&#39;s campaign. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IDK When Flynn lied to FBI and Yates informed the White House that Flynn was under investigation, Trump responded by making major efforts in stopping the investigation. Trump asked Comey to intervene to let the Flynn issue go but Comey told Trump there were other concerns about Flynn. Then according to Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, Trump asked him to intervene with Comey. Coats told Trump talking to Comey about the Flynn case was inappropriate. Both of these actions by Trump warrant obstruction of justice charges according to legal analysts. As they said about Watergate scandal, it wasn&#39;t the break-in at the DNC headquarters that brought down the Nixon administration, it was the cover up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has to be this, because the chain of collusion is very specific, and has been all along. Russia-&gt;Wikileaks-&gt;Trump. If you&#39;ve read any actual MSM stories with quotes from the frothing-at-the-mouth accusers, it&#39;s always Russia-&gt;Wikileaks-&gt;Trump. Wikileaks is a key piece of the collusion narrative. Also, everything else has fallen apart.

<p>The DNC didn&#39;t refuse. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Comey&#39;s testimony the FBI requested physical access to the servers several times &quot;on different levels&quot; but was refused.</p>

<p>He stated plainly that it would have been &quot;preferable&quot; to have direct access and that that would have provided &quot;the best evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>So in other words, the DNC <em>did</em> refuse--and more than once. Which is crazy--especially considering that many feel that Russia sabotaging a US election is tantamount to an act of war. Crazier still is the fact that, considering the far-reaching implications, the FBI didn&#39;t just go get a warrant and seize the affected server. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s see, to recap, a hostile foreign government hacks the servers of a US political party during an election year with the clear intent of sabotaging said party&#39;s candidate in favour of a candidate that they&#39;ve had in their back pocket for years, and the victims of the attack should refuse to cooperate with their country&#39;s counterintelligence agency <em>because it would violate their constitutional rights</em>? </p>

<p>What happened if your house get robbed and you report it to the police? That&#39;s right, you SHOW THEM YOUR HOUSE so that they could find evidence, get the robbers and returning the goods for you.</p>

<p>So when the DNC refuse to let the FBI investigate their supposed hacked drive after they&#39;ve claim that they got hacked, it smelled like they have sth to hide, and it was not anything standard or inconsequential. In fact, I&#39;m willing to bet that there are many more corruption and crime evidence inside that drive that they have to go through Crowdstrike since they could just forge a report and give it to the FBI to not deal with mountains of foul play evidence and lawsuits piling against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, here’s the thing about Assange. He’s been exposed as having bias towards the Trump campaign, and working with them to attempt to get something he could leak “to appear impartial” with what he leaks. WikiLeaks also said in their AMA they had no contact with the Trump team, we know that to be a lie. So we have to take a pro-Trump bias into accounts here.</p>

<p>We know that DNC emails were hacked, and ended up on WikiLeaks. We know that the intelligence community believes the hacking to be from Russia, and we know Julian Assange also has a pro-Russia bias. So Assange has a motive to make it seem like he got the emails from somewhere else so as to not implicate Russia.</p>

<p>That’s why the Seth Rich thing was pushed so hard by the right despite the biggest players (Butowski, Wheeler, DotCom) outside of Assange essentially destroying their credibility and having their claims retracted, while Assange has made sure not to ever say Seth was the leaker, only hint at it enough to get people to believe it while maintaining plausible deniability. Because the idea is that if we could prove that Seth Rich was the DNC leaker it somehow destroys the Trump/Russia narrative despite the fact that in the six months since the story was pushed heavily, we’ve seen a significant amount of evidence that points towards that narrative having some truth to it, including four arrests of senior officials on the Trump campaign</p>

<p>“It is the third reason, though, WikiLeaks wrote, that “is the real kicker.” “If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,” WikiLeaks explained. “That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.” </p>

<p>which can also be found in the exchange Trump Jr. tweeted out in one of his classic “I’m showing transparency after getting exposed” moves</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s politics. You think anybody in Washington is losing sleep over the average person? They only give us thought every election cycle to secure their career. Meanwhile we&#39;re too bombarded with frivolous news (celebrity gossip, drastically simplified news, party politics arguing over largely inconsequential things) to hold people accountable to their promises. We saw it during Obama&#39;s term (&#39;our troops will leave the Middle East&#39;, drone strikes, drastically increased surveillance, militarization of government departments [BLM needs weapons? The Postal Service needs weapons? Police departments need mine-proof vehicles? The 1033 program 👀]). </p>

<p>Our political system is top-down. Candidates need major party support to stand a chance in the spending war &#39;ie: election season&#39; which means they must answer to the party&#39;s funders. There is a financial barrier that prevents people from moving beyond local politics without picking a team and adopting that team&#39;s interests. </p>

He&#39;s not accepting a salary, and it is yet to be seen if being president will really make him better off.  Does anyone remember the boycotts against his hotels?  Many idiots are angry over him and I really don&#39;t see why.  If one didn&#39;t watch MSM, and actually looked at what he says and ESP what he does, and the mood he&#39;s setting in Washington and for the country, I do think he&#39;ll bring about a sense of Progression, responsibility, and increased productivity/wealth to our nation.

    <div class="md"><p>I think he was a step in the right direction, but still not the answer. The greatest thing he&#39;s done is force our elites (politicians, celebrities, media personalities, unelected officials) to show their hand by the constant bombardment he received for being an outsider. The treatment he received also opened many eyes to the propaganda machine our media has become. </p>

<p>Trump has the personality where, having already achieved massive wealth, power is the next logical step. The hits he&#39;s taking (no salary, boycotts, etc) don&#39;t matter because money isn&#39;t the prime objective for him anymore. If I had to speculate at his long-term goal I&#39;d suspect it to be transitioning his dynasty to the political realm due to appointing his children to positions (and I&#39;m sure Don Jr is already being groomed for the presidency down the road).</p>

<p>That being said, he&#39;s still a tool of Zionism and I don&#39;t see the demilitarization of government departments happening during his term. Although he said we&#39;d mind our own business I expect we&#39;ll see the perpetual war machine continuing to run smoothly either directed at Muslim extremism or North Korea. War has always been profitable for tptb while also lessening our civil liberties. The pharmaceutical industry will continue to grow/overprescribe and corporate ownership over water will increase as well. </p>

<p>He has his good qualities but much more change is needed beyond what he&#39;s capable of. We&#39;ll see globalization continue to spread under the guise of increasing our nation&#39;s wealth. But he&#39;s not the disaster people like to think.</p>

So for all the things I like about Trump, I&#39;m not hopeful of him on that front. But, as I said, there&#39;s no chance of having the perfect person in office so hopefully he will do the good he&#39;s capable of and we can get the Zionism pendulum swinging the other way at a later date. Baby steps! </p>

<p>No proof of this has been made public. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Lie #2 </p>

<p>The FBI and CIA only state that they have &quot;high confidence&quot; in the assessment, whereas the NSA states they share the same judgement with only &quot;moderate confidence&quot;. In either case, according to the ICA, &quot;confidence in a judgement does not imply that the assessment is a fact or a certainty. Such judgements may be wrong.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we know Julian Assange also has a pro-Russia bias</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lie #3</p>

<p>He&#39;s never said it, so you&#39;re just assuming his known anti-Hillary stance amounts to a pro-Russia stance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So Assange has a motive to make it seem like he got the emails from somewhere else so as to not implicate Russia.</p>

<p>Lie #4</p>

<p>A deduction based on lies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it&#39;s not conclusive that it&#39;s non-internet. It&#39;s weird to have such large volume transmitted with no one noticing, but the DNC is probably incompetent, so no surprise there. I just wonder if there&#39;s any evidence it was 100% a hack, hell, any percent it was a hack. It seems equally possible for it to be a hack or a leak. I&#39;d need some kind of backing to believe either one, and right now the only hints available are that Assange offered tons of money for anything catching Rich&#39;s killers, and used him as an example of what leakers put themselves at risk of while hinting strongly that he died because he was a source.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the evidence it was a hack is news reports stating that an anonymous conglomerate of agencies said it was a hack, even though the DNC declined to allow their servers to be analyzed in any capacity. We&#39;re just taking their word, and the intelligence agencies were taking their word. Essentially this is a hearsay based everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m speaking generally and not singling you out specifically. Being able to tell the difference can be difficult, but not impossible. Think of a bayesian spam filter. You feed it lots of examples of &quot;known spam&quot;: To train the filter, the user must manually indicate whether a new email is spam or not. For all words in each training email, the filter will adjust the probabilities that each word will appear in spam or legitimate email in its database.</p>

<p>There are many different data points that one can use to determine the probability of whether a post was made by a computer or user, one is looking at the IP addresses users are connecting from over a given period of time and correlating those IPs with blocklists and other metadata existing elsewhere to make a determination on whether or not the profile in question is human or not, and from there looking at other things (history, how often the profile posts, where, how big are the posts, does the profile just argue and poke at everyone or is there evidence of intelligent discourse? </p>

<p>And no, an astroturfing profile would not be able to implement advice from a comment. It functions depend entirely on it&#39;s configuration in the Persona Management Software framework it&#39;s running on. </p>

The intelligence communities were not the ones who claimed Russian hacking of the DNC servers. The DNC would NOT allow anyone but Crowdstrike look at them. Which is highly suspect in its own right. So your incorrect there my friend. And Assange only hinted at it being Seth because he never reveals his anonymous sources. It wasn&#39;t for fear of his credibility being slandered. And finally this isn&#39;t a right wing thing. I&#39;m hardly a right winger. I was 100% all in on Bernie. Then when he didn&#39;t get the nom I was #withher. Unfortunately the DNC leaks came out and I found out exactly how important my vote was to a few with power and connections. Which is a HUGE deal! That got me looking at other stuff which led me down this path. And I gotta tell ya, the way this post was down voted and the comments from cats like you 100% affirm to me that there&#39;s some meat to this story and there are some powerful people trying desperately to spin the narrative.</p>

<p>Not true according to Donna Brazille, who claimed in her new book that the <strong>DNC</strong> --- then headed by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, in conjunction with a DNC cyber attorney and the private internet security company Crowd Strike at the time assisted by a former #3 man at the FBI --- &quot;<strong>provided the FBI with everything they requested</strong>&quot; cooperated fully with ALL of the FBI&#39;s requests.

<li><p>about CrowdStrike Senior VP/Chief Risk Ofcr/Gen Counsel, <strong>Steven Chabinsky</strong>, who was also serving on Obama&#39;s <strong>Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity</strong> in 2016 and still serves there under Trump (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/cybercommission/commissioners">NIST.gov</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>about <strong>Google&#39;s $100M investment</strong> in CrowdStrike.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>CrowdStrike has also employed former FBI cyber-crime expert <strong>Shawn Henry</strong> since 2012 (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-cyber-expert-joins-private-firm-crowdstrike/">CBSNews</a>), so it&#39;s no big stretch of the imagination that there was some form of coordinated effort there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since when has it been abnormal to confiscate property in an investigation? If the FBI suspects a federal crime and needs forensic evidence, then they will come and take your car or guns or computers and mobile phones or whatever they want. </p>

<p>It seems as if somebody (Obama? Lynch?) told Comey to stand down and let the DNC do their own due diligence...by a neutral party (CrowdStrike) acceptable to both. Then the FBI nerds either agreed with the analysis from CrowdStrike or not. Nobody is talking about that because no one ever asks the right questions. It&#39;s either shallow or softball questions from every committee, even from the opposition. They save the serious stuff for closed-door meetings. </p>

<p>22 mb/s is not the speed the data was exfiled at. 22 MB/s is. Capitalization is important. 8 bits in a Byte. </p>

<p>22 MB/s is too fast for a link between Romania and the US, but no Romanian hacker is going to attack a system directly. They are going to use a proxy server, usually rented anonymously at a bulletproof hosting company, in country, so as not to arise suspicion. Any network admin worth their salt is going to geo-block Romania unless they do business with Romanians. </p>

<p>22 MB/s is in no way too fast for a US to US connection.

    <div class="md"><p>The way they got 22.7 MB (capitalization matters) is by dividing the size of the file downloaded by the time the operation took. There is no forensic evidence left behind indicating what the transfer rate is moment by moment.</p>

<p>I would also like to add, metadata on files is one of the easiest things to change. That reason is why the Right like to question whether hacks into US systems were actually perpetrated by the Russians or just made to look like they were perpetrated by Russians.</p>

<p>Unless you have some other evidence that you want to share as to the fact that the transfer rate was steady, you are mistaken. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In both cases, perhaps the single most suspicious thing about the &quot;official narrative&quot; is the <em>withholding</em> of evidence, though. </p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been a single update about the Seth Rich investigation since Police Chief Cathy Lanier resigned the month after the murder. She had been updating the public regularly, and said it was possible it was a botched robbery, but that they couldn&#39;t say for sure. Then Wikileaks offered a reward, she resigned, and was never heard from again about the case. Her successor has never publicly commented on it in well over a year, despite all the media attention. That&#39;s weird. </p>

<p>We know that according to Aaron Rich, the EMTs said Seth was &quot;very aware, very talkative&quot; on the scene, and we know from the police report that three of the cops on the scene were wearing body cams. And yet we&#39;ve never been told a single word about what he actually said. That&#39;s weird. If he said something like &quot;these guys tried to rob me, but I fought back!&quot;,  that would go a long way toward settling doubts. But instead of providing any evidence, they rely instead on shaming people for even bringing it up. </p>

<p>Then with &quot;Russian hacking&quot;, according to people like Edward Snowden, if Russia hacked the DNC, the NSA could absolutely prove it, without disclosing any sources/methods that aren&#39;t already public knowledge. That lack of evidence itself is very suspicious. As is the DNC&#39;s refusal to let the FBI inspect their servers, CrowdStrike&#39;s &quot;declining an invitation&quot; to testify under oath about their findings, and a multitude of other factors. They are obviously hiding something. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also plenty of evidence contradicting the official narratives, like Guccifer 2.0&#39;s deliberately planted Russian fingerprints suggesting <em>intent</em> to implicate Russia, and the claims of credible people like Craig Murray and Seymour Hersh regarding how WikiLeaks got the material, but rather than going into all that, I just wanted to point out that the lack of evidence itself is a big red flag in both cases, precisely because evidence that <em>should exist</em> to support the official narratives is conspicuously lacking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea but this one is different and a special case considering the implications of what he may have done and who the killers could be. The police told his parents that they had video of who they thought were his murderers but they never released it to them or the public. They never released many details of this. If they truly wanted to solve it, wouldn&#39;t they release it and ask the public for tips/help solving it? Especially considering the public interest in this, it makes no sense.</p>

<p>What more could they have done? Release the surveillance tape they told the parents that could have his murderers in it. Release the body cam footage of the responding officers.

    <div class="md"><p>in what fucking world does it make sense to kill a leaker? definitely not this one. maybe you would kill a leaker that’s known to <em>potentially</em> leak, but in this scenario the murder would’ve been retaliatory, not preventative. in the scenario, seth rich would already have given the emails to wikileaks, so killing him would do nothing but expose a professional hit man job being covered up as a robbery. and <em>even if</em> you thought they would be dumb enough to do that, you really think they would hire some homeless person off the street to conduct an assassination that could potentially expose the entire fucking DNC? No chance in fucking hell. they would have hired the most professional hit man and paid him millions of dollars. And that hitman would have made sure everything was clean cut. What professional hitman sets up a fake robbery and forgets the actual robbery part? </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/770358978203254784"></a></p>

<p>These point to a reward that was active at the time Seth was looking to drop his information.</p>

<p>The reward system was apparently in place well before the public admission via twitter. It does put some taint on the process as it gives some ammunition to critics to say it might attract bad information but as long as it is verified then it is okay.</p>

<p>This is what I&#39;m thinking has happened. There is no other reason for Roger Stone, Alex Jones, and then parroted by Hanity and Savage, to yell, scream and point to Seth Rich like it&#39;s a brier patch. And Roger Stone even laid the ground work for the narrative to resonate a much as possible by talking up the &quot;Clinton Murders&quot; months before Seth&#39;s murder</p>

<p>22.7 megabytes per second (MB/s) sounds impossibly fast if you don&#39;t know any better. But if you do the simple conversion from megabytes per second to megabits per second necessary to determine the actual speed of the connection used, you get a fairly reasonable 180 megabits per second (Mbps). While the report proclaims that &quot;no internet service provider&quot; can provide such speeds, ISPs around the world routinely offer speeds far, far faster -- from 500 Mbps to even 1 Gbps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently the hit was directly by Debbie Wasserman Shultz.  She was the head of the DNC.  She was forced to resign from her position as DNC head when wikileaks dropped emails re: sabotaging the Bernie Sanders nomination for Clinton.  Upon stepping down as DNC head, Clinton promptly hired her as honorary chair of the Clinton&#39;s campaign’s 50-state program to gain ground and elect Democrats in every part of the country.  Oh, and she said publicly that weed is a gateway drug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a freaking unsolved murder with ties to the DNC! And what difference does it make that they hacked the DNC when it was already bought out by an individual. The NSA, CIA, and FBI ALL have an agenda and as we have seen by information in recent weeks, depended greatly on DNC and HRC success. Their reason for believing it was that it is a better story. </p>

<p>If anything THAT is being used to distract from the fact that this man was murdered. This man connected to so many important people was murdered in cold blood and we have exactly 0 answers as to who did it and every time the question is raised as to why this supposedly simple murder has not been solved, it is met by mindless, brainwashed slaves like the crew that showed up in this sub very passionately trying to keep people from talking about it. </p>

<p>It is well with theorizing over and the fact that you show so much opposition shows you are not on the right sub, so get out.</p>

<p>&quot;President Trump appears to have raped several babies in the face. This could change the entire &#39;Russia Russia Russia&#39; narrative.&quot; </p>

<p>that&#39;s acceptable? It&#39;s certainly not based in any facts whatsoever. But it&#39;s stated in a speculative way, so it&#39;s ok? It shouldn&#39;t be. Neither should the &quot;Seth Rich is the DNC hacker/insider who was murdered by HRC&quot; narrative. Because both stories have not only zero substantiation, but in the SR narrative, there is affirmation by several intelligence agencies that the DNC hack was the result of Russian (GRU) activities. And this has been substantiated by <a href="https://labsblog.f-secure.com/2015/09/17/the-dukes-7-years-of-russian-cyber-espionage/">independent 3rd parties</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s strong propaganda trying to claim Seth Rich was a random murder, not that he wasn&#39;t the leaker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like you&#39;re using the word &quot;propaganda&quot; in an unconventional way. &quot;Evidence&quot; is not the same as &quot;propaganda&quot;. </p>

<p>Tell me, what actual evidence do you have that SR was murdered by HRC? Is that your take on the SR murder? That he was &quot;taken out&quot; for leaking the DNC info? Have you looked into the Rod Wheeler claims? Did you know that according to Wheeler, the <strong>ONLY</strong> source for the claim that SR had been in touch with Wikileaks was from a FOX NEWS employee? </p>

<p>Wheeler is now suing FOX NEWS over this predicament. And he&#39;ll likely win.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s Ed Butowsky. He&#39;s the guy who hired Wheeler--supposedly out of the kindness of his heart &quot;in order to give the Rich family closure&quot;. Sounds legit, right? Rich, Texas businessman doles out cash on a P.I. for the sole purpose of giving this random family, for whom he has ZERO connection to, closure. Sure. The Rich family didn&#39;t hire him. If you didn&#39;t know all this before, well, you don&#39;t have that excuse anymore. You can&#39;t claim ignorance anymore. </p>

<p>On the other side of the evidence pile is [this well-researched white paper by a Finnish cybersecurity company called FSecure] which states that all roads of DNC hacking lead back to the Russian GRU. The same &quot;smash and grab&quot; code used on Ukraine a few years before was also used in the DNC hack. How could that be?</p>

<p>This particular code was made <em>in house</em> in the Russian GRU hacking group. But you actually believe SR got a hold of this code somehow and used it to hack a server for which he had password clearance? Tell me you don&#39;t really believe that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The editor of the leaks, who has a perfect accuracy record, alleged that Seth Rich was the leaker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The editor of the leaks? You mean Assange? You didn&#39;t get the memo apparently, but Wikileaks has been compromised by the Russians since some time in 2015. Perhaps earlier. Russian GRU has been using Wikileaks an in info-launderer. Note that just because a liar lies doesn&#39;t mean a liar cannot tell the truth. Likewise, just because a person told the truth doesn&#39;t mean they cannot lie. This seems like it&#39;s news to you. Are you under the impression that if a person tells the truth, they can never lie?</p>

<p>Take a look at the earlier work of Wikileaks and Assange and compare it to his statement on Dutch TV where he dances around implicating the death of SR to being a Wiki source. Did he <em>ever</em> do anything like that before? No. Absolutely not. Unless you&#39;re in an information bubble, that&#39;s a pretty good sign that he was threatened with a big stick and a big carrot. Lead or silver. The blackmail model is as old as our historical records. But you don&#39;t seem to be able to see it right in front of your eyes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Astroturf profiles read the OP, but if a campaign is configured in the software for a specific topic, like: &quot;Seth Rich&quot;, and a bunch of customization is done, the software is probably configured to forum slide, continually ask questions in order to goad, and evoke an emotional response in order to shut down any discussion and cause people asking the wrong questions or typing things the software is programmed to respond to to stop posting and/or give up. After that the software either goes silent or, depending on how it&#39;s configured, may make a bunch of posts to steer the forum back to however the narrative is configured in the software</p>

<p>Based on the past 10 days, the following topics seem to have campaigns on Persona Management Software targeting Reddit posts (in Conspiracy):</p>

<p>Seth Rich
Pizzagate
Las Vegas Shooting
Anything mentioning Pedo
Anti-Trump
Anti-Hillary
etc,
etc...</p>

<p>But the metadata is great! The more, the better! Little does the Persona Management Software know that it is slowly but surely ensuring its own demise by making it easier to identify posts made by it. ;) The shills are doing a great job!</p>

<p>Also of note, is that Wikileaks has dropped many not so subtle hints that Seth Rich was the leaker, most notably that Wikileaks offered a reward for information about his murder, something Wikileaks has never done for anyone else in their entire history of leaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The method of removing the emails is critical. Either Seth Rich took them or the Russians hacked the emails server and uploaded the files. You say this is all a gambit, and adequate speed. I have to disagree, here&#39;s why. On the evening of July 5, 2016, 1,976 megabytes or 1.976 gigabytes of data were downloaded from the DNC’s server. The term used in the investigation is downloaded The correct term is uploaded. If the Russians hacked the DNC then the email files were &quot;Uploaded&quot; from the mail server to Russia. However, when the term download is used it describes the email files were taken either from the mail server itself or a workstation, using a USB flash drive or comparable USB device.  The operation took 87 seconds. This yields a transfer rate of 22.7 megabytes per second. The upload speed in the D.C. area ranges from 3 Mbps to 10 Mbps. Showing that you can not transfer the stolen files over the internet in the time frame of the theft. Now, when using a USB flash drive, the speeds are 60Mbps for USB 2.0 and 640 Mbps for USB 3.0. This shows that the file transfer was absolutely done using a USB flash drive and NOT uploaded from a internet hack of the DNC server.
Time stamps in the metadata provide further evidence of what happened on July 5. The stamps recording the download indicate that it occurred in the Eastern Daylight Time Zone at approximately 6:45 pm. This confirms that the person entering the DNC system was working somewhere on the East Coast of the United States. In theory the operation could have been conducted from Bangor or Miami or anywhere in between—but not Russia, Romania, or anywhere else outside the EDT zone. Combined with Forensic findings on the transfer rate, the time stamps constitute more evidence that the download was conducted locally. 
I now ask how you can stick to your version of what happened. There is absolutely ZERO evidence of a computer hack of the DNC. Zero. Why is it so hard for all of you Hillary fans to realize that she has committed crimes against the USA and its citizens. She must have her day in court. Is that too much to ask for. Equal justice for all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flynn discusses sanctions with Kislyak. Flynn tells Pence that the sanctions we&#39;re explicitly not talked about. Pence then tells &quot;Face the Nation&quot; that sanctions we&#39;re not discussed. FBI later interviews Flynn about his conversation with Kislyak. Two days afterwards, Sally Yates tells White House counsel Don McGahn that sanctions had been discussed. Trump was immediately told about this development, according to Sean Spicer. Trump then fires Sally Yates (possibly unrelated.) Then a week and a half later, WaPo published a story that revealed the White House had known about Flynn&#39;s &quot;misleading&quot; statements. He is forced to resign just hours after the article&#39;s publication. </p>

<p>Not way back when the president learned about the lie. Not when the FBI knew about it. Not when the Acting Attorney General knew. He was fired when it was released in the news days after the fact.</p>

<p>FFS, a year ago Kushner claimed under penalty of perjury that he had no such meetings. We now know that not only did he have a meeting, it was specifically about how the Russian government could help Trump damage Clinton. They <em>claim</em> that no deals were struck during any of these meetings, but given that they&#39;ve already been caught red-handed lying about their existence, who on earth would believe their claims about their content?</p>

<p>The dossier isn&#39;t a hit piece. First of all, the DNC stopped paying Fusion/Steele well before the election without releasing it. You can&#39;t call something a hit piece if you don&#39;t make it public. Secondly, Chris Steele is a highly respected intelligence operative who exposed the corruption in FIFA. He doesn&#39;t write fiction, and you wouldn&#39;t hire him to write fiction. He wasn&#39;t in it for the money, either: he was so disturbed by what he found that he kept up the investigation after he stopped getting paid by the FBI.</p>

<p>What the heck are you talking about? this debunked report, now know to be mostly fiction which no one took seriously, was used in order to get a FISA order to spy and monitor Trump AND staff - despite endless assurances to the contrary by a lying, cheating FBI. They did too bug Trump Tower and in all likelihood bugged Trump himself.</p>

<p>That&#39;s basically what a police state does, not a democracy. The Steele report is now considered a joke, and is still being uncovered as a low quality make-up story. It appears that big chunks were effectively &quot;lifted&quot; from story tellers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, Chris Steele is a highly respected intelligence operative who exposed the corruption in FIFA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are quite wrong about this. Steele was considered to be a washed-up operative which is probably why he took the job. His sources in Russia did not pan out - despite substantial payments. Some of those &quot;sources&quot; essentially invented what Steele et al wanted to hear. Including pulling up entire storylines from known fictional tales. Russians are really smart that way - give the customer what they want, charge a hefty fee, then hanker down while counting your money.</p>

<p>There were many stories in the press about how the MI6 no longer had any confidence in this individual, Steele.</p>

<p>The word for him is &quot;sheister&quot;.</p>

<p>But I am getting suspicious you are so keen on peddling this garbage. No one believes it, as you know. Even the US intelligence agencies washed their hands off it.</p>

<p>Though now we do hear about collusion between Fusion and the FBI.</p>

<p>A racket is a racket, no matter how hard you want to push the perfidy. Truth is that McCabe, Storck, and the mistress should all be in jail warming their heels. As should be those turpid DNC operators who commissioned the fairy tale and peddled it to daily Beast etc. And DWS, in an ideal world, would be serving 10-20 years in jail for blatant disregard for the country&#39;s security laws, along with her lying boss Hillary and her assistant Abedin, who peddled e mails to her sexting husband, including secret ones.</p>

<p>Oh, and did I mention Shawn henry who probably ordered the hit on Seth and his buddy Alperovich of crowdStrike, the company that inserted malware into DNC&#39;s computers in an effort to finger Russia?</p>

<p>Anyways, you should try and swim in more waters more hospitable for blue pillers.</p>

To the extent that it can be verified, <strong>every single meeting</strong> detailed by the dossier with respect to Page&#39;s trip to Moscow has been <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/06/politics/carter-page-testimony-released/index.html">proven true</a> (although he disputes the content of the meetings and claims that in some cases he <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-campaign-aide-carter-page-denies-then-admits-meeting-with-russian-bigwigs">wouldn&#39;t</a> call them &#39;meetings&#39;, only &#39;greetings&#39;).</p>

<p>BTW, Page had already had a <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/former-trump-adviser-carter-page-under-fisa-warrant-since-2014-report/article/2630576">previous FISA warrant</a> against him because the FSB had tried to recruit him as a source. So he&#39;s a dodgy fellow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Steele report is now considered a joke, and is still being uncovered as a low quality make-up story. It appears that big chunks were effectively &quot;lifted&quot; from story tellers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the dossier is currently about <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/09/a_lot_of_the_steele_dossier_has_since_been_corroborated.html">half corroborated</a>. Almost anything that can be proven true <em>has</em> been proven true, but for obvious reasons the details of various conversations cannot be proven without a recording device or a transcript.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are quite wrong about this. Steele was considered to be a washed-up operative which is probably why he took the job.</p>

<p>There were many stories in the press about how the MI6 no longer had any confidence in this individual, Steele.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong. Some proof:</p>

<ul>
<li>The former head of MI6 <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/13/dirty-dossier-donald-trump-probably-credible-says-former-mi6/">says</a> that the dossier is credible.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-who-is-christopher-steele-man-behind-the-trump-dossier-perverted-sexual-acts-mi6-agent-a7524191.html">Numerous</a> other intel people endorse Steele.</li>
<li>Steele is the one who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/01/13/the-british-spy-behind-the-trump-dossier-helped-the-fbi-bust-fifa/?utm_term=.1cba48cddaa3">gave the FBI</a> the information that broke the FIFA corruption scandal wide open, so the FBI has good reason to believe him.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>His sources in Russia did not pan out - despite substantial payments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no evidence of <em>any</em> payments, let alone substantial ones. And Steele is so confident in his sources that he already <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/05/politics/special-counsel-russia-dossier-christopher-steele/index.html">gave them to Mueller</a> and to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/08/23/545289362/researcher-behind-unverified-trump-dossier-meets-senate-investigators">the Senate</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of those &quot;sources&quot; essentially invented what Steele et al wanted to hear. Including pulling up entire storylines from known fictional tales. Russians are really smart that way - give the customer what they want, charge a hefty fee, then hanker down while counting your money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s raw intelligence, and wasn&#39;t meant to be 100% true. Steele himself says that it&#39;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/15/christopher-steele-trump-russia-dossier-accurate">70-90% true</a>. And yes, some of it could be disinformation, particularly the pee tape. Notice how all anyone ever talks about with respect to the dossier is the pee tape, even though it&#39;s not even close to being the worst thing described in it? That could be intentional.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I am getting suspicious you are so keen on peddling this garbage. No one believes it, as you know. Even the US intelligence agencies washed their hands off it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I am getting suspicious you are so keen on peddling this garbage. 
Anyways, you should try and swim in more waters more hospitable for blue pillers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Big words coming from the dude who mainly posts in the dead of night. But yes, I understand that this sub is generally skeptical of collusion, which is why I made <a href="/r/RussiaLago">/r/RussiaLago</a>. I mainly come here for contrary viewpoints and to debate in an environment where I won&#39;t get insta-banned.</p>

<p>FWIW, collusion skeptics are also welcome in <a href="/r/RussiaLago">/r/RussiaLago</a>. :-)</p>

<p>What version should i accept/ yours/ who are you exactly that i should believe a word you say? so far you have been peddling an obvious hoax, that pathetic dossier (for which Fusion and the DNC should ask for their money back, it was so poorly put together).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kushner omitted this meeting from his SF-86 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Kushner omitted something then it was the part about asking the Russians to support the apartheid country, Israel, in its effort to avoid a vote castigating it for evil behavior and human rights violations. Since that is the case and since israel pretty much runs America&#39;s foreign policy and military strategy (ie it runs the Empire) you can rest assured that Kushner will never be called on this.</p>

<p>An aside: I would be delighted to have Kushner thrown in the slummer, but not for anything Russia, Russia, but for his traitorous amateurish games with the KSA and with israel. The boy has probably fglunked his bar Mitzvah if you ask me (or, better yet, ask Saban, the DNC ultra zionist godfather, ensuring obedience to Israel).</p>

<p>True, that operation isn&#39;t illegal by itself.

    <div class="md"><p>If that was my source of anything I would not have spoken up.  It was the first link I grabbed while on my phone while in a hurry.</p>

<p>There was no Phishing attacked which led to the email leak.  That is a MSM lie. Members of the NSA admitted to the leak prior to the very poor argument that a phisher with a Russian IP got Podesta&#39;s password. (Sophisticated hackers don&#39;t even know rule #1 of hacking?  Hide your IP? Come on, this does not fit with reality. Never-mind the fact that the NSA has software which can spoof any country&#39;s IP addresses. ) This is complete hogwash, especially since people like me knew the leak was coming months in advance and were telling people ahead of time that the Podesta emails were going to crush Hillary.</p>

<p>former s Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Steve Pieczenik, told us the leaks were coming, told us they were from US DOD, told us why the US DOD was doing it.  Judge Nap even went strait on Fox and told us that NSA came to him to admit yet again they were behind the leak. .... The FBI, NSA, and at least 12 other intelligence communities were behind this, along with the NYPD. People like me who were mining these emails before the MSM even knew what happened know better than to believe any part of the &#39;official&#39; story.  </p>

<p>Here is a very sensible opinion piece explaining to those who still buy the official story how it could not possibly hold water. Neither the DNC nor the Podesta were hacked in any way.  More importantly, they were not tempered with in any way.  Google DKIM can verify any of them as authentic.</p>

<p>Theres no evidence seth was a bernie supporter. Assange has also said 100000 times he would never reveal a source, and said his reason for bringing up seth rich. So you should be a little clearer in saying &quot;he gave an extremely slight nod when asked a question in an interview before giving an answer that was disagreeing with what I think the nod meant&quot;</p>

<p>So if you take assange at his words and actions, rather than body language in an interview, he&#39;s never indicated seth rich was the source.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth remembering that the sources are supposed to be anonymous to begin with, so assange not knowing if seth rich is even the leaker or not is entirely possible, and would fit with all of his actions.</p>

<p>There is tons of evidence. His twitter and instagram accounts under &quot;panda&quot; or something all showed he was a Bernie supporter.</p>

<p>Right and he didn&#39;t. He did strongly suggest many times it was Seth AND others. If he conclusively said it, then the OTHER conspirators could be prosecuted. It is a crime after all to steal emails and give them to wikileaks. You do know that right?</p>

<p>And again. You provide absolutely no proof that it was Russia. Tell me why you&#39;re so sure?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don’t know.  There’s a tremendous amount of conflicting evidence going back and forth on this, and it seems pretty much impossible to define a conclusive narrative. It’s essentially a mystery, and it seems like the amount of faith one has in the establishment determines ones position on it all.  </p>

<p>I saw the cheating and lying on the part of HRC and the DNC, along with her MSM allies, so I have less trust in their side of the story.  SO far they haven’t proved to me in anyway that they were hacked, and their resistance to handing over the servers to the FBI bothers me quite a bit.  </p>

<p>If they were really interested in getting to the bottom of this and proving they were hacked by Russia, they would give those servers up and we’d get an open and transparent review of what happened.  They haven’t done that so I’m dubious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s all fine, you can feel how you want to, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the forensicator is completely omitting  that the metadata being used to prop up the impossibility of that high of an upload speed applies to a date months after the files were stolen, by either hacking or leaking. I&#39;m not saying it seals the case either way, but it is a dishonest thing to say that it disproves the hack because it isn&#39;t even in reference to the time period the hack/leak occured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you familiar with what the (Russia stuff) is? there is strong evidence that due to the size and speed of the download from files passed on to wikileaks, they would have had to have been copied from close to the source, indicating an insider not a hack. also Julian Assange&#39;s hints at Seth Rich&#39;s murder being an assassination and putting a reward up for information leading the capture of his murderers. he also said unequivocally that it was not a state or country that was responsible for the leak. so i would say that the evidence points to an individual within the DNC. I would also say that H.R.C has a much closer connection to Russian collusion through the Uranium deal, dodgy deal, dodgy payoffs to the Clinton foundation and a dodgy cover up. looking at the facts , i would say there is a worse smell hanging over H.R.C.

    <div class="md"><p>There is no evidence suggesting collusion between the Russian Govt. and the Trump Administration being helped into power, there are facts that can be interpreted as such if you have come to the conclusion that they did before seeing the evidence, once you have done that all evidence helps point the way you believe, dont fall into that trap.</p>

<p>The evidence surrounding Seth Rich is much greater, we know he was murdered in cold blood with no other motive, he had all of his belongings on him, the media has covered this fact up with further backs up the fact he was murdered and he was also in a position on the DNC to leak these emails between the party once he discovered that the DNC conspired with Hillary Clinton and rigged the primaries against Sanders. </p>

<p>The Russian Narrative was spun up at this point by the DNC to maintain the DNC voting base and reputation, otherwise they would have been politically destroyed, it is a look over there to Russia, not over here at what&#39;s actually going on.
Why else do you think the DNC refused the FBI to investigate their servers?
Most likely because the FBI would have uncovered that it was internal within the DNC and Seth Rich.</p>

<p>In terms of the &#39;Russia Connections&#39;, Trump said his entire campaign that he wanted a closer relationship with Russia, most likely to fulfill his promise of trade and a stronger economy as the rest of the Western world has sanctions on them, the first to break the sanctions would have extreme potential economically from Russia&#39;s vast resources. Therefore he hired people who had previous contact with Russia as to get advice on how to befriend them and also how to use them for American interests.
Keep your enemies closer than your friends, have you never heard that saying before? Especially when you friends can be used as enemies.</p>

<p>And also, if the entire mainstream narrative is that something happened, you can usually trust that the truth is the complete opposite.</p>

<p>How about the fact that Trump still hasn&#39;t signed the sanctions that congress overwhelmingly passed? How about the fact that Trump will literally shit all over any world leader, or person for that matter, about the smallest things, yet only sings Putin&#39;s praises?</p>

<p>And most of all, the collusion that DID happen, and Mueller knows about because both Flynn and Papadapolous have flipped - changing the RNC platform to ease up on Russia and sanctions around the time of the convention. Plus we now have evidence that Flynn was speaking to the Russians (which he lied about) about sanctions (which he also lied about) in December, actively undermining the current administration, with a hostile government, openly violating the Logan Act.</p>

<p>Trump knew for days that Flynn had lied to the FBI before he fired him, and has not given a reason as to why he waited so long. At the time he claimed Flynn was fired for lying to Pence, but then when Flynn got indicted, Trump claimed he was fired for lying to the FBI.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have all these &quot;coincidences&quot;, Trump reps speaking with Russian reps, meeting with them, not taking a stronger stance on Russian interference, which we know happened, regardless of whether it was Pro-Trump or not, we know for a fact that the Russians hacked voting machines and actively sought to undermine our election, and are going to continue doing this in the future, yet the current administration is doing nothing to stop it, or punish it. Why again is this, if not a quid pro quo, or collusion?</p>

<p>Collusion is the least of Trump&#39;s worries, he&#39;s publicly obstructed justice, and Mueller has his bank records, which going back for years will show all the dirty deals and money laundering he&#39;s done. The deep state didn&#39;t force Trump to work with Russian mobsters in the 90s and 2000s. The deep state and media didn&#39;t tell Trump to accept dirty money for the funding of Trump Soho. Keep defending him, it&#39;s working out great.</p>

<p>And if the &quot;deep state&quot; was so powerful and all mighty, and wanted nothing to do with Trump, then why release the dossier <em>after</em> the election, especially if &quot;it was fake&quot;? What good will that do? Plus, Trump was told in the Summer of 2016 that the Russians were working to undermine our election process. If the almighty and powerful deep state was so concerned, and as lawless as so many believe, why not rig the election results to make Hillary win? Trump won by tiny margins in WI, MI, and FL (because ballots weren&#39;t counted, but that&#39;s a different story), if the almighty deep state could sway elections, how come they didn&#39;t?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if that was the case (it wasn&#39;t), it was damn good one that continues to have its claims verified and proven.</p>

<p>The issue with the dossier, and this goes for ALL intelligence reports, isn&#39;t &quot;is it real or fake&quot;, but &quot;how much of it is real, and how much is fake&quot;, and Steele (who has no financial or political interest in this, and has only suffered since it was published, having to hide out with his family) claims that 70-90% is real.</p>

<p>Plus, if it was &quot;the insurance policy&quot;, why was it initially funded by Republicans, long before the primaries were finished? Most likely a republican who is currently going along with the Trump regime. And how about the separate investigations that are going on in NY, that started back in 2015? Investigations that have been going on when Trump either wasn&#39;t running, or was thought of as a joke and wouldn&#39;t last the end of the year? Insurance policy? Sure....</p>

<p>Deny it all you want, say that the FBI is corrupt all you want, throw out &quot;deep state&quot; like it doesn&#39;t really apply to neo-cons, but when you have the former NSA cooperating with the FBI and admitting to lying to them, as well as a former campaign advisor (Gates), campaign chairman (Manafort), and a member of the nat sec team (Papadopolous) all getting indicted, things are starting to look fishy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LMAO! I love how you think all &quot;deep state/establishment shills&quot; only read/watch CNN or MSNBC, and you know, not the hundreds of other sources that have verified parts of the Dossier.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take Miss Hungary into account, who in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NwmZ2FySL8">July 2016</a> so before the Dossier came out, admitted that Trump tried to proposition her at the Ritz in Moscow in 2013. The same hotel that Trump, following the publishing of the Dossier, claimed he knew &quot;was bugged&quot; so he wouldn&#39;t have invited prostitutes up to piss on the bed, which he totally did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>True Pundit is a great resource for the facts of this investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is when I won the argument. True Pundit is faker than The Onion. Everything it claims ends up being proven false or not happening, and its founder, who said they were gonna make themselves public and reveal who they are following the election, conveniently never did this. You tell me to read the news, then site True Pundit. What&#39;s next? Zero Hedge and Breitbart? I&#39;m guessing you probably jerk off to pictures of Hannity as well.</p>

<p>Finally, and I won&#39;t respond to anything else if you don&#39;t acknowledge this - let&#39;s forget about the Dossier for a second, you&#39;re really telling me that the FBI cut a deal with Flynn for cooperating if he didn&#39;t have information to give them pertaining to their investigation? And given that his list of bosses was very short (Trump, Pence basically), who is the FBI getting him to give info about? Same with Papadopolous, who in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/03/21/a-transcript-of-donald-trumps-meeting-with-the-washington-post-editorial-board/?utm_term=.b316f8bc4344">March of 2016</a> Trump said the following about:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FREDERICK RYAN (WaPo): Thank you… We’ve heard you’re going to be announcing your foreign policy team shortly… Any you can share with us?</p>

<p>TRUMP: Well, I hadn’t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names… Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counter-terrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; <strong>George Papadopoulos, he’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy;</strong> the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that’s a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that’s a representative group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But yeah, Papadopolous was just the coffee boy, and the deep state made up this interview back in March 2016, and actually, little known fact, forced Trump to say those words.</p>

<p>I also have yet to see any of your &quot;proof&quot; that the Dossier is not true, and don&#39;t bring Cohen&#39;s passport into this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no hack of the Democratic National Committee’s system on July 5 last year—not by the Russians, not by anyone else. Hard science now demonstrates it was a leak—a download executed locally with a memory key or a similarly portable data-storage device. In short, it was an inside job by someone with access to the DNC’s system. This casts serious doubt on the initial “hack,” as alleged, that led to the very consequential publication of a large store of documents on WikiLeaks last summer.</p>

<p>Hacker compromises computer A on DNC network, copies DNc files to it. Then transfers files to computer B in russia/romania/america/the moon, that is set to eastern time. Hacker or wikileaks intermediary goes on computer b, inserts a flash drive, and copies all the files to it with the cp command.</p>

<p>you could insert 1000 extra copies before the last step, result is the same.</p>

<p>Maybe nothing that&#39;s been revealed rises to the level of collusion in your opinion, but it does raise red flags for me as to why they tried to keep so many of their foreign contacts secret if it wasn&#39;t nefarious, and what other contacts they are still keeping secret. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you are fucking dense. Hillary didn’t even campaign in the most vital swing states she lost. She deliberately wrote off the largest voting demographic, the blue collar white male. Her own staff thought she was stupid for doing so. Trump filled 2-5 stadiums a day for months while Hillary had to hire degenerates like Jay Z and Beyoncé just to get a handful of people to show up to see her. She was the worst candidate in modern history yet you think Russia somehow put Trump over the top by buying $50K in Facebook ads, LOL. </p>

<p>Democrats know Hillary lost the election of her own doing. Any other excuse is the height of delusion. This fake Russia narrative is the most ridiculous thing ever witnessed in American politics. The public knows it is bullshit and the IG report coming out in a few weeks is going to show how Obama FBI sycophants used their power to illegally frame the Trump campaign. Their own text messages prove it. Comey’s own testimony proves it. The four FBI agents fired from Mueller’s investigation proves it. </p>

<p>But keep on dreaming. </p>

<p>But hey, I&#39;m perfectly happy to just let the investigation run its course. If Mueller and company find him to be blameless, I&#39;ll accept it. But Trump sure seems to be afraid to let the investigation continue, going so far as to outright accuse the FBI of being biased against him.</p>

I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day on television saying there is no collusion [note: not true]…The Republicans, in terms of the House committees, they come out, they’re so angry because there is no collusion…there was collusion on behalf of the Democrats. There was collusion with the Russians and the Democrats. A lot of collusion…There was tremendous collusion on behalf of the Russians and the Democrats. There was no collusion with respect to my campaign…But there is tremendous collusion with the Russians and with the Democratic Party…I watched Alan Dershowitz the other day, he said, No. 1, there is no collusion, No. 2, collusion is not a crime, but even if it was a crime, there was no collusion. And he said that very strongly. He said there was no collusion…There is no collusion, and even if there was, it’s not a crime. But there’s no collusion…when you look at all of the tremendous, ah, real problems [Democrats] had, not made-up problems like Russian collusion.“</p>

<p>You&#39;d think, though, that as members of his family, their deaths would be really freakin&#39; obvious attempts to shut them up. Killing them if they talk would just completely expose the conspiracy, you know?</p>

<p>Whoever actually did the DNC hack, if Seth Rich had nothing to do with the DNC hack.</p>

<p>They would have massive benefit to pushing the Seth Rich narrative, because if you can convince the right, then you&#39;ve convinced half of Americans to look the wrong way entirely -- the half currently associated with control of three divisions of government, who might actually have the resources to establish who hacked the DNC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a browser injection attack combined with a privilege escalation, sounds like. There are modules on some Persona Management Software versions that support hacking and deploying exploits. If you are running a rooted device, it increases the likelihood that such a hack would be successful. If you are not running a rooted device, there would be other exploits to gain root and do the same thing (through the baseband processor). Just to be on the safe side, I would make a backup, and master reset the phone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One feature I forgot to mention was a module that ties into an advertising account (with any ad company), that can inject ads and use zero-days and other exploits (through the ads) to view not only the sites a user is clicking on, but what they&#39;re typing as well. Mobile phones are especially susceptible to this, even if it&#39;s a completely different site running in the background.

Some might call that &quot;courage.&quot; And I&#39;m 41, not 75 like Bernie, and I have two daughters, ages 4 and 6. So FUCK RIGHT OFF.&quot; - Jared Beck on Bernie&#39;s cowardice</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ll never know who shot Seth Rich. It was either a random robbery or a professional hit. Either way, little chance to discovering his killer if the police wanted to, assuming they don&#39;t.  It&#39;s also speculation that Seth was the leaker.  You know it and I know it but unless Julian talks, it could never be a fact.  Concentrate on the real evidence we do have and push for a prosecution with that in Seth&#39;s name. We&#39;re not forgetting him, we&#39;re hoping to get even for him. And include Hastings while we&#39;re at it.  He died needlessly too working to right the wrongs.</p>

<p>This is you ignoring evidence that disagrees with you. Explanations that agree with you are baseless, but your own theories aren&#39;t. Botched robberies occur, this is a fact. There are multiple murders in the DC area every week, and that neighborhood is a high crime area. There is no evidence that Seth Rich communicated with wikileaks, nor is there evidence that he stole their documents.</p>

I love conspiracies, I used to use above top secret back in the early 2000s but that place is to crazy now. Anyway sorry for getting off topic. I just wish people would stop throwing that around on every post. Its losing its power, so people aren&#39;t gonna take it seriously anymore. Its like crying wolf. </p>

<p>You will loose because you are not as depraved.</p>

<p>When i keep seeing these people dying to give us this information i get sad when i feel like its in vain. I dony want these journalists and brave reporters and people fighting for whats right dying in vain anymore.</p>

<p>I wish we could help them some how. Its just sad to think they het killed and shot in the back and their killers live full wonderful rewarding lies.</p>

<p>Its only because i believe in a higher power that i know punishment will only escape these people for so long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and when Christopher Steele, completely on his own, for years prior gathered information on this subject, and then brought it to the FBI in Summer of 2016, he did this knowing that Hillary was going to lose, and then they waited until January of 2017 to release it to tip the scales of the election that already happened. That makes sense.</p>

<p>How about the fact that Trump still hasn&#39;t signed the sanctions that congress overwhelmingly passed? How about the fact that Trump will literally shit all over any world leader, or person for that matter, about the smallest things, yet only sings Putin&#39;s praises?</p>

<p>And most of all, the collusion that DID happen, and Mueller knows about because both Flynn and Papadapolous have flipped - changing the RNC platform to ease up on Russia and sanctions around the time of the convention. Plus we now have evidence that Flynn was speaking to the Russians (which he lied about) about sanctions (which he also lied about) in December, actively undermining the current administration, with a hostile government, openly violating the Logan Act.</p>

<p>Trump knew for days that Flynn had lied to the FBI before he fired him, and has not given a reason as to why he waited so long. At the time he claimed Flynn was fired for lying to Pence, but then when Flynn got indicted, Trump claimed he was fired for lying to the FBI.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have all these &quot;coincidences&quot;, Trump reps speaking with Russian reps, meeting with them, not taking a stronger stance on Russian interference, which we know happened, regardless of whether it was Pro-Trump or not, we know for a fact that the Russians hacked voting machines and actively sought to undermine our election, and are going to continue doing this in the future, yet the current administration is doing nothing to stop it, or punish it. Why again is this, if not a quid pro quo, or collusion?</p>

<p>Collusion is the least of Trump&#39;s worries, he&#39;s publicly obstructed justice, and Mueller has his bank records, which going back for years will show all the dirty deals and money laundering he&#39;s done. The deep state didn&#39;t force Trump to work with Russian mobsters in the 90s and 2000s. The deep state and media didn&#39;t tell Trump to accept dirty money for the funding of Trump Soho. Keep defending him, it&#39;s working out great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>except in Trump&#39;s case I think he did it because he cares about the future of the country.  I truly believe that.  He&#39;s not a career politician. He&#39;s not accepting a salary, and it is yet to be seen if being president will really make him better off.  Does anyone remember the boycotts against his hotels?  Many idiots are angry over him and I really don&#39;t see why.  If one didn&#39;t watch MSM, and actually looked at what he says and ESP what he does, and the mood he&#39;s setting in Washington and for the country, I do think he&#39;ll bring about a sense of Progression, responsibility, and increased productivity/wealth to our nation.  My take on it anyway, but what do I know, I&#39;ve only read about this stuff for many hundreds of hours since the DNC fucked Sanders in the primary.</p>
