        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Honestly wondering this, how much of the general subreddits are full of paid bots &amp; shills that manipulate the Downvotes as a way to censor opinions &amp; information, because I’ve encountered numerous times where legitimate evidence &amp; proven historical events that go against the MSM narrative be instantly discredited, downvoted, which almost always results in people labelling me with the typical “Tinfoil Hat” bullshit that is always used. I’m not sure how many of this sites population is shills, or if the people are really that brainwashed by the Media. Not to mention the suspicious mods, like i have seen the stories on this Subreddit about people being banned for no reason just because they posted relevant content. This makes me wonder, how much of this site is controlled through corporate bots &amp; shills?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couple of thoughts:  We all shill for someone or something at some point in time.  Were human and we have biases and we have a very hard time admitting we are wrong even when faced with overwhelming evidence.  In fact, when faced with overwhelming evidence against our position, we tend to dig in and resist even more.  So there is that.</p>

<p>Another thought: Reddit is huge and has influence as a social media platform so there are many entities trying to manipulate this site and the admin here seems to not give any shits about it and are probably on the payroll of some of those entities.</p>

<p>So, I assume <em>everyone</em> is a shill or a bot until proven otherwise.  If you spend enough time here, you will see some regular users that you will get to know and realize they are not bots or <em>paid</em> shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>One individual identifying himself as a paid web commentator told dissident artist Ai Weiwei in an interview that a fifty-cent blogger typically has many different online IDs, and in order to stage dramatic online debates often plays different roles.</p>

<p>When the government raised gas prices, for example, this person was instructed to control negative comments. In one remark he said: “I don’t care. It should rise more, so you poor people can’t afford to drive and it’ll free up the roads. Only the rich should drive.” Then he used several other IDs to quote and attack his own comment. His strategy worked: people attacked the provocative remark instead of the Communist Party, and the discussion was diverted away from the high gas prices.</p>

<p>“I usually debate with myself … It’s like playing a mind game,” he said to Ai Weiwei.</p>

<p>Another strategy he cited is to use apocryphal details when citing negative news reports, in order to undermine the story.</p>

<p>The blogger also said that 10 to 20 percent of the comments he sees online are by paid commentators. “Chinese netizens are really quite stupid. They become easily agitated. I can very easily control them,” he said.</p>

<p>Though he justified his work, he also said he thought the Chinese regime had gone too far on certain issues, such as carefully-crafted attacks against the Falun Gong spiritual practice and the Dalai Lama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is compromised to the core. Its &quot;common&quot; knowledge that subreddits are bought and spots on the front page are paid for, so it seems extremely likely that certain users or mods that run these subs are paid shills. They can delete whatever doesn&#39;t fit their narrative, they aim conversation in a certain path and work their non-shill users into a frenzy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While there are definitely paid shills and bots, I think there are far more people that &quot;brainwashed by the media&quot;. (I put that in quotes as I&#39;m not fond of the term even if I agree with the general sentiment.) That&#39;s kind of the point of the media controlling the narrative, isn&#39;t it? You get the most bang for your buck by having only a few shills start things off and making a safe place for everyone else to join in and agree with the narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My county flipped from Obama to Trump in 2016, and it was pretty obvious it was going to happen judging by lawn signs and bumper stickers.  During the entire election cycle (Spring 2015 - November 2016), I saw 3 Hillary bumper stickers in a mid-Atlantic city of ~40,000.  Every third or fourth car had MAGA stickers or flags though, and about as many cars had some Bernie gear.  I saw more Jill Stein stickers than Hillary stickers.  Lawn signs were about the same ratio - Trump &gt; Bernie &gt; Jill &gt; Hill .  </p>

<p>So there&#39;s definite support for the President - it&#39;s just not always loud, not unlike Nixon&#39;s &quot;Silent Majority&quot;.</p>

<p>But I reckon your mileage may vary.  </p>
