<p>Title: How the State Shapes Your Reality, Limits Your Consciousness, and Separates Your Family.
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Today’s societal structure operates in such a way that is systematically designed to prevent individuals from reaching deep, intimate levels of thought. By participating in society’s game, a majority of individuals are forced to agree to many terms that ultimately shape their reality, limit their consciousness, and separate them from their families. The 40-hour work week, for example was proposed by Henry Ford in 1914 as a means for maintaining optimal productivity. However, more than 100 years later, many individuals are still bound to a 40-hour work week, and for good reason. It is my belief that the standard working model is set in place to subversively destroy families throughout America.
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether individuals choose to acknowledge their reality or not, the simple truth is that a professional career is quite possibly one of the most important aspects of an individual’s life. A career provides you varying degrees of financial freedom, allows you to take part in leisure time, when permitted, and provides food, heat, and shelter for your family. However, the costs associated with acquiring a fruitful career, although intangible, are rather significant. For example, agreeing to a 40-hour work week ensures that you will spend a majority of your life away from your loved ones, while your children are told what to think and believe by complete strangers. Wives and husbands become estranged over time, as they begin to spend more time at their workplace than they do with their significant other. This can cause individuals to become closer with their coworkers than their significant other, leading to a lost connection that was once present, or in some cases, infidelity. Worse yet, many individuals take their work home with them, whether mentally or physically, preventing said individuals from being able to have any sense of clarity or deep thought, as they are often too busy thinking about what they will have to tend to at their workplace the following day. While the 40-hour work week is just a small piece to society’s game, the latest and greatest technology ensures that we spend as little time with our families as possible while away from the workplace.
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Although some choose to limit their technology use, it is no secret that a majority of individuals indulge in various mediums of technology throughout the day. For example, social media ensures that individuals remain separated from their friends and family while portraying a false sense of interconnection. Constantly scrolling through various news feeds of superficial content ensures that many individuals remain in a constant state of discontent, causing said individuals to continue an unsustainable rate of consumption as a means of filling an empty void in their lives. And the constant consumption of new products and technology ensures that a majority of individuals will have to remain dependent on their 40-hour work week in order to continue living a lifestyle that is simply designed to feed the ego.
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>To no fault of your own, these needless wants are instilled in almost all individuals at a very young age through varying mediums of entertainment. Children are highly impressionable by nature, and as such, they tend to mimic the wants of their peers as a means of fitting in. But where do these wants stem from? It is my belief that television and other forms of media are simply vessels for instilling superficiality in young children under the guise of entertainment. Not only does television ensure that families around the country remain detached from their family members through simple distractions, it also shows children a false sense of reality where many individuals live lifestyles that, for most Americans, is simply unobtainable. Not to mention, the little amount of time left at the end of the day to spend with one’s family is often instead spent in silence whilst staring at a plastic screen projecting various images. This perverse method of selling products and lavish lifestyles via entertainment causes many children to ask more from their parents so that they may fit into their current social circles while looking more desirable to outsiders. However, if parents succumb to the superficial wants of their children, and most parents do, then they will be required to work longer hours or make financial sacrifices that will affect their family’s quality of life. The result is more time spent at work away from one’s family, which will ultimately contribute to a growing resentment that many children develop towards their parents once they begin to feel neglected. This is one of the many ways that televisions are used by the state to infiltrate the homes of families throughout the country in order to begin shaping the reality of children.
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Although these traps are purposefully set in place at every turn to cause conflict within families, they can be minimized rather easily with a few simple lifestyle changes. Instead of choosing to watch TV when returning from work, consider reading a book or reflecting on where you are currently in life. Instead of choosing to use social media as a way to satisfy your ego, consider getting rid of social media altogether while committing yourself to strengthening the relationships around you in real life that you care about most. Instead of thinking about what your next day at work brings while at home, consider basking in the present moment where you can give all of your love and attention to your family. Tribal societies are an incredible example of how families can strengthen their bond without the need of material possessions.
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>When considering life during tribal times, hunting, gathering, and thinking were quite possibly the most prominent activities in day-to-day life. With no technology to distract from furthering an individual’s interpersonal development, many in tribal societies more than likely spent a good portion of their time talking with family members and reaching deeper levels of consciousness that is nearly impossible for many individuals in modern times. In fact, in today’s society, you would be hard pressed to find a large group of people that have been able to prioritize the things that are most important in their lives. This is because with so much outside stimuli imposed at any given moment, and so little time to reflect on one’s own life, society’s game has reduced individuals to their economic worth, preventing said individuals from taking extended periods of time to sit and think.
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>We are only here for a brief period of time, and instead of spending said time with family and loved ones, we choose to chase superficial materials that we think will bring us joy and comfort. The only joy and comfort that can be found in this life is the joy and comfort that comes from family, friends, and a sense of community. Acquiring as many material possessions as possible may provide instant gratification, but none of the materials acquired will be of any value when you reach the end of your life with no sense of family or community. Creating meaningful relationships with loved ones while continuously striving to remove yourself from society’s game is one of the only ways to ensure that you avoid the countless traps set in place that are designed to shape your reality, limit your consciousness, and separate your family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for checking out this article. I suppose what I meant by that portion of the article is that I don&#39;t believe a majority of people take the time to think about their existence, how they impact the world around them, and how getting caught up in the momentum of society&#39;s game affects not only yourself, but the people you love most around you. It is my belief that this type of thinking is subversively discouraged through the use of technology, work, entertainment, and social media, so that reaching deeper states of consciousness is nearly impossible. I understand where you are coming from in saying that the internet has allowed people to grow their consciousness, but I think that the internet has simply allowed people to be more privy to knowledge that they may not have been aware of otherwise. Thanks again for the read and well thought out response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trying to reconcile these truths with the rat-race mentality of modern families/friendships has been a trial for me. Little-to-none of my friends and acquaintances can understand the necessity to conduct oneself harmoniously, and their emotional natures override the wisdom of these insights, creating various emotional scenarios which result in loss, discomfort, and otherwise sub-optimal functioning.</p>

<p>I think that the inability to realize the splintering nature of this technocratic system is derived on the dependence on the system itself. By being so radically enlightened regarding the use of these technologies, you intrinsically oust yourself as an enemy-of-the-state, given that the &quot;state&quot; is partial to maintaining the current &quot;system&quot; in place.</p>

<p>Ultimately, radicals and revolutionaries aren&#39;t meant to be plain and normal humans. Being able to pierce the veil of manipulated consumerism and see the validity of a spiritually-grounded existence...well, that&#39;s a beautiful thing. No matter if others can recognize it or not.</p>

<p>Thanks for the read, archiving it for posterity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bizarre to think there are actual people benefitting from this system.  Are they meditating on the suffering (or more lightly; a general lesser well being) of those cast down by this system?  I think not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>8 hours a day for 5 days a week doesn&#39;t equal a majority of your life. It&#39;s not even a third.</p>

<p>40 hour work week was a gift at the time. You do understand these people were working 12-16 hours a day for 6 or 7 days a week for pennies right?</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t see how people choosing to indulge in technology is anyone&#39;s fault but their own. </p>

<p>Active parents are also heavily involved in their child&#39;s education. You think good parents don&#39;t supplement what&#39;s taught at school with their own teaching?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>40 hour work week is way less than some people work, but way more than humans have worked historically.  The 40 hour work week is better than victorian era sweatshops or dutch indian company slave workers, but way more than pre-agriculture and medievel era stuff.</p>

<p>I agree with you on technology. Some things can be good in moderation. This is a social media platform. </p>

<p>Worth noting that for some people a 40 hour work week is okay, and it might destroy others. Research suggests 22 hours is optimal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it also seriously depends on whether you&#39;re doing something that you love and you are genuinely contributing with your work, or whether you&#39;re ruining people&#39;s lives, the environment....etc. while not really helping our society evolve.</p>

<p>Some jobs are more geared towards making things better, others less so. If you really have a shitty and destructive job and there&#39;s no way to get out, then at least try your best to turn it into something that brings value to others and this planet - it will be more fulfilling for you and everyone else if you do so in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of America’s well-publicized problems, including obesity, depression, pollution and corruption are what it costs to create and sustain a trillion-dollar economy. For the economy to be “healthy”, America has to remain unhealthy. Healthy, happy people don’t feel like they need much they don’t already have, and that means they don’t buy a lot of junk, don’t need to be entertained as much, and they don’t end up watching a lot of commercials.</p>

<p>The culture of the eight-hour workday is big business’ most powerful tool for keeping people in this same dissatisfied state where the answer to every problem is to buy something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think your focus on separation of family is prescient. The family is the fundamental building block of any society. Now we&#39;ve undermined our foundation by devaluing the family unit and attempted to replace it with other institutions (such as public school or the &quot;job&quot; - working 40 hours a week for someone else, as opposed to the &quot;occupation&quot; - working directly to sustain one&#39;s self/family) and are looking around wondering &quot;why isn&#39;t this working?&quot; Here&#39;s a hint: humans didn&#39;t evolve to be this detached from one another. The detachment only serves the extractive elements in that society. Your attention is a resource - direct it mindfully.</p>

<p>Would it be fair to say that, on average, the typical individual spends 1.5 hours preparing for work each day? Many individuals, especially women, would say that this is a very conservative estimate. If so, this would add 7.5 hours towards your working week, a total of 47.5 hours, so far. Now let&#39;s consider cooking and cleaning up the mess made from cooking after work.</p>

<p>If we assume that the average individual spends two hours (one hour for prepping and cooking, and one hour for cleaning afterwards) on dinner, then we have a total of 57.5 hours, so far. Lastly, let&#39;s factor in sleep, or do you not sleep?</p>

<p>When factoring in the recommended eight hours of sleep that you should receive each night, we have another 40 hours of time unaccounted for (sleeping Monday through Friday). These four activities alone (preparing for work, work, cooking and cleaning, as well as sleeping) total 97.5 hours, and this isn&#39;t even factoring in the extra 16 hours of sleep that you should be receiving on the weekend. So, by taking part in these four basic activities that all arguably relate to working, you can expect to spend a total of 97.5 hours, or 58% of your time during the week getting ready for work, working, cooking and cleaning, and sleeping. However, if we add the additional 16 hours of sleep that you would be receiving on the weekend, we come to 113.5 hours of time spent on the four activities listed above, or 67.5% or your time throughout the week. It is my personal opinion that your calculations seem to be a bit shortsighted. Thank you for reading this article and taking the time to respond with your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think public schooling is the biggest factor breaking up families and leading to the alienation of children with their parents. People always worked to survive since the dawn of time. That is not the issue. Go back 100 or 150 years and adults used to work much longer hours. What is different is how much longer the school day has gotten with after school activities and hours of homework that eat up literally every minute of a child&#39;s day. A modern parent is lucky if they even get two free minutes to talk to their kid during weekdays. In Europe the school day is actually shorter than it is in America and they don&#39;t have nearly as many activities or homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/1_gyVPzbB_Y?t=58s">https://youtu.be/1_gyVPzbB_Y?t=58s</a> (notice the top comment on the video)</p>

<p>School has taken up a huge part of my life so far, Its hard to find time to do anything else than schoolwork. I am technically putting this on myself by being in AP classes (advances placement) in high school, but if I pass the AP exam, I get a year of college knocked off, and this is good because colleges are EXTREMELY expensive in America. When I get home from a 7 hour school day, I usually stay up till like 12 or 1 in the morning working on homework, or feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the enourmus homework load. The Finnish education system, by what I saw in this video, would personally be amazing to have here, and I could actually live my life instead of being cooped up in my room all day studying. I live in Texas.﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for taking the time to read this article. That is an admirable lifestyle change that I think would also benefit me. I have since rid myself of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, so maybe it is the right time to make the switch to a flip phone.</p>
