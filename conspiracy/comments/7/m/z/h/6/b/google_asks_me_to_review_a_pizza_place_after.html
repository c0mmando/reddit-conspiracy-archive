       Basically the title, was at home while somebody came over with a pizza. A few minutes later I get a notification from Google Maps asking me to rate that same pizza place. We never even said the name of the place. This person is on a family location app with me, but regardless it seems pretty sketchy.

       The location app knew they went to the place, knew they stayed long enough to order, and knew they went straight to your location afterwards.

       Your phone (probably) isn’t listening to you.

       Isn't it sketchy that any app can do that, owned by Google or not? Goigle doesn't give a shit about you. Google is not your friend. Google is not, in any way, good.

       Well, while I think it is sketchy,  there is a very good possibility the location app (I am curious what the name is) uses googles maps api, and possibly is just a repackaging of googles location services.

       The other day, my wife and I were joking around, talking in silly British accents, and one of us went on for a while about wearing “nickers,” something we’d never normally say, and the next day my wife got Facebook ads on her phone for nickers.

       It's funny how people were called crazy and paranoid for saying phones are listening years ago,  now everyday people post something about this. I wish we had a list of yearly "confirmed conspiracies " to pass off on newly red pilled people.  It would be a good place to start and with more recent conspiracies people would be more interested.

       If you read the terms of service (TOS) you actually probably agreed to it as so many people simply just scroll through the TOS nowadays that basically a company could put in anything they want and if you click yes i agree then you are beholden to do whatever you agreed to just because you didnt read the fine print doesnt mean you arent beholden to it.

       If you don't want ads, you must turn off the reverse notifications for following apps on you phone:
      </p>
      <p>
       stomach.app
tastebuds.app
nasal passages.app
      </p>
      <p>
       If you set all of these to off, no one will know what you are eating. 
Finally, you can also shut it all down by removing your apple watch.

       How about the idea that the delivery driver is recognized as such - and each house he goes to is tagged, referenced - and any users active on an Android device in the same location may be prompted if it's likely that they are recognized as someone who resides at that address? Just a fun thought.

       That is exactly what I said! People need to read the damn terms &amp; conditions! And another thing. My phone recently updated to the Android Nougat 7.1.1, which I found weird because I forwent all of these builds: 6.0.1 Build/PDA APJ3, 6.0.1 Build/PDA APK6, 6.0.1 Build/PDA AQC3, 6.0.1 Build/PDA AQF1, 7.1.1 Build/PDA BQI5. My phone has not ever done that before. Anyhow, after it updated, to me seems it reset itself and I had to log back into my gmail and Samsung account. And upon signing back into my gmail account, it seemed like the agreement or opt in had became 2 pages (or screens you have to click through). I do not remember that being like that. And I know for sure on the samsung portion, it used to allow you to opt out and not  agree and not when you try to select what you agree to, it will not move forward. and it places you back to agree to all. I was going to try and downgrade the OS back to the 4.4.4 but on Samsungs or certain ones you cannot downgrade once you are updated to a certain bootloaders, in my case MM; you cannot downgrade! So until them I am scouring XDA, Android File Host, GitHub; pretty much all the Android forums to find something that fixes that shit, if not just gonna install a custom OS

       its AI. Not only is it ancient, but it is telepathic.

       Humanity will be able to merge with a form of AI that we create, that is benevolent, but this ancient telepathic, psychopathic type has got to go. Rumor is that the sun is gonna sneeze (CME) and wipe out all the bad AI.. Interesting times, compatriot.

       That is the thing. This is more than listening. This means that Google really does have access to all data, even from apps that they do not own or operate. It was never discussed to me that we were getting a pizza, a person just showed up with it. I didn't even look at my phone until I went back into my room and got the notification.

       There could be an RFID chip in the box itself or, as someone else said, some other petsonthat was there had an app. This is why the tracking systems are so insidious: if a couple of your friends allow themselves to be tracked and they spend time with you, it's as if you're fully tracked despite trying to maintain your privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding RFID boxes, I had an experience in 2013 where a lady walked
       <em>
        into
       </em>
       a convenience store carrying a cardboard box, triggering anti-theft alarms. She started blabbing on with the cashier about how she didn't need the extra empty box so she wants to return it to the store.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I pieced together was that everything is being RFID chipped, including the plainest cardboard boxes used to transport bulk commercial goods.

       Google asks me to review a lot of places I've never been to. "Please review this Indian buffet! Please review this automotive store! Please review this adult novelty store!" Shit Google, calm your tits. Just because I drove past it doesn't mean I've been there.

       Which family location app? The one by Google, called Family Link. Or another one? Did you text about it? Are you using the Google Assistant? If so, that is how and when you begin using any phone that has the Google Android OS on it and or signing in to your Gmail account or using their new Google Assistant app; you agreed to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I began using the Google Assistant app, and I really did not pay attention I just kind of clicked through it without reading. Well, me and my 12 yr old son what having a talk about this guy and him pissing me off.  The Google Assistant begins speaking exactly what I said "This is the thing that really pisses me off, I am sorry I don't understand, I can search that for you"  The last little portion is paraphrased, it said something along that line. I scared the shit out of us. I took the battery out of my phone put it in a rubbermaid container and put it in the closet. I went on a 48 hour mission reading and researching. Only to find that Google has my voice recordings store in my account online. FUCK THAT SHIT!

       I have a similar app that tracks what stores I go to and asks me survey questions about them later. It gives playstore credit I can use for buying other apps or buying in game items.

       It's funny how people were called crazy and paranoid for saying phones are listening years ago,  now everyday people post something about this. I wish we had a list of yearly "confirmed conspiracies " to pass off on newly red pilled people.  It would be a good place to start and with more recent conspiracies people would be more interested.

       Well, while I think it is sketchy,  there is a very good possibility the location app (I am curious what the name is) uses googles maps api, and possibly is just a repackaging of googles location services.
