    <div class="md"><p>The State Department just released 2,800 work-related emails from Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, that were found by the FBI on the laptop computer of Abedin’s husband, &quot;Carlos Danger&quot;, former Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the emails were deemed classified some of them are connected to talks between Hamas and the PLO; a call to  Benjamin Netanyahu; and conversations with the United Arab Emirates’ foreign minister.</p>

<p>IMO, the conspiracy community will be interested in the emails due to their sensitive nature and despite redactions give a glimpse into the seamy underbelly of the US Government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fact: classified information was stored on an unclassified server.</p>

<p>Fact: that is a crime</p>

<p>Fact: an army major was prosecuted for less than this when he sent a piece of classified information to help protect his guys. But Hillary was investigated by corrupt officials.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t deny McCabe was compromised. You can&#39;t deny the doin was compromised. You can&#39;t deny the leadership at the FBI was compromised as a whole.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this. If you&#39;re not ok with sessions investigating trump why were you ok with Lynch investigating Clinton then meeting on the tarmac with Bill then a week later announce no charges?</p>

<p>Any investigation into a cabinet official should be a special prosecutor from the other side. If you didn&#39;t do anything that will come out but if you did they&#39;ll go after it. </p>

So woth that being said this information he shouldnt have had at all because it was meant for HRc and Huma but even then they were not using secure channels like they should have. Instead they used regular insecure email channels that possibly could have let ANYONE grab these classified emails if they knew where to look</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The La Romana flight to Gitmo is intriguing given that it’s the only international flight plan from the log of Gitmo flights. La Romana is not exactly a major population center (7th largest city in the Dominican Republic). I just did a quick search on Wiki and one thing that caught my eye was that a notable resident of La Romana passed away on November 15, 2016.  Juan Alberto Cirez was a Software Engineer and Entrepreneur.and was one of the developers behind Storm Linux (a Linux Distribution) and Stomix Technologies. He was 46 when he died and I cannot find anything regarding his passing online. Given his area of expertise and the fact that he died 7 days after the US election, I wonder if his death might fit into the picture somehow when it comes to a Gitmo prisoner originating from La Romana? I know it’s a stretch but I offer it up for those of you who are much more capable and talented than I, </p>

<p>PS - if you aren’t familiar with the type of expertise Cirez would possess, read the Wiki pages on Linux Distribution and Stormix, attached below:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution</a>

    <div class="md"><p>I found one mention of him online so far on what appears to be a real estate/tourism website covering destinations in the Dominican Republic. La Romana webpage mentions Cirez in description and the article is likely dated given the reference to 2005 census info as well as the articles citation of the city as the 3rd largest in D.R. (Currently 7th largest):</p>

<p>“One of its most prominent Citizen is Juan Alberto Cirez. &#39;Berto--as he is known to his family--was one of the developers behind Storm Linux and Stomix Technologies - the ground breaking Linux Distro that for a brief period in 1999-2000 seemed poised to take over the computer world.”</p>

<p>And additional context on La Romana:</p>

<p>“La Romana is not a typical Dominican town; instead, it is a company town, with the Central Romana Corporation owning the majority of the town. It is a town with nearly 100% employment, mostly in the tourism industry or with The Central Romana Corporation, the Free Zone (Zonas Francas), or one of the service businesses there.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone still talking about Hillary needs to pull their head out. 1). Even after all the drama with Hillary, Ivanka and Kushner still used their own.  private accounts. 2). Plenty of precedent for other high ranking officials using private accounts. Should Colin Powell be locked up as well? 3) Russia and others hacked the private server and had full access to the account she should have been using, so end result is that if anything, they had less access to emails than they would have if she had used the proper account. 4). If Weiner used his wife’s computer to access her emails than that is on him, assuming that laptops were able to access the ‘secure’ account she was supposed to be using, it stands to reason he would have been able to obtain the emails on the secure account as well.  </p>

<p>Unless you are upper class, the  fact that you still believe DT has the interest of America at heart is laughable. His healthcare bill would have only made things worse. Was so terrible that it wasn’t even possible for Rep to pretend like it was a good idea. His tax bill does nothing but benefit corporations and the ultra wealthy. Everything he attempts to do is done solely for the purpose of benefiting the interests of his family and his ultra wealthy friends. The middle class is being decimated, and you all are still talking about Hillary?  Wake up!!!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No evidence that the server she maintained was ever successfully hacked. The FBI report confirmed attacks on her server, but no evidence any of them were successful.  </p>

<p>There was a massive breach of the federal governments email servers in October 2014.  Official statements were vague, along the lines of we aren’t sure, or we don’t think they accessed the confidential server.  They suggest they thwarted the hackers ability to access the confidential files by shutting the server down....however, is known that the hackers had been inside of their network for over a week before anyone realized they were there.   They also briefly hacked the White House. Other reports suggest these breaches were an ongoing problem, not a one time deal.  </p>
