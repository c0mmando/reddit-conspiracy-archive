       The name of our sub is tongue and cheek as experts want you to believe that soil can build up 10+ feet in less than a hundred years, because people forgot to sweep their streets.

       I hope that we can all dig into our local history and see if we can find the evidence of "cultural layer" in our areas.

       there are many different aspects to this theory. the evidence seems to indicate an event happening sometime in the 17th century and possibly continuing into the 19th century. In other words possibly some kind of biblical destruction and then subsequent winds carried this layer across the land over the next few decades.

      <p>
       (thats just one hypothesis credit to sibved.livejournal.com)
      </p>
      <p>
       But possibly not as long as we think because there seems to be further evidence that the recent timeline has been artificially stretched and historical figures completely made up and others duplicated to fill in the non existent times

       Mankind is capable of amazing things but there are some things that just aren't feasible for us. The closest personal experience I have with stuff like this is that guy I met in Mexico who claimed he had been abducted and educated by aliens. He built a home out of all stone like these. But the doors opened and closed on their own. Imagine a giant stone slab 1 piece garage door. That's what it was like. He could also grow produce the size of a person. Never said why they taught him this they just did and he never told anyone how he did anything and once he died no one could get anything he built to work. So I don't doubt some other force assisted with these structures. Question is how and how much did they help and more importantly, why.

       <em>
        Something

       happened in relatively recent history to bury large swathes of land in sediment, and it's been almost completely wiped from public consciousness. This is a massive conspiracy.

       The fact that the Rockefeller Foundation took over the educational system in the early 1900s &amp; co-opted the universities, that written Western documentation of history was compromised through the agendas of those financing publishing houses... add Tavistock, add the planting of professors and scholars compliant with the agendas in high places in corporate, non-profit and educational sectors... and it's completely absurd to buy the truth of anything we've been taught. As your post illustrates, we don't even know what time it is anymore. Thanks for compiling.

       Did we ever know what time it is? Or ever really know "where" we are or what we're doing "here" in this so called world and universe that at the cutting edge of the best of our knowledge is all completely "illusory"?
      </p>
      <p>
       A trick of such fabulous proportions we can't comprehend that it could conceivably be "a trick" of some kind?
      </p>
      <p>
       All nothing but changing and shifting patterns of infinitesimally small discrete little bundles of energy with no form or substance of their own, outside of time as we know it, whose constant motions in and out of the three dimensions we're aware of and presently trapped and brought to life in, seem to substantiate and solidify all the constantly changing forms we recognise as being around us,
       <em>
        for us
       </em>
       , including what seems to be our very own bodies?
      </p>
      <p>
       And we have the ludicrous conceit to think that we actually know anything at all besides what is to temporarily be in and a part of this incomprehensible illusion? This "story" of human beings continuously living and dying on a remote little planet in the middle of something we call the "Cosmos" that we're even smaller than some microscopic "speck", or a tear-drop in the ocean?

To control the past heritage and memories and cultures-  and rewrite new histories portraying the current powers that be as champions/heroes/good.

To control the re-implementation of technology.

       ...not to mention, to coverup what caused the worldwide disaster.  Maybe it was a natural disaster.  Or it was an act of God.  Or perhaps the ruling world powers cut down enormous, miles-tall tree(s), which when felled, caused tremendous tidal waves and mudfloods in many directions.

       Hell yes, we do not know jack shit about what really happened and what things were really like even a few generations ago. Much less 100-200-300 years ect. History is but a fable agreed upon, gotta love that quote.

       It's true that we know nothing of our history other than what we're told, however, one generation who lived the previous were at some point alive in ours, therefore surely if something was written down that wasn't true, it would have been picked up.
This is why it is so much easier to re-write ancient history, because nobody would know.
These buildings being buried could possibly be because of the World Wars, a lot of turmoil in the soil, it being tossed in the air and reburied would surely make the soil softer and less compact, therefore sinking what lies in it faster.

       Great post. I‚Äôve been interested in this topic since I heard Sylvie Ivanowa on the higherside chats. During the reformation period, it would have been incredibly easy to fabricate anything you wanted. The vast majority of ppl were illiterate. Priests, who were held in high regard, could have easily added, subtracted, or fabricated anything. Governments were forceful and feared and could enforce anything while also smothering dissent. I have not heard of our recent history being fabricated but I find it very interesting. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt even want to send my child to school because what the fuck is a fact nowadays? Everything is open to question and schooling just seems to be more indoctrination rather than education.

       Looks like they were grading the roads for the town, and for water runoff they had to build up around some buildings. Probably made a lot of people mad for sure, but I don‚Äôt think this is necessarily the work of alien abducted Mexicans.

       Excellent post. I think the revision of history is one of the biggest conspiracies there is. George Orwell: "Those who control the past control the future."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is something I've often thought about while watching movies. I can pretty much guarantee that the vast majority of people picture something they saw in a movie when picturing a certain time period. I'd say unless someone is a history major, most people get a lot of their education about "history" from movies. Random thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard of the phantom time hypothesis? It's a rabbit hole I fell down not too long ago. Interesting stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The phantom time hypothesis is a historical conspiracy theory asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, the hypothesis proposes a conspiracy by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and possibly the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, to fabricate the Anno Domini dating system retrospectively, so that it placed them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history[1] to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.[2] According to this scenario, the entire Carolingian period, including the figure of Charlemagne, is a fabrication, with a "phantom time" of 297 years (AD 614‚Äì911) added to the Early Middle Ages."

       I really can't see there being a conspiracy here... soil and shit just builds up, and it built up around these buildings. There's also the fact it's much easier to rebuild on top pre-existing buildings and foundations, rather than removing the whole structure and starting again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also can't get my head around why they would cover it up, who they are, what they gain and what they covered up?
Seems like a massive thing to try cover up, they must have got something important from it.

       Considering on average, 1 inch of top soil takes 500 years to form leads me to believe that something else has happened to these places and this is what OP is talking about... Our human history is likely been false fabricated to what
