<p>you cant change most of their minds anyway, they are too far gone into illogics and feelings, believe me I have tried both in my family, friends, etc and there is just no logic, manners, or critical thinking in these people.

    <div class="md"><p>Completely disagree. The SS is a good idea, but not for this sub. IMO, the SS takes away from the idea of this sub, which is to formulate your own understandings by filtering out the bs <em>on our own</em>. The users here already know that the world is filled with bullshit, spam, and lies, which is why this sub even exists in the first place because people need a place to weed out all the garbage and eventually dig down to the truth. The SS adds another layer to be manipulated, in ways like filtering content, or even just upright lying about the content of the post. Mark my words, this rule will only bring more confusion to this sub and, at the very least, gives the mods more control over what is posted, upvoted, and seen. Not that i dont trust the mods, i dont trust anyone, hence my presence here.</p>
