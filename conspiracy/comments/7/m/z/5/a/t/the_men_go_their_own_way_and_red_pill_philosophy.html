      <p>
       I'm a bit older and dated around a lot, and was in plenty of short and long term relationships. Because of these relationships, 1 night stands, and dating, I started noticing a pattern about every single woman I ever met.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part they were as follows: Feelings instead of logic, shallow instead of deep, did not have Passion and Love the way I do/did, quite a few wanted me to get them pregnant (never did), and I started noticing that the better looking women who were older tended to have a kid from an Alpha male who was not raising the kid, so these women would lower their standards for someone who would pay the bills and raise someone else kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed that the douchey muscle bound alpha jerks got laid easily no problem, handed to them on the platter. The average joe had to work for it in various ways, and the short, chubby ugly guys really never stood a chance unless the girl was also chubby/ugly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several women I have been with who were closing in on 30 would beg me to get them pregnant, but I never did, and later found that usually the next guy they got with right after me, did get them pregnant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our culture and society in the West also reflects the strong Alpha Muscle Bound Chad as the hero who all women want, and end up getting, and the average joe or the nerd as a pain in the ass in most dating movies, disney movies, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually I just learned to be self sufficient and realized that I have to honor my time and would rather use it for my own interests instead of dating, sitting around watching netflix, wasting money on movies, dates, etc for some future possibility that this would lead to sex, while also spending massive hours texting and talking on the phone to keep her interested and giving her attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       So eventually I took a few years off and focused on me, learned Spanish, spent a month, then 3 months the next year in a Buddhist Monastery, traveled in India, Tibet, and various Eastern Countries, Ayahuasca with Shamans in Peru, noticed more money in my savings, generally more happy and self sufficient, recorded a debut electronica album, got in shape by falling in love with cardio, tai chi, and eventually after 4 years of lot of overtime and a side jobs, I paid off my house and my car and have had some fascinating spiritual awakening using Esoteric Yoga systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I started living a bachelor no women lifestyle before I knew there even is such a thing:
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go to r/mgtow (which is short for Men Go Their Own Way) you will find a male Philosophy about exactly this, bettering yourself as a man, education, health, savings/earnings, good job, not being in depth, and most importantly not getting imprisoned in a relationship and with a kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       To my suprise, something that I discovered and love, is actually a movement among men.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, there is r/theredpill which also discusses all the collective archetypes of western women's inability to be in love, to be passionate, to be with a guy because of his personality and not looks, to sleep with as many Alphas as possible, and to eventually settle down with a Beta provider, amongst many other patterns I've discovered in my own life.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, every Alpha I ever knew is not married and not supporting any women and they are doing fine and generally happy. Every beta I know is woman/child supporter, and after a handful of beers if you ask them if they are happy, many will admit they are miserable, made a mistake and feel imprisoned in their sexless broke check to check marriages.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll leave you with something from Seth McFarland's Family Guy summing up exactly what happens after you get married, something every single one of my married friends has admitted either sober or after a little truth serum:

       Submission Statement: Western Society Women get the upper hand in relationships, financially, in the courts, and generally a man will get stuck in a marriage with kids and become miserable because of it. This, along with being a wage slave and debt slave, is further imprisonment of the Western Male. However now new Movements are forming where men are just opting out entirely from this system for their own freedom and happiness.

       not sure if even the keepers are worth it. The "keepers" in r/theredpill talk are considered unicorns because they don't exist. Of course that's relative. To me, someone who has passion, depth, cooks good (because I cook good AF too) and is well rounded in various departments, can be viewed this way

       I suppose, but I found out that foreign women, especially from Eastern Europe, have much of what you are looking for, which are pretty much what I look for, as well. Women from more of the Western world, are for the most part, exactly as you described in the OP.

       Women from East Europe are on male order bride websites looking to come and get their green card to stay in the U.S. then many eventually leave the guy they got for someone better or from back home. Not always, but everyone I know who date Russian, never went back, and the Polish, Czech, etc girls here are already Westernized and on some bullshit, or the ones who are still out there have seen the mags, american movies, western media and they thing everyone here is rich AF

       Good post, I have followed a similar path
      </p>
      <p>
       the women asking to be impregnated with my child was a weird one! And it happened several times, not just once!
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know several women who 'spermjacked" some hunk so they could have a better looking kid. Once they were pregnant they ditched the guy. Shit like that sickens me

       I was with this one girl, and she would tell me to (basically in the most p.c. way I can, to get her preggo while we were having sex) and every time she said this was when she was ovulating, so there is another little mini conspiracy. Do women who are ripe to get pregnant tell their guy to impregnate them mostly during this cycle?

       I find that a little weird, too. I've had men in casual relationships that wanted to "knock me up". Maybe it is a fetish or a result of sleeping with people that can't connect properly.

       It was so much better back when women were chattel to be traded as servants to men. This "new" wanting-to-make-babies biology thing is a pain in the ass, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on, OP. If anything, it's women that have figured out that they don't have to stay in shitty marriages like they have for ions or couples that have lost sight of the satisfaction that working toward a lifelong relationship can bring.
      </p>

       Thank you for bringing up the fact that things are evening out as far as child sharing and financial responsibility, though. It was very biased in favor of the mom for decades, but most courts are gender-blind when it comes to custody, parenting time and support these days.

       It really is the truth, at least in the region I live in. I've been a victim's advocate for four years now and literally help folks to write comprehensive parenting plans. The only female gender bias I have witnessed is when a child under three is still breast feeding. Beyond that, the courts look for equal parenting time and use a simple matrix to determine support.

       It is probably 90% female, to be honest. The folks I help are completely battered and beaten physically. I often meet them in the hospital when the police are there to take their statement. I do get fathers, too, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with the battered state of the folks I help, the state treats both parents equally as long as there was no abuse to the children. Both parents go through the same psych exams and home studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       My job is to go at it with the goal of a 50/50 arrangement, and often giving the "bread winner" 51% to offset the financial matrix. CPS decides the support, and in my state, even an unemployed parent has a base income of 40 hrs/wk at min wage. Both parent's incomes are added up and 20% of that is considered the "child's portion" of the "family's" income. That 20% is then divided by the number of overnights with each parent and distributed with the hope that both homes will be livable for the child.

       that's not the question.  the question was how many people in your job are men and how many are women, percentage-wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'll note that your initial comment on this thread indicated a gender bias by virtue of your characterization of men treating women as chattel.  and i'll note that you failed to respond to the question asked and instead misread it (likely intentionally).  does that tell you something about your own biases or what?

       As for my "chattel" op, yes, I think men have recently gone through some serious inequity as a result of an overcorrection from hundreds (thousands?) of years of complete inequity against women. As I've stated, I actively
       <em>
        volunteer my time
       </em>
       to rectify the couple decades of men getting picked on by the courts. Shit, I set up three Xmas trees and presents for men
       <em>
        were stupidly advised to quit their jobs to avoid child support
       </em>
       .

       again you can answer the question.  what's the gender breakdown percentage-wise of people in your role?
      </p>
      <p>
       the existence of gender bigotry doesn't just happen thru policy.  it happens by virtue of who is hired to implement policy.  it happens by virtue of who writes policy (and you may see that this too has a gender bias in it).
      </p>
      <p>
       i get that your intentions maybe are good.  but your bias is clear.  your words speak quite loudly.  that you can't understand this or intentionally ignore it because admission of such a thing is quite telling, is itself quite telling.

       I think my words speak for the best interest of children. I'm not getting what you are saying. Lots of folks know me here, including you, and I doubt you could find someone that thinks I favor a gender.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told you my experience of my last four years helping families get through custody trials in a fair manner. I think the courts have moved beyond the old days of giving the mom the child by default.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, as I stated, anyone can volunteer with victim's advocates. It is likely that, as in my case, those that have been abused and helped end up taking up the reigns.

       I'm on board with most of what you said. There are definitely still courts that are biased in favor of the mother, in custody situations. I've watched several of my guy friends go through messy custody battles recently, where they were simply fighting for some form of shared custody. It all depends on the state you're in.

       I think my region may be a bit ahead of the game, which is odd because it is fairly conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I've noticed, though, is that men often believe from the get-go that they don't have a right (and often don't want the responsibility,) to 50/50 parenting. They were raised in the days of divorced dads seeing their kids on Wed evening and every other weekend and alternate holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also faced with attorneys that will bleed them dry by making the custudy agreement an endless, slanderous, painful battle that does nothing but hurt the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work to stop that.

       I've watched a handful of friends go through the process in GA, and it's never been pretty for the father. One is deep in debt from fighting in court. His ex is a drug addict that puts their kid in danger more often than any parent should. My friend still had to fight for even partial custody. He managed to get to an even split on custody, but only after she fucked up publicly a few times. He still periodically deals with his ex trying to take him to court to challenge the split. The system is still very broken in GA. Another friend went to law school just so he could fight his own battles in court with his ex.

       After my experience, I think the majority of the destruction starts with the lawyers. I'm not a lawyer, but I can guide folks to "the best interest of the child" and show them the ropes with filing, dealing with the court and sharing Co-parenting templates.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the worst things in this society is families being torn up by court system. If they cared enough to make a baby, they can usually work a compromise out if they focus on the best interest of the kids.

       One will never know if they picked the perfect path for themselves or not, but I found myself a woman who's even more redpilled than me, and she's a fucking wonderful mother to our child.

       shit, sounds like you hit the lotto. But if I were you, I would have a secret bank account or invested in crypto, and rent instead of own. Who knows what the future holds and its good to have an out just in case. Wile I wish you the best and hope you found a gem, I know way too many people, including myself, who thought they found the One, only to realize after a few years that its not so

       Don't worry, got that part covered. I know what I would lose, and am willing to lose that. But I also know what I
       <em>
        won't
       </em>
       lose if things were to go sideways, and that's most important (hint: entities owned/formed before the contract).
      </p>
      <p>
       Things also change when a kid gets involved... losing half a house isn't the end of the world, and I fully disagree on renting. Rents nearly
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       go up. My mortgage will not. The interest is low and I intend to pay it off relatively soon (driving interest even lower) and then should have some good choices and more financial freedom if we want it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a crypto guy, but I follow it. No need to hide money in my situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the one comment I'll make is that if things were to go sideways, I'd be quite close to the going own way thing, which is why this post struck a nerve. I had to filter through a
       <em>
        ton
       </em>
       of crazy bullshit before finding the babymama here, and wouldn't have the patience to do that again. So I don't blame you at all.

       The need to hide money is so unhealthy. I own a business and to avoid any problems if it fails we married out of community of property - basically we own our own assets. We are grown ups and simply discussed it before we got married and both thought it was a good idea. We share expenses, have a shared budget and shared financial goals but run everything separately - again by talking and not hiding stuff.

       I can offer the best of me by focusing on and bettering myself, via "be the change you want to see." In terms of expecting the best from others, I choose to have no expectations. That way if I have built a mental strawman, I am soon disappointed. But if there is just neutrality, then you can soon become presently surprised

       It's just genetics.  Women want to bang the alpha-chads because they have the best genes.   This is the same way for us.   You don't hear about a bunch of dudes fawning over Lena Dunham.  We all want a healthy woman with a big ass that can fire out the babies- only you don't consciously think about the babies.

       Maybe for some, sure. On the other hand, being conscious enough to circumvent this wiring, this programming, and having the gusto in life to sacrifice that in order to put an album out, or go meditate with the Monks for a year, ot to focus on other things, at the very least shows there is a conscious higher imperative going on

       Lol, you'd be surprised. A friend of my sister, who herself is actually attractive, is herself similar to a cross between Shrek and a Mexican Lena Dunham, goes on Tinder and has a few hundred requests that first week

       You don't have to be an unconscious zombie to want love.  Love leads to children which (despite being completely illogical because they are a fuckload of work)  will make you way happier than jerking off 1000 monks to EDM In any country.

       I get that in this ocean of angry betas the idea that having a family and getting caught up in the stereotypical "fulfilling life" is incredibly unpopular on this site.

       women are not able to love as men are able to. Women will only love an X amount and withhold the rest. The heart in western society is closed, and most Eastern philosophies and religions discuss this openly

       I have no kids, dont want any and am happy AF, have self love, love for humanity, and am at peace with everything. I love my dog as well, and Love doesnt mean kids. Not sure where you got that from, sounds very religious, like old school catholic

       After living with women, and dating one with a kid for a short amount of time (and let her stay over to save up for her own apt for a few months) I have never been happier than to not have kids and someone who wants to use the debit card for shopping, or wasting my time watching horrible netflix movies.

       I get it that it that it's way easier to be single.   No doubt about it.   I do hr have anything against it.   In the other hand,  you seem like a person that has experienced a lot, but have completely missed enjoying the quintessential human experience.  Plus your experience would probably make you a good parent which in turn would make your kids good and decent people, of which there are not nearly enough of.   All I'm saying is don't deny yourself because you had a few bad experiences with women.   I've seen a few people post about how great their experience is with their wife.   It's not a one in a million situation, I have the same thing with my wife,  but I had to crawl up a mountain of psychos to get there.

       Yes! Its already a thing in highly intelligent folks and in Western society as a whole, people have been having less kids, because with higher intelligence there is an understanding, perhaps subconscious, not to tax the system, to bring in life to be cogs/debt slave/sufferers, and to have a lesser overall carbon footprint

       Not procreating has some fascinating consequences, a paid off house/car, 401k, various real estate investments, time and money to travel, explore, to break out the system a bit more to see what else is out there and what is possible

       Seriously don’t need oxygen or food? Are you short self awareness? I’m heading a lot of self justification and in some circles I think it’s called ego. Another question, human pair bonding, how long do you think that’s been a thing? How long do you think having no kids has been a thing?

       Here's the thing, if you simply study r/theredpill and r/mgtow and start looking around, look at the movie plots, at friends, at males in hollywood going through divorces, at the dating scene, at the alpha male, etc, and you will start to notice the pattern. This link is just more proof. Thanks for this, had a great laugh

       Actually it takes a weak minded man to unconsciously orgasm without any foresight, and then spend the rest of their lives in an almost sexless marriage while being depressed and feeling like they are in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, it takes a strong willed strong minded man, to wear protection, or pull out consciously, and to avoid the whole imprisonment while taking care of your physical health, 6 figures, paid off house/car, spiritual growth, learning a new language, having the money to travel, to take a year off of work, to have savings in the bank, to take a chance on starting business or learning a new craft, and if sex really is necessary then the local club and bar offers a variety of one night stands no problem

       Oh I know. Females get crazy pissed off emotional and illogical when they find out there are ever increasing groups of men who are opting out of being enslaved in a marriage, being a financial supporter, and having kids. I have seen some the most serious outrage come from women over this.

       Ahhh there you go, proving me right again. See, with men, I can have a logical conversation even if we are in disagreement we can at the vert least be mutual respectful without any side looking for some rules to end free speech or a loophole to make sure a topic your feelings dont like, can be censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would hope you can break this bad habit and have an open debate and discussion with me about this, without running to the mods about it.

       Nice assumption. I dont think you are the wrong half. I just think that more and more men are no longer buying into the old programming of relationships, marriage, being a supporter, and having kids, and its great.

      <p>
       There is also a correlation between women who have higher intelligence having less babies:

       And since increase in intelligence is part of evolution, we can argue that these movements are a natural part of hugher intelligence and higher consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, men in general are really looking forward to A.I. Sexbots which some scientists and futurologists say will one day be indistinguishable from real women:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sex-robots-porn-industry-rise-women-out-of-work-threat-ela-darling-adult-star-a7990361.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So overall, the whole scope for women is changing, there is no less supporters and baby makers to choose from because of the higher numbers opting out, and the future A.I. female bots will really put a massive dent and destroy the old way of how things are done between the sexes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one, welcome it all. And if you are married, have a kid, and your husband supports you. Cool, you're very lucky, privileged we can say, to have that. But many women will not be so lucky in future generations.

       This has been fascinating and hilarious all at the same time. But in all honesty none of this is really news to be. My family is filled with redpillers and I hear this shit all the time. My own father insists that the single biggest mistake ever made was giving women the right to vote. He raised my brothers to view women as cleaners, cookers and cock suckers. If she doesn't do the three C's she is useless. Trust me, your views a pretty mild in comparison.

       I'm completely in touch and hardly stunted emotionally. I am more at peace, in tune with myself, with growing investments, and with peace of mind and acceptance of life, when there is a leech constantly seeking my time, attention, and resources. Life is good and I am happy

       Maybe the real problem with you Red Pill guys is that you can't learn to have a mature relationship with a partner and can't treat them like a human person. I mean seriously "western women's inability to live" is a bullshit phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like you made bad dating choices and couldn't man up in a non-aggressive way. It's great that you worked on yourself and had some success but you can do that in a healthy relationship too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often when I talk to RP guys I get the vibe that they dated people bad for them and lacked the skill and maturity to navigate a relationship. They took took relationships that were maybe bad or unfulfilling for them and decided that that's how all relationships are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sent 6years in a toxic relationship but I can acknowledge that it took 2 people to make it bad. I realised afterwards that I was dating people who were wrong for me. Changed my dating habits and ended up with someone completely different to my type. It worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it might not last because people, relationships and feelings change over time. It's great now - we just had a second daughter - but I know if it fails it will be for a number of reasons and I am strong enough to get through that.  And I can have a healthy, loving relationship because I don't worry about getting hurt, being second class in a relationship etc.

       You can but with a lot of limits on time and finances. No thanks. None of my married or LTR male friends were ever able to do what I have done in my life so fair because that would mean an end to their relationships. Not only that, when I spent some time at a Monastery in Tibet, I met an Early 20's kid there who said he was "In Love" and that his "Love" was going to wait for him when he's done with he 3 months at the monastery. When he got back, she was with someone else. Women have zero loyalty unfortunately, because everything is feelings and attention based

       Have you seen the film Kapurush (1965) by Satyjit Ray? It deals with this subject very directly. I'd like to see a remake w Michael Cera...

       I realize youre considering it to be a western issue -and perhaps the director shows some of that western impact on modernizing bengali life - but it features a short chubby alpha in the role of the rebounded's husband and he is nothing close to a beta.

       I feel this whole male/logical - female/emotional dichotomy is deep root that goes way beyond current social programming.  But it's true that men today have been encouraged to fantasize about a "logical life", really a twisted inversion of Alan Turings original parlor game for identifying "man" from his opposite (female).  And women too have been invited into this fantasy, but for women it's different because having womb means in reality you don't actually have to pay back the bank for your supply chips.   For women "reason" isn't a game of probability it's genetic, and today in a very literal sense "reason" just isn't able to conceive this fully.

       Of course it does. At the very least, its supposed to be both parents raising the child, the father imbuing logic, lessons, mechanical skills, manhood into the sons, and strength, self esteem, and protection for the daughters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mother is supposed to imbue emotion, love, passion, feeling safe and love into both.
      </p>
      <p>
       If either parent is not there, you start to find imbalances from the children. For example my sister didnt have her father since she was 6, so when she got older she dated an old ass dude 20 years older than her and he played to father role, until he passed away from cancer. After that, she had closure that the "Father figure passed" and after that she started dating in her age range

       Exactly, that's the underlying imperative in women, to be impregnated by the Alpha tall muscle douche who has the best looks (just like in nature, the Alpha buck fights off all the others for his chance to mate and pass down his genes) thing is, these Alphas are not sticking around to raise the kid and be providers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So women end up with lower/lesser mates that they convince to be providers and fathers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all wiring for the most part, and when you become aware that women's imperatives are due to unconscious programming, then it gives you the upper hand not get caught up in any traps where you feel stuck or imprisoned

       I suppose, but I found out that foreign women, especially from Eastern Europe, have much of what you are looking for, which are pretty much what I look for, as well. Women from more of the Western world, are for the most part, exactly as you described in the OP.

       again you can answer the question.  what's the gender breakdown percentage-wise of people in your role?
      </p>
      <p>
       the existence of gender bigotry doesn't just happen thru policy.  it happens by virtue of who is hired to implement policy.  it happens by virtue of who writes policy (and you may see that this too has a gender bias in it).
      </p>
      <p>
       i get that your intentions maybe are good.  but your bias is clear.  your words speak quite loudly.  that you can't understand this or intentionally ignore it because admission of such a thing is quite telling, is itself quite telling.
