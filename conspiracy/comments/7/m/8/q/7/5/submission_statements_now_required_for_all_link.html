        As previously announced
       </a>
       ,
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       link posts must now include a personalized Submission Statement written by OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Link posts lacking this Statement will be removed after 20 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7kwma5/submission_statements_to_be_required_for_all_link/drjd56f/">
        Here are some tips
       </a>
       for writing an effective Submission Statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       This new rule is lucky #13:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Submission Statements are required for link posts. Link posts without a Statement will be removed after 20 minutes.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This rule is being tested on a trial basis. Ideally, it will cut down on spam/troll posts by compelling OP to not only prove his humanity, but to show that OP is actively and constructively engaging with this community.
      </p>

       Great! But I think the proposed method is pretty complicated. I'd just post the link and comment from the post itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does an OP have to include
      </p>
      <p>
       "Submission Statement:"
      </p>
      <p>
       before his statement or can he just comment his thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Will the link post be removed if the statement is deemed insufficient by mods or can he amend his comment if needed?

       Yes. It will help both the mods and the users.

      <p>
       Yes, but with an important caveat: The Statement is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a test of grammar/reading comprehension.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Statement should hopefully serve as evidence that OP is real and attempting to genuinely engage with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Poorly written Statements should suffer the same fate as any poorly written title/post in the past: it will be rightfully downvoted by the community and will require little or no moderation.

       Since this is such a new system, I see no reason why users shouldn't be given a chance to edit/fix their statement. However, consistently poor efforts may result in warnings and eventual bans.

       Wouldn't it be scary if that was the very idea?  There's plenty of mods too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody knows that you don't need to explain why certain articles have been posted.  We know plenty of the particular themes that you'll find in conspiracy sites and forums whether we follow them or not.  Stuff about surveillance ties in and doesn't need to be spelled out.  If we think something is irrelevant, we can just downvote and move on.  If enough people downvote, it disappears as it's meant to.  Nobody's going to run out of any ink and it's always been perfectly easy to flick through a few pages till you've got to postings you've already read.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy - When did you start letting people tell you when to make written
       <strong>
        statements?
       </strong>
       on top of the ones your articles were making to me loud and clear anyway?  In these times and the way things are going, I thought you all might be more wary of demands like that.  Are the people who forced this on us really acting in our interest?  What do you really think? 
Remember - You just lost the right to post articles that speak for themselves to people who understand the language.  Sometimes, for whatever reason, you might want to do it that way.

       It doesn't really need to be effective, it just needs to be original (not copy/pasted) and needs to demonstrate that the OP knows something about their post and why the subreddit should care about it.  If people want to post shitty submission statements and get downvoted then that's up to them.

       So basically what you're saying is that in the end the submission statement has little to no bearing over the actual reception of the intended message and is just a road block to ensure free and open discussions are filtered through the moderators approval? Because they way you ended your statement sounds an awful lot like how it used to be before all of this nonsense. You know, where people could make up their own minds as what to believe or not, what links to click on, what stories interest them... But noe nobody has to worry about that because the mod team is deciding for you whether or not your message should be heard.

      <p>
       What's that? No Submission Statement?

       Explain, specifically, how the mod team "is deciding for you whether or not your message should be heard".  If you include a submission statement, your message can be heard.  If you don't, it gets removed.  Nothing subjective about that.

       Because upvoting and downvoting is obviously still a reddit feature and will still be utilized for posts and submission statements.  Not sure what you're even asking.
      </p>
      <p>
       And asking for a couple of sentences explaining why your submission is relevant and why people should care is "draconian"? lol, talk about a massive exaggeration.  What is draconian about it?  It takes about 30 seconds of effort.

       The rule isn't going to eliminate spam entirely.  No rule would.  The idea is to limit it as much as possible, and so far it's done that to some degree.  Do you have a solution that will eliminate 100% of spam instantly?  If so I would love to hear it.

       Why does what function the same?  The front page of the sub today is already a huge improvement over the front page of the sub three days ago.  I wouldn't call it the same at all, if that's what you mean - though I'm not really sure what you mean because your entire comment is just vague complaints/questions.

       So since voting is "easily manipulated" we should then place blind faith in the infallible mod team? 
Because they've never been manipulative before... they've never gone out of their way to hide and destroy opinions they didn't like...
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the reason you think the front page is so great the past three days is because it's been flooded with self congratulatory pats on the back one after another. How would anyone know it's better when it's now flooded with this new bullshit? I stated before this whole thing comes off like when radio guys try and pull the "well management loves the new direction of the show"... That's all well and good but the people who listen don't. They think it's shit. There's front page posts with hundreds of upvotes stating the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no vote on this, it was implemented one day over night and everyone was supposed to just fall in line and follow suit or have your post removed in 20 minutes. Did you ever stop to think that maybe not everybody spends their entire day on Reddit? Maybe people post something and then just piss off back to the real world and don't ever think of Reddit again for hours or days... "Well it's all on the sidebar" Yeah, the sidebar that doesn't appear on mobile... The way that probably 75% of people access Reddit...
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it retarding free speech and thought? By placing a road block in fucking highway! You set up a new hoop to jump through, told as few people about it as possible, then imposed a 20 minute ultimatum less your post be destroyed. And all this is for the sake of what? Saving your eyeballs from having to decide whether or not a story is true by yourself instead of having some nameless, faceless keyboard warrior on a power trip make that decision for you?
 Over the last two years this place has become a total fucking shit show and this is just the latest in a long list of draconian bullshit coming out of this sub's supposed moderators.  So how long before this submission statement is revised and you have to jump through a new set of hoops to prove your conspiracy fits in with all the others? And who decides what conspiracies fit and which don't? Slippery slope you're setting up for everyone here...
      </p>
      <p>
       Either everything is okay to talk about or nothing is. Plain and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       But go on, keep pushing the corporate line about how great everything is and how much everyone there just loves it... it doesn't come off as the least bit disingenuous or condescending...

       No, saving the sub from a flood of shitposting and spamming.  There were users who would post a dozen Donald Trump tweets a day, for example, and just farm upvotes while never participating in the thread.  There were spam bots that would just post random links from blogs and never participate in the threads.  The entire front page was political shitposts for months.  That's what this rule is meant to mitigate, and it's doing a pretty decent job so far if you just look at the front page today compared to Monday.

       "Corporate line"?  I'm telling you my personal opinion on how the rule is going so far and you can read lots of other opinions from the user base who agree with me.  I don't need to make up the fact that the response has been positive overall, you can just look at the threads discussing it.  And it's pretty ironic you would say I'm being disingenuous and condescending when all you've done in this chain of replies is put words in my mouth while dripping condescension.

       You sir or madam are absolutely one of the finest cherry pickers I've ever seen. How about you address one of the problems I've brought up directly and not with another question or a blow off. Everyone can see what you're doing. You're avoiding the subject at all costs and deflecting at every opportunity. You play the constant victim but you put yourself in this role. Keep telling yourself that everyone loves the new system, ignore the dozens of threads of complaints, ignore the thousands of comments pointing out the glaring flaws in this situation.

       "We posted a sticky" Who the fuck reads stickies? 99% of the time it's just some bullshit ramblings about goings on within the group and is boring as fuck. And stickies don't always appear on mobile, once again something your team didn't take into consideration. NOW back to the sticky itself: Unless it has a title like "URGENT! LIFE ALTERING CHANGES TO THE BOARD! CLICK HERE NOW!" or some shit, it's just lost in all the other garbage of stickies you see on boards that are just left there for months and mean diddly. So like I said, you delivered the message to as few people as possible but just enough to be able to say that you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I pulled that number out of my ass just like you've been pulling "we love our new hoops to jump through" garbage out of yours.
      </p>

       You complain about propaganda being pushed all the while pushing your own. Yet somehow the irony is lost on you.. There's that cognitive dissonance problem popping up again.

      <p>
       Now answer the questions and quit playing the dumb victim role. Nobody is buying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about a submission statement from every member of the mod team as to why they deserve to stay on as a mod. You want us to prove our points worthy of being heard. Then you should stand up and lead by example. State yourself, your motives, your goals as a moderator, why we should trust you, and why you should be allowed the power you have. And this requirement should be enforced every six months. That is truly the only way to police this board or any board for that matter. You can't lead by blind faith alone.

       My motive and goal is to make the sub a place where users can discuss outside the box ideas with other like minded people, and to keep the sub free of trolls, shills, spammers, bots, and the like.  I'm "allowed" this power because I was chosen to be a mod by users of the sub a few years ago, as were most of the other current mods.  Being a reddit moderator really doesn't grant one much power FYI.

       Like which ones? Gee, I don't know, how about the other 3 or 4 comment threads filled with questions that you just slid right past and instead of answering anything you just ask a new question that leads the conversation where you want to go... Anyone who wants to take the time and actually read this thread can see what I'm talking about. But no, you help prove my exact point about this entire submission statement being subjective. You decided to not read into anything I said and just pushed through spewing the same tired lines as every other new product pushing mod on here. Do you all work on commission?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah being a mod comes with so little power... only the ability to silence, shadow ban and outright ban anyone whom they see fit at any time for any made up reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chosen by which users? Were those "users" also mods? There seems to be a real "you pat my back and I'll pat yours" thing going on with the mods on nearly every board. An echo chamber of know it all egomaniacs who think they alone should be able to control how ideas are spread...

       I get what this submission statement is aiming to accomplish but I fear that this idea will soon be twisted and used for nefarious purposes.

       And yes, God forbid anyone say anything controversial against the mods with an actual account. We all know just how well that goes...

       A shill? Now who's putting word in who's mouth? 
Isn't calling someone a shill a ban-able offense? There's those trumped up charges and once again the deeper issue here. The mod team reads into things what they will and has a flair for the dramatic and a heavy hand. Two things that mix about as well as sugar and shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excuse me for trying to bring a smidgen of levity to what could be seen as the first foot on the stepping razor of Orwellian dreams.. I know one of the rules of comedy is to not explain the joke, but I guess some times you've gotta break some rules ;) so here we go: You "work" as a moderator... An employee let's say.. Some employees work on what's known as commission. Commission is made when an employee sells a certain amount of a product. A product like oh, I don't know, hoops let's say. And this hypothetical sales team certainly seems to be pushing hoops awful hard this week. So one might think it would be nice to bring some chuckles to this morose hypothetical New Years party that's going on...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that we've got that out of the way...
I'm not here to play the role of your encyclopedia dramatica. You want to know what questions I want answered? How about you go back through my prior questions and take a look for anytime that you answered my question with a question. Or when you would cherry pick one tiny piece of the actual question I asked and focused on that because you felt more comfortable in your talking points there. I'd like to know how you can prove that beyond a margin of error 99.9% of the people that are being denied their posts to remain up are in fact bots, trolls, spammers, whatever buzz word you want... because if you're not that certain about this then there's a problem. Why must we wait until the mod team has grandly overstepped their bounds when they've shown a history of doing so. This is why I'm "bitching". Not once have I ever said anything about you personally nor have I ever referred to you yourself as the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im simply pointing out the flaws and hypocrisy of this bundle of hoops that have been rolled in shit, covered in sugar, topped with sprinkles and placed on a lovely piece of china for everyone to feast. That's this ball of shit I'm talking about.

       Okay man. It's clear this conversation is going nowhere. You continue thinking the new rule is shit, I'll continue thinking it's been pretty effective, and we'll see who ends up right in the end. I can't waste anymore of my life on this pointless back and forth. If you ever have any specific questions for me of the mods, just shoot me a message or PM the modmail. Cheers and have a happy new year.

       That is certainly
       <em>

       of the intended effect...but honestly we hope it improves the quality (and quantity) of discourse in the comment sections, especially by compelling OP to

       think about why they are sharing it with the

       If we can get people to not blindly post links and actually argument their posts with their own words and take a minute or two to show us what they are posting, it will greatly improve this subreddit. In two main ways:
      </p>
      <p>
       -It will help the community here (reducing spam and shills, but obviously also helping people make better choices on what to click &gt; "Should I check the link or not? Is it worth my time? Let's just check the submission statement and see a summary to find what it's about").
      </p>
      <p>
       -It will help the person posting it (summarizing an article/link and describing things in your own words are wonderful way to deepen critical thinking skills and reflect on what is being said).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this will be great for the sub. A trade-off of quality over quantity in links and thus, hopefully, discussions.

       Bullshit. Its another check and layer to stiffle discussion. This use to be one of the only subs where you could talk about any conspiracy. Now its a censored circlejerk. The same people that use to make fun of this subs userbase with conspiritard etc have hijacked it.

       You could see it that way. And if we had properly crafted titles maybe we wouldn't be here. But really, to me personally, it is about making OP take that extra second to think about what they are posting.

       A title should ideally describe
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       the content of the link is, and the submission statement should explain
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       the content is pertinent to the readers of this sub. Obviously the title can also explain the why, and the statement can also tell some of the what, but this is the general difference. In an ideal world, the title would also explain the why, but in practice this has not always happened, and in some cases it doesn't really fit to explain the relevance in the title.

       This was part of the motivation. Already, it's slowed a lot of a certain type of spam we've been inundated with, where users (likely bots) spam one or two of the same domains with a single focus, but never participate in the discussion.

       You guys need to have something done with the CSS or something to REMIND people.  You've removed two of my posts 12 hours after I posted them, forgetting about this "Submission Statement" rule.  Both posts were VERY VALID CONSPIRACY posts.  Not the usual horse shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've been a contributer here FOR YEARS it's easy to forget something like a Submission Statement put in the comments.  It's a stupid setup.  The link shouldn't be able to be posted UNLESS the statement is put up.  It should be a type of field validation.  This is a terrible way to try and enforce the rule.  And it's also pretty shitty to delete someone's post(s) 12 hours later.

       We're working on the CSS so that you're given a little text reminder before submitting a link.  Also going to hopefully have a bot set up to crawl posts and auto-remove any that don't have a statement within the first 20-30 minutes.  Right now it's all being done manually while we work out those kinks though so that's why some posts were left up longer than they should have been without statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've had two posts removed but I bet when you go to post the next one you'll remember, and if not that one then you will for the one after that.  Changes always take a bit of time to get used to.

       The sub has been full of shitposts and spam for the last few years and it's only getting worse.  That's the reason this rule now exists.  Sorry to see you go if you go, but losing a couple of real users is a price we may have to pay to get rid of most of the serial spammers.

       Exactly this.

      <p>
       Remember, this is how they killed Reddit:
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/6zz7zu/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver_40/">
        /r/conspiracy/comments/6zz7zu/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver_40/

       does anyone know of another forum or website where we can talk freely on the subject of conspiracies and the like? I am afraid this one has become unusable.

       I don't think so. If you post a link, I should have some context of what you are posting or why. It is a reasonable request and not a censor at all. In fact it will encourage redditors to post explanations of what they are attempting to bring to light with their links.

       I guess I'm wondering who gets to decide what is actually a conspiracy? I have see people asking "how is this a conspiracy" on threads I believe are conspiracies. Politicians being bought by corporations, conspiracy. Media pushing certain narratives while ignoring other facts, conspiracy. Campaigns hiring people to pretend they are regular people to push narratives online, conspiracy. Nestle pumping water from a drought stricken area for free, conspiracy. Regulatory capturing, conspiracy. Company engineering in a cheat so their vehicles pass envision tests, conspiracy. Hospitals and drug companies being allowed to charge whatever the fuck they want because in some cases no medical care is about the same as a loaded gun to a persons head, conspiracy. our food being garbage, conspiracy.

       If that's the case why do you need an entire thread to lay this out? Why is any clarification needed? You just summarized the whole thing in one sentence. Why didn't you do that in the original post?

       How is it not subjective when you're using langauge like "Here are some tips for writing an effective Submission Statement." Tell me who is determining what is an "effective" submission statement and how that is not subjective?

       As exemplified by the fact that you need and entire thread to lay out the rule and talk about what it will and won't be used for. It starts here, it will morph. Perhaps eventually comments will need approval too? It's clear r/conspiracy was getting too much of a problem as are all online communities who share too much truth. Slowly but surely, reddit, Digg, 4chan are subverted by bigger more powerful agendas. I don't think it's a problem asking people why they think somethings a conspiracy, but when you're using it to censor posts it gets ugly really fast. Open minded discussion does not start with telling someone what they're allowed to contribute and in what form.

       I'm doing my best with the limited time I have for reddit.  Just be sure to use the report button if you see any link posts missing one.  We're working on a script that will check submissions for an OP comment and auto-remove them after a half hour if they don't add one but as of now it's not up and running yet so we're doing it all manually.

       Is it possible to get the submission statements pinned to the top of the top of the comment thread- regardless of downvotes?  I love that you've required these, and it's really nice to see the justification first, even if it's shitty justification.

       So I posted twice a link directly to a tweet from CIA and it says I need to add a submission statement...first It was "I thought CIA always denied the existence of UFO's", after that one was deleted, I posted the same link under the title of "CIA on Twitter: "Trying to photograph a UFO"?" and it also got deleted. This is...I guess r/conspiracy doesn't allow any "Twitter" links...which is stupid if you ask me.

       Hey! So here's your mistake...the submission statement needs to come in the
       <em>
        comment

       section.

       within 20 minutes of posting.

       No quite the opposite. Just a way to keep the shilling down so accounts just cant spam any crap on a daily basis.

       Judging from the modlog, you've been doing a great job enforcing this. I was a bit disillusioned when I posted the above comment but you've turned me around a bit. Thank you.

       Not everyone uses Reddit on a pc. Mobile users don't get a sidebar... Just another thing the mod team here never took into account before enforcing draconian thought crimes.

       So basically what you're saying is that in the end the submission statement has little to no bearing over the actual reception of the intended message and is just a road block to ensure free and open discussions are filtered through the moderators approval? Because they way you ended your statement sounds an awful lot like how it used to be before all of this nonsense. You know, where people could make up their own minds as what to believe or not, what links to click on, what stories interest them... But noe nobody has to worry about that because the mod team is deciding for you whether or not your message should be heard.

       What's that? No Submission Statement? 
"You have 15 minutes to comply or you will be terminated"
Thanks Ed-209!! What did we ever do without you?

       Hey! So here's your mistake...the submission statement needs to come in the
       <em>
        comment
       </em>
       section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is to hinder bots/spammers by requiring OP to write a coherent statement
       <em>
        in the comment section
       </em>
       within 20 minutes of posting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try again, and summarize your post in a sentence or two, but in the comments.

       I guess I'm wondering who gets to decide what is actually a conspiracy? I have see people asking "how is this a conspiracy" on threads I believe are conspiracies. Politicians being bought by corporations, conspiracy. Media pushing certain narratives while ignoring other facts, conspiracy. Campaigns hiring people to pretend they are regular people to push narratives online, conspiracy. Nestle pumping water from a drought stricken area for free, conspiracy. Regulatory capturing, conspiracy. Company engineering in a cheat so their vehicles pass envision tests, conspiracy. Hospitals and drug companies being allowed to charge whatever the fuck they want because in some cases no medical care is about the same as a loaded gun to a persons head, conspiracy. our food being garbage, conspiracy.

       Thanks, Butt--Queef.  Your opinion is really important to me, especially since it's clear you're a truly valued member of this community based on the zero comments/posts you've made to the sub.
