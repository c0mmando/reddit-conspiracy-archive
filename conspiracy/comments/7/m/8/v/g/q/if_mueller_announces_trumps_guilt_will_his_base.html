       First, Mueller will not announce "guilt".  He may indict the president for crimes, or he may present his findings to DOJ/congress, and this may include crimes he believes the president committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, he would not and cannot impeach the president, that is the job of congress, and they may or may not do so based on what Mueller presents them with, if anything.

       Third, I think Morell's point of view, former head of the CIA and someone who supported HRC, is probably what we're going to see:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Morell: So, let’s talk about what I think the possibilities are, going forward.
        <strong>
         So, I would not be surprised if Bob Mueller concludes that the Trump campaign did not violate the law with regard to its interactions with the Russians. I’m really open to that possibility. Why? Because, as you know, The New York Times, The Washington Post, every media outlet that is worth its salt has reporters digging into this, and they haven’t found anything.  And I think that, had there been something there, they would have found something. And I think Bob Mueller would have found it already and it would have leaked
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        So, I’m really open to the possibility that there’s no there there on a crime being committed by the campaign and the Russians. Right? That interaction leading to criminal charges.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second point I’d make is that I wouldn’t be surprised if there were single individuals who were associated with the campaign who violated the law with respect to their interactions with the Russians on the election. Paul Manafort comes to mind. I think he has little to no integrity. There’s no way you spend that much time with the old Ukrainian government and not bump up against Russian intelligence officers a lot. 
I wouldn’t be surprised if there were single individuals who faced criminal charges here with regard to their interactions with the Russians, and Paul Manafort’s a possibility.
        <strong>
         But that’s different than a conspiracy by the campaign, right?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The third thing I’d say is, every FBI investigation that I’ve ever had visibility into or been involved in, the people who they’re looking at actually don’t end up getting charged with the crime they were being investigated for. They get charged with something else. Right? And that something else in this case could be the laundering of Russian organized crime funds. And if that was done by the Trump organization—if that was done knowingly—it’s a criminal violation.
       </p>
       <p>
        If it was done unwittingly, because you didn’t do the due diligence that’s required under U.S. law for where the money is coming from, from overseas—it’s a civil penalty. And the Trump organization gets fined. What the politics of all that is, I have no idea. That’s the third thing I’d say.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fourth thing I’d say is, the obstruction of justice issue. In my view, when I read the statute, boy, it looks—you know, it looks like you could make a case. Now, the hard part is intent. Right? You have to intend to violate the statute. You have to intend to obstruct justice. That’s the difficult piece to prove here.
       </p>
       <p>
        You need something on paper, or you need somebody who heard the president say something about what he was trying to do here, or you need him to tell you that. Right? Well, he’s not going to do that. And so, while it looks like it to all of us, that that’s what he was trying to do—you’ve got to get to that intent part, and that’s what’s hard from a criminal perspective.
       </p>

       I really don't think that will go well. This will probably end up being the reason people start killing each other in the streets, either way. Both sides are convinced beyond reason and are have been carefully prepared for violence.

       actually most of the DEMOcrats are being lied to by the media and their establishment and refuse to hear any other side.  They will start a skirmish and get squashed and the DEMOcratic leaders will use that event to make the rest of the nation pay.

       I think the mass rioting is planned if Mueller is fired.  That's what Eric Holder and others in the DNC have been threatening for a few weeks now.

       Yep. If this doesn’t pan out the way they want it they will move to plan B. Disrupt this presidency by any means necessary. They have been doing this since Nov. 9th. Look at Loretta Lynch calling for

Our events include everything from rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes. The biggest qualification is enthusiasm, a ‘can-do’ spirit.

       Crowds on Demand is a real company. It was founded in 2012 by UCLA graduate Adam Swart.

       "I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background."
      </p>
      <p>
       The video was taken at 3:30pm on South Canal Street in Chicago on Saturday. As our reader points out, hundreds of the participants that took part in the downtown Chicago protests from November 12 were bused in using these vehicles. Other arrived by train.

       He won't announce if Trump is guilty or not since that's not his job. His job is to collect evidence and present the findings to the head of the DOJ and makes a recommendation on whether the head should indict or not, based on the evidence.

       But you already know the answer to your rhetorical question. It will be the same as the anti-Hillary folks not moving on after Comey didn't recommend charges being brought against her.

       Some will, some never will. Put the shoe on the other foot-- Hillary wins and a Republican special council investigates her and finds nothing in the end. "It's a cover up," "rampant bias," "partisan conclusions." The argument will always be possible if Trump gets off, not that there's real merit to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please acknowledge one does not have to be "anti-Trump" to think there's something to all this and all the Team Trump lies. Just as one doesn't have to be "pro-Trump" to believe there's nothing really to the investigation.

       You know protest are organized right? Why would I walk down my street with a protest sign when I can drive to the city and meet up with 100s or 1000s of other protestors to make the protest more noticeable? No one care about a couple people standing on a street corner but 1000s walking down the streets of a major city gets peoples attention.

       At this point he really doesn’t have a chance at convincing
       <em>

       who isn’t already convinced no matter what he concludes.

       Think about all the conflicts of interest already exposed among the FBI and his team.  If this was a normal court case, there is no way
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       prosecutor would even bother with it because the investigation has been so ineptly compromised it would guarantee a mistrial or dismissal.

       Mueller’s team has no credibility at this point.

       If they do find something it’s going to be some other crime publicly. If it did come out that the current potus did commit treason knowingly with a foreign nation, the implications would be felt globally. Stock markets would take a dive, relationships from other nations would be instantly gone. Hell, a lot of people would flip out and do some dumb shit.

       The public trial would be a distraction. He’d be convicted in  that one, and because of his wealth, be put on house arrest. After that trial he’ll have the real one. But the public will not know about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would mess up too much shit if it comes out with  what they found. That’s my take at least.
