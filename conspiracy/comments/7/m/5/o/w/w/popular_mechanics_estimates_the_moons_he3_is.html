       So since mostly we are a capitalist society, we should have mines ALL over the moon right now in 2017, since 12 humans have been there already, and had the tech then, and should be advanced tech now, no? It is like teaching a toddler to learn the alphabet but when they are teens they are still learning the alphabet. This makes no sense. The human spirit is not like that.

       IM HUMBLE O - we've never ever been and it is one GIANT hoax. They know this is one giant hoax and they know as more time moves on it will get more difficult to cover the deception. Hence 21 trillion to make some grand deception like fake aliens disclosure, fake AI God or shit like that

       Clint Mansell did the score on that. He has done the scores for all of Darren Aronofsky's movies as well. The Fountain's score is my favorite. Check it out if you haven't already!

       That movie was SO FUCKED UP. When they were carrying the baby through the crowd and it was wailing in terror, its piss spraying all over the place in panic, right before we hear the neck snap, I was like---this was made my fucked up satanists.

       The problem isn't that we've never been to the moon, but that we don't have the infrastructure to utilize quantities of the isotope to make it worthwhile. Although we
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       have fusion reactors in every state, every city for that matter, the money isn't there because the general public (which includes the politicians) just isn't educated enough to believe it's a good idea. Then there's a metric shit tonne of corporate propaganda to perpetuate the idea that fusion reactors are just little Chernobyls waiting to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think we should be getting 20% of our energy as a country from fusion reactors, but I'm well aware of being in the minority on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if this is the best reason you have to believe we didn't go to the moon, it's not good enough. And you believe both that the Earth is flat AND we didn't go to the moon, please do us all a favor and learn what evidence is and how to evaluate it.

       It seems that there are a lot of lazy thinkers out there who jump on board whatever "conspiracy theory" they hear about with only the most cursory research on the subject in question. It's not a stretch of imagination or an outlandish assumption that those predisposed to unfounded nonsense about the moon are also predisposed to believe unfounded nonsense about a number of subjects.

       Oh, some of us aren't a fan of NASA but also don't believe the earth is flat. Maybe you shouldn't put those two together, kinda like putting 9/11 and flat earth together. It discredits it.

       I'm not saying we haven't, but they lied during the those years. The doc a funny trick on the way to the moon I believe has em floating in orbit trying to make it loop like there further from earth my covering up windows. I love the idea of space exploration, but why does NASA need to get caught lying so many times?

       Armstrongs return from the moon was nothing but bizarre, he barely talked and when he did he had a bunch of goons around him making sure he didn't go off pace.

       If you told me we never went to the moon, or if you said we didn't  go in the 60's but we've been a bunch of times now without the people knowing, well I wouldn't know what to believe. Fool me once shame on you, fool me.... do the point where I'm just here thinking only time will tell what actually is going on, and hopefully it's everything the MSM actually tells us.

       The "news" is a constant mix of truth/fiction/editorial opinion and omission. It is a constant task to separate these. The history of media is a history of propaganda, however, that doesn't mean everything ever said on tv is a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the "coverage" of Saddam Hussain from 2001-2002. It was non-stop saber-rattling from every outlet available. Why? Because defense contractors OWN the media. They stood to make a shit tonne of cash from dropping ordinance, truth be damned. If you already knew this, well, that's why they have to fake so much shit.

       As for the moon landings, there certainly were some reasons to make the Russians believe we had done so, even if we didn't. So I think there were backup plans for the event that our mission(s) there failed. However, by all evidence, it appears we did in fact put a man on the moon and get him back home.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were good enough evidence to the contrary, please share it. I haven't seen it.

       Fusion energy isn't a public perception problem imo. It's just technologically hard to do. They just achieved a net positive energy gain with Wendelstein 7-X, but it was extremely small. To be viable for mass production it needs to increase by a factor of 1000.

       As far as I understand on nuclear energy (roommate was a nuclear physicist and I studied the basics as a MechE), is that fission reactions are a lot tougher to stop and to cool then theoretical fusion reactions. Fission reactor rods are extremely hot, producing steam, which drives the turbines. They can be shut off safely in the event of an emergency, but the rods keep emitting heat so water still needs to be recycled. With that being said, there are tons of fail-safes in the event of a catastrophe. Fukishima was an older design and they were not able to keep the influx of water coming in, creating the disaster that it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I'm aware, fusion is much easier to control (granted with the right design), and can be stopped much quicker. This is from word of mouth knowledge though, and I haven't looked into it extensively.

       If satellites that orbit the moon at only 50 km without an atmosphere can only produce little pixels and blobs on NASA images .. Why can satellites 400-500kms above earth WITH an atmosphere produce images like the worldview images below. Something's amiss.

       If we can image a yacht on earth we should easily see one of the 6 lunar landers on the moon.

       LRO imagery had a maximum resolution of 50cm/pixel while the image you provided has a resolution of 30cm (this is calculated after the orbital altitude is considered, so the LRO being closer to surface than the earth satellite does not mean it will have a higher resolution).
      </p>
      <p>
       From the picture you supplied, I estimated one of the yachts is about 33 pixels long which results in a real life length of ~10 meters (matches up with average yacht size from a google search)
      </p>
      <p>
       From
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Apollo_12_landing_site_imaged_by_LRO%2C_2011.jpg">
        this picture
       </a>
       , the intrepid descent stage is about 16 pixels long, which results in a real life length of 8 meters while the Apollo module is actually 9.4m wide/long.
      </p>
      <p>
       One explanation for the difference in resolution is that the LRO had many many other instruments and equipment (power has to be management and distributed between all of them), while satellites that only take images of the earth, only do that. Also, there is probably not enough incentive to send a satellite to the moon just to get a small increase in image resolution, as what we have now is sufficient.

       LRO pictures? If someone disbelieves that NASA went to the Moon, why would they believe their satellite pictures of the Moon? If you do believe them, then you agree with them when they say there is no telescope on earth that can see any evidence of the Moon Landing, including equipment and tracks.

       Good thing they put those arrows in the picture. I'm genuinely fascinated that someone can look at those pictures and be convinced that they are actually seeing a flag and equipment just because an arrow points to a pixel and the government tells them they are really seeing a flag where there is none.

       If there are 4 lights but the authorities tell you there are 5, will you say 5 or believe your own eyes? I'd wager you'd say 5.

       Ok, I got time to reply now. 1. Never said the picture were legit, only said they exist and I provided a link to support that. 2. Your comment does nothing to discredit the images. Nowhere did I say someone could be convinced that those images are real, but I will say you comment does nothing to convince me they aren't real.

       I was watching Nasa's unexplained files on Science network the other night. I forget the exact episode, but they were discussing having photos of an object that looked like it was about to crash into a asteroid. One of the speculations was that it could be a mining company attempting to land a mineral miner on an asteroid. Apparently there are plenty of people who see the potential in this and are working on it.

       They didn't fuck up astronauts either, apparently. They sailed right through the van Allen belts and didn't feel a thing. They all lived to old age, too, no cancer. It's almost as if they didn't go through the deadly radiation belts.

       From the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">
        Wikipedia entry on the Van Allen Belts
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners.[31] The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them.
        <strong>
         Apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely
        </strong>
        , and only passed through the thinner areas of the outer belts.[25][32]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Astronauts' overall exposure was actually dominated by solar particles once outside Earth's magnetic field.
       <strong>
        The total radiation received by the astronauts
       </strong>
       varied from mission to mission but
       <strong>
        was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity.
       </strong>
       [31]
      </p>
      <p>
       As a radiation worker, I get about 2 rems per year (DDE, Deep Dose Equivalent, which measures radiation to the central mass). This is well acceptable. And it's understandable that they didn't receive that much. There are 3 main factors in radiation exposure:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Time
       </li>
       <li>
        Distance
       </li>
       <li>
        Shielding
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       By by-passing the inner belt, they avoided the most concentrated radiation exposure threat. The speed of travel gave them an advantage as well. Do you not believe these radiation exposure numbers provided? You think they made them up as well? Why not give a bigger number if they're just making it up?

       I worked with ionizing radiation as well. The belt figures are all over the map, here's one I found and I'll tell you what, I would nope out of a trip through this: The description of the Van Allen radiation belts of Smolders seems to be very clear:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The radiation dose in these belts is between 75 and 100 roentgen per second - but not more than 15 to 20 roentgen are acceptable per day. So the dose in the belts is lethal. This is the reason why the Soviets have objections against higher orbits."
      </p>

       For sure, it sounds risky as hell. When numbers like 400 MeV protons come up as possibilities, it makes me cringe. There was an incident about 3 years ago where a couple of guys slept with an open source in their room. (I believe they were checking pipeline corrosion, but not positive.) Over the course of the night, they received a dose of about 50-60 REM--from a fairly large Cs source. Not sure what happened to them, but a medical physicist I work with said they were probably dead.

       The assumption above is based entirely on adequate shielding and estimates of radiation and time. The exterior of Saturn V would not likely have provided the adequate shielding. The shielding the lunar module had to block the radiation was a few sheets of aluminum foil (imagine building a fallout shelter with aluminum foil). Once past the belts and especially on the lunar surface, the space suits were even worse than the spacecraft. If the radiation from the Sun didn't spell doom for the astronauts, then the 200+ degrees of heat would have.

       I think they made the whole mission up from soup to nuts, and I think your reliance on wikipedia's take on the missions, an obviously controlled information site, tells me all I need to know about how much of the official narrative you believe.

       This is where some Bayesian logic comes in handy: is it more reasonable that NASA made the entire thing up, and all the accompanying lies and people who must lie in order to make that lie hold or did we actually go to the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I think we agree that NASA had backup plans to sell the idea of having been to the moon, in the event they failed. That, to me, is reasonable given the backdrop of nuclear war and the race for ICBMs. However, to have faked the moon video from any of these missions relies on the idea that many engineers, administration and general staff would have gone along with this plan. Aside from the technical difficulty of faking moon video footage, it's simply not believable that all these people would have played along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has there been anyone who was part of these missions break their silence on the moon landing and confess that it was all a hoax and that all the evidence for the missions was faked?

       You want logic, how about a false dilemma? What is the common element in both of the following sentences? "NASA can go to the Moon, and it did." and "NASA can go to the Moon but didn't." Did you catch it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they couldn't go to the Moon, for whatever insurmountable reason, then they didn't have much choice did they? What you call backup plans is what everyone saw. The technical difficulty of this farce paled in comparison to the difficulty of actually going, and they failed at overcoming dozens of aspects of that difficulty, which is why it is probably the most talked about hoax in history.

       It's called compartmentalization. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Only few top masons would be involved in knowing the full truth. They and their secret are insulated by
       <em>
        truth's protective layers

       . I'll let you imagine the other confirmed ways the government agencies have to control people and the truth. You are on r/conspiracy and you believe the government would never harm anyone. That would be funny if it wasn't deadly serious.

       This is exactly the mentality that allows people to fall for all kinds of dumb shit. Just because a liar lies
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       mean they cannot tell the truth about anything, ever. That is the primary mistake that "all-or-nothing" conspiracy theorists here make. They think because the govt lied about MKULTRA and 911 and JFK, that they must have lied about going to the moon. But that logic is faulty.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only a liar
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       lied. Then it would be easy to tell truth from fiction. But real life, as you're well aware, doesn't work that way. The only way to sift the truth from the bullshit is to do the work. So, what evidence can you show that's strong enough to dismiss all the evidence for the moon landing?

       It's also worth noting that He3 wasn't as highly valued in 1970 as it is today. Also, it's not like they are just landing on the moon and sweeping the stuff into duffle bags, they would have to set up extraction and processing facilities there as well, which would have been enormously costly and time consuming.

       Anyone else find it ironic that Boeing now suddenly wants to beat Elon to Mars? They've had 60 years to beat him but now only suddenly they're actually interested.

       There's also probably massive realizations that if a company were to explore space for resources, the entire economy would collapse because capitalism REQUIRES scarcity to function. Can't have profit in a world of abundance.

       Well, and you know, capitalism. It's free PR. No big aerospace company wants to lose to a relatively new start-up  (granted that spaceX is not really a start-up now, but it's still new to the game). If they beat SpaceX, that means potentially new government contracts and more press.

       OR along similar lines, the motives have changed. Before anyone had been, there was international incentive to show other nations you could. Now that we know what's up there, incentive is to downplay our urgency to get back.

       IOW, we've been, we know what's worth farming. If we make a big show about flying up there every week, we'd create a new space race with other nations competing for our resources.

       Not surprised if you all missed it with the way shills will bury any promising news coming out of this current administration, but Trump recently announced plans to return to the moon. I'd drop a link but there are no many it's better if anyone interested runs their own search and chooses accordingly.

       Edit: I agree that the recent talk of alien disclosure is just smoke in mirrors. Anything to prevent people from asking why we haven't been "back" to the moon or why all pictures of earth from space are CGI cartoons.

       As far as I understand on nuclear energy (roommate was a nuclear physicist and I studied the basics as a MechE), is that fission reactions are a lot tougher to stop and to cool then theoretical fusion reactions. Fission reactor rods are extremely hot, producing steam, which drives the turbines. They can be shut off safely in the event of an emergency, but the rods keep emitting heat so water still needs to be recycled. With that being said, there are tons of fail-safes in the event of a catastrophe. Fukishima was an older design and they were not able to keep the influx of water coming in, creating the disaster that it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I'm aware, fusion is much easier to control (granted with the right design), and can be stopped much quicker. This is from word of mouth knowledge though, and I haven't looked into it extensively.
