       And yes you can say Trump is part of the 1% but really, from his actions this year, and THEIR actions this year, he doesn't seem to be on their side, at this moment in time.

       Point being. This is just about Good vs Evil, not about party ideology, race, or agenda. It's just them vs us. And I have faith many of us are inherently good. So why not use POTUS (because of his PRESENT actions) for the time being to kill off the sick elites for good this time. We have a great opportunity after what we thought was no chance for him to be in power.

       Cannot copy paste from a title. But OP did say..

      <p>
       "Can we 99% grow up,stop being divided and fight back"
      </p>
      <p>
       Your statement is why we will never make any progress in making this country great for anyone but the elites. It does not matter the puppet. Obama gave billions to the banks who did nothing for us with it. An if people like OP are attempting to bridge a gap and people like you come around an immediately dismiss the message i quoted above we will get nowhere.

       We do not need to support any puppets this one included. In my opinion we need to vote every single politician who currently hold office in DC out and start fresh with a younger more in touch group of diverse people that actually represent the American people and have not been bought out by the corporations. To me the beauty of life is we as a whole will never fully agree on anything which is great cause it keeps life interesting. But if we can put partisan issues aside for just 1 election cycle we can end this circlejerk of whose gang is better the Crips or the bloods, when it has been proven time and time again the puppet does not matter the rich will get tax cuts and we get fucked.

       Not with that attitude.  there are plenty of people who still believe their votes count. So I suspect 2 things could come of this. 1 being we get rid of all the shitty politicians who have been bought by corporations and care only for this rich. or everyone learns the vote does not actually count and we finally revolt. Peacefully of course.

       The good thing about the Trump era is that everyone was paying attention to politics last year. I was the only of my friends who had an interest for politics, now we're all debating each other at dinner. Even if we don't ageee with each other, at least people are talking about it more and to me that's a step in the right direction

       The bullshit is going to happen whether you get mad at it or not. A lot of people before you and even me have focused on a lot of government corruption and bullshit. An the only that happens is the color of the gang gets changed. The rich and corporations are favored over us. So yeah, let's not waste out time or energy bitching about things we cannot change. Instead let us focus our time and energy on making an actual change in November. Focus our energies on exposing the government agents who would actively try to infiltrate this movement and derail it so they can keep their scams going. Just my opinion.

       I did not read OP's full statement. my textrectile dysfunction kicked in when I saw the 99% line an I got excited. Then I saw one of the first few comments attacking trump. An due to the current status of this sub, one has to wary of those types of comments (not defending the trump) an their intentions. I would have said the same thing has someone made a hillary comment or any partisan comment.

       Trumps policies are very good for the elite and very bad for the common person.  He has expanded CIA drone strike powers, greatly reduced the tax burden on the wealthy(which will eventually lead to a greater economic burden placed upon lower income earners and negatively impact the US's ability to trade), gutted environmental protections, and he's just getting warmed up.  Extreme right wing policies cannot truly be populist - it will lead to more mega-corporations that buy out all of their competition and greater concentrations of extreme individual wealth.  The "99%" cannot organize and fight back when they cannot even understand the basic facts pertaining to the reality of what is unfolding before them.  Trump's policies are intended to rob sub-millionaires blind, and we have people who want to "use Trump as a spearhead" whatever that means.  Trump is just the next step in a logical progression, the next phase of psychologically and sociologically beating the general populace into an impotent lump.  Perhaps if the 99% were to create a movement based upon anti-hierarchical mutual aid and independence, they could start to stand on their own two feet, rendering political apparatuses superfluous and granting common people some semblance of actual power.  Until then, we are at the mercy of the social engineers.  Oh, and all the while that we fiddle-fart around they are dumping billions of dollars into highly advanced technologies that we are not allowed to know anything about.  Psychotronics, brain manipulation, AI, propaganda...they have been researching these topics for a very long time.  Their holy grail is a system whereby they can physically control peoples's minds remotely, and I don't know if they're too far off.

       Just checked your comment history - you're pretty light on the sourcing with your anti-atheist and anti-liberal rants there guy.  What subject would you like to learn more about?  I may be able to point you in the right direction.  We've already seen what massive tax cuts for the elite do to the economy and the deficit - they've run that experiment with Reagan and GW Bush.  The advanced technology stuff can be learned about by reading Delgado or Robert Duncan(though you'll have to put up with some egregious spelling errors.  I think that intel agencies fudge his written work before allowing it to be published).

       Definitely the biggest distraction right now. Probably not in the history of humanity though. Religion comes to mind.

       People are distracted, too, and they would rather criticize their own neighbor than the rich elite.

       They make you believe it is your fault, or that guy's fault, but they never admit to creating the problem.

       Ego and cognitive dissonance are a motherfucker... it's nearly impossible to talk to anyone anymore without sounding condescending or combative... even at length. Your partisan bullshit is not appreciated. Nothing is real. Esp not trump. Uniting has jack squat to do with the nonsense that comes through these screens. Separating the nonsense that comes through these screens from the nuggets has never been harder. Finding anything outside of the screens has never been harder... you're part of the problem like it or not

      <p>
       I don’t believe that any candidate will bring about that revolution. Normal people will. I don’t think that revolution will involve a leader the way you think about a leader. Bernie would’ve been as close as we can hope for, and they blatantly replaced him with their candidate. They did it obviously, and then basically acted like “yeah, what are you gonna do about it?”
      </p>
      <p>
       And guess what?  No one did anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, go ahead and cast your vote in the next election for Trump. Keep believing in the system. Keep believing in the 2 carefully crafted candidates you’ll be offered. You seriously think the 1% will actually give you a choice that matters for the POTUS? If you want the change you’re talking about, you need to realize that both sides are in on it. Trump is not your friend. He doesn’t give a fuck about you. That should be clear to anyone paying attention.

       Great job unifying the country buddy.  Keep doing exactly what Trump and the people who control him wanted you to.  Just alienate anyone who disagrees with you, I'm sure that'll work out.

       Stop being intentionally abrasive.  You act like there were a dozen presidential candidates who had chances of winning. 
You came here to shit on Trump. Then you started derailing. Just stop. We don't care.

       Something the human race has never been able to over come is that the 1% are the same as the 99%, but they have money and power. The 99% can make all the claims they want to morality, equality, etc., but at the end of the day they are just as much a bunch of swine as the 1%. People have always been attracted to the "us and them", "good and evil"(...dichotomies in general), yet the human race is comprised of individuals who vary along many stratification and divisions. Small, cohesive groups have a much easier time working toward a goal.

       Sadly, this isn't likely to happen. Many people are intellectually lazy, and many more are intellectual cowards. They refuse to acknowledge the existence of the deep state. Even if you could somehow force them to acknowledge this fact, many of them would just go apeshit and hurt themselves. Humans have been trained to have the minds of children.

       Whether or not Trump is the real deal only God knows. We can't see into his heart. But, to be honest, he fits the general description of what the real deal would look like. He is independently wealthy, so he doesnt need to promise favors for campaign support. He has a huge ego, so he is indifferent to the personal attacks on his character. He just keeps pushing forward. He has experience being in the public eye, so he knows how to work and manipulate media to get his message out. And there are many other qualities Trump has that make him an ideal person to fight the fight. And, personally, I'm betting that he is the truth. I could be wrong, but I don't see anyone else out there who is even close to being the savior that is needed. Trump is a ram not a sheep and we need a ram to fight this fight.

       The 1% vs 99% meme is Occupy language.  It is the language of socialists.  It is the language of the real left, not the MSM/DNC/Obama/Clinton/pussy-hat left.  It is the language of Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges, Cornell West, Ralph Nader, Richard Wolff, Michael Parenti.  These are the leaders of the the REAL left.  And their enemy is Trump (and the Republicans and Democrats as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to fight evil, if you want to fight the cabal, if you want to fight the rich, if you want to fight establishment then reject both parties and become a socialist.  If not then don't speak about 1% and 99%.

      <p>
       "Can we 99% grow up,stop being divided and fight back"
      </p>
      <p>
       Your statement is why we will never make any progress in making this country great for anyone but the elites. It does not matter the puppet. Obama gave billions to the banks who did nothing for us with it. An if people like OP are attempting to bridge a gap and people like you come around an immediately dismiss the message i quoted above we will get nowhere.
