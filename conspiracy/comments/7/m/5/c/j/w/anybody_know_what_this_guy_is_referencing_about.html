    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, I&#39;ve constructed an argument you can try out on atheists when you want.</p>

<p>You: &quot;So you believe in science then?&quot;</p>

<p>Them: &quot;Yes&quot;</p>

<p>You: &quot;<del>Well, we will skip over how that IS a religious belief and get to the science for you (so you can be comfortable)</del>... you know much about multiverse theory?&quot;</p>

<p>Them: &quot;Yes/No&quot; (Doesn&#39;t matter, you can educate them if they don&#39;t know)</p>

<p>You: &quot;In an infinite number of universes then, there are an infinite number filled with hatred and malice and an infinite number capable of scientifically penetrating into other universes and affecting them. Your scientific Satan is more real (and infinite) than the Biblical one...&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry, I hate (the) atheists (I have had more than casual interaction with). They hold science up as god and yet (almost) never obey the mathematical odds or use rational thought to find the middle ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey atheist. I don&#39;t hate you, but can you explain how atheists &quot;know&quot; that deities don&#39;t exist since proof of universal non-existence is near impossible? (i.e. God could &quot;hiding out&quot; somewhere...or maybe he&#39;s just sleeping.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making the common error of conflating belief in a thing with belief in knowledge of a thing. Believing in something specific is like performing a specific action: you either are or you aren&#39;t. When you are playing chess, you&#39;re a &quot;chess player.&quot; When you believe in a certain kind of omniscient deity, you are a &quot;theist.&quot; When you aren&#39;t playing chess or believing in a certain kind of omniscient deity, you are an &quot;atheist&quot; and a &quot;non-chess player.&quot;</p>

<p>You may believe all sorts of things about chess while you&#39;re not playing it. Maybe you think it&#39;s possible to understand the &#39;true&#39; nature of chess. Maybe you think there&#39;s no such thing. You may think the rules of chess are beautiful and perfect. Or you may believe them to be ugly and flawed. Regardless, you are still a &quot;non-chess player.&quot;</p>

<p>Likewise, some atheists may think they &#39;know&#39; deities don&#39;t exist. Others, like myself and Richard Dawkins, feel confident but leave open the possibility of being wrong. We&#39;re still atheists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not following your explanation of 
belief in a thing&quot; vs &quot;belief in knowledge of a thing&quot;. Could you rephrase?</p>

<p>So I guess it boils down to agnostics believe they don&#39;t know, but atheists believe they&#39;re &quot;pretty sure&quot;? But then what&#39;s there to be pretty sure about? The lack of evidence? Doesn&#39;t that assume current human knowledge to be pretty exhaustive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s both agnosticism and atheism. What &quot;agnostics&quot; usually THINK they mean when they call themselves that is that they don&#39;t believe in god OR the &quot;non-existence&quot; of god. What they don&#39;t realize is that makes them an atheist. Atheist means &quot;non-theist&quot; and theist means &quot;belief in an omniscient, interactive deity.&quot; If you are no actively a believer in said deity, you are an atheist, regardless of how unsure you are about whether you&#39;ll change your belief in the future.</p>

<p>But sure, if you insist, then I guess you can call Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris &quot;agnostics.&quot; Likewise you can refer to most reasonable religious people &quot;agnostics,&quot; as long as they admit that they could be wrong. Not a super useful term, but logically valid.</p>

<p>Remember, there&#39;s 2 questions here: Belief in a thing, and belief in your knowledge of a thing. There are agnostic theists and agnostic atheists. You can have &#39;gnostic&#39; theists and &#39;gnostic&#39; atheists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agnostics are people who say it&#39;s nearly impossible to know with any accuracy whether the existence of God/s is true as they are described. Evidence is necessary to prove something regardless of what it is, otherwise it&#39;s speculation.

Atheists point out that if there is no proof of the existence of God, then logically you can&#39;t say that he exists. They&#39;re not saying they &#39;know&#39; he definitely doesn&#39;t exist, they&#39;re saying there&#39;s no proof of him existing, therefore, they are atheists, or &#39;without God&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, I shall rephrase. I hate the atheists I have met.</p>

<p>Now I will &quot;meet&quot; you (therefore exempting you from my dislike) - and I will tell you everything is better in person. Text does not include nuance, facial expression or even charisma. You are correct.</p>

<p>I did not present the argument as &quot;smarter&quot; than atheism however, I ensured it was crafted only to do with science, fact and mathematics. </p>

<p>The post-amble was my own opinion of how they are unintelligent (in respect to denying anything that is not concrete and does not fit into the &quot;scientific model&quot; despite the base admission of science that there is &quot;more to life and the universe than we know&quot;). Science dismisses religion and everyone gets salty. Everyone also gets all salty when religion dismisses science... it is an endless process of re-gifting vitriol between two opposing belief systems.</p>

<p>Edit: Additionally, I don&#39;t particularly care what atheists believe, because they believe the same shit I do: we&#39;re here, science exists, laws of thermodynamics, quantum entanglement - except I believe in ANOTHER thing ontop of that, which they do not.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need an explanation for what I already know, I want an explanation for what I DO NOT know - and that <a href="https://i.redd.it/lwell0j7189z.jpg">was found in spirituality</a>.</p>

<p>As you hold me up as an ignorant theist I hold up Sam Harris as an ignorant atheist...

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you&#39;re committing a classic No True Scotsman fallacy by defining &quot;modern theists&quot; as only those who believe in a specific subset of theism and perform a specific subset of theists&#39; actions which you find palatable, while discounting those you do not like as &quot;not modern theists&quot; or something else altogether. There is a second claim you&#39;re making too about such, shall we call them, &#39;bad theists&#39; being a minority. It&#39;s not a very small minority, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Here is a good blog post that covers an engagement Harris had with a Muslim apologist on TV: <a href="https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/never-stop-lying">https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/never-stop-lying</a></p>

<p>The Pew poll he references here (and on Bill Maher) is the source for stats such as 88% of Egyptian Muslims favoring the death penalty for apostasy: <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf">http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf</a></p>

<p>These examples aside, the broader point Harris and his kind are making is not that &quot;theism&quot; is inevitably going to produce throwing acid in people&#39;s faces. It&#39;s that theism CAN be, and often IS, a prerequisite for otherwise reasonable, moral people to commit atrocities.</p>

<p>Dogmatism, the belief in the irrefutable truth of a body of text in spite of contradictory evidence (strengthened by it even, in some cases) is the root evil at work here. Theism is just one form of it. And, as we mentioned earlier, you can be dogmatic with other ideas. Theism happens to be a much bigger issue at this point in history than, say, communism or homeopathy.</p>

<p>Which is what I watched Sam Harris and his Echo chamber engage in at TED, I don&#39;t see the difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not ignoring the good aspects of religion. In fact he&#39;s one of the few prominent atheists who press on that and say atheists need to NOT ignore the good aspects. What he is saying is that the good aspects do not require belief in theism, religion, dogma, whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>Also, I get where you&#39;re coming from re. some atheists being combative. They are. As someone who lives in a very religious area of the US, let me assure you that they are far outnumbered by combative theists, both by headcount and (more importantly) by voting power.</p>

<p>I disagree that discussion is a waste of time. Can be with some. But I became an atheist after reading many internet debates as a child. So I tend to think it&#39;s worth it sometimes, in the right contexts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secret #2. But more profoundly, he discovered that he could influence brain waves if precisely timed with a return training signal. He had no idea that at this moment in history, he had accidentally destroyed democracy as we envision it to be. The military and surveillance community immediately picked up on the patent and within two years had reprogrammed their communications and surveillance satellites and terrestrial phased arrays with the new concepts. The rapid deployment of this technology occurred because it only required software changes in already existing radar, imaging, and communications’ terrestrial dishes and satellites. Many additional spy satellites have been launched since to bolster the system. So in 1976, on the bicentennial of this great nation, a system called TAMI was born. TAMI is an acronym for “Thought Amplifier and Mind Interface”. A more invasive “Big Brother” technology came about before George Orwell’s prediction of 1984.</p>

<p>To elaborate, i was reading about it, they said anyone can do this if they follow protocol. So i got the protocol, learned how it works which took maybe a day or so. Then I tried a few sessions, 6 or 7. There was a practice website that would give you random target photos. It went better than I expected and I actually got significant information. This was around 2010.</p>
