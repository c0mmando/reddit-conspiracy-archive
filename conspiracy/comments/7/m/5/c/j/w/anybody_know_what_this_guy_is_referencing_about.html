       Probly just a demon possessed individual touting the Enemy’s name. Although, Satan does walk the Earth according to the Bible. Maybe not too much longer though. (if you’re Atheist you don’t have to tell me).

       In “Phenomenon” it appears the US psych-research pgm brought in some occult types. Then there’s Uri Geller’s and the visit to Lawrence Livermore laboratory . . .

       The psych stuff began in earnest with paperclip and the legacy nazi occult crap himmler had whipped up. That's not to say it wasn't going on before - heck, this is a masonic country, after all. But what may have started as strictly right-hand path stuff took a sharp 180°. The Viet Nam era would appear to be the peak, but I'm guessing it just went further underground (the melding of tech &amp; "spiritualism").

       Hey man, I've constructed an argument you can try out on atheists when you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       You: "So you believe in science then?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Them: "Yes"
      </p>
      <p>
       You: "
       <del>
        Well, we will skip over how that IS a religious belief and get to the science for you (so you can be comfortable)
       </del>
       ... you know much about multiverse theory?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Them: "Yes/No" (Doesn't matter, you can educate them if they don't know)
      </p>
      <p>
       You: "In an infinite number of universes then, there are an infinite number filled with hatred and malice and an infinite number capable of scientifically penetrating into other universes and affecting them. Your scientific Satan is more real (and infinite) than the Biblical one..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Sorry, I hate (the) atheists (I have had more than casual interaction with). They hold science up as god and yet (almost) never obey the mathematical odds or use rational thought to find the middle ground.

       Hi, I'm an atheist. Sorry you hate me. You may be interested to know that what you wrote comes across as very ignorant, not to mention stupid though I'll throw you a bone and permit that your argument is better in person. If you actually want to change minds and not just dance around hooting about how much 'smarter' you are than atheists, consider reading a bit more about what atheists actually think and why.

       Hey atheist. I don't hate you, but can you explain how atheists "know" that deities don't exist since proof of universal non-existence is near impossible? (i.e. God could "hiding out" somewhere...or maybe he's just sleeping.)

       You're making the common error of conflating belief in a thing with belief in knowledge of a thing. Believing in something specific is like performing a specific action: you either are or you aren't. When you are playing chess, you're a "chess player." When you believe in a certain kind of omniscient deity, you are a "theist." When you aren't playing chess or believing in a certain kind of omniscient deity, you are an "atheist" and a "non-chess player."
      </p>
      <p>
       You may believe all sorts of things about chess while you're not playing it. Maybe you think it's possible to understand the 'true' nature of chess. Maybe you think there's no such thing. You may think the rules of chess are beautiful and perfect. Or you may believe them to be ugly and flawed. Regardless, you are still a "non-chess player."
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, some atheists may think they 'know' deities don't exist. Others, like myself and Richard Dawkins, feel confident but leave open the possibility of being wrong. We're still atheists.

       With all the recent UFO conspiracies if it turned out we were genetic creations of an advanced preexisting species, would you then accept them as “god” and consider yourself theist or would you still remain an atheist?

      <p>
       Or with the Holofractal stuff, if it turns out were in some quantum AI virtual reality system, would you consider the developers god?

       I'm not following your explanation of 
belief in a thing" vs "belief in knowledge of a thing". Could you rephrase?
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess it boils down to agnostics believe they don't know, but atheists believe they're "pretty sure"? But then what's there to be pretty sure about? The lack of evidence? Doesn't that assume current human knowledge to be pretty exhaustive?
      </p>

       Thanks, btw. Never asked these questions to an atheist before, so I appreciate the education.

       It's both agnosticism and atheism. What "agnostics" usually THINK they mean when they call themselves that is that they don't believe in god OR the "non-existence" of god. What they don't realize is that makes them an atheist. Atheist means "non-theist" and theist means "belief in an omniscient, interactive deity." If you are no actively a believer in said deity, you are an atheist, regardless of how unsure you are about whether you'll change your belief in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sure, if you insist, then I guess you can call Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris "agnostics." Likewise you can refer to most reasonable religious people "agnostics," as long as they admit that they could be wrong. Not a super useful term, but logically valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, there's 2 questions here: Belief in a thing, and belief in your knowledge of a thing. There are agnostic theists and agnostic atheists. You can have 'gnostic' theists and 'gnostic' atheists.

       Theism does not depend on a deity, most religions actually have an esoteric/occult side which usually puts forth an "all is one and one is all" type metaphysical argument and discourages deification, we are the snake eating it's own tail for eternity through a constant process of creation and destruction. This aligns well with many shamanic and aboriginal belief systems as well.

       Theism by definition depends on a deity who created the universe and who is concerned with the affairs of people. What you are describing is a different set of beliefs that does not seem to relate to the question of whether such a god exists. You may therefore hold your belief in this... cyclical metaphysics(?) and be an atheist or a theist.

       Agnostics are people who say it's nearly impossible to know with any accuracy whether the existence of God/s is true as they are described. Evidence is necessary to prove something regardless of what it is, otherwise it's speculation. Regardless of weather you believe it or not the evidence is a necessity to structurally proving anything to be truth. Blind Belief is one thing evidence based belief is another.

       FYI Dawkins goes into a explicit description of the spectrum of atheism  at the start of "the god delusion", absolute atheism is as silly as absolute  certainty in god. If you leave an opening in your mind for there to be a god, you are more agnostic.

       A-theist. The 'A' means without, 'theist' meaning God. Atheists point out that if there is no proof of the existence of God, then logically you can't say that he exists. They're not saying they 'know' he definitely doesn't exist, they're saying there's no proof of him existing, therefore, they are atheists, or 'without God'. One of the fundamental rules of religion is to 'have faith', which is an admittance of the fact that there is no proof. If you have proof, you don't need faith.

       Isn't that agnostic though? As in, atheists believe that no God exists whiles agnostics believe that no one can be sure. (Or at least they're not sure.)

       Not quite. An atheist doesn't believe that God exists, while an agnostic says they don't know. When talking about atheism, it's important to point out that not believing that God exists, is a different thing to believing that God definitely doesn't exist.

       Now I will "meet" you (therefore exempting you from my dislike) - and I will tell you everything is better in person. Text does not include nuance, facial expression or even charisma. You are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not present the argument as "smarter" than atheism however, I ensured it was crafted only to do with science, fact and mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post-amble was my own opinion of how they are unintelligent (in respect to denying anything that is not concrete and does not fit into the "scientific model" despite the base admission of science that there is "more to life and the universe than we know"). Science dismisses religion and everyone gets salty. Everyone also gets all salty when religion dismisses science... it is an endless process of re-gifting vitriol between two opposing belief systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Additionally, I don't particularly care what atheists believe, because they believe the same shit I do: we're here, science exists, laws of thermodynamics, quantum entanglement - except I believe in ANOTHER thing ontop of that, which they do not.

       We agree that there are atheists who take science at face value in a way that's too dogmatic. I suspect we disagree that it has anything to do with atheism or with science. I also wonder if you're familiar with prominent atheists like Sam Harris, who produce a lot of 'spiritual' content and freely admit of the need for "another thing" on top of the project of science.

       No. It's about engaging with the profound mystery and awe of the qualitative aspects of our experience. Why is it "like" anything to be at all? How much of what we think we know and control is, upon reflection, partially or entirely illusory? Stuff like that.

       So far he has talked about "Don't spare the rod lest we spoil the child" and "throwing acid in faces" and "keeping wives in bags" and "murdering your daughter for being raped" - this guy is out of touch with what modern theism is about (read: NOT religion interpreted literally and zealously as it used to be and is still done by a
       <em>
        minority
       </em>
       of theists) just as much as you claim I am out of touch with what atheists believe...
      </p>
      <p>
       As you hold me up as an ignorant theist I hold up Sam Harris as an ignorant atheist... I would say this man's beliefs do not reflect well upon the atheist religion - he talks about releasing cholera in the water (what the fuck is going on in this guy's head? Yes he says "no this wouldn't be a good idea" but seriously, who thinks about that kind of stuff? and the audience laughing at the oddest times. Talk about an echo chamber!)

       Sounds like you're committing a classic No True Scotsman fallacy by defining "modern theists" as only those who believe in a specific subset of theism and perform a specific subset of theists' actions which you find palatable, while discounting those you do not like as "not modern theists" or something else altogether. There is a second claim you're making too about such, shall we call them, 'bad theists' being a minority. It's not a very small minority, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a good blog post that covers an engagement Harris had with a Muslim apologist on TV:
       <a href="https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/never-stop-lying">
        https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/never-stop-lying
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pew poll he references here (and on Bill Maher) is the source for stats such as 88% of Egyptian Muslims favoring the death penalty for apostasy:
       <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf">
        http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These examples aside, the broader point Harris and his kind are making is not that "theism" is inevitably going to produce throwing acid in people's faces. It's that theism CAN be, and often IS, a prerequisite for otherwise reasonable, moral people to commit atrocities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dogmatism, the belief in the irrefutable truth of a body of text in spite of contradictory evidence (strengthened by it even, in some cases) is the root evil at work here. Theism is just one form of it. And, as we mentioned earlier, you can be dogmatic with other ideas. Theism happens to be a much bigger issue at this point in history than, say, communism or homeopathy.

       He's not ignoring the good aspects of religion. In fact he's one of the few prominent atheists who press on that and say atheists need to NOT ignore the good aspects. What he is saying is that the good aspects do not require belief in theism, religion, dogma, whatever you want to call it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I get where you're coming from re. some atheists being combative. They are. As someone who lives in a very religious area of the US, let me assure you that they are far outnumbered by combative theists, both by headcount and (more importantly) by voting power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree that discussion is a waste of time. Can be with some. But I became an atheist after reading many internet debates as a child. So I tend to think it's worth it sometimes, in the right contexts.

       I could literally say the same thing to you with Atheists and "religious people." Newsflash: Atheists are religious people, they have faith that there is no God. They have faith that everything here today is just an accident, 1 in basically an infinite chance. There are
       <em>
        plenty
       </em>
       of Atheists who claim to
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       how the universe was created and forget that the Bing Bang is merely theory, just like there are plenty of religious people that do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atheism is just as flawed as any other religion, and they are more vicious and intolerant than any religion Ive seen (other than maybe Islam), we are probably not an accident and the universe most likely wasn't created by a random giant space fart like I grew up believing...

       You are not a believer in Apollo. You are atheist as far as Apollo is concerned. Atheists for your God number in the billions- every Hindu and Muslim is an atheist for your god, and Apollo as well. I'm an atheist for all the gods because I see nothing that would indicate they exist.

       You have faith. That's what is important. You're no different, as much as you'd like to be special. Sorry pal. Atheists suck. Like it's cool if you don't believe in God but to start a group of parading fanatics who attack every religion when you have your own ridiculous beliefs that you tout around as fact? Hypocrisy at it's best.

       Ok you're in denial. It's ok. Just look up "Atheist" and get back to me. What I said is true, atheists have
       <em>
        faith
       </em>
       that there is no God. They don't have any proof, it's their belief. Attacking people for their personal beliefs; that's literally all atheists are good for. And they act as if they're good people progressing society or something when in reality, r/atheism is merely a hateful cesspool of neckbeards who have nothing better to do than congratulate themselves and circlejerk about not believing in God.

       No you are missing my point. You are yourself an atheist. You also have "faith" that the world is not perched on the back of a turtle, you have "faith" that Poseidon does not rule the realms of our many oceans.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the exact "faith" I have when asked if the universe has been created by an intelligence. I've heard those claims. I don't believe them. I don't believe people return from the dead, so I'm not a Christian. I just don't believe in theism. All theism is right out, and that's what defines an atheist, not message boards on Reddit. You seem very "hip" and "with it", young man, but you are just simply wrong. And, your god isn't real.

       Remote viewing is all disinfo. basically, u can project info into peoples heads using satellites. CIA put out all the info on remote viewing so other countries would investigate, allowing the CIA to feed them bogus info through the "remote viewers".

        Secret #2. But more profoundly, he discovered that he could influence brain waves if precisely timed with a return training signal. He had no idea that at this moment in history, he had accidentally destroyed democracy as we envision it to be. The military and surveillance community immediately picked up on the patent and within two years had reprogrammed their communications and surveillance satellites and terrestrial phased arrays with the new concepts. The rapid deployment of this technology occurred because it only required software changes in already existing radar, imaging, and communications’ terrestrial dishes and satellites. Many additional spy satellites have been launched since to bolster the system. So in 1976, on the bicentennial of this great nation, a system called TAMI was born. TAMI is an acronym for “Thought Amplifier and Mind Interface”. A more invasive “Big Brother” technology came about before George Orwell’s prediction of 1984.

       If so then they are pretty sneaky
      </p>
      <p>
       To elaborate, i was reading about it, they said anyone can do this if they follow protocol. So i got the protocol, learned how it works which took maybe a day or so. Then I tried a few sessions, 6 or 7. There was a practice website that would give you random target photos. It went better than I expected and I actually got significant information. This was around 2010.

       So yea if it was the cia zapping me with space lasers, in my bedroom on some random weeknight, that's pretty sneaky
