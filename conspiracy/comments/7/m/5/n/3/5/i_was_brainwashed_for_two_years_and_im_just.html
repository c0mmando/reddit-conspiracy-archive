        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi Reddit,
I browse this subreddit occasionally.</p>

<p>I understand some people know a lot about brainwashing (I don&#39;t, experience aside), and I would like to hear your takes. I don&#39;t understand where we are at in politics. I think it is interesting what&#39;s written here.</p>

<p>I went through brainwashing and conditioning as a slave for a very twisted man. He tested things on me because I let him at first... and then things got out of hand. I lost myself completely. There were things I could not say. There are still things I cannot say.</p>

<p>Examples: I would be tied up for days in a closet for a minor transgression and forced to drink water only when allowed and from a bowl with a leash and collar attached in order to choke me. I had phrases I had to recite daily or receive punishment. I was sexually attacked repeatedly for years and forced to recite sayings or listen to things as it was happening. I was made to believe I was not human and I believed it entirely and still sometimes believe it to this day. These are just some things I have lately been able to say. </p>

<p>This all occurred inside a rental house in a rural area. I am 22 years old now. I had been a recent college student when this began. I do not know what I did to make this happen. I was abused as a child, but I don&#39;t talk about it much. I was, by all accounts, a normal kid. Besides having occasional flashbacks. The man who did this to me -- I do not know him anymore nor do I think I ever did. He skipped town soon after. </p>

<p>The Point: </p>

<p>If anybody has questions, I will answer them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what gets traction here, what people are interested in, but if this is anything you are curious about -- I&#39;m no genius on the science, I&#39;m just healing now -- but I&#39;ll try to answer completely, from a survivor standpoint.</p>

<p>PMs will be more open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It started out as &quot;I bet I could do this&quot; to him and myself not realizing how strong conditioning and brainwashing is. Laughing almost. I did not see it as something I could be susceptible to, or something that was real, or any such thing. </p>

<p>I was held against my will only after I had laughed and made jokes about things he was serious about. Small steps led to building trust, and times that he said he would come back, he started not coming back, until he was the only person who I could rely on, and I suppose you could say I could not even rely on him. But at least he was giving me water. I guess that&#39;s how I viewed it. He was keeping me alive, and therefore, I had to trust him. I owed him for my life.</p>

<p>By that point, I was that low.</p>

<p>He was much older than me and I had a quite open-minded view-point of the world, however, a naive one. I am still quite naive, though I&#39;m growing out of it quickly, of fear.</p>

<p>I would have gone to the police.
Again, he skipped town soon after.</p>

<p>Interesting question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition, i suffered severe torture, physical and psychological. Once he realized he could push me to certain extents, he would leave me that way for long periods of time, sometimes playing recordings that I would listen to over and over. Sometimes just loud loud music, or over-simulus. </p>

<p>Occasionally he would &quot;joke&quot; about selling me. I don&#39;t know what that was.</p>

<p>I think that it was his first time going as far as he did. I don&#39;t think it was something that he did on a whim, however.</p>

<p>See, this is where I came to r/conspiracy.... </p>

<p>was this an individual experiment? Why did he pick me? Why did he skip town and cut contact once he was confronted, if it was only a one-off? Was he working alone? Was he just seeing how far he could push a person, as a sociopath? Was he working with other people? Could this affect me in the future (I have heard of &quot;activation&quot;? and I am very curious how this works)? Why? I understand this now more than ever, but I do not understand the WHYS </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you looked into trauma based mind control experiments such as MK Ultra? It was conducted on a mass scale throughoout this nation by Good Ol Unclesams funding. Thanks for the memories by Brice Taylor is just one example of how these programs operate, your experience may possibly be another...The way you spoke of his sudden departure is all to familiar in my research, largely due to the fact that when a community

    <div class="md"><p>And why these types of trauma based mind control techniques work is they target specific parts of the subconscious, without our conscious mind understanding, the goal being to fragment the mind and
 create alternative personality types in one person.  Your mind splinters because it cannot endure the trauma, pain, and fear your experiencing,   a built in protective mechanism that internally switches on and off without your awareness, in an attempt to separate itself from the abuser.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please explain more to me. </p>

<p>I am trying to make sense of my experience. If it was part of something bigger? Or part of just some singular sicko? It sounds like there is so much going on that is bigger and that they can make you do anything. I don&#39;t know, and I want to know about &quot;activation&quot; or if I could be made to do something via triggers.... It all confuses me so much. I read little about MKULTRA, and as far as I&#39;m aware it sounds like that&#39;s over, but that there seem to be lingering experiments.</p>

<p>I was certainly an experiment, whether for something larger or for a singular psycho, I&#39;m not sure. There also were drugs involved at points.Not often. The sudden departure from the place he lived is a HUGE red flag for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He knew that I had a trigger already about halloween things. That I had been pulled to the back of a certain Halloween-themed bar in Times Square a year or so before I met him. I do not recall everyone who was there, and most were dressed up anyway, so I could not tell you if he was there. What I know of him - unlikely. But what I know was clearly a lie if he could leave so easily and cleanly. If he could have a house like this around. I don&#39;t know him at all really now. Could he have been a part of this earlier? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>But at that point, I had been pulled into the back and raped by a bartender. They closed my friends out when they went out for cigarettes. They just locked up the Haunted House portion of the bar/theater thing. And I screamed and screamed, it was not at all quiet, and there were so many people there, nobody helped. Afterwards, I was put into a taxi and a man gave the driver $100 to drive me a block down the road.</p>

<p>That Halloween party where I was saved - I didn&#39;t know everybody who was there, but as I said, this is a rural area. I met the person whose home it was. He helped me. Is still helping me. But he&#39;s been using my triggers. So far, only &quot;good&quot; ones, so I have not complained, but it makes me fearful that I react. It makes me wonder what else could happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for your experiences. As somebody who has been abused my entire life, I now understand the role of fear and trauma in control.</p>

<p>Many members of the elite have been abused like you mentioned with torture techniques (mk ultra programming). What happens is the mind fragments into different alters.</p>

<p>I have a belief that many are being brainwashed through programming (not realizing that much of what they watch is emotionallu manipulative). Let me just give a tiny example of the &quot;You can never be beautiful or good enough or anything enough&quot; programming that  brings people down.</p>

<p>To me it is wide scale through music, television, and media in general.</p>

<p>With that being said one likely does not understand the true horrors of the abuse you mentioned. It is unfathomable to some.</p>

<p>I realize now at the root of all the physical abuse I experienced, there was always an emotional component. As crazy as this may sound to some, I often preferred the physical abuse over the emotional abuse because I became numb to it and stopped feeling it (desensitization).</p>

<p>The point I am getting at is that I have a theory that most of us are brainwashed on some level, but unfortunately some of us go through extremely traumatic forms of brainwashing.</p>

<p>My question for you is why do you think yoy fell into the abusive relationship. Was it &quot;voluntary&quot; or forced?</p>

<p>For me, it helped me to see how my abusive childhood led me into an abusive relationship where I was nearly murdered.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Do you know what mk ultra is?</p>

<p>As I said, I found him fascinating and intelligent. The most successful person and intriguing mind I&#39;d met. I went willingly with him. I did not engage willingly in the rest of our... experiments.</p>

<p>I am quite fragmented. I am told I have six &quot;alters&quot; in personality that had not been present. What are &quot;members of the elite&quot;? The torture I underwent I cannot explain fully. Only some things I understand. I agree about preferring physical over emotional. It mostly went hand in hand. It was all so overwhelming.</p>

<p>Second, are you in therapy or anything like that? I would find a therapist who specializes in abuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just reading the thread, congrats on your walk and best of luck for the future! </p>

<p>Here is the protocol i came up with when overthinking the risk of being programmed... Luckily i haven&#39;t had to test it yet, besides it might be really stupid but it&#39;s hard to fight the unknown i suppose, anyway here goes:</p>

<p>First take a couple non addictive one time positive drugs like DMT, these have been known to get rid of some nasty grooves and patterns the brain gets stuck into, i would imagine mind programming are such grooves. </p>

<p>Then bring real friends and cameras to a hypnosis specialist (i don&#39;t know of any, the Quebec artist Messmer would be close to what i have in mind, there is a part of showbiz but what he does is too much imo to be strictly tricks), and ask them to nullify eventual prior programmings, they might not find out what they are and if they are there, but i think and hope they can nullify them anyway. The friends and the cameras are to ensure you do not somehow land on a new psychopath, i would imagine the talent is attractive to them... if he or she can&#39;t work with this, pick another. </p>

<p>And then for personal peace of mind, I would also do some self-programming, much like people self program to regularly test reality in hope of doing it in their dreams to initiate a lucid dream, i would start creating protocols to regularly check whether i could be under the influence of someone, like ask myself &quot;am i alone? no? how are they on the stranger scale? any real close friend to have my back? have i followed any directions from the people around me in the last five minutes? what kind of directions? how will the person react if i take the lead and bring this completely elsewhere? Bad? Why yes I&#39;m out of here!&quot;... you don&#39;t want to become paranoid about it but instead just trust the checklist, it could be a good reflex to have considering you have proven vulnerable in the past, it will be negative 100% of the time, until it won&#39;t be, and then you know it&#39;s time to walk away. It sounds a bit silly because we&#39;re supposed to be doing these kind of checks subconsciously at all time but for some it doesn&#39;t work as well as it should so you have to help it a bit consciously.</p>

<p>Oh and also polkadotgirl is in all likelihood a very trustworthy person, i mean it&#39;s still the internet but i&#39;ve read her for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He took me to a Halloween party. It was exciting. Everybody was all dressed up though so I kept thinking about just running away from there. He knew I had triggers from haunted houses. I knew in my head that if I left, all sorts of masked people would come out and take me back to the house.</p>

<p>The man whose home it was started talking to me.
Under the right light, he could see my bruises, my black eye, and he told me I looked terrified in the crowd, however much I danced. Nothing I said satiated his curiosity.
We talked whenever I could following. I couldn&#39;t be watched all the time, nor tied up, though I knew better than to ever talk about it with anyone I was allowed contact with.</p>

<p>Eventually he was intimidated out of town. As I say, this is a rural, small place. People don&#39;t take kindly to unsavoury characters. And word travels fast. Just not fast enough for me.</p>

<p>It took a long time to say what happened was what it was, mostly because of the disbelief and awe I am met with. Nobody looks at me the same ever again. I don&#39;t speak of it. But he understood, and eventually, there was a confrontation, and I didn&#39;t know how to be once I was out. I didn&#39;t know how to be a person at all. I just wanted to be whatever this other person who saved me wanted me to be. I still do. I&#39;m trying now to learn how to break that pattern. Is that the right thing to do? Or are some people better to follow than my own self?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe this is anybody&#39;s area of expertise. But I&#39;ve certainly found this subreddit (reddit as a whole actually) from trying to research brainwashing and the biggest question for myself to grasp -- why me? I have seen on here that others research brainwashing and conditioning and I&#39;m just looking for what people know, not for a sort of ultimate knowledge. I suppose that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Thank you for that. I don&#39;t know how to believe in myself in that way, after trusting the way I did. After believing something to be complicated and false only to have it explode in my face in allowing it to happen. Which, if I am honest with myself, I did allow it to happen. I wish I had not and that I had known anything about this prior.</p>

<p>I only wonder -- and here is where the conspiracy lies -- was this an individual experiment? Why did he pick me? Why did he skip town and cut contact once he was confronted, if it was only a one-off? Why? I understand this now more than ever, but I do not understand the WHYS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in Canada; maybe it&#39;s different where you are, but there are social workers and trained people who offer various forms of help and therapy; you need help to deal with what you&#39;ve been through.

There is a phone line called the &quot;Distress Center&quot; where people who are in any form of mental or emotional distress can call, just to talk to someone.

<p>The right thing to do is learn to know yourself; know who you are. This is not easy in the best of times, but if you truly know who you are, and know what you want, then you will know what to do; you will not need to follow anyone other than your own self. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bless you. I hope you can recover. Much love.</p>

<p>If you can get help from a psychotherapist, please do so. Talking to someone about this, making any trauma conscious is a very healing practice.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Be gentle with yourself and accept yourself as you are. </p>

<p>Know that all trauma can be healed and you will eventually come out of this a better person. </p>

<p>Though I have not had any similar external things happen to me, I also went through a period of inner hell, depression, anxiety, horrible inner struggles combined with various painful physical health issues.</p>

<p>This was an experience for you. It will help you grow as a person and as a being. You can use it as a catalyst for inner freedom. Any experience can be used this way. As a fire to move forward. As a lesson to learn new things. As a means of developing greater love for yourself. And any other lessons you can discern from it.</p>

<p>If you feel in any way spiritually inclined  (though for this book you don&#39;t really have to necessarily be as it&#39;s very practical common sense psychological advice) I would recommend the book The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, as well as his other book A New Earth (in that order, reading the Power of Now first would be my recommendation).</p>

<p>They will help you find the timeless freedom that is here now, beyond the past and future, beyond any traumas. The books are not religious in their nature, but spiritual in the sense of seeing oneself as the being, the freedom beyond the body and mind.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Even as you do so, I would still recommend someone you can talk to. A therapist, as I said would be very helpful. But ultimately listen to your intuition, you yourself will know how to heal best.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Know that awareness is the greatest healer. I can tell you this from my personal experience. Using awareness and your breath to steady your awareness, you can face your traumas in a less painful manner. Embrace your pain, your suffering with love. Love yourself, love your pain, accept it, embrace it with soft awareness. This dissolves it.</p>

<p>This is my advice to you, based on my decade long personal journey of inner healing and seeking of freedom and peace within. Through various meditative, introspective and spiritual practices I myself have brought myself out of the depths of inner hell.</p>

<p>I have no questions for you, but if I could ask you something it would simply be this - a series of questions that can facilitate a release, something you can use any time you feel pain welling up.</p>

<p>Could you embrace what you are experiencing right now?</p>

<p>Could you allow yourself to let it go?</p>

<p>Would you?</p>

<p>When?</p>

<p>By simply answering this series of questions internally in an honest manner, seeing the resistance present within you and having the courage to let go and ultimately answer &quot;yes&quot; to them will help you a great deal.</p>

<p>Another process I could recommend that has helped me a great deal, for healing (from a program I enjoy greatly called the Sedona Method) - <a href="http://www.embraceyourexperience.com/2016/05/triple-welcoming-process-the-sedona-method.html">Triple Welcoming Process, Sedona Method (Beyond Letting Go)</a></p>

<p>(you can just listen to it over and over and it will help a lot, it&#39;s like a mini meditation, it has helped me plenty in my life).</p>

<p>Katie Byron and her self-psychotherapeutic practice called The Work is also a great tool for healing. It is available totally free on her site:
<a href="http://thework.com/en/do-work">http://thework.com/en/do-work</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>I wish you well and much love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last I heard he is in Northern California, though I don&#39;t know what is true and what isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>That is what I mean by &quot;activation&quot; and I do not know if I am paranoid simply because I&#39;ve been reading up about brainwashing and that it seems there are so many people involved in huge crazy conspiracies and that I don&#39;t know now if I play into this. I know that I do have triggers, but they are a mystery. The other day I went to a yoga class that I did not know much about. What ended up happening was that it was hot yoga, and I began to get overheated. When I tried to leave, the door was locked, and the instructor was telling me it was to keep people out but it was the longest two hours of my life trying to understand that I was safe even though I was locked in this insanely heated room with a group of strangers. It... really messed me up, to say the least. I was desperate to get out.</p>

<p>It was certainly. Thank you for your empathy. I certainly hope no other women face what I did at his hands. He faked remorse at a point, before he left completely. But he had phrases too. The person who saved me... he would use the phrases that made me &quot;feel good&quot; to try to help me. But I&#39;m afraid that isn&#39;t helpful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot imagine what you are going through. An from what I have read on hypnosis and mind control there are triggers. For example a video with repetitious phrases may have sounds of running or dripping water in the background, with a soft voice telling you the sound of water will trigger a response. So now whenever you hear the sound of water whatever conditioning you have suffered is subconsciously triggered.  For your sake I hope you recover as fully as one could from something like this.   That remorse he faked was probably a fear of being arrested reflex an was trying to save himself. </p>

I&#39;m just learning this. This is why I posted in this r/conspiracy. I do have triggers. I&#39;m just trying to figure out what this is all for. Could he have been part of something bigger?

<p>I think it&#39;s despicable that they do that. I guess some part of me is afraid to think that it could possibly be that it was all just for some sick man&#39;s enjoyment. But everything that he did to me, the tests run, the experiments, the conditioning, the non-stop torture, and the fact I&#39;ve lived in areas where sex-trafficking is prominent... I just have to wonder what he would have done had nobody intervened. It eats me up at night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People always ask about child victims and why they never come forward as adults. My theory is that they (franklin coverup helped me form this) are abducted as kids and then were experimented on with hypnotic images,videos and recordings. What makes this a sort of fringe thing is I think this is where we get sissy hypnosis from. You can search it just as those words,or forced fem. So to combine my 2 train of thoughts, what are the chances that our surge in the amount of just turned 18 trans kids who if you look at some of them have clearly had thousands in surgeries and hormones that make them look way to feminine to have just started or been doing it for a few years.  I have watched a few of those types of videos. creepy stuff. An it makes me wonder if young boys or girls are not being targeted to be kidnapped and turned into feminine sex slaves.  I follow conspiracies and I think my theory is crazy. hence why it is not formulated or written articulately. I understand that the forced fem is a fetish for some people. But I still wonder who they practiced on. A few videos have swastikas that flash during playback, others have pentagrams. It could be a bunch of really freaky people just doing freaky shit, but when it comes to mind control,hypnosis and porn I start to think.  I want to do more research but I do not really want to watch too many videos for obvious reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not that way. i think videos like this may have been tested on kidnapped children. Where they are forced to watch these mind changing videos, an possibly similar to your situation, over time through hypnosis and torture they start to believe it. A developing mind can be molded easier than an adults,an what better way to get a perfect slave then to brainwash them as young as possible.  I think that there is a possibility that someone else is paying for their surgeries and hormones. Healthcare in America is not cheap, yet you can search online and find thousands of teenage trans women who look like real women. People who have been taking hormones for more than just a year or 2.  It is a theory. As far as non abducted children who decide to become trans, that is just life. Like i said before I do understand that it is a fetish an some adults willfully participate, but at the same time, there are those who do not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah... well... I did... but I moved to an absolutely awful place inner city. I had a lot of difficulty, especially as a vulnerable and small (5&#39;4&quot;/80lbs) girl. A lot of things were very troubling and I became a target for pimps. It&#39;s not important. Now... I want to move back. Despite everything, I see it as my home. Despite it all, without knowing the full story, everybody came to my defense. My throat closed when I tried to talk about it. I couldn&#39;t. And they still rallied together just because they suspected he was hitting me. If they knew the whole story...? I don&#39;t think anybody could ever look at me again.</p>

<p>I want to move back. Mostly for the man who helped me get away. He&#39;s been using triggers. I do have trigger words that make me different... it feels different, I act different, I feel different. I feel almost like a voice watching my body from far away.</p>

<p>Anyway, he uses these phrases sometimes to make me &quot;feel good&quot; he says, because that&#39;s what he thinks it does. It&#39;s so complex... I don&#39;t know if I can tell him exactly how it really is. He knows from the party, and the following weeks, when he planned to help me escape, but he doesn&#39;t really know. He doesn&#39;t want to. It scares him. He just wants a girl who he can easily make feel different ways vis a vis trigger phrases.</p>

<p>I know that isn&#39;t right. But I owe him my life. And I feel I need to move back because it is what he says I need to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you being serious? Because I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not certain over typing sometimes.
Now I am very scared. Was this last time of healing a lie? Is this the truth? If I go home, will this happen again? Where I get triggered and I just openly believe anything he says and anything he tells me to do</p>

<p>If you really want to know, it was very very painful. You&#39;d have to be with somebody quite unique who would consent to this. Or rather, do it in such a way that you don&#39;t have to have equal and opposite reaction.</p>

<p>And not taking advantage of it. If somebody knew a phrase for me, they could really control me. And he knows a few. And he just... does use them. He told me he accidentally said it early on, when we were first starting to be intimate, and it was like a vacuum pulling me out of my body, and my body just started to move almost of its own accord. It was scary and it hurt so much and it continues to hurt to this day. (Physical therapy)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how anybody could consent to that, save for those who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid sometimes that people will say things without knowing. It hasn&#39;t happened yet. Sometimes, when the fragmented parts come out... I don&#39;t even remember what they are. That&#39;s scarier. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about consensual things, we could PM, however as I said, the way it was, as you say, &quot;coded&quot; into me... I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d be much help to you.</p>

<p>This is eating away at me. Did he really sell me? I would never know, would I? Because I never even considered leaving an option. I never thought, ever, that the person I saw as saving me would ever be involved but he&#39;s been increasingly physical with me, aggressively, and my throat closes up every time I try to protest. I finally told him I didn&#39;t want him to hit me anymore, and it was like I was vomiting. I was so afraid. And then he got so serious about not abusing me and telling me I was just sick and confused and mistaking him for the man who trained me, but I know it was him. I do because he&#39;s talked about it. Because I remember it. But also because he&#39;s admitted it. Is this what happened?
Do I need to get out of there?</p>

<p>Why the fuck are you so okay with being beaten? JFC, of course you should stay away.</p>

I&#39;m away. But I don&#39;t know how to get this out of me. See? I don&#39;t even know something that you take to be basic. I don&#39;t understand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear u/violetsylph thank you for sharing your experience. It pains me that this was the path that you were given to walk in this life. That being said I believe individuals that experience a deep amount of pain in this life can also be blessed with a unique perspective that allows them to more fully appreciate the good in this world when it finally comes around.</p>

<p>I would like to resonate the minority of what u/ragingsatyr said. It seems odd to me that the new guy is using your known good triggers, that should be a warning sign to me. Beatings or being hit is not normal and is a very big sign that you should not be with that person. Good people do exist and you should not settle for anything less than love, happiness, and fulfillment because you are worth it.</p>

<p>I also believe that a lot of what happens in this life is out of our control as individuals. All that we can really control is how we react to the 99% of uncontrollable stuff thrown at us. So know that you have self worth. Learn to forgive and let go of the past so that you can enjoy and live life to it&#39;s fullest in each present moment. You must be the master of your own life and learn to reinvient yourself. </p>

<p>If you are safe staying with your dad\ other family members for a while to help you gain some perspective being further away from it all, then I would highly recommend this. Also I encourage you to continue to work with your trauma specialist. As some one that has depression I know working with or just being able to talk to my psychiatrist has been very helpful to me. </p>

<p>To follow up on some of your points you had in your post. </p>

<p>Do you remember any details of the mantras and images or symbols that you were being programming with? Might help us identity if there was any occult symbolism that we can notice to see if there are any know groups of any given sect in your area to help you know if it was alone or part of a bigger plan\ network. </p>

<p>I was hypnotized at an early age at a fair and have always been fascinated by how it worked. Through researching  topics like hypnosis I learn about MK ultra CIA mind control, manchurian candidates, demonic possessions, and more topics about how one could loss control of one&#39;s body. Ultimately what I found was a lot of these programs\ phenomenons share a commonality that, if taught the most effect way to stop most &quot;mind control&quot; is by becoming very self aware of your thoughts, feelings, and actions so that you can start to block out what you know to be coming from somewhere else other than youself. Easier said than done but if you are aware of some of your triggers maybe once you are grounded you could work with some one you trust to have them use these triggers while you try and block out the invoked response. Not an expert but might help. </p>

<p>I will leave you with two of my favorite inspirational\ healing quotes. I hope that you find all the strength you need to face this journey ahead of you and that you come to find peace and happiness someday my friend. I love you and will send my thoughts and prayers your way! </p>

<p>&quot;He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,&quot;— in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease. &quot;He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,&quot; — in those who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease. For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by love, this is an old rule.&quot; - Dhammapada</p>

<p>Here is a link to the video reading of the other quote.</p>

<p>I identify so strongly with some of this, things I had never heard before. I am diagnosed with DID (MPD, newer term). Even just the intro: &quot;Monarch Mind Control is a form of mind control which creates a mind control slave by utilizing the human brain’s trauma response of dissociation to create a form of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) wherein various triggers can cause the slave personality to surface and respond to commands given by the master (“Handler” in Monarch parlance).&quot;</p>

<p>It is a relatively new approach in the field of psychology (and definitely more Jungian than Freudian), although it rests on age-old spiritual truth. Ask your therapist about it, and/or look seriously into it yourself (if indeed you share the intuition and this resonates with you).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello OP, now this might not be the right sub for this as Stockholm&#39;s syndrome is a thing and not really a conspiracy, I do not mean to be mean when I say this but very little information was shared and it almost seems like you want people to beg for the information... what are we supposed to infer from &quot;It started out as &quot;I bet I could do this&quot; to him...&quot; with no more information? did he experiment on you medically? female genital mutilation? gaslighting? I feel like more information is needed now I understand that this could in turn spark something negative in you but then what was the point of making this post? it&#39;s like that person that says &quot;i&#39;m so mad right now&quot; but when you ask them what&#39;s up they just say oh nothing or whatever. 
-How did you find yourself in that situation?
-What did your family think/say about you during that time
-how is it you can&#39;t recall anything at all from someone you were so infatuated with stating that &quot;...and I found him to be interesting and brilliant. One of the most intelligent, thoughtful, and successful minds I&#39;d met.&quot; yet he disappeared as if he never existed? can&#39;t you just get the police to get public records of the owner/lease?
Now let me be clear that I am not asking for details about the horrible abuse you endured but simply the series of events that led you there including being MIA from friends/family for ~2 years. although I am curious to know what action initiated by him crossed the line for you? why did it take so long for you to realize abuse=bad ?  </p>

<p>I apologize if it seems like I am attacking you I simply would like more information than a couple of vague cliffhangers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about Stockholm&#39;s. I read some things on this subreddit about mind control, brainwashing, conditioning, and it sounded all so so familiar that it was almost painful. I was amazed. So I wanted to share and I wanted to see if anybody in this particular subreddit could help me make sense of this.</p>

<p>I found reddit through just looking for information, and I don&#39;t intend to stop looking for information. I&#39;m not here looking for sympathy or for information on mental illness that I am not diagnosed with. I am here looking to understand the things that rang a bell with me about the brainwashing I endured and to add my own voice to this ongoing conversation.</p>

<p>-I found myself  in the situation because I found him at first charming, successful, brilliant. I saw him as a trustworthy figure and I was wrong. I went with him willingly. And then I was already in over my head.</p>

<p>-My family was upwards of 10 hours away. We didn&#39;t speak that often. When we did, I wished them happy holidays, I embellished the truth. For instance, sometimes we had friends get together for debate parties around election time (he was very politically-inclined). Friends knew nothing and asked nothing. Bruises were easily explained away. He talked about how I was getting more ambitious as a dancer and how I was always working myself too hard and falling over. I went along. I was losing weight because of dance. I was hurting myself because of dance. I had always been a dancer, and so it was a very good excuse for him. And for me, I went along, and I was terrified. He would smile and tell me horrible things he was going to do if I didn&#39;t go along. He would ruffle my hair and laugh about it. In such a disarming way it was like I couldn&#39;t process his tone and his words together. I didn&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>And he was just gone when he was gone. He just moved away. He disappeared. And I&#39;m still not even ready for a lot of basic things... let alone pursuing him across the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thank you for responding, and would like to reinforce the pursuit of information as it is amazing what barriers we can cross (a whole lifetime of a certain craft or subject can be summarized and absorbed easily thanks to this).
I did not want to diagnose you with Stockholm&#39;s that was simply me trying to understand your post as it wasn&#39;t 100% clear and felt almost constructed similar to a Writing Prompt, like we just come into the story with you being abused already for 2 years, you go to a party, he nonchalantly says threats while keeping his cool, etc. just seemed like you were with someone and they ended up being bad but you admit you let some things pass as if you were content with it or enjoying it (ex: easily covering up for visible bruises on yourself) hence me saying the syndrome thing.
You were with a sociopath and as you can expect things could have gotten worse, you and you alone can recall how he carried himself with his activities and really should be able to answer if you were his first/only victim by recalling his lets say expertise when it came to executing Machiavellic like manipulating or his ability to lie while keeping a straight face, was he full of confidence or did he seem somewhat introverted? as a person who suffered abuse as a child I can vouch for that sudden feeling of your memory clicking certain images and a wave of emotions basically like restoring a lost backup to your brain, I can safely say a vast majority of my childhood seems like a blur that is hard to recall.
I really hope you can find peace and be able to recover, I myself have trouble in certain areas like being able to emulate properly or feeling empathy and connecting to people.
good luck in life and take care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for clarifying. I suppose I can see why you saw it that way.</p>

<p>No, I tried to communicate quietly to people at first, about how afraid I was, and after that... I was too afraid to try at all. I knew how bad the punishment was. </p>

<p>He was always so confident, and he never cared about a facade with me, not like he did in public, unless it was for fun. He seemed strategic and methodical. You posing that question makes me now realize I&#39;m almost certain I wasn&#39;t the only one he did this to.</p>

<p>But now I still wonder, with the sudden move, with all of it, what was he a part of? What was it all for? His sick fun? Or something more?</p>
