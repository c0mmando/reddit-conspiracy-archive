       Try and make an In depth post about any of these things, and if they aren't able to bury your thread, they will most certainly infiltrate the comments section of it and take control of the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So, keep hammering these pressure points. These seem to be relatively sensitive and vital subjects that the shills are paid to prop up, and bury any criticism of. Keep slowly eroding away at them and forcing these topics to the forefront of the discussion.

       christ if theres anything i hate most about gamergate, 2016 elections and all the bullcrap in the past 3 years is how everyone's a shill now and unless youve been here for 10 years you should be downvoted, called out and maybe banned.

       If you're bored you can reply to them and say how much shills suck in third person without referring to them specifically.

       They will get pissed off easily and try argue back but arguing back and showing they're mad in a reply just admits they're annoyed by it and subsequently they're a shill but their egos are so huge that they cannot possibly let it go.

       If it's an actual shill they will not be butt hurt. That would be projection on your part. They are literally being paid to tactically troll you.

       Oh you missed the point completly. You don't argue with them at all. You don't even talk to them. All you do is say how shit shills are in general and keep repeating it. It doesn't even warrent a reply from anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean shills are so hopeless that they're not even worth baiting any making fun of anymore. It's just too much of an easy game. It's like playing with a child that's how easy it is to win. Most of them hate themselves anyway, the money is shit and job statisfication when you're losing every day must be one of the lowest.

       And the 9 grand was from a couple days ago from 4chan, and it was the leaders. But either way if I hated Trump and someone offered me 9k a month to chirp him, Fuck me that be some easy earned money.

       lol you're comparing shills to terrorists. Shills are pathetic but I think that's going a bit too far.

       9k is also nothing if you're constantly frustrated at your job and having fits of anger ever day from losing arguments. You'll probably end up with a heart attack too from all the stress of constantly losing.

       Yea, that last point discredited him a bit, although he never called them Shills and I don't think Trump needs shills, he's got enough supporters who will gladly voice their opinion loudly. He didn't pay for commercials, he ain't paying for shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly think there is a lot of Trump supporters who frequent this sub and in turn downvote the posts they don't agree with. Now this whole Q thing has got them on an edge, they can't prove Q ever did anything. How many threads came up asking for Q evidence of being right and nothing ever came of it?

       Similar to pizzagate. No proof concrete enough for the naysayers (Big shocker there) but over on Voat I've seen some awfully compelling stuff. There's always going to be people denying it as it's presented but many posts from Q have had correlative Trump tweets and other such "coincidences" and he's after hinting at some events that have happened very closely afterwards. Like I said. Nothing 100% concrete but it's enough for the people paying attention. I believe Q is at the very least strongly connected to POTUS.

       Right, brigades / voting patterns don't mean it was shills each time. But I don't understand why critics of government trust the top representative of government no matter what is said.

       There is a difference between trusting the top representative of government and accepting the mostly baseless attacks at face value.  I don't trust Trump but it does seem that people in powerful positions sure don't like him in power either and that makes me curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's just pretend somehow there is allowed to be a modern day JFK elected as president.  If that happened I would imagine he would be attacked at all angles to put forth an effort to legitimize him at every opportunity.  That's sort of what it looks like with Trump. IF that turns out to even be marginally true who am I to be tricked and join in with the herd to basically discredit him based on nothing.  If even a small amount of good for the people comes out of this administration it is worth giving them a chance to prove us wrong.  It really can't get much worse than the road we were heading down anyway.  Clinton was status quo.  Even if Trump does nothing more than stir the pot a bit and get people questioning the government that is a step in the right direction IMO.  I just want to see how things play out and don't want to be quick to join in on the impeach movement which is really just based on feels at the moment.

       What is your reasoning? Anyone who uses the word Torah is a shill now? You said it twice now. That's stupid logic, makes you look even more suspect than you already are to users on this sub.

       It's great to be skeptical. It's silly to dismiss. It seems like you're primarily doing the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I implore you to step down from your pedestal and admit with the rest of us that none of us know.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many reasons to take Q seriously. There are also many reasons to doubt his validity. Read it all with that attitude and come back to us with a reasoned judgment. Anything else is a waste of everyone's time.

       He's an anonymous 4 chan user that makes these posts that get tons of followers and readers. He claims to have inside knowledge, but speaks in weird "beating around the bush" code words and uses loose language thats open to interpretation. Nobody knows what the hell hes talking about, but everyone claims to be able to decipher his bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's resulted in a big fuck fest of confusion and division. Thankfully, r/conspiracy is far smarter than the userbase of 4chan...

       Well objectively the Holocaust or "sacrifice offerring to the gods" doesnt make sense to a modern truth seeker with internet access.  What tipped of a pleb like me is when Obama said to a crowd how evil Holocaust denial was.  Right away i knew it was worth looking into it.

       The 6 million number wasn't used until the 1960's and has been used loosely for centuries.  In the USA you are taught about nazi and the holocaust in Grade 3, so you have a hard time breaking free from this conditioning.
 The various "death camps"  kill counts fluctuate by the million as time passes but always add up to the magical 6mil number.

       Other than a brief association and friendship with Epstein which was publicly rescinded by Trump, no. He seems to be one of the rare one's who's

       Trump and epstien are life long best friends. Trump had more numbers in Epsteins little black book than anyone. Trump talked about their mutual love of young women. Trump kept one of epstiens sex slaves at Maralago. It's confirmed that trump was on Lolita express at least once but never appeared in the logs. So we have no idea how many times Trump flew but we do know that Epstein actively removed him from the logs, something he did for no one else.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not even getting into the actions of Trump himself. Like walking into the changing rooms of little girls to try and see them naked.

       Trump may have been on Lolita Express once but it never went to Lolita Island with Trump on board. Nice attempt at muddying the waters, though, to make it sound like Trump visited the island. But unlike the Clintons, Trump never visited Lolita Island.

       We already know epstien purged trumps names from the flight logs. Trump is the only person who epstien did this for as far as we know. We don't know how many times Trump visited the island because of this favor. You do sure pick a strange time to believe a pedophile 100%. That's not even getting into the sex slave at maralago that trump kept for his own use provided by epstien. Also the whole pleading the 5th when epstien was asked about trump raping children

       I have noticed a similar pattern in the voting process. After i have made a few posts now.( long time lurker, newer participant) while lurking not much changes in comments section. Usually seems like a dialouge when reading.
Signed in however.... Post a question then wait for reply. So I thought at first. After posting a couple of times when going back to respond to what Ive asked at. First can look on screen like q and a dialouge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check back later and see my responses to a comment made earlier is then shifted around and not placed like reading before, (changing due to vote stature i guess?) to read like i didnt respond or was downvoted and accused of idk what. Point being some of this entertainment. But I can see where some of the confusion leads to conflict better now.

       You're excluding a
       <em>
        very fucking obvious
       </em>
       "pressure point," which is using the word "hoax" or calling into question the basic claims of mass shooting events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here I am, commenting that there isn't any video of bullets striking anything in Las Vegas (objective fact which anyone on earth is welcome to try to disprove) sitting at -31 downvotes, with a random guy commenting saying "my friend got shot in the arm" (unsubstantiated internet bullshit claim) and sitting at 34 upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you agree with me, the contrast is stark. Does this seem like a marketplace of ideas? An evidence-based critical discussion?

       Anyway, they are alerted by the word "hoax" the same way Cockran is notified when anyone mentions the Apollo moon landings.

       Hey Joe_jaywalker.  Ive been expanding my investigation to other hoax shootings and the Pulse Night Club follows the same MO as Las Vegas.  Lots of video evidence and anomalies caught on video.  We'll keep focus on Vegas for now but just wanted to say there are likely more hoaxes that have occured and future ones planned, but Vegas sticks out like a sore thumb.

       Oh yeah the Pulse thing was part of the same ongoing parade of hoax shootings. Like Las Vegas there can only be seen civilians attempting to carry "victims" away, throw them into trucks, etc. with no actual medical response taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
       People several times have asked me "do you think the hundreds of doctors and nurses are all in on it too?" and the simple answer is that if there are no real victims there are no real hospital stays or hospital bills. And the first thing that comes to my mind is how we know hospitals and their staff can be made to participate in mass casualty incidents.

       Fight against Trump, and fight against pizzagate guys! These are the pressure points! Thanks for the keen insight OP! I had no idea. Let's resist guys, we hate conspiracies!

       It would work best if we divide into a "pizzagate team" a "Q anon is fake omg! team" and a "resist Trump" team. We can work more efficiently that way.

       and by the way, I've seen it really be hit or miss on pro-trump versus anti-trump.  If anything, I've seen more legitimate pro-Trump comments be downvoted.  Really depends on which thread your in.  Someone could quickly test this theory though, with two similarly but oppositely weighted opinions on one of your "3 pressure points".

       I think its just that Reddit is mostly adolescents, and adolescents mostly are stupid-by-design (thanks, nature), and are more likely to believe all kinds of stupid shit.

       That silly crap like pizzagate and Q propagate is surely almost entirely to the incomplete brains of kids or to really stupid people.

       Pizzagate is dumb, but real shit that is real is different. Real shit has been proven, has harm under its belt; 4chans silly code word list is not real, and has shown zero harm, but has actually caused significant harm against innocents.

       They're an admin-condoned harassment sub, they refer to the people they mock and harass as "Top Minds", a satire to reflect that the people they make fun of supposedly think they've got everything figured out while discussing that which is not part of a specific set of accepted group think, the accepted group think being typically aligned with MSM and Shareblue narrative. They regularly brigade threads of the mentioned topics and more.
