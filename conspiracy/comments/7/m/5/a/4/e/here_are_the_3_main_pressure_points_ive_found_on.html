<p>Edit: starting to even out now</p>

<p>Try and make an In depth post about any of these things, and if they aren&#39;t able to bury your thread, they will most certainly infiltrate the comments section of it and take control of the narrative. </p>

<p><strong>So, keep hammering these pressure points. These seem to be relatively sensitive and vital subjects that the shills are paid to prop up, and bury any criticism of. Keep slowly eroding away at them and forcing these topics to the forefront of the discussion.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, that last point discredited him a bit, although he never called them Shills and I don&#39;t think Trump needs shills, he&#39;s got enough supporters who will gladly voice their opinion loudly. He didn&#39;t pay for commercials, he ain&#39;t paying for shills.</p>

<p>I honestly think there is a lot of Trump supporters who frequent this sub and in turn downvote the posts they don&#39;t agree with. Now this whole Q thing has got them on an edge, they can&#39;t prove Q ever did anything. How many threads came up asking for Q evidence of being right and nothing ever came of it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar to pizzagate. No proof concrete enough for the naysayers (Big shocker there) but over on Voat I&#39;ve seen some awfully compelling stuff. There&#39;s always going to be people denying it as it&#39;s presented but many posts from Q have had correlative Trump tweets and other such &quot;coincidences&quot; and he&#39;s after hinting at some events that have happened very closely afterwards. Like I said. Nothing 100% concrete but it&#39;s enough for the people paying attention. I believe Q is at the very least strongly connected to POTUS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between trusting the top representative of government and accepting the mostly baseless attacks at face value.  I don&#39;t trust Trump but it does seem that people in powerful positions sure don&#39;t like him in power either and that makes me curious. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s just pretend somehow there is allowed to be a modern day JFK elected as president.  If that happened I would imagine he would be attacked at all angles to put forth an effort to legitimize him at every opportunity.  That&#39;s sort of what it looks like with Trump. IF that turns out to even be marginally true who am I to be tricked and join in with the herd to basically discredit him based on nothing.  If even a small amount of good for the people comes out of this administration it is worth giving them a chance to prove us wrong.  It really can&#39;t get much worse than the road we were heading down anyway.  Clinton was status quo.  Even if Trump does nothing more than stir the pot a bit and get people questioning the government that is a step in the right direction IMO.  I just want to see how things play out and don&#39;t want to be quick to join in on the impeach movement which is really just based on feels at the moment. </p>

<p>There are many reasons to take Q seriously. There are also many reasons to doubt his validity. Read it all with that attitude and come back to us with a reasoned judgment. Anything else is a waste of everyone&#39;s time.</p>

<p>The 6 million number wasn&#39;t used until the 1960&#39;s and has been used loosely for centuries.  In the USA you are taught about nazi and the holocaust in Grade 3, so you have a hard time breaking free from this conditioning.
 The various &quot;death camps&quot;  kill counts fluctuate by the million as time passes but always add up to the magical 6mil number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have noticed a similar pattern in the voting process. After i have made a few posts now.( long time lurker, newer participant) while lurking not much changes in comments section. Usually seems like a dialouge when reading.
Signed in however.... Post a question then wait for reply. So I thought at first. After posting a couple of times when going back to respond to what Ive asked at. First can look on screen like q and a dialouge.</p>

<p>Check back later and see my responses to a comment made earlier is then shifted around and not placed like reading before, (changing due to vote stature i guess?) to read like i didnt respond or was downvoted and accused of idk what. Point being some of this entertainment. But I can see where some of the confusion leads to conflict better now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re excluding a <em>very fucking obvious</em> &quot;pressure point,&quot; which is using the word &quot;hoax&quot; or calling into question the basic claims of mass shooting events.</p>

<p>Here I am, commenting that there isn&#39;t any video of bullets striking anything in Las Vegas (objective fact which anyone on earth is welcome to try to disprove) sitting at -31 downvotes, with a random guy commenting saying &quot;my friend got shot in the arm&quot; (unsubstantiated internet bullshit claim) and sitting at 34 upvotes.</p>

<p>Whether or not you agree with me, the contrast is stark. Does this seem like a marketplace of ideas? An evidence-based critical discussion?</p>

<p>Anyway, they are alerted by the word &quot;hoax&quot; the same way Cockran is notified when anyone mentions the Apollo moon landings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Joe_jaywalker.  Ive been expanding my investigation to other hoax shootings and the Pulse Night Club follows the same MO as Las Vegas.  Lots of video evidence and anomalies caught on video.  We&#39;ll keep focus on Vegas for now but just wanted to say there are likely more hoaxes that have occured and future ones planned, but Vegas sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah the Pulse thing was part of the same ongoing parade of hoax shootings. Like Las Vegas there can only be seen civilians attempting to carry &quot;victims&quot; away, throw them into trucks, etc. with no actual medical response taking place. </p>

<p>People several times have asked me &quot;do you think the hundreds of doctors and nurses are all in on it too?&quot; and the simple answer is that if there are no real victims there are no real hospital stays or hospital bills. And the first thing that comes to my mind is how we know hospitals and their staff can be made to participate in mass casualty incidents. </p>
