<p>Don&#39;t let this place turn into a fucking 4 chan, where it&#39;s essentially a pro trump cult obsessed over the predictions of &quot;Q&quot;, and taking the bait of his pro trump/pro government PR. </p>

<p>AT LEAST don&#39;t be so quick to jump in and take everything this dude says as the Torah. If you can even understand what the hell hes saying. </p>

<p>He says random coded words/jibberish, and people make these ridiculous connections and reaches based on what he posts. Then everybody runs with it like its the truth. </p>

<p>To me, not only is this Q stuff instilling a trust within Trump, (which is part of the psy op, recruiting more cult members), but it&#39;s just keeping us spinning our wheels and distracting us from real developments that we should be focusing on.</p>

<p>Focus on the evidence, and don&#39;t put all your eggs in the basket of this potential bullshit artist. Think, &quot;If Q IS an engineered psy op distraction, why would the social engineers want me to be focused on it so much? What do they gain from this?&quot; </p>

<p>Can you tho, tell us what we’re being distracted from. Since you haven’t fallen prey to the psy op this should be easy for you. What have we missed? Again, Qs questions and answers deal with real
world events not open ended conspiracy questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So quiet... I will never understand posts like this. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. How can you know any of these things for certain? And for those who actually are unpacking Q and doing good work, you are shitting on because you cannot keep up.</p>

<p>If you want to disregard Q, you are most welcome to, but screw off with this shame bullshit about how we spend our time/energy  here. Q has been probably the most entertaining conspiracy topic of the year for myself and I don&#39;t &#39;believe&#39; in Q by any means.... His drops stand on their own merit. If you can&#39;t keep up, broaden your horizons and study up. It&#39;s been a really fun ride to this point.</p>

<p>And as others have mentioned, if you have some great truth to share, lay it on us! But to act like you have it figured out and we should all just trust that you&#39;re right seems just as hasty and foolish as blindly trusting Q, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>So back it up or shut up and let people make their own decisions. Don&#39;t hold it against the rest of us if you can&#39;t keep up.</p>
