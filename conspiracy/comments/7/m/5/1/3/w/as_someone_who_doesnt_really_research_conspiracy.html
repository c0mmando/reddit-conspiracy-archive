       WAR is a racket. It always has been.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small "inside" group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.

       Everyone is being played, but the world is the result of our individual choices, and we can change course anytime we want; nevertheless, the players continue to advance their agenda.
       <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/">
        The players are a globally dominant cabal
       </a>
       , but they still need to maintain the illusion of legitimacy until they have sufficient power over every individual in the world. They foment most of the conflict in the world because it 1) profits them, 2) prevents us from focusing on them, and 3) can be used as a pretext to justify more of a police state. They perpetrated 9/11 for that purpose. They manufactured anthropogenic global warming alarmism to justify global government.
       <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/coming-alien-hoax-peaceful-invasion-extermination/">
        They will do the same with an alien hoax
       </a>
       if they think they can get away with it. Flat earth, the Mandela effect, and other such ludicrous theories are designed to divide, waste time, and smear poo on real conspiracies. They definitely don't want you to know about WTC 7 or the Pennsylvania wreckage pattern, which they have kept out of the MSM 100% ... globally ... for 15 years. (They messed up.)

       For me, the greatest conspiracy is the one where you believe you cannot be free. The road to freedom and inner peace is the key.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inner precedes the outer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inner harmony would spawn outer harmony and create a true world Utopia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am optimistic humanity will soon globally free itself from the self imposed shackles of limitations, of hatred, fear, greed, ignorance.

       I am suspicious why a 2,000 yr old holiday that is broadly observed but never specifically named in MSM. It’s as though the “birth of Jesus” was being suppressed. I mean, for those that don’t believe they can just ignore it or laugh.

       War is good for business. Infinite energy exists but oil companies don't want you to know that. There is a cure for  cancer but the medical and pharmaceutical industry doesn't want you to know that. Most of our food and water is no good for us. Consumption and debt is modern day slavery.

       The War on Drugs and The War on Terror are both massive money-making scams, essentially. Not meant to be "won." The superficial "left-right" paradigm in American politics is a distraction. Mainstream news media/narrative is not "free press," but on the contrary is pretty much completely compromised/controlled at this point and, more often than not, cannot be trusted.

       That there's people who run America and its systems that have aided Nazis and a small group of families really run the world. Look into the Bushes or Warburgs to give you just a taste.

       Living a minimalist lifestyle and buying what you do need from others that also live minimalist lifestyle is the best way to defeat them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with this is we need a community that does this to build a decentralized counterculture within cu4rent society.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example a group of people that buy food in bulk from a good source sell to other minimalist and then buy from the person they sell things they need.
