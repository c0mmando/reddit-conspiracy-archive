       Richard Serino was placed at the Boston Marathon finish line before and after the bombs went off:

       DHS Partnered with BAA, MEMA, MA National Guard, MA Fire Services, Natick and Hopkinton Police Departments. Road closures coordinated and scheduled using NICS. Natick Police used NICS SA to coordinate bank robbery response

      </p>
      <p>
       Police response training planned but bombs hit first... Last fall a slew of agencies including Boston Police and the police departments, the Coast Guard, and the MBTA joined forces to confront a simulated armed bank robbery
      </p>
      <p>
       they had already planned a mass casualty drill which include the use of backpacks filled with explosives

       we know different agencies resources were deployed to the Boston Marathon prior to the bombing

       so my question for you all is:
      </p>
      <p>
       what exactly was Richard Serino doing at the Boston Marathon finish line April 15, 2013 if not a mass casualty drill?

       According to Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen, Bill Richard had just completed the marathon and Martin went out to hug his father and returned to his mother and sister just as the first bomb exploded

       Two different sources identify the female next to the boy who died as "MOM". This female somehow has the foreknowledge to flee the scene before the bomb goes off, killing the boy

       After public uproar, the FBI reluctantly "fake arrested" the female suspect, because her involvement was so obvious and well documented. She was never identified, which is odd because she clearly was "arrested"

       It was to establish in the public mind that law enforcement could lock down your city and search door to door for any reason they determined.   A test case, a small sample training to see how it would go and how people would react, so that later, when the time comes, they will know how do it to the entire country.

       Kept demanding "evidence" though I never made any claims or shared any info with. I just called bullshit on his claim of reading everything there was on SH. The brigading and strawman smashing in that thread may be more than I have ever seen in one place. It is what got me thinking and reminded me of the Rosin FEMA links. Thanks guys!!

       My question to all this is, how were the first responders and medical personal fooled? Why did medical doctors go on camera and give information about injuries to fake crisis actors? And how was it ensured that not one single hospital employee or first responder has come forward to point out that the actors were faking there injuries?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example two medical doctors are mentioned in
       <a href="http://www.wbur.org/news/2014/04/09/boston-marathon-doctors-reflect">
        this article
       </a>
       . Is the theory that they are so ignorant that they can't tell faked injuries from real? Or are they part of this conspiracy?

       You must know (since it took me all of five minutes to figure it out) that there is a very simple explanation for why the incorrect photo may have been shown, correct? Assuming that is the same person, there is a very prosaic explanation that doesn't require a complex fake bombing.

       what you probably don't know about Joanna Leigh is that the online hacktivist collective known as anonymous took a keen interest in her case.
      </p>
      <p>
       after she got her $8000, she decided she needed more money. of course, anonymous was not amused by her disgusting greed, but within the context off all the other greed, she seemed like a small fish.
      </p>
      <p>
       so a plan was devised, to leverage her greed against the greed of all the other shysters. if she was going to get more money, then that means someone else was going to have to get less money, and as we all know these criminals are not going to go for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       so anonymous took up her cause, and started building online support for her to get more money. of course, at the time it appeared as if anonymous was being helpful to her, but they were just trolling her and the rest of the perps
      </p>
      <p>
       and before you know it, the rest of the shysters decided to throw her under the bus, and have her charged with fraud, and this action gave anonymous a solid example of people faking their injuries at the Boston Marathon

My wife missed me crossing the finish line of my last marathon because she stepped away for a moment, yet no bomb went off go figure. It's almost as if in a large crowd people come and go.

       You do know that the part of the marathon the crowd stays for was long over by the time the bombs went off, right? The race clock was over 4 hours at that point, the star runners who people might have crowded to see were back in their hotels having lunch by then. The only people watching would have been mostly people waiting for relatives or friends and would have been coming and going pretty steadily.

       right. so that totally undermines the narrative about Richard Serino milling around watching losers finish,

       which also makes you wonder why, if the Tsarnaev's wanted to disrupt the marathon, why they wouldn't have pulled it off sooner, to disrupt the winners and ruin the whole race...

       You are arguing with yourself. I have never heard that they wanted to "disrupt the marathon". Is it claimed they said that? Or are you just making up arguments in your head and then winning them?

       Let's see, she had to go to the restroom, her husband just finished the race (actually most like from having been to many marathons, how many have you been to again?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you provide some proof of how she had foreknowledge. In fact here is where you can become a star. Use all your research powers, your truth seeking, to find out who she is. Then research why and how she is connected. In other words do some real research instead of proving to the grown ups of the world how smart you are. You have one distinct target, you've had 5 years already. Why are you still providing vague "look at this video or photo" crap and not providing one single tangible piece of real evidence?

       I agree with that. But isn't it possible for there to be a real attack and then bring in some prop kids for PR? The shit about the whole thing being faked is stupid, it's definitely a combination of real attack and fake PR photos.

       No evidence, it's just what I'd do if I wanted to make a false flag. Plant a real bomb, set up some suspects and set up media and props for PR. Then we have people grieving real deaths on social media while spreading fake PR pics around and not realizing that the whole thing was planned.

      <p>
       How can you tell that from the photo? How can you tell the extent of 1) her injuries 2) what sort of pain she is experiencing 3) how far into shock she may be, solely from that one photo?

       They found the shells of RELOADABLE kits there and then the pyros association speculates if it could have been the original consumer based product.

       If you now found the official report saying otherwise you got some solid stuff. If not its once again trying to spin your opinion as fact.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The fireworks industry is heavily regulated by multiple U.S. federal regulatory agencies in addition to state and local regulations with regard to manufacture, transportation, storage, sales and use.  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) are the primary federal agencies with oversight of consumer fireworks such as the reloadable fireworks devices purchased by the older Tsarnaev brother.  All consumer fireworks are subject to strict pyrotechnic composition limitations as well as construction requirements," said Julie L. Heckman, Executive Director of the APA.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fireworks devices allegedly found during the investigation were two reloadable aerial shell kits, each containing 24 small aerial shells.  These types of devices contain limited quantities of explosive or combustible chemical composition designed to deflagrate (burn) rather than detonate like dynamite, TNT or military explosives.   The specific firework devices that have been linked to Tsarnaev contain a maximum of 60 grams, or roughly 2 ounces, of pyrotechnic composition per aerial shell.  Additionally, each aerial shell is limited to no more than 130 milligrams (or 0.005 oz.) of explosive composition, less than three aspirin tablets, which produce a firecracker-like aerial effect inside the shell.  Consumer fireworks are thermally stable and do not present a mass explosion hazard as manufactured and transported.  Again, consumer fireworks are designed to burn or deflagrate, rather than function by explosion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Could these consumer fireworks devices be used to produce a pipe bomb or pressure cooker bomb like the bombs involved at the Boston marathon?  Perhaps;  however,  it would take a significant volume of these small aerial shells to extract the volume of chemicals necessary to create a significant blast and it would be extremely time consuming and dangerous to disassemble the shells to collect the minute amount of pyrotechnic composition in each shell.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contrary to media reports, consumer fireworks have rarely been used in such destructive activities, especially since there is a vast array of alternate energetic materials widely available via the internet, hobby stores, home improvement centers, etc., which are far easier to obtain, considerably less expensive to purchase, and significantly less time-consuming to deconstruct and obtain material from if someone wanted to cause destruction or harm.  In fact, according to data routinely distributed by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), consumer fireworks are rarely used for destructive activities, with the exception of the failed Times Square bombing incident in 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        Heckman noted that, at present, we know that two reloadable consumer fireworks aerial shell kits were purchased by the older Tsarnaev brother.  The total amount of pyrotechnic composition in two such unopened kits would be considerably less than the amount of explosive material believed to have been used in Boston.  In addition, there has been no evidence or federal agency report citing that the fireworks were actually used but rather, were simply found, and there was no observation of colors and other visual effects observed when the blasts occurred which would typically be associated with fireworks.  "We believe it is virtually impossible to create the level of destruction and devastation caused in Boston with legitimate consumer fireworks and suspect that the investigation will ultimately point toward other materials being responsible for the creation of the deadly pressure cooker bombs," said Heckman.
       </p>
       <p>
        The APA and members of the professional fireworks industry pledge our on-going support and assistance to the investigation.  Our thoughts and prayers are with all Bostonians and especially the families and victims who suffered from this senseless act of terrorism.

       So there is nothing here that indicates this was a hoax or anything. Just the pyros saying this bomb was
       <em>
        probably not
       </em>
       made with just consumer based goods.

       The guys that know and profit from said products say there is nothing wrong with them. So?

       are you suggesting that this backpack was NOT used in the Boston Marathon Bombing?

      <p>
       i'd be happy to consider any other backpacks which you could produce evidence for the existence thereof

       I dont know if it was. Thats the point here. Nor do you. You just assume it was the one - because you want to believe it.

       so you are arguing over whether the exploded backpack in the photograph was the exact same backpack that was supposedly exploded at the boston marathon?

       we can talk about whichever backpack you are willing to present as the backpack in question.

       until you can provide an alternative backpack, we will proceed under the assumption that the backpack cited by me is the correct one

       and again you distract with some random bullshit. Why is it so hard for you to day: I dont know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there was no backpack, maybe the backpack was ripped apart, maybe all traces of the backpack are gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is no evidence for anything. If you dint care about sources then this is at best a lead. Which vanishes quite quickly if you think about the fact that someone wrote "FBI" on it without having anything that connects the FBI to it. Like someone just wanted to fool biased people.

       For someone who spends so much time with conspiracy theories you sure tend to believe a lot if it fits your narrative.

      <p>
       No you are not. You appear to be a child, at least in maturity if not in actual years, who is trying to get the grown ups to argue with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       These links aren't arguments, and pasting two pictures next to each other with an un-proven declaration is not an argument. But I will tell you why the counter argument I usually hear (an actual attempt at a reasoned argument) is, IMO false.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument usually goes "Look at big government secret projects, such as The Manhattan Project or the development of secret aircraft, they involve large numbers of people and no one talked".
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is a valid point. However the successful programs like that involve things where the workers are working for a shared and un-controversial goal. For instance during WWII support for the war effort was about as close to 100% as you are ever going to find, and among defense workers like those on The Manhattan Project it surely would have been 100%. So there would be no reason for anyone to "talk".
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare to the Boston Bombings or any other "false flag" terror attack. At least some of the people up close and personal would have been random first responders, medical workers and doctors (a marathon of any size always has an MD on hand). For the bombing to be fake they would have had to keep their mouths shut about a massive lie that they A: Did not want to be part of and B: Is obviously a nefarious plot AGAINST the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare and contrast defense workers who willingly go to work to fight a shared enemy with a randomly selected public employee or medical worker. Group A would be expected to keep quite, Group B would not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other argument is usually "No one would believe them". There are again problems with that. The mainstream media might not accept their stories as proven. But the stories would be out there. For instance things like COINTELPRO and The Tuskegee syphilis experiment were exposed by whistle blowers. The widespread knowledge of them came after extensive hearings and stories, but they started with whistleblowers speaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The catch to the second counter argument is that it is hard work exposing something like this. Posting jpegs on the internet is not really doing work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this answers your petulant multi link posting. I honestly think you have some personal issues or perhaps worse and feel somewhat guilty for talking to you this long. I will not reply to you further.

       I remember reading they were not allowed to go to the bomb site to assist the victims. From photos you can certainly see that is true. Paramedics were told to stay where they were past the finish line and race volunteers were the ones to assist getting victims to paramedics and ambulances. Perhaps this was intentional to hide fake injuries. I know I found it really odd. Especially considering some paramedics were already stationed right past the finish line to help racers with injury and over exhaustion.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the tourniquets used would have worked to stop blood flow from serious injuries as none of them were properly tied or made of the right things to be tied tight enough. One guy, who basically had now lower legs left, left the scene concious, sitting upright in a wheelchair, not bleeding despite not having any flesh below the knee and he only had two visibly loose shoe laces for tourniquets. He really should have been dead. At the very least unconscious or in shock. But according to reports and his account, he staid concious through his ambulance ride where he identified the bombers as the two brothers, saying their description, but not that they left the backpacks or anything substantial. Just that they looked suspicious. In reality, it is him and his survival after such substantial wounds, delay and lack of  proper medical attention.

       When a bomb goes off you always wait to make sure its the only one before the paramedics go in, as many times the bomber will have secondary explosives to catch those who run in to help.

       and by sheer coincidence within days of this drill some actual terrorists create a real mass casualty incident using a backpack filled with explosives?

       I considered that possibility too, but a few paramedics should go in and assist those in real need. Sending in young race volunteers who know nothing about medicine would cost people their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s possible that is the reason, but it’s also still very strange they would not run over there regardless in the chaos. If no one was suspecting this to happen, I doubt they would think to not go over there, at least one to asses injuries and direct how volunteers could help.
      </p>
      <p>
       This alone could maybe be nothing, but when paired with other weird occurrences around the event, it makes it strange.

       Is a paramedic mentioned by name who claims to have treated victims. Are you saying he was duped by makeup and old injuries or that Walter Dunbar, EMT is part of the cover up?

       I have no comment as I have never treated bombing victims, or even been involved in medicine in any way.

       You know this how? What is your background that allows you to make that judgement? Also how many times have you heard emergency workers or doctors refer to a recovery or survival as "a miracle"?

       Well, a tourniquet needs to at least be wrapped around the injury tightly to work. The only way to see from a distant photo if a tourniquet would work is if the tourniquet is visibly so loose that it can be seen to have gaps or is draping, which is the case from the photos. That is the only reason I mention it. The tourniquets in one photo were so visibly loose, it’s clear they served no function to stop bleeding. I don’t have military medical experience, but a close friend of mine was a medic in Iraq and Afghanistan for 6 years and he had some serious issues with what he saw in the photos from that day, specifically with regards to that guy. He brought up stats on why survival rates of those who lost limbs can be higher for people actively serving in the military vs. when those injuries occur in the general public because many serving military are equipped with easy to use and very effective tourniquets for such occasion and that medic air evac is usually arriving to an injured military person within 8 min in many areas of (either) Iraq or Afghanistan (I cannot right now remember which area he was saying that was for). I have medical training, but am not military.
      </p>
      <p>
       Severe Injury to the femoral artery (or severing) causes a rapid loss of blood without proper tourniquetting. So much so, a person slips into shock rapidly (a matter of a couple minutes) due to blood loss and can bleed to death in under 10 min. If you have severing off a lower limb, without proper tourniquet method used, and have the person sitting up with the major injury being held below their heart due to posture, that person will rapidly decline and then die. It’s really a matter of minuets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy with both of his legs blown off at the knee was seen barely bleeding, with no tourniquets, sitting up in a wheelchair, never loosing consciousness and continued communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a miracle occurred that day, but it’s very unlikely for what was shown to have played out to be legitimate.

       So your source for the story of the century is literally a guy you know who used to be a military medic who saw it on television or photos?
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW: The absurdity of the above aside, have you ever pondered why a world full of other medics, doctors and nursed did not notice this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also have you ever run a major marathon? They are literally crawling with medical personal and various other first responders. There is probably no better place to have a bombing, so far as having immediate treatment available, than the finish line of a marathon.

       You really believe that doctors and other medical personnel don’t know how tourniquets work unless they served in the military? Come on now, that’s truly bankrupt logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that was my exact point. The finish line where the bombing occurred had medical personnel working the event within 100 feet of the incident, yet those medics did not go over and assist the injured. At least a few should have gone over and helped asses injuries, and help volunteers addressing those injured. But from the countless photos taken immediately after the bombing, that did not happen. They had volunteers and race attendees assisting, doing a piss poor job of it (which is not the helpers fault, they just did not have medical training).
      </p>
      <p>
       The medical professionals I know who have seen the photos of these severely injured people find it very suspect, 1, that trained medical professionals were not addressing the injuries, 2, that volunteers were moving some severely injured persons in ways that would actually make their injuries worse, 3, that a few survivors had severe trauma without bleeding that would correspond with that trauma. The issue is that most are exposed to images on the news and are not actively looking up all the other images made available online of the event. Those who have seen the additional images find it suspect, but those who have not seen more than a handful of photos that aren’t provided in a timeline fashion are unable to see the oddities of the event because they simply have not seen exactly what took place.

       No, he was not the only one to notice the issue, neither was I the only one to notice the issue with the tourniquets. It’s actually an issue I have discussed with many medical professionals, all of them having an issue with anyone surviving both legs being blown off with no blood loss and no tourniquets, topped with no loss of consciousness, no shock.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all the footage and back to back photos taken immediately following the bomb explosion, there is no footage showing paramedics going in to help those at the site of the event. There was also news reports that said paramedics were held off and volunteers stepped up to help. Just look up the photos and you will see paramedics made no appearance there, which is why volunteers are shown removing people improperly and in ways that would make injuries worse and/or more deadly.

       Isn't this common procedure at crime scenes? The police must clear the area before EMTs etc. are ordered in. Under those circumstances I can see bystanders helping. Or are you saying the EMTs were held back, but bystanders were allowed in but they were all fooled?

       Almost all "victims" and the younger brother were brought to a special part of Beth Israel Deaconess medical center. This special wing for lack of a better word was constructed/donated by Israeli's(maybe Israeli government but not sure). It was completed just one year before the bombing and you can find interviews with hospital staff saying they skipped normal triage/ER and were brought directly to this "wing".

       I am not concerned with your beliefs. You can see the choreography clear as day. Boston unbombing does an excellent job pointing it out. Any one can watch the video. I share the video and let folks draw their own conclusions. I don't care what that conclusion is because ultimately truth is a personal journey and even if every single person in Boston knows it was FF it would change nothing. Best regards

       Op I like this compilation of information and would like to offer this imgur post with some shared info and new info including an image of tamerlan in custody alive with no visible bruise marks and a picture of his at the morgue that shows numerous bruises. It also mentions and shows pictures of two suspects and an suv believed to belong to Craft Internationals a CIA linked company. A screencap of a post on one of the chans before the bombing happened, images of the suspects with clearly different backpacks (white and gray vs the black one that was found) and a picture showing some spooks carrying the exact black backpack with white tag, there is also a supposed picture showing the principal murdered during sandy hook appearing also as a casualty at the marathon. kudos and keep up the good work

       [NSFW] [NSFL] This photo is supposedly of a dead Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Tamerlan supposedly had just been in a gun fight with police. How many bullet holes do you see? Zoom in on his neck and you can see the brushstrokes where the "blood" was applied

       it says:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As he has been for many years Serino was at the finish line for the Boston Marathon this year, bet left about 15 minutes before the two bombs went off, killing 3 people and wounding more than 260 others. He rushed back to the finish line and watched as the EMS first responders, other public safety employees, and citizens rushed to help.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "They did an unbelievable, amazing job that day" Serino said of Boston EMS and other first responders.

      <p>
       "unbelievable" indeed
      </p>
      <p>
       so, we can agree that the Boston Globe does not actually specify what Richard Serino was doing at the Boston Marathon finish line in 2013, so therefore the most simple and plausible explanation is that he was doing what he had done in previous years, which is to have a DHS urban shield mass casualty drill, where they waste taxpayers dollars training for unrealistic scenarios, while building the infrastructure for a permanent police state

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        so, we can agree that the Boston Globe does not actually specify what Richard Serino was doing at the Boston Marathon finish line in 2013, so therefore the most simple and plausible explanation is that he was doing what he had done in previous years, which is to have a DHS urban shield mass casualty drill

       why wouldn't there be a drill, considering the fact that Richard Serino has served as an incident commander for over 35 mass casualty incidents and for ALL of Boston's major planned events, including the Boston Marathon
      </p>
      <p>
       why would he skip this mass casualty drill if he showed up to all the other ones? was he too drunk from celebrating patriots day?

       I already answered this. Until I see evidence that indicates otherwise, there is no reason not to believe he was just a fan of the marathon (which he'd been going to for decades) watching the race with everyone else.

       Actually, I have a simple answer to this. I would accept for any of your claims any evidence that supports the claim you are making
       <em>
        but cannot be explained by alternative means, and especially by simpler alternative means.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the reason you and I are disagreeing. To me, evidence is only evidence if it has one meaning and one meaning only. If two people can disagree about something's meaning, then it's not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, I would require
       <em>
        conclusive
       </em>
       evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd ask again: name what thing I could show you that would convince you that Richard Serino was just watching the race?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also ask: what could I show you that would convince you that there was no training exercise that day?
      </p>
      <p>
       This would mean that you have to accept that you are wrong in your interpretation of all the other data that is out there. What would it take--what could I show you--that would convince you of that?

       a mass casualty drill makes much more sense that some radical muslims bombing people with no apparent motive. theres a reason that motive is such an important part of a major crime. thus far nobody has even suggested a motive that would seem plausible, and the fact that they were allegedly muslim is not evidence or motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       theres plenty of evidence provided, its just a matter of how far you are willing to go to ignore it and/or explain it away with absurd, unbelievable and ultimately unacceptable speculations.
      </p>
      <p>
       your prism analogy is basically a shaggy dog story.

        That's the reason you and I are disagreeing. To me, evidence is only evidence if it has one meaning and one meaning only. If two people can disagree about something's meaning, then it's not evidence.

       wow, did you think that nonsense up all by yourself? or did you plagiarize it from some other idiot? id be happy to consider any credible source you can cite to support this claim
      </p>
      <p>
       "your honor, the defense moves to have the fingerprint evidence striken because its not really evidence because some idiot somewhere, someday might conceivably come up with some alternative explanation for why my bloody fingerprints are all over the crime scene"
      </p>
      <p>
       yeah, lets see how far that argument gets your client.

      <p>
       cool. so where is the "conclusive evidence" that the Tsarnaev's killed anyone, or that they were even at the Boston Marathon on the day in question?
      </p>
      <p>
       now remember, even the most flimsy of alternative explanations will render your evidence null and void.

        I'd ask again: name what thing I could show you that would convince you that Richard Serino was just watching the race?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       if you could actually produce any of this evidence that you assume exists, then maybe we could discuss it, but so far there is no evidence to support that alibi.
      </p>
      <p>
       why do you keep asking about hypothetical evidence that we both know does not exist, while ignoring the evidence that does exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       the evidence which has been provided thus far all points to Richard Serino doing a mass casualty drill, as he had in previous years
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I would also ask: what could I show you that would convince you that there was no training exercise that day?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       well instead of asking about imaginary evidence that doesn't actually exist, maybe we should focus on the evidence that does exist. or am i being unreasonable?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This would mean that you have to accept that you are wrong in your interpretation of all the other data that is out there. What would it take--what could I show you--that would convince you of that?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       are you prepared to admit you are wrong, and that your imaginary evidence doesn't really refute the actual evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       talking to sheep has piqued my interest in the psychology of sheep. like, how can a sheep ignore actual evidence in favor of imagined evidence, and then still consider himself intelligent? i see this behavior all the time. maybe ill write a paper on it someday if i figure it out.

       dont be silly. those things are only toxic outside of the context of a vaccine. if you put them into a vaccine, they become inert and harmless, beneficial even!
      </p>
      <p>
       but seriously
      </p>
      <p>
       i have sincerely and diligently looked for the root cause of Autism for over 3 years
      </p>
      <p>
       in 2016 i became a "one issue voter" and my issue was Autism
      </p>
      <p>
       if i was to summarize that wall of text above for you all, it would look like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rubella Causes Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubella">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubella
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_rubella_syndrome">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_rubella_syndrome
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       some cases of CRS later manifest as Autism- ASD
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       according to this study, vaccinating against Rubella prevents CRS, which in turn prevents ASD
      </p>
      <p>
       in other words, "vaccines prevent autism"
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-11-340">
        https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-11-340
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, "genetics" are often blamed for Autism, so which genes are responsible and what goes wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       it seems that many people are gravitating toward the MTHFR gene,
      </p>
      <p>
       and DME (drug metabolizing enzymes)
      </p>
      <p>
       basically, some people are not able to process toxins as efficiently as other people, so vaccines become toxic to them
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Brain Surgeon Dr Blaylock coined the term "Immuno-Excito_Toxicity" to describe the situation where the brains immune system is activated, and thus the brain itself becomes toxic as part of the immune reaction/funciton, but for whatever reasons (vaccine residue?) doesn't deactivate and detoxify

      </p>
      <p>
       to summarize my summary:
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past, Rubella infection caused a handful of CRS and ASD cases
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the Rubella in MMR vaccine causes millions of cases of ASD
      </p>
      <p>
       this is all supported in the documentation above, if anyone cares to spend a week looking at it all

       i have worked very hard and overturned every stone to find the root cause of autism
      </p>
      <p>
       and i think autism is the single biggest problem facing our society today
      </p>
      <p>
       and its getting much worse as we go
      </p>
      <p>
       we need to stop expanding vaccine schedules, just to please $MRK shareholders
      </p>
      <p>
       this is one of those situations like, you are out driving and you get lost, and you can either stop and ask for directions or keep driving. it looks like we as a society have decided to keep driving, getting farther and farther away from where we want to be

       I didnt check an of the links because I assume the ones that you posted me are your best pieces. And they are weak as fuck. Why do you call them evidence? Would you consider that evidence if that backpack was burned?

       ill present it, and you will offer a rebuttal. hopefully your rebuttal is more substantial than unsupported opinions

       As he has been for many years, professional mass casualty drill incident commander and FEMA deputy administrator Richard Serino was at the finish line for the Boston Marathon in 2013

       Uff I dont know if I wont lose interest, because the pieces you present may be evidence in your mind who is convinced anyway, but objectively seen they arent evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you got so much evidence, why not post your strongest one since that will be unrebuttable?
      </p>
      <p>
       However yeah that guy was there. And he was lucky to get out! Thats great news. Got a source saying he was mass casualty drill incident commander? Atleast if thats of relevance.

       i am an armchair psychologist.
      </p>
      <p>
       would you mind answering a few questions?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sincerely curious about how sheep think, because i think if we can understand that, then we can help sheep to not be fooled by fake news, and to learn how to think critically about all of the evidence, instead of just imagining that theres evidence and basing an opinion on this imagination
      </p>
      <p>
       1) would you mind describing the evidence that convinced you that either of the Tsarnaev brothers were at the Boston Marathon on April 15,2013
      </p>
      <p>
       2) after you have figured out that you can't describe or produce any evidence, would you mind explaining why you continue to believe something for which there is no evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       thats the definition of "faith": belief without evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) did "God" or some other voice in your head tell you that the Tsarnaev's did it?

       so once again you have no source and because you cant say "no" or "I dont know" you gotta distract😂

      <p>
       Look man I already told you that I dont know about the case. I dont even know how the dude is called nor do I know any of the evidence. However if he was spoken guilty then a judge passed that judgement. And I sure as fuck think that judges can do their job. I mean if you dont trust the judges then the whole legal system falls apart and democracy wouldnt work.
      </p>
      <p>
       So just the simple fact thatthe other guy got convicted and you present your "evidence" on a subreddit instead of a judge shows clearly who meets the legal minimum of "evidence" and who doesnt.

       If you wouldnt be biased to hell and back you would atleast know which evidence got him accused snd maybe even convicted.

       well just to give you an idea of how much time i have spent researching this one subject,
      </p>
      <p>
       i started following the story right when it happened, on April 15, 2013 and pretty much spent every spare moment i had, hours and hours every day, day after day, week after week without a break until August 28, 2014
      </p>

       i spent well over a year examining all of the evidence, regardless if it contradicted other evidence or not. how many defendants get the benefit of a jury taking a year to meticulously examine the evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       i have documented massive amounts of evidence from all sorts of places, and have only presented some of the evidence in the interest of staying focused on FEMA deputy admin Richard Serino and his 35 previous mass casualty drills

       the court case was a Hollywood production
      </p>
      <p>
       his lawyer, Judy Clarke, has a list of clients she represents in fake court cases. as a matter of fact, you could even say that anyone that Judy Clarke represents is probably a fake defendant.
      </p>
      <p>
       He supposedly plead guilty, which is convenient, because then no evidence has to be presented, which would be very problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
       the defendant, "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev" has been playing along with this charade as a crisis actor since the beginning, and that became obvious when he hid in the boat that had been prepared for him to hide in, while government agencies sealed off an entire city and went door to door looking for suspects, just like the mass casualty drill planned for.

       it was a guilty plea. probably scripted from the beginning of this psyop. his guilty was definitely NOT based on any sort of evidence, nor did he offer up any defense, which would have been very easy, considering the evidence presented in OP
      </p>
      <p>
       when it became obvious that DZ was playing along in his role as "bad guy" as part of a larger operation, it wasn't enough simply to say
      </p>
      <p>
       "free jahar" (DZ)
      </p>
      <p>
       based on some presumption of innocence.
      </p>
      <p>
       but if jahar was in fact innocent, then who is the real perp
      </p>
      <p>
       and that is answered in the OP
      </p>
      <p>
       im not calling for "free jahar"

       i can show you plenty of evidence for why he got accused and convicted, but thats not what this is about. I'm asking you what you know about the evidence, to illustrate the fact that you don't know anything.
      </p>

       there was no "evidence" presented at trial. research old newspaper accounts of the trial. it was a joke. fake suspect comes out with fake lawyer and pleads guilty.

       Not how it works. You cant make accusations without any serious leads. Either say that the evidence was faked or that he is a fake defendant. You mix all the arguments that come to mind in order to push your narrative. Thats just not how things work.

       nah you dont get to turn shit around. The evidence of the trial case is clear. You might get to another conclusion but it is there and its clear where it was found and such things.

       Your pieces dont meet that basic threshhold. Your made up bullshit only is believable if you want to push a narrative that you believe for literally no reasonable reason.

       yup. I've been spending many years looking at all the evidence of 9/11, and i have found myself looking at the 9/11 pot hole as "a smoking gun" of evidence that the official story is not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       at first the mini-nukes theory sounds absurd, because well...
      </p>
      <p>
       but then after you look at the evidence, and work your way backward...
      </p>
      <p>
       you have to ask yourself, "what could have caused this pot hole?"
      </p>
      <p>
       or "can jet fuel melt bed rock?"

We're history's actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.” ~ Karl Rove

       ever notice the people who invent and use nuclear weapons always assume that they are the good guys, and those without nuclear weapons are the bad guys? when the US goes around attacking countries on the flimsiest of pretexts (Regime change in Syria! who authorized that?) its no wonder that other countries seek more powerful weapons, to defend themselves against the US aggressors. and then the US whines about arms proliferation, after supplying Israel and SA with the exact arms they whine about proliferating

       no, I'm the person who forced HRC to deploy her attack dogs
      </p>
      <p>
       you probably don't remember this, but in the 2008 Iowa caucuses, HRC was leading in polls and projected to win the Iowa Caucus
      </p>
      <p>
       a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses were held, NPR ran a hit piece on Hillary and Obama, probably as a way to attack Obama while appearing to be even-handed and attacking HRC too
      </p>
      <p>
       i took this hit piece, ignored the Obama angle, gave it a click-bait title, and helped it go viral
      </p>
      <p>
       thats what the NYT article is about
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary lost the Iowa caucuses, and a previously unknown token diversity candidate named Barack Obama, who had been trailing in 3rd place, suddenly gained all of the Hillary deserters and won by a nose at the finish line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama, of course, went on to win the DNC, in spite of going up against the HRC machine, thus depriving HRC at her first shot at the presidency in 2008, and effectively in 2012 too, since Obama was the incumbent of the same party.
      </p>
      <p>
       i just want you to be aware of the fact that HRC was derailed by an anti-war pro-labor lefty Obama supporter, not by some RWNJ or Russian agent

       i just want you to know the reasons why your sorry excuse for candidate lost 3 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       so not only did i derail the pantsuit princess in 2008 and 2012 with just a rumor about stiffing a waitress on a tip called "tip gate"
      </p>
      <p>
       i was also waiting for her in 2016, with a little scandal called "pizza gate", that you morons conveniently blamed on the Russians
      </p>
      <p>
       and here you are, in 2018 still unsure of why your candidate always loses, in spite of having it explained to you, and certainly no hope of winning in 2020, seeing as how the DNC standard bearer won't step aside.
      </p>

       its just a islamophobic conspiracy theory, and i don't even especially like muslims, but this conspiracy theory is obviously based on stereotypes and not on evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       what does the evidence show Richard Serino doing at the Boston Marathon on April 15 2013?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It says he was there for a while, left and came back.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       no actually, the evidence doesn't show that he left and came back.
      </p>
      <p>
       we only know that he was there before and after the bombs went off, (15 minutes before, to be precise) and that he claims to have left.
      </p>
      <p>
       we also know that there is no credible evidence of either brother being at the Boston Marathon, in spite of there being countless photos and videos of the people at the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       how you do you expect the public to reconcile the fact that the evidence strongly supports the theory of a mass casualty incident, and debunks the islamophobic conspiracy theory that you've been lead to believe?

       i keep asking you to describe or produce the evidence that the Tsarnaev's were at the Boston Marathon
      </p>
      <p>
       there are 2 specific pieces of evidence that were presented to the public as evidence
      </p>
      <p>
       of course, i know what both of those pieces are, and you do not, which is why you can neither describe or produce them
      </p>
      <p>
       1) side profile shot of DT behind Martin Richard, after backpack bomb had been left on the ground nearby
      </p>
      <p>
       2) side profile shot of DT fleeing the scene, moments after the explosion, turning a corner right where you would expect a suspect to make his getaway.
      </p>
      <p>
       if course, if i produce them, you will get distracted worrying about my sources or grammar or something
      </p>
      <p>
       so thats why i want you to produce them, so that we can then examine them closely, together
      </p>
      <p>
       would you mind describing or producing examples of things that you consider evidence that support the official story?

      <p>
       i suspect you are doing what is called psychological projection. what that means is that you attribute to me, what you are actually doing yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       or to put it another way, you can only see your flaws in others, not in yourself
      </p>
      <p>
       now, the reason i keep going back and forth between the 2 competing theories, is to give you or anyone else the opportunity to present and defend the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       on the one hand, you say that my evidence is weak
      </p>
      <p>
       but on the other hand, its the most compelling evidence presented thus far, simply because you refuse to admit that the official story has no evidence, yet you assume it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you had any credible evidence, certainly you would not hesitate to present it. your hesitation is indication of no confidence in the evidence to support your wild-eyed, crazy conspiracy theory

       I'm going to commend on you on remembering our previous discussion after all this time. No sarcasm, by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       A question about the pictures though...
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the picture on the left a screenshot from a helicopter shot or something? When was it taken? I'm assuming that it's during the chase when the guy was hiding in the boat, but I want to be sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the blood...if the picture on the left is prior to them shooting him/him killing himself/whatever happened, then we wouldn't expect to see blood there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that shot on the left is after he died, but before the body has been removed, then the absence of blood may not be an issue either. They could have gotten the blood on the fender as the body was being removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as our previous conversation. I just took the position that the BMB wasn't inherently a false flag due to the circumstances revolving about the IC designation and whatnot. I've held some suspicions that the two brothers were probably tapped as suspects prematurely, and were likely either not alone, or perhaps not even responsible for bombings themselves. I've always thought the boat-apprehension was sketchy and that something went down there that wasn't released.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't have any bearing on the IC designation and it isn't a smoking gun for the bombing itself to be a false flag. The brothers could have been fall guys, they could have had something planned but another group went off first and they got pinned with it instead, etc...

       and then it took a solid week for the owner of the boat to get his story straight
      </p>
      <p>
       first he was cooped up because of lockdown, then went out back for a smoke and noticed blood on his boat
      </p>
      <p>
       but we already had pics of the boat with NO blood on it, so how could he notice blood thats not there?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a picture of the boat that the Boston Marathon Bombing suspect was hiding in. Notice that there is no hatch in the boat cover

       sp then after the "i went out for a smoke and saw blood" BS didn't wash
      </p>
      <p>
       he felt compelled to contact the media to clarify exactly what happened
      </p>
      <p>
       he went out to walk his dog, and thats when he noticed a piece of foam in the yard that came out from under the shrink wrap on the boat. he went to put the foam back, and thats when he discovered the suspect
      </p>
      <p>
       in spite of there being a ladder leaned up against his boat that he didn't bother to mention seeing
      </p>
      <p>
       in spite of that ladder being necessary for Dzhokhar to get inside the boat

       Yeah that's what I was referencing. What the fuck is Patriot's day anyway, literally never heard of that. Most likely they through that one in their to increase patriotic sympathies and spice it up a bit. I doubt a fucking local FEMA deputy admin would be in on this if it was a false flag.

       you will figure out why it matters when you can explain to the rest of us, and support it with evidence, what exactly Richard Serino was doing at the Boston Marathon finish line April 15, 2013

       right now the prevailing theory, supported by a confluence of evidence, is that Richard Serino was on the job, being the incident commander for another mass casualty drill, as he had many times previously

       its not really that hard.

      <p>
       the Boston Marathon Bombing was a pre-planned mass casualty drill, done under the DHS urban shield program, and Richard Serino was the incident commander.

      <p>
       so, you think its perfectly logical for Richard Serino to conduct a mass casualty drill at the Boston Marathon in 2011 and 2012, because thats where the terrorists are likely to strike,

       He was doing what everyone else was. Watching the race. Evidence? I don't need evidence. That is by far the simplest, most likely explanation. I don't need evidence to prove he was just watching the race. You need evidence showing that's not true.

       That plate says that the national guard was using NICS to monitor security before the bombs went off, and then once the bombs went off they began to use NICS to coordinate emergency responders. What is unusual about the national guard monitoring security of a large event, or emergency responders using the standard program for inter-agency disaster response?

      <p>
       This is wrong. We are going to go through this logically, step by step.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this moment, we have
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       piece of evidence. The director standing at the finishing line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on this picture of him there, and
       <strong>
        this picture alone
       </strong>
       , what is the simplest explanation?
      </p>
      <p>
       The same as the explanation for everyone else. He's there watching the race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now. We are going to move forward. The simplest explanation based on the photo of him being there is that he is there watching the race. That means
       <em>
        we need evidence to indicate he's not there watching the race
       </em>
       until we go beyond that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will now consider your first piece of evidence:
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/bvjmzl5c2q401.png">
        https://i.redd.it/bvjmzl5c2q401.png
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Does his job title or previous work experience working as a disaster relief coordinator make it more likely that he is there working?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's try a test for someone else:
      </p>
      <p>
       Bob works as a garbage collector, and Bob is at the finish line. If we were to encounter Bob at that finish line, would it be more likely he's there to pick up trash, or watch the race?
      </p>
      <p>
       Karine works as a teacher, and is at the finish line. If we were to encounter Karine at that finish line, would it be more likely she's there to teach the kids, or watch the race?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is obvious.
       <em>
        We cannot make any inferences whatsoever about a person's presence at the finish line based on their job, and it is most likely regardless of job title that someone at the finish line is watching the race.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It tells us nothing at all. His prior work experience cannot be brought into the discussion, because it doesn't imply or indicate anything at all. Thus, that piece of evidence is discarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mention that Patriot's Day is not a federal holiday. This is irrelevant. He could have easily have taken a day off. We also know he was a fan of the race and attended it very often, even during years when he was a FEMA director and there was no training exercise and before he was a member of FEMA at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, is it likely that he was working that day? No. Based on his history of being at all the marathons in the past, it is likely he just took a day off. That explanation makes more sense, because it explains all the evidence (his history of prior marathon viewings) and not just the 2013 viewing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we return to our initial question: based on the fact that it was Patriot Day, is it more likely that he was working or that he was just watching the game like everyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have established that it being Patriot Day is meaningless and indicates nothing at all. Consequently, it cannot indicate that he is working. Consequently, we are again returned to our first basic premise: he was there watching the race just the same as everyone else around him.
      </p>
      <p>
       You next imply that it is suspicious that he held two drills in 2011 and 2012, but not 2013. This is not suspicious. It is not indicative of anything. In fact, it does not need an explanation. If you think this needs explanation, you need to explain why. The fact that there was a training exercise in 2011 and 2012 does not logically lead to a reasonable assumption that there will be one in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the logic of that question is circular. To ask "why didn't he hold a training exercise in 2013?" presupposes that there was a reason. It's possible that there was no reason. In fact, "there is no reason" is the most likely explanation for all things that don’t happen. Why isn’t the flashlight shining? Because no one turned it on. Why is the door not open? Because no one is opening it. Why is there no training exercise in 2013? Because no one scheduled one. And note—non-events do not require conscious thought. Do you make a conscious effort not to open a door? No. You make a conscious effort to open one. Do you make a conscious effort to not turn on the flashlight? No. You make a conscious effort to turn it on. Do you make a conscious effort not to schedule a training exercise in 2013? No. You make a conscious effort to schedule one. The most simple explanation for why there was no 2013 training exercise is simply “because no one scheduled one.” And the most likely reason for them not scheduling one is that there was no reason at all. They had no reason to, and so they didn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we must ask ourselves yet another question that returns to our root. Based on the schedule of training exercises in the past, is it more likely that the director was working, or more likely he was just watching the race like everyone else? Because the schedule of training exercises does not imply or indicate anything at all, and because we cannot glean anything at all from it, it means nothing. That means that we continue to lack evidence that he was working, and thus we are forced to return to our original explanation: the director was there to watch the race. This means that the schedule of training exercises may be discarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving on to the amputee picture: that caption doesn't mean anything. I could take a picture of a trauma victim and put any caption on it you like. If you would like, I can take that picture and turn that amputee into Gandalf the wizard. To my eyes, that is a picture of an actual trauma patient that some hoaxer has put a caption on using photo-shop. Unless you can prove otherwise, that picture is nothing.  So, it may be discarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must also take this piece of evidence (and here, you will see a weakness in the way you argue) and bring it back to the original question: was the director working or just viewing the race? This leads us to this question: does a picture of an amputee, without a name, place, or timestamp, indicate or provide evidence that the director was working the day of the marathon?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is obviously no. The picture—real or fake (and it is most certainly fake)—does not tell us anything at all about the director. So, it may be discarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding this bank thing—I still have no idea what you are talking about. I have seen nothing (and I just looked) about a fake bank robbery being called in (or a real one for that matter). You’ll need to explain it. However, I’ll grant it just so we can ask our principle question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Does a fake bank robbery being called in on the day of the marathon bombing increase the odds that the director was at the finish-line working, or is it more likely that he as just watching the race like everyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is obvious: a bank robbery of any sort is not going to affect the director in this case, because FEMA does not assist bank robberies or provide relief for them. So, even if this fake bank robbery was real (I need evidence of it), it would not affect whether the director was working. This means that it is most likely, still, that the director was not working and was in fact just watching the race.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bank robbery may thus be discarded.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        so let me get this straight; you expect there to be mass casualty drills in 2011 and 2012, but you don't expect there to be one in 2013? please explain your reasoning. it sounds kinda desperate and ill conceived to me
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have already addressed this point, but will rehash. The occurrence of a drill in 2011 and 2012 does not in anyway indicate that there will be one in 2013. My reasoning is simple: I don’t need to provide an explanation for why there would not be one in 2013, because there is no reason to believe there would be one in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, this is discarded. Consequently, it is most likely that the director was just watching the race.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        if you were capable of reading for comprehension, you may have noticed that resources were leveraged…"prior to the bombings"….this clearly indicates that a drill was in fact going on
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You should lose the attitude. Trust me. You’re not in a position currently to be acting clever.
      </p>
      <p>
       SA means situational awareness. NICS is a computer program that LE nationwide use to create a one-stop repository of various data—the idea being to avoid information being lost between chains of command, etc.  This plate says that “before the bombings, the national guard was using NICS to monitor safety during the marathon, and after the bombing the national guard used NICS to track and coordinate personnel and resources in response to the bombing.”
      </p>
      <p>
       So this image is admitting that the national guard was monitoring the marathon using the standard interdepartmental SA software. This does not hint at foreknowledge of a bombing. In fact, the use of NICS to monitor large events and coordinate personnel, etc., is common. It’s literally why they built the program.
And so this returns us to our initial question: Does the fact that the national guard was using software to monitor the safety of the Boston marathon make it likely that the director was working, or was he just watching the race like everyone else? Obviously, the national guard using the standard inter-agency program to monitor a large event is perfectly normal, and it gives us no reason to believe anyone was working (besides the national guard).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this,
       <strong>
        and because the plate does not have any evidence indicating prior knowledge of a bombing
       </strong>
       , it may be discarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thus we arrive at the end. Every single piece of evidence has been demonstrated to not have any relation to the director, and none of it provides any hint of a reason that we might use to say he was working. Because there is no such evidence, the only reasonable conclusion we are left with is the base conclusion: that he was just there watching the race, just like thousands of other people, and just like he had done for years and years before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless a serious attempt is made to explain why any of this evidence is relevant, I am permanently disqualifying it as “evidence,” because I have explained in detail here why none of it is evidence of anything.

        So, is it likely that he was working that day? No. Based on his history of being at all the marathons in the past, it is likely he just took a day off. That explanation makes more sense, because it explains all the evidence (his history of prior marathon viewings) and not just the 2013 viewing.

       do you really think that by asserting that your absurd theory "makes sense" that it will magically make sense?

      <p>
       can you explain why it made sense to have mass casualty drills at the boston marathon in 2011 and 2012, but not in 2013?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm having a hard time following your faulty logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       either it makes sense to have a mass casualty drill in 2011, 2012, and 2013
      </p>
      <p>
       or it doesn't make sense to have a mass casualty drill in 2011, 2012, and 2013
      </p>
      <p>
       im leaning toward the latter
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the logic of that question is circular. To ask "why didn't he hold a training exercise in 2013?" presupposes that there was a reason. It's possible that there was no reason. In fact, "there is no reason" is the most likely explanation for all things that don’t happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       and what was this compelling reason for doing mass casualty drills at the boson marathon in 2011 and 2012?

No. You make a conscious effort to schedule one. The most simple explanation for why there was no 2013 training exercise is simply “because no one scheduled one.” And the most likely reason for them not scheduling one is that there was no reason at all. They had no reason to, and so they didn’t.

       lets see:
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Serino has long history of being incident commander at mass casualty incidents, and specifically at the Boston Marathon

      <p>
       they had already planned a mass casualty drill which include the use of backpacks filled with explosives

      </p>
      <p>
       what was Richard Serino doing at the Boston Marathon finish line April 15, 2013 if not a mass casualty drill?

       DHS Partnered with BAA, MEMA, MA National Guard, MA Fire Services, Natick and Hopkinton Police Departments. Road closures coordinated and scheduled using NICS. Natick Police used NICS SA to coordinate bank robbery response

       Police response training planned but bombs hit first... Last fall a slew of agencies including Boston Police and the police departments, the Coast Guard, and the MBTA joined forces to confront a simulated armed bank robbery
      </p>
      <p>
       they had already planned a mass casualty drill which include the use of backpacks filled with explosives

       so my question for you all is:
      </p>
      <p>
       what exactly was Richard Serino doing at the Boston Marathon finish line April 15, 2013 if not a mass casualty drill?

       According to the co-director of MIT's Graduate Program in Science Writing, the 'naked man' is not either of the Tsarnaev brothers... A naked man was in police custody, in handcuffs, and later a pic of a naked body purportedly of Tamerlan was later leaked online

       Maret Tsarnaeva the aunt of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev the suspected Boston marathon bombers has revealed to me that she can positively identify the oldest nephew Tamerlan Tsarnaev as the man who was stripped naked and placed into a police cruiser during the manhunt for the suspects.

       According to the co-director of MIT's Graduate Program in Science Writing, the 'naked man' is not either of the Tsarnaev brothers... A naked man was in police custody, in handcuffs, and later a pic of a naked body purportedly of Tamerlan was later leaked online

       Maret Tsarnaeva the aunt of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev the suspected Boston marathon bombers has revealed to me that she can positively identify the oldest nephew Tamerlan Tsarnaev as the man who was stripped naked and placed into a police cruiser during the manhunt for the suspects.

       [NSFW] [NSFL] This photo is supposedly of a dead Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Tamerlan supposedly had just been in a gun fight with police. How many bullet holes do you see? Zoom in on his neck and you can see the brushstrokes where the "blood" was applied

       please provide all of the evidence you can, to support the claim that the Tsarnaev's were at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013

       il take that as an admission that the evidence of the Tsarnaev's is so sketchy that it actually debunks the official story, which is why you refuse to present it for public scrutiny

       why wouldn't it be odd? its unprecedented, actually.

       No its odd for Richard Serino to do mass casualty drills in 2011 and 2012, but then inexplicably skip the mass casualty drill in 2013, while also showing up at the exact same time and place as the mass casualty drill would have been held, and to have fake bombs in backpacks also go off, just like planned

       can you cite another example of a time when a mass casualty drill using backpacks filled with explosives was planned, but somehow "real" terrorists hijacked the training exercise and set off real bombs killing real people, before the exercise could take place?
Boston, 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       please cite specific examples which would support the position that its common for mass casualty drills to be hijacked by terrorists.

      <p>
       would you mind explaining with your presumaby-superior logic,
      </p>
      <p>
       1) insufficient evidence to support your conclusion (which you formed conclusion first, rather than conclusion last)
      </p>
      <p>
       the confluence of evidence lead to my conclusion. its kind of absurd to imagine that i somehow concocted this entire scenario in my mind, and then went about documenting it with credible sources after the fact
      </p>
      <p>
       clearly, the evidence came before the theory, not the other way around
      </p>
      <p>
       you, on the other hand, have this wild-eyed, islamophobic conspiracy theory about the Tsarnaev's planting backpack bombs at a marathon, and yet you can't even put two pieces of evidence together to support that theory, and instead rely on his suspicious af guilty plea as a substitute for actual evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       i could show you the evidence that the Tsarnaev's were at the Boston Marathon, but it will only open up more cans of worms for the official story which cannot be easily explained away
      </p>
      <p>
       2) demonstrated lack of common knowledge that people leave their homes and go to public events sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       double bad logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       so what was Richard Serino doing at the Boston Marathon in 2011 and 2012?

       so you think that i somehow made up the Boston Globe, USAToday article, and Richard Serino's FEMA profile pages?

      <p>
       many of the images are of articles published in mainstream news sources. i suspect if there was a problem with the writing style, it would be much more noticeable, and not just isolated to a few outliers on the left end of the bell curve

       unless you can offer up a more plausible explanation as to why you would convict muslims of terrorism and murder, in spite of the evidence, not because of the evidence, i can only assume that you have some deep seated hatred for muslims.

       "lol" is right. we both know "the evidence" that the Tsarnaev's were there is a joke. i know why you don't want to cite it, but here shortly i will go ahead and cite it myself and then we can discuss the evidence, in a conversation I'm sure you'd prefer we didn't have

      <p>
       did you even read his FEMA page where it says he's been incident commander for mass casualty drills at the Boston Marathon, coupled with the Boston Globe article which placed Richard Serino at the scene in 2013, as well as previous years?
      </p>
      <p>
       how can you say you have no idea, when the only reason you know who Richard Serino is, is within the context of mass casualty drills at the boston marathon, as mentioned in most of the articles or pages that talk about Richard Serino

       you probably aren't familiar with incident commanders, if you haven't trained for these kinds of things

      <p>
       "incident commander" is not a job title per se, because anyone can become an "incident commander" in an instant, and/or just as easily pass off that responsibility to someone else and NOT be the incident commander anymore

       That plate says that the national guard was monitoring the event's security with NICS before the bombs went off, and when the bombs went off they used NICS to coordinate emergency responders.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing there that indicates foreknowledge of an attack.

       No, it doesn't. It means that they were using NICS to monitor security. That's literally what it says.

       Direction translation:
      </p>
      <p>
       Massachusetts National Guard used NICS for security prior to bombings
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing it says is that they were using NICS to monitor security. That says nothing about a drill. NICS is used in all cases where LE from different agencies are working together. If you have a hit and run that crosses city or county lines, the local PDs, county sheriffs, and state troopers will use NICS to coordinate their search.

       The thing that really got me with this event was the guy who identified the brothers. He had his lower legs torn to shreds, shin bones sticking out, ashen from blood loss yet was not actively bleeding. He had loose shoelaces for tourniquets, so loose they visibly were not capable of stopping bleeding in the least. He laid on the pavement for too long to stay concious from his wounds and yet was eventually wheeled out of there with his legs below his heart sitting in a wheelchair, fully concious. He was wheeled out by race volunteers, like every other victim, because they did not let paramedics (many were there at the finish line to take care of runners who might need assistance at the end of the race, a standard precautionary measure) in to help the victims. This does not make any sense, whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       That guy later told paramedics in the ambulance taking him to the hospital that he knew who did the bombing, that it was the two ethnic looking men in the crowd, that they looked suspicious. He never saw them leave anything or actively do anything unusual, just that it was them because they looked suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the younger brother’s white backpack showed up in a photo on the cover of a major news paper (I can’t currently remember which one, but I suspect it was The NY Times. It’s been a long while since I looked at this topic and I currently don’t have access to my saved links). The photo was of their FBI ransacked house. The news paper reported that the brothers lived in squalor, and showed a massive pile of possessions in the middle of the room, but that was due to the FBI ransacking the house for clues. Right in the middle of the pile, very clearly can be seen is his white backpack. Never mind that the backpacks that blew up we’re both entirely black. The only possible explanation would be that he had another black backpack with a pressure cooker inside it all inside his white backpack, but it was a jansport and those things don’t hold much at all, let alone another maxed out to full capacity backpack.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is WAY too much weird shit with this event. WAY TOO MUCH to be normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, within a couple hours after the event (I saw this first hand shortly after they were uploaded that day) a guy who worked in a building just above the finish line was photographing with a high resolution camera out his window of the finish line captured a ton of images of the bombing as it happened and uploaded them all to Flickr. He basically just held the shutter down and captured every second. You can see from those images that a lot did not add up. Right after the bomb went off a man comes running from well outside the bomb area in completely comically tattered clothing with no visible injuries or blood, he jumps through exactly where the blast occurred (seen by the marks on the pavement) past a completely unharmed young girl who was only a few feet from the blast, and then runs right out of frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much can be seen and yet most Americans missed all of it.

       The second guy with the shredded pants.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a YouTube video of someone on the second floor laid thier iPad on a window facing down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bomb goes off and everyone runs by. That guy walzes up. His pants are fine. He goes to a fire truck and an older white fireman in black kneels down and shreds his pants up with a blade!!  The guy then runs back to the bombing area and is photographed with the oddly blown away pants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone else seen this video? I would swear it's a smoking gun but it didn't get around, didn't get any attention. It blew my mind. I wonder if my YouTube history goes that far back?

       My personal favorite is the series of photos of the lady walking up to the bomb scene from about 100 yards away. She is carrying a bag and holding a sheet around her legs with no apparent injuries. Someone (director?) holds up a hand to her like stop you are late.
She walks around him and lays on the ground.

       I live outside of Boston and to this day if you even question the official narrative to friends and coworkers, or if you suggest that it was strange that nobody got to see the trial or pictures or video or anything else after the incident, you are met with anger and hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
       People around here are completely brainwashed about the bombing. They just want to see the guy dead whether innocent or not. TPTB said he did it so he did it.

       Two things on that. First you can see the wrapped boat and what most likely looks like a hole in it. This would be significant if we can have the date on that image.

       Second, either flir gps is off or that picture was fabricated. The angle on the flir should be the exact mirror based on gps.

       So from that tiny picture you can apparently ascertain that apparently there is "no
       <em>
        hatch
       </em>
       in the cover". Some serious l33t CSI photo skills you got there.

       Looks like there's a flap right on it. There's a ladder leading right up to it.  I imagine he used that.

       I have no idea, looks like the boat has some kind of cover on it, which is common for boats.

       yes, you can tell its planted, because it wasn't there before, when the suspect had allegedly left the blood, and now it is there, long after the suspect is gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       how did the blood get there if not from the suspect, who has already been ruled out?

      <p>
       you see, that theory doesn't add up, because the owner of the boat said that he noticed blood on the boat, and thats why he looked inside the boat and found the suspect hiding inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       now, if the boat owner was telling the truth, there would have been blood visible on the boat in all photos, since there were likely no photos taken of the boat before the boat owner saw his boat,
      </p>
      <p>
       so, after the official story was destroyed by the blood evidence, the owner of the boat actually had to spend a week re-explaining how it wasn't the blood on the boat but it was some foam stuffing
      </p>
      <p>
       the man is a liar.

       yeah and then he magically recovered in world record speed, and was able to go the Boston Bruins game, where some washed up loser name Neil Diamond came out and sang "Sweet Caroline"

       theres always this debate about whether or not is he Nick Vogt, but nobody seems to want to check on Nick and see if he's ok. afaik nobody has heard from Nick since the BMB. maybe he's homeless living in a van down by the river

       i have worked very hard and overturned every stone to find the root cause of autism
      </p>
      <p>
       and i think autism is the single biggest problem facing our society today
      </p>
      <p>
       and its getting much worse as we go
      </p>
      <p>
       we need to stop expanding vaccine schedules, just to please $MRK shareholders
      </p>
      <p>
       this is one of those situations like, you are out driving and you get lost, and you can either stop and ask for directions or keep driving. it looks like we as a society have decided to keep driving, getting farther and farther away from where we want to be

       “We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality — judiciously, as you will — we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.” ~ Karl Rove
