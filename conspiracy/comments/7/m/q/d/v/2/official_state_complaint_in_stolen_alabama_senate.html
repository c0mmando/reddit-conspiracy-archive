    <div class="md"><p>The results were fraudulently certified, which you would have realized if you had read the evidence provided. Not only was there evidence of pre-filled &quot;sample&quot; ballots being illegally cast in many Democrat-leaning precincts (which the Sec&#39;y of State acknowledged in the days following the election), there was strong evidence showing that pro-Democrat groups were coming in from all over the country as part of a massive voter intimidation campaign designed to scare Moore voters away from the polls through threats of doxxing and physical threats, as well as an attempt to bring in non-registered voters from out of state to cast ballots. One election official saw 8x as many out of state licenses as normal, while turnout in a largely Democrat county near Birmingham skyrocketed 47%. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in the video, the guy clearly says people came in from all over the country to caucus and help the Jones campaign. And the guy certainly doesn&#39;t look like a thug.</p>

<p>In addition, there are voter ID laws in effect in Alabama that would have made it impossible for people to cast fraudulent votes, no?</p>

<p>That just leaves tampering with the Diebold voting machines, which historically has been a GOP move, from Bush II first presidential race to Mitt Romney securing the GOP nomination in 2012.</p>

<p>Well, people did go back to Alabama to vote...and they were Alabama citizens. Do you have proof of a non-Alabama citizen voting in the election?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t nominate pedophiles! How hard is this! Luther Strange would&#39;ve won this election easily.</p>

<p>ANTIFA couldn&#39;t elect a dogcatcher in San Francisco. They&#39;re a boogieman, not a political force. They&#39;ve got some masks and a willingness to do stupid-ass stuff to get media coverage to further their nihilistic anarchism, the new Black Bloc. They don&#39;t have the wherewithal or the numbers to impact an Alabama special election for Senate.</p>

<p>Stop pointing toward the paper tigers, man. Moore was the WORST candidate the GOP could have offered, Jones was the BEST the Democrats could have offered. So Jones (barely) won. That&#39;s all there is to it. </p>

<p>If people had voted that weren&#39;t on the list there would be more votes than people on the list. That&#39;s pretty easy to verify. I&#39;m going to guess that was the first thing Republicans in charge in Alabama did. Or are you saying all of Moore&#39;s old time friends just conspired against him?</p>

<p>Zero evidence of anything wrong but tons of evidence it went right. Prove there was fraud. This doesn&#39;t do that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oops, sorry. I know the H word is a trigger for so many. Not a big fan of Roy due to his 10 Commandments stand but curious.... you refer to Roy as a pedophile. Is that based on evidence gained at his trial or is that mere speculation fueled by hopes and dreams?  Lots of accusations, very little proof.  The reason I&#39;m concerned is say... say you wanted to run for office. How would you feel if opposition hired women to claim you molested them? How can you proof it never happened?  Not saying anyone hired those women, just that accusations are dangerous especially ones not requiring proof.  I didn&#39;t care about Moore, I cared about any candidate being slammed with &quot;pedophile&quot; accusations.   You didn&#39;t see the danger of that?  </p>

<p>Democrats for the most part don’t vote as frequently as republicans do. Case in point majority of the Bernie bros chose not to vote. Hence why the voter turnout was less than previous presidential elections. You will prob see more in 2020 given the current climate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Alabama, and voted for Jones. Fuck Roy Moore. We&#39;re tired of watching old, redneck cronies buy their way into and out of everything with their good ol&#39; boy system. </p>

<p>You people are all about the party first, and to hell with ethics and morals if they get in the way. The man is guilty of being a pedophile, period- but none of you pro party people care.</p>

<p>I&#39;d go to jail, just to get to punch him in the face. Fuck that pig bastard, and the Sassy horse he rode in on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also fuck your Republican/Democratic party bullshit. If you really believe that Trump and the Clintons didn&#39;t fine dine and laugh together over these ignorant sheeple buying into their whole sherade- you need to research more, and do a lot more homework before stepping off into a sub like this with that said bullshit.</p>

<p>They are all, &quot;in cahoots&quot; with each other, and both parties are owned by the same people. At best it&#39;s two different corporations fighting over control of the economy and pork money. </p>

<p>Neither side gives a fuck about Joe millionaire- much less Joe middle class or Joel Prole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The GOP LOST ALABAMA! !  GET OVER IT CRYBABIES.</p>

<p>Seriously, not even being able to win in backwards ass Alabama is not a good sign for them.  Even worse sign for trump.  Who knows, with any luck trump won&#39;t even make it 4 years.</p>
