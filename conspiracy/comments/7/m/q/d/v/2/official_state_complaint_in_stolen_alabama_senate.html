       Well, duh. We have video proof (referenced in the complaint) of leftwing antifa thugs bragging on local news about how "they'd come from across the country to vote in this election."
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no other credible explanation for this -- this is a concerted effort by the media, deep state, Republican oligarchy (led by corrupt crony capitalists like Mitch McConnell and Jeff Flake), Democrats and New World Order to sabotage the Trump agenda and create an excuse for continuing the same failed globalist policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moore just so happened to be the man that the voters wanted. Trust me, had Anne Coulters guy won the primary it would have been the same and had Luther Strange won the primary then it too would have been nasty, the only difference being the "establishment Republicans" would not have been against him, but the Democrats would have unleashed their same corrupt schemes and attacks to undermine that election too, just as they tried to do in 2016 and succeeded in Virginia and now Alabama.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also a precursor to what we've to expect coming shortly in 2018. That is, a massive mainstream media push in conjunction with smear campaigns and obscene amounts of money all with the desire to stop Trump. These people are evil. They care not for America. It's nearing the 2nd evolution of 1776.

       The results were fraudulently certified, which you would have realized if you had read the evidence provided. Not only was there evidence of pre-filled "sample" ballots being illegally cast in many Democrat-leaning precincts (which the Sec'y of State acknowledged in the days following the election), there was strong evidence showing that pro-Democrat groups were coming in from all over the country as part of a massive voter intimidation campaign designed to scare Moore voters away from the polls through threats of doxxing and physical threats, as well as an attempt to bring in non-registered voters from out of state to cast ballots. One election official saw 8x as many out of state licenses as normal, while turnout in a largely Democrat county near Birmingham skyrocketed 47%.

       So in the video, the guy clearly says people came in from all over the country to caucus and help the Jones campaign. And the guy certainly doesn't look like a thug.

      <p>
       In addition, there are voter ID laws in effect in Alabama that would have made it impossible for people to cast fraudulent votes, no?

       That just leaves tampering with the Diebold voting machines, which historically has been a GOP move, from Bush II first presidential race to Mitt Romney securing the GOP nomination in 2012.

       Well, people did go back to Alabama to vote...and they were Alabama citizens. Do you have proof of a non-Alabama citizen voting in the election?

       ANTIFA couldn't elect a dogcatcher in San Francisco. They're a boogieman, not a political force. They've got some masks and a willingness to do stupid-ass stuff to get media coverage to further their nihilistic anarchism, the new Black Bloc. They don't have the wherewithal or the numbers to impact an Alabama special election for Senate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop pointing toward the paper tigers, man. Moore was the WORST candidate the GOP could have offered, Jones was the BEST the Democrats could have offered. So Jones (barely) won. That's all there is to it.

       Voter ID laws that require you to be on a preregistered list say your little conspiracy doesn't hold water.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people had voted that weren't on the list there would be more votes than people on the list. That's pretty easy to verify. I'm going to guess that was the first thing Republicans in charge in Alabama did. Or are you saying all of Moore's old time friends just conspired against him?

       Oops, sorry. I know the H word is a trigger for so many. Not a big fan of Roy due to his 10 Commandments stand but curious.... you refer to Roy as a pedophile. Is that based on evidence gained at his trial or is that mere speculation fueled by hopes and dreams?  Lots of accusations, very little proof.  The reason I'm concerned is say... say you wanted to run for office. How would you feel if opposition hired women to claim you molested them? How can you proof it never happened?  Not saying anyone hired those women, just that accusations are dangerous especially ones not requiring proof.  I didn't care about Moore, I cared about any candidate being slammed with "pedophile" accusations.   You didn't see the danger of that?

        Submission Statement
       </strong>
       : We have video proof (referenced in the complaint) of leftwing antifa thugs bragging on local news about how "they'd come from across the country to vote in this election."
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no other credible explanation for this -- this is a concerted effort by the media, deep state, Republican oligarchy (led by corrupt crony capitalists like Mitch McConnell and Jeff Flake), Democrats and New World Order to sabotage the Trump agenda and create an excuse for continuing the same failed globalist policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moore just so happened to be the man that the voters wanted. Trust me, had Anne Coulters guy won the primary it would have been the same and had Luther Strange won the primary then it too would have been nasty, the only difference being the "establishment Republicans" would not have been against him, but the Democrats would have unleashed their same corrupt schemes and attacks to undermine that election too, just as they tried to do in 2016 and succeeded in Virginia and now Alabama.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also a precursor to what we've to expect coming shortly in 2018. That is, a massive mainstream media push in conjunction with smear campaigns and obscene amounts of money all with the desire to stop Trump. These people are evil. They care not for America. It's nearing the 2nd evolution of 1776.

       Not with the level of corruption and collusion involved between fraudulent out of state voters and election officials. Voter ID laws would prevent a lone individual from committing voter fraud but when you have the entire media, political establishment of both major parties, etc. conspiring to undermine the will of the people, all bets are off.

       Perhaps maybe, just maybe. Out of state Alabama citizens (college kids, people who moved recently but are still registered in al, etc) decides “hey, we really don’t want some pedo pice of shit representing us.” And they went out and voted so. There no conspiracy with this. The dude was a terrible candidate and the people spoke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats for the most part don’t vote as frequently as republicans do. Case in point majority of the Bernie bros chose not to vote. Hence why the voter turnout was less than previous presidential elections. You will prob see more in 2020 given the current climate.

       roy moore lost because he's a openly racist xenophobic bigot and black women, men, LGBTQ, and liberals of alabama said 'there's no fucking way we're going to let this guy represent our state' and they showed up in huge numbers to vote against him.

       It's sad watching the collective hissy fit surrounding Moore's loss. Just bow out with grace. Jones won, it's ok, Republicans still have the majority, and it shouldn't be taken personally by anyone other than Moore.

If you really believe that Trump and the Clintons didn't fine dine and laugh together over these ignorant sheeple buying into their whole sherade- you need to research more, and do a lot more homework before stepping off into a sub like this with that said bullshit.
