       Serious question. I'm not saying anons are right to be judeoskeptical, or wrong to support Trump. I'm not looking to disparage anyone, just to understand the discrepancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether it's an
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY">
        ad campaign
       </a>
       or a

        "secret deal"
       </a>
       , the proximity seems established.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, how do you reconcile the two? And if it's 10-D chess, can you enlighten me as to its mechanics?

       Q may or may not be the conductor behind everything happening, but I think his appeal is in it's generality.  The real benefit of Q is that a LOT MORE people are starting to pay attention to this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I explained it to a friend was, that Q turned politics/world events into a spectator sport for a lot of people who were turned off by politics.   Q gave everyone the figurative shorthand to see behind the scenes a bit, a look behind the veil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's all we need is more people who are questioning, being vigilant, calling out/directing attention to iffy practices and shady dealings.  Maybe they'll have a bit of a Trumpish leaning, but I think at its heart it is an awakening, even if Q is bullshit.    For the record, not sure how you could say Q is bullshit, at the very least he is an actual insider, in which case, pay attention to what he says, how can it hurt?

       I think the big disconnect people have with Q is that they don't understand (or are not being properly explained) that Q doesn't really predict anything.   It's the people interpreting his questions that are making most of the "predictions", as you put it.  Q mostly just points people in certain directions, and then things tend to actually happen in the vicinity of those places/people/events, etc.

       I’m mostly trying to find an example. Why do people think he knows so much, why do they put so much faith in him?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been asking this question for a few weeks now and not once has someone showed me an example of where he was even in the vicinity. It’s always responses like yours (no offense) that are as vague as Q himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d really just like to see a couple examples of where he was right. I don’t know how to word my question any more specifically so that the response isn’t about the specificity of my question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know of any examples at all?

       I'm looking at Q's actual posts, and he doesn't make very many predictions.  Have you read all of his/hers/their posts?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only real predictions are regarding Huma and Podesta being arrested, those days came and went.  However, Podesta's company is now closed, and Huma, well who knows where she is.  Otherwise, it's literally painting a picture one question at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like reading, (I know there's a LOT) there are plenty of people making videos on the subject.  I think the least boring ones are either Destroying the illusion or Tracy Beanz on Youtube, although even though the guy goes off on his own tangents sometimes, DTI is probably one of the better ones, in spite of the fact that he mostly uses just a white board behind him lol. Others might be more informative, but I wouldn't know because I fall asleep trying to watch them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a honeypot link to one guy's compilation of Q:
       <a href="https://anonfile.com/43C4q9d5ba/Q_s_posts_-_CBTS_-_3.12.0.pdf">
        https://anonfile.com/43C4q9d5ba/Q_s_posts_-_CBTS_-_3.12.0.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You get taken to the page, then you can elect to download the file if you want. (15mb)
      </p>
      <p>
       Read through the first few days of Q posts.  Not many predictions there.  Just kinda guiding along with certain things that happen, mostly after the fact.  Sometimes, he'll harp on a certain subject (like Saudi Arabia), then something will happen (all the princes being arrested) within the next few days within the vicinity or sphere of influence of the subject he was referring to.  Mostly with questions.
       <br/>
       He drops codes and some have gone as far as attempting to those as being a "prediction" by way of flight numbers, or other such things.  Example Q posted: Conf_term[5]_y on 12/15.  Then on 12/17 the ATL airport happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Conf= Concourse F, Terminal 5.   I'm not 100% behind this "decoding" aspect, personally.  Seems like a bit of a stretch for my tastes.  Again, it's mostly the Anons who are making the predictions.

       Keep in mind where the post come from and the nature of 4chan always looking to troll everyone/anyone at all times. So no mater what is said in a Q post one will always find a TON of people trying to support it, prove it and so on. Do they honestly believe all of it? Who knows but I'm willing to bet a whole lot of it is layer on top of layer of trolling powered by very effective crowd sourcing.

       that's the entire point of the site for a lot of people. The dream being some how, some why whatever happens makes it to main stream press or some talk show etc. Then the whole place laughs their ass' off at it happening.
