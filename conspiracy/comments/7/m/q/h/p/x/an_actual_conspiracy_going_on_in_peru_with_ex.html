        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some background:
Perus current president, known as PPK, won an election last year against Fujimoris daughter Keiko, mostly because a lot of people thought she only wanted to be president to pardon her Father, ex president Fujimori.</p>

<p>After promising multiple times he would not pardon Fujimori, PPK found himself in his own scandal for bribery charges, and was going to be voted out of office by a congresss whose majority was held by the opposition party lead by Keiko. Except that didnt happen, because Kenji, Keikos brother, and son to the ex dictator, convinced 10 other congressmen of their party to abstain from the vote, essentialy going against his sister, and taking the spotlight away from her.</p>

<p>In return, PPK has now pardoned Fujimori, conveniently on christmas eve, and huge protests are being planned to put this man back in jail, and get PPK out of office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That almost just seems like out-in-the-open politics.</p>

<p>Awful politics.</p>

<p>And I hope the people of Peru see through it, and keep up the pressure to pursue corruption charges against the current government.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just not sure if it&#39;s a conspiracy, in that it&#39;s so on-the-nose and public that it just acts as general politics?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some backroom dealings had to have gone on between Kenji and PPK where they agreed that if he convinced 10 congressmen to abstain, he would pardon his father. Thats where the conspiracy is, sure not the most hidden conspiracy, but they are denying that one had to do with the other. PPK is now saying he was going to pardon him anyways for humanitarian reasons because of his poor health.</p>
