He did not believe what media was telling us but never directly told me to think his way, he just gave a little bump into the right direction. After that I started to question things until today and stopped believing everything I was told in an instant.

I had no idea there was <em>any</em> substance to aliens/UFOs outside of movies. I had been drawing Greys for fun since I could remember and they were always some fun thing it never occurred to me in my wildest imaginings that UFOs/Greys could be an actual thing.</p>

<p>I would give almost anything to go back to how I felt during those 2 years of research. The world was absolute magic to me at that time. It made me realize that maybe the world <em>really</em> is as cool as I always thought it was as a kid growing up.

    <div class="md"><p>I think about 2 years ago now. Hearing about Hillary&#39;s corruption and the tarmac meeting piqued my interest during the election. One of my friends who has been into conspiracies had told me to look shit up for years but I ignored him and basically rolled my eyes. Then I heard about Bohemian Grove, which blew my mind, and then I looked into 9/11 after my friend mentioned it being a false flag, as much as I didn&#39;t want to. That put me over the edge, I was a &quot;9/11 truther&quot; within like 10-15 minutes of <em>starting</em> my research. My world has been turned upside down since then lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess there are a few moments in my &quot;truth&quot; history that stand out. As a kid I was always fascinated by paranormal and unexplained type stuff. UFOs, ghosts, cryptids, the whole lot. Every time I would go to the library I would always get at least one book on something weird. 9/11 came along and one thing that always stood out was my Dad&#39;s response to the PA &quot;crash&quot;. My dad flew in the Air Force, has a degree in aviation safety (he could just look at a wreck and tell you what went wrong, angle they crashed, etc) and is an all around level headed guy. I will never forget him standing in front of the TV saying &quot;There&#39;s no plane...something doesn&#39;t seem right here...&quot; I could never pinpoint at the time why that seemed weird, but it always sat with me. Then in 2011 is when it all came to fruition, I was home sick binging on Netflix when I noticed Loose Change. Put it on out of curiosity and then fell down a hole I could never get out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to pin an exact age but I&#39;d guess I was around 11 or 12. I was always into ufos, aliens, ghosts, mostly paranormal stuff when I was real young. 2pacs death was definitely one of the first actual &quot;conspiracies&quot; I looked into and the rabbit hole had been found. ( I almost don&#39;t want to include this as it looks bad, but is pertinent to why I think how I do. My father was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who also had a severe drug/alcohol problem, namely crack/cocaine, and would often be convinced that the car behind us on the road was following us, the guy who offered me free cheese samples behind the deli counter was trying to poison me, the department of defense had our phones tapped, etc. But then my father died of what I like to refer to as &quot;odd circumstances&quot; and it was ruled an &quot;accidental death/suicide and no investigation was needed&quot;)</p>
