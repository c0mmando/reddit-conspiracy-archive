<p><a href="http://vancouverisawesome.com/2012/02/08/vancouver-was-awesome-ufo-over-city-hall-1937/">Vancouver UFO Source</a></p>

<p>40 years later in 1977 Petrozavodsk, Russia it was photographed and also reported as a UFO incident </p>

<p><a href="https://www.fern-flower.org/en/articles/petrozavodsk-phenomenon">Petrozavodsk UFO Source</a></p>

<p>40 years later in 2017 LA it was photographed and reported as a ‘SpaceX launch’</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.space.com/39200-spacex-rocket-launch-not-ufo-spectactular-photos.html">LA SpaceX Source</a></p>

<p>I’m not sure what to say about this one, it just needs to be included. It’s a wall mural from 1350 of The Crucifixion</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/ancientufo.org/2016/04/ufos-visoki-decani-crucifixion-fresco/amp/">The Crucifixion Source</a></p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="/u/Slanderson77">/u/Slanderson77</a> and <a href="/u/Pepe_LeKel2017">/u/Pepe_LeKel2017</a>, them both were able to find a source about a UFO crash in Aurora, Texas. And a bonus one from <a href="/u/Slanderson77">/u/Slanderson77</a></p>

<p>I don’t think this source is very accurate but I’ll let you guys decide on that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thinkaboutitdocs.com/1857-neston-england-ufo-sighting/">1857 UFO Source </a> </p>

<p>40 years prior to the events of the Vancouver UFO sighting, It was reported by locals that a UFO had crashed on a farm near Aurora, Texas.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Texas,_UFO_incident">1897 UFO Source</a> </p>

<p>I felt like I needed to include these last two sources as they had a connection to the time differences of the first three sources. </p>

<p>I got all this from another post (except the last 3 sources) I thought was interesting, not on reddit. I wasn’t sure if it was accurate so I thought you guys might be able to help me see if it’s true or not. I just though it was interesting to be honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/e6pB0JI.jpg">They were in 1977
</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to descriptions of eyewitnesses, the phenomenon is very similar to the observed in the area of Baikonur launches of space rockets. According to the main version of events, it is believed that in 1977 over Petrozavodsk (or a few dozen kilometers away, but at high altitude) can fly the rocket with military satellite &quot;Cosmos-955&quot;, launched it at 4:00 from the Plesetsk cosmodrome. In favor of this version says also that the phenomenon was observed in the pre-dawn hours, when at high altitudes the sun was already up and was able to light the exhaust jet of the rocket, which gives the object the appearance of Medusa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one from 1937 sounds like a meteorite breaking up and shooting a chunk upwards as it exploded, giving the appearance that it was a craft that flew upwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m hijacking the top comment thread to provide a little extra information and anecdotal evidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;m from Aurora, TX. The house I grew up in is two properties away from the cemetery where the &quot;alien&quot; was buried. I use quotation marks only because it&#39;s conjecture at this point and we won&#39;t likely figure out the truth unless files on it are released. My family and I were close with the gravekeeper, Ned, and his family for many years. He passed away a few years ago, but I used to ask him about the grave and the alien all the time. When I was younger, he seemed to enjoy talking about it and would tell us kids the secret of where it was <em>actually</em> buried, rather than where the general population believed it was. </p>

<p>There is a small fenced in section that is raised from the rest of the property just as you enter the cemetery from the southwest entrance. He told us it is (was) buried in the southwestern most corner of that section and a tree was planted over it. </p>

<p>Later on when I actually became seriously interested/involved in the UFO community, a friend and I went back and asked him about it again to see if he would confirm what he said years ago. He immediately looked fearful and somewhat guilty and pretty much denied it all. Said it was a hoax. I don&#39;t know what to make of it, but something definitely changed in his demeanor over a 10 year period. </p>

<p>Getting back to OP&#39;s post, the craft seen across North Texas back in 1897 was said to be a cylindrical, silver object. Nothing like what we&#39;ve seen recently was reported in the news that day. The Aurora alien story is one of my favorites, though, because of how closely related it is to other incidents. Also, this all took place six years before Orville and Wilbur Wright flew the first aircraft. I suggest you all research it thoroughly, if not only for an interesting story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah a few of my crazy religious family members swear up and down that they all saw this huge, silent, black disc with small blinking lights floating above them when they were moving into their house back in the 70s. </p>

<p>Four of them would bet their life on it. Scared my uncle Leslie half to death, but he was only 10 or so then. He crawled up under a table and started crying. They said they &quot;felt&quot; it to, like it was giving off this weird force or energy. They obviously can&#39;t explain it so I can&#39;t do much better.</p>

<p>If you read the Wikipedia and resulting sources you can see this system had several disadvantages to HD. Any broadcast for the amaerican market was not compatible with the PAL protocol most of the rest of the world uses. That would be a huge cost using new tech, that would only be available for one market or the other. Something that is hard to justify today. </p>

<p>Well that sounds quite useless both in terms of accuracy and effect.</p>

<p>Many steerable ICBM warheads have a CEP of &gt;100m, though some are close to zero.</p>

<p>Even if a 500kg tungsten rod survived the atmosphere completely, retaining it&#39;s velocity and mass, the impact would be roughly comparable to 0.006 kilotons of TNT which is nothing. Why not put a 500kg real warhead into orbit instead?</p>

<p>There is the benefit that it could be mistaken as a meteorite for a moment, but quite soon it&#39;d be obvious it was tungsten and a rough trajectory from where it came - and probably the satellite that released it.</p>

<p>Before there was internet and a bunch of humans critically thinking about “the space race” and “Star Wars” programs of the Reagan era...</p>

<p>So they may be defunct at this date, and they have probably evolved since.</p>

<p>Imagine a tungsten bolt encapsulated in ceramics - it would likely be able to not liquify and hit a very pointed target.</p>

<p>If they can read a newspaper from space they can take out a target with a bolt.</p>

<p>But now they have scalar weapons - so tungsten rods is likely not a requirement and longer.</p>

Not saying it&#39;s all true information, but using your best judgment, try to discern whether or not he knows he knows what he speaks about. He very eloquently, calmly, and honestly (I assume, by studying his body language and the emotions he pairs with what he says) discusses the spiritual war that&#39;s being fought around us. Our understanding of reality is not at all accurate, generally speaking, according to Max. Anyway, if you&#39;re skeptical but interested in alien talk, he&#39;s worth checking out, at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s more likely that it exists, and is highly beneficial to John Q. Public, but is so far advanced as to “show our cards”, so to say, or requires some other technology which could benefit another country in development of weapons, or better yet, development of strategic utilities to counter said technology/weapons. </p>

<p>It’s all about keeping secrets because if you and I have it, then there’s probably 10 Chinese knockoffs, and that means China has their hands on it, and have picked it apart and know how to use it against us if possible (just used China as an example, not saying they’re an “enemy” in any way shape or form). </p>

<p>This is why we get technology that’s existed forever, but doesn’t have an immediate use against our troops in warfare. A good example is GPS. It’s existed for quite a long time but I’m positive something was developed to either secure it when used by the military, or something better has been discovered/implemented, so this now obsolete technology is readily available to the public on a mass scale. Also it can be used against us by our government, so it’s better for the public to have it, knowing full and well that other countries will get their hands on it, then to keep it private. </p>

<p>The Nazi’s spent a great deal of time, money, and energy into creating the weapons of tomorrow, in order to get the edge over all enemies. We are basically doing the same thing and had such a huge advantage over basically every other country because we weren’t negatively impacted by the war domestically. </p>

<p>Other countries were shoveling tons of money to us to help them rebuild and we used ex-Nazi scientists and all the advancements they made to build up our “future-technology” programs in order to increase our chances of winning WWIII.

And rightfully so. ITs alot easier to try to defend ourselves from alien threat rather then tell everyone about it and have people freaking the f out. </p>

<p>I probably would of did the same thing these people are doing. Keep it a secret make excuses why we need 100x trillion dollars for a secret program or military. We need to be prepared. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would imagine that they would accomplish such feats with technology so advanced that it would be incomprehensible to us and mainstream science. Such projects would probably be using reverse engineered alien or ancient breakaway civilization technology such as anti-gravity propulsion, zero point energy, force fields/gravity fields, or molecular 3D printing, things that are in their infancy when it comes to theoretical science. The logistics of this kind of operation would still be a massive burden even with ridiculously advanced technology. I&#39;m assuming that other &quot;major&quot; countries are let in on the project to offer assistance, and minor countries are simply left in the dark. Keeping all of this a secret would be immensely difficult, but I wouldn&#39;t say with certainty that it&#39;s outright impossible. </p>

Who&#39;s &quot;we&quot; in this? The regular taxpaying proletariat? Bankers and politicians? Maybe we are, sure. But I don&#39;t think the particular military, energy and tech interests who are &quot;pioneering&quot; (I put that in quotations because... Well, relatively speaking) in advanced tech like anti-grav and stealth/cloaking are preoccupied with petrol. I think that having the entire rest of the population busy with petrol completely fits their aims and goals. It means they can carry on a lot of work with few distractions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, the Vancouver image and the SpaceX image in particular have quite a bit of similarity to the point where I wouldnt ve surprised if this is a space caliber rocket in 1937, which is definitely possible seeing as rocket tech really exploded in the 30s in the US and Germany. And that&#39;s in the public sector, I can only imagine what they had in the private sector when they were talking about the V2 rocket is on an entirely different level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The description of the one in 1937 makes 0 sense compared to the newer ones. The newer ones are very easily explained by rockets, and they clearly do appear to just be rockets. The one in 1937 has a description that doesn&#39;t match the others:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>THE TWO WERE SUDDENLY ASTOUNDED TO SEE A “BRIGHT BRIGHT BLUE LIGHT” DROP STRAIGHT DOWN FROM THE SKY. IT BECAME LARGER AS IT DID AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE THE SOURCE OF THE LIGHT AS AN OBJECT THAT LEONARD DESCRIBED AS “TWO SAUCERS” OPEN ENDS FACING EACH OTHER, GLOWING BRIGHT BLUE. THE OBJECT THEN MOVED “DEAD STRAIGHT” HORIZONTALLY ACROSS THE SKY. WHEN IT JUST APPEARED TO CLEAR THE FLAGPOLE ON THE ROOF OF THE CITY HALL IT CAME TO AN ALMOST DEAD STOP AND LEONARD CLICKED THE SHUTTER ON THE CAMERA. THE OBJECT THEN SHOT STRAIGHT BACK UP INTO THE SKY.  </p>

<p>Rockets don&#39;t do that.<br/>
Also, there were no rockets in 1350. The painting could be of anything, really. It could be entirely made up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a normal launch that happened to occur right after sunset so the exhaust was lit up by the sun against a black background. The reason the plume high up looks like that is because at the low pressure nearing space the exhaust leaves the nozzle at higher pressure than the surrounding air and thus can expand out sideways (and there is little air left to slow it down once it does so). Literally any rocket launch will do that you just can&#39;t see it from the ground like this except when the sun is just below the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks different because your getting to see the plume extremely high in the atmosphere, whereas normally the plume is only visible in the lower atmosphere. This rocket was launched at twilight, when the sun was just under the horizon. When the rocket got high enough to reach sunlight, the atmosphere was thin enough that the exhaust expanded by a huge amount. This happens nearly every time a rocket is launched just before or after sunrise/sunset.</p>

I haven&#39;t quite put together all the info in my head so other than dropping some bread crumbs I can&#39;t offer much. It has to do with sacred geometry and harmonics, also energy and the frequency with which our dimension vibrates. It&#39;s out there but there is evidence to make it seem possible to me. </p>

<p>&quot;It was performed in 1913, but it didn&#39;t work. In fact, I believe it made things worse and probably was the source of the First World War in 1914. Exactly forty years later (this time period is critical), the U.S. military performed the Philadelphia Experiment in 1943 during the Second World War. Again, in 1983 (40 years later) the Montauk experiment was performed, trying to solve the problems caused bythePhiladelphiaExperiment. Asmallexperimentwasfinallycompleted in 1993 (a harmonic of the 40 cycle) to speed up the male component of the original problem caused by the Atlanteans.&quot;</p>

I can shoot you the links to those books if you&#39;re interested. The editor seems like he was drunk when they were edited but the core information is fascinating.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone actually answered this for you.</p>

<p>Ill use the 12 note musical system as an example. Here is a handy chart <a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/%7Esuits/notefreqs.html">https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html</a></p>

<p>Now we can take the lowest C on a piano and its 16.35 hz. A D is 18.35 hz. An E is 20.6 hz.</p>

<p>Well obviously there are sounds that are between those. What about 16.9 hz? Or 17.4 hz? Its not quite a D but its higher than a C.</p>

<p>So long ago Pythagoras (the a²+b²=c² guy) started experimenting with this concept.</p>

<p>He took a string and plucked it and it made a certain sound. He then cut the string exactly in half and realized it KIND OF (but not exactly) made the same sound. This is called an octave (well get to why 8 later).</p>

<p>So then he started wondering about other fractions. What if you cut the string in 1/4s? Or 2/5? Etc.</p>

<p>So yes there is an infinite amount if different sounds obviously, even a very specific sound like 16.85326 hz could be 16.85327 and while you&#39;re human ears wouldn&#39;t really notice the difference, there is a difference.</p>

<p>Well then what defines how these sounds are REALLY different? We know that if we take a sound and shorten its length by half we get and octave (the same &quot;note&quot; but a higher pitch). And it works backwards of course, if you double the length, the sound is the same note but lower pitch.</p>

<p>Well he figured out after his experiments that there were 7 different &quot;overtones&quot; and 5 &quot;undertones&quot;. So if you play a note followed by its 7 overtones you would end up on the same note you started on, the 8th note is the same as the 1st, hence octave. </p>

<p>Meaning, that there are 7 distinctly different notes that &quot;go together&quot; (this part is hard to explain, but you know when you hear an out of tune note). And 5 that dont fit with the other 7.</p>

<p>Now which 7 of the 12 total are the overtones and which are the undertones all depends on which one you start with. Meaning its not a hard &quot;this is this&quot; type of thing but rather a pattern thing. So if you start with this, then its this (hope that makes sense).</p>

<p>Another example is cymatics. I wont bother explaining it. Just youtube &quot;cymatic display&quot; and watch one of the science videos not the nonsense artsy stuff they do with it nowadays (unless you&#39;re into that).</p>

<p>Basically, certain frequencies make certain &quot;shapes&quot; in cymatics. Like we said earlier, there can always be a SLIGHTLY higher or lower note, but at what point have you crossed the barrier into, &quot;ok this is a different sound than the previous one&quot;?</p>

<p>Overtones and undertones is all about answering that question.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Tldr: when dealing with chaotic things like sound or light or vibration, the many VERY subtlety different vibrations or sounds or lights sort of &quot;coalesce&quot; into 1 discernable pattern and this is called and overtone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh well i think the idea is that, if sounds coalesce into overtones then why wouldn&#39;t the universe. Its just a matter of scale. From far away, you and a train and a mountain are all just Earth. Kinda like how a bunch of VERY similar sounds are just E.</p>

<p>Like i said there IS a difference between 16.865238 hz and 16.8652385 hz. But you might just call them both 19 hz.</p>

<p>You might just call certain time frames &quot;the aquarian age&quot; and it might sound like new age mumbo jumbo (and from a certain perspective it is just mumbo jumbo)... But if you are trying to measure time frames in the thousands or millions of years, seconds are a bit tedious.</p>

<p>So you come up with a larger scale schema to work with and if you want to get more detailed you come up with a smaller scale schema that nests inside the larger one and this repeats infinitely.</p>

<p>So i could take 20-21hz and reproduce the whole musical system using 1/100ths of a hz as my new &quot;note&quot; so now 20.1635 is C  and 20.1835 is D.</p>

<p>I dont think its that far fetched, considering how HUGE the universe is, to assume that various repeating patterns (overtones) exist and that they have a major effect on shaping our galaxy, world, climate, skin, language... Or anything, no matter how big or small. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I go way out of my way everyday to try to prove as much new age nonsense as i can as false. Im a big skeptic with all the new age shit. So i feel where you are coming from.</p>

<p>But the concept of harmonics being an integral part of the universe is pretty solid. Same reason a rainbow has 7 colors. If you had specialized eyes you could divide each &quot;color&quot; into many colors (light green, medium green, dark green)... But you naturally see them in a certain schema.</p>

<p>This concept is repeated over and over when dealing with the organization of chatic things. So its very reasonable to assume that harmonics form the underlying framework of how all chaos is organized.</p>

<p>If i said every 12th note on a piano will sound similar to the 1st , i would be correct. Assuming the original 40 years thing was accurate (i have no idea if it is, i didn&#39;t look into it) then it wouldn&#39;t be farfetched to say, human society repeats common actions every 40 years.</p>

<p>Or it gets cold every 365 days. Or the sun goes down every 24 hours. These are all overtone patterns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is, you can actually lose power in one of the engines and it should still be operational. Pretty dope considering what its used for. That and its a multi launch system (or something like that) so that adds to the confusion of it seeming UFOish, when it suddenly midair releases satellites</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Virtually all multi-engine rockets try to arrange their outermost engines in the closest approximation of a circle as you can get with the number of engines (4 outboard engines = square, 6 outboard engine = hexagon, etc.). This is because a circle is inherently the most balanced shape - each outboard engine is responsible for an equivalent load. This concept has been around since the 1960s. </p>

<p>In fact, SpaceX first tried a non-circular outboard engine pattern on early Falcon 9 rockets where there were 4 outboards where they are today and 4 “corner” engines (basically a 3x3 square when you count the center engine). They changed to the octagonal shape for the better balance during an engine-out event, improved aerodynamics and simpler construction. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, it was scheduled rocket launch.</p>

<p>The launch had been scheduled for nine months, and all launches are filed publicly with the FAA. It was launched from CA instead of Florida for a variety of reasons, the primary being its polar orbit.</p>

<p>The launch deployed ten Iridium Next satellites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the Vancouver photo, there&#39;s something fishy. First, no negative exists which makes it impossible to verify. Also as far as I know there is no access to the original print to check if the UFO is merely water damage or some other artifact. I&#39;ve seen similar looking artifacts on old prints from light water damage. Most interestingly, several articles state that Leonard died in 1992, and his brother in 1955. But I found both of their obituaries. Leonard (who took the photo) passed away in 2006. He was 89. Which would make him 21 (as the article states) when the first was taken in 1937. His brother, who was there when the photo was taken, passed away in 2007. Debra (the daughter who is credited with first telling the story, and providing the image) died in 2012 from Cancer. Why the misinformation about the men&#39;s deaths? </p>

<p>The earliest reference to the story and image I can find is dated to Feb 1, 2001 <a href="http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/avistamientos_ovnis/Noufors,UFO%20Photos.htm">here</a>. Another article dated May 2, 2002 is <a href="http://www.thelivingmoon.com/49ufo_files/03files2/1929_Wards_Colorado.html">here</a>. Both dated to <em>before</em> the deaths of Leonard and Wilfred. </p>

<p>While it definitely resembles what we&#39;ve seen with the SpaceX launches, it is fully possible that this is just an old Vancouverite Urban Legend. Such a sighting, with photographic evidence, would have made a huge stir in the papers. Especially with the beginning of WW2 overseas with Japan, China and the Soviet Union. Rumors of Jet Engines, The Hindenburg Disaster. New record flights around the globe. But there&#39;s nothing other than these handfuls of brief articles online. And nobody other than Debra recounted this story for 60+ years. Even though both men who were actually there lived into the mid 2000s. Also, no other witnesses? Large, bright trail in the night sky over a relatively high population City, but there are no other reports. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be the buzz-kill devil&#39;s advocate here. Feel free to throw spears but please show your work (have more than a 5th-grade counter to my argument, please).</p>

<p>The Norwegian spiral launch was in 2009, but the first of only a few sighted phenomena that had since took this specific shape seemed to occur next in June of 2010 from a Kyrgyzstan launch.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yo8f7fQFO8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yo8f7fQFO8</a></p>

<p>With that said, please look for a preponderance of pre-2009 articles talking about examples 1 or 2 in Op&#39;s post.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll help. There wasn&#39;t much of any. For the Vancouver UFO, at least, all post 2009 links come back to one 2009 source, a British Columbia UFO website.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091121083118/http://www.ufobc.ca/History/Early/cityhall_v2.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20091121083118/http://www.ufobc.ca/History/Early/cityhall_v2.htm</a></p>

<p>At best, most other links are to crap SEO&#39;d sites and had cut and pasted the same narrative, crediting the above source. Here&#39;s the heart-breaking piece: the only pre-2009 version of the cut-and-paste narrative that I could find was the following link from 2005. The problem is that the narrative goes with a totally different picture. </p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050403234534/http://www.burlingtonnews.net/ufofiles.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20050403234534/http://www.burlingtonnews.net/ufofiles.html</a></p>

<p>So, with this last point especially, one could take any old narrative, and then rehash it with a newer &#39;old&#39; photo. This narrative was convenient because it mentions a &quot;bright blue light (dropping) straight down from the sky&quot;. Never mind that the Spacex launch sighting didn&#39;t do that. </p>

<p>So, with that said, for all of you Project Bluebeam lovers out there, I&#39;ve got some more ammo for you. Here&#39;s a scenario: </p>

<p>Step 1: Create the physical tech - rocket-launched aerial phenomena and concurrently plant an &#39;old&#39; photograph that corroborates your phenomena. Hypothetically, according to what I&#39;ve posited here, this could be done with low effort. </p>

<p>Step 2: Create a disclosure buzz.</p>

<p>Step 3: Profit.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one last thought experiment: If &#39;they&#39; could have been a little more careful about not having their R&amp;D launches observed, and if they could have successfully removed all of the evidence of the launch contrail, how much easier would it have been to sell this phenomena to you right out of the gate (if OP&#39;s post gave you a curious sense of hope)? </p>

<p>It, of course, then begs the question, why were they so sloppy with revealing their hands before they were ready to present the big shoe, if this were all the case. I couldn&#39;t presume to know, but it&#39;s hard to account for failures in R&amp;D planning, execution, and desperation stemming from a potentially accelerated timeline, caused by concurrent geo-political events.</p>

<p>Regardless, I ask you to apply some rigor to your enthusiasm about this, and to what I&#39;m positing here. And...go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m typically pretty open to thought about these theories but this one is just plain wrong. The entire event was live-streamed from onboard cameras and directly matches what you can very clearly see in the sky, for example, the stage separation, boostback burn, max-q, fairing separation, etc. </p>

<p>If this thing wouldn’t have had sunlight on it and wasn’t glowing none of you would have raised an eyebrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>keep in mind that top secret U.S. and russian rocket programs had been around for about a decade before 1937.   To me, the spacex launch just gives more credence to the 1937 photo being a rocket experiment. This would have been less than two decades after the first world war and on the cusp of a second. I&#39;m sure officials would rather say it&#39;s anything than announce to the public their rocket capabilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found a website with a listing of paranormal events in the early 19th century. Here&#39;s a copy/paste of 1817 for those interested.</p>

<p>Location. Adams, Robertson County, Tennessee</p>

<p>Date: 1817</p>

<p>Time: daytime</p>

<p>In the early 1800’s John Bell moved his family from North Carolina to the Red River bottomland in Robertson County, Tennessee, setting in a community that later became known as Adams. Bell purchased some land and a large log home for his family. The Bells quickly made many friends and gained prominence in the community. John Bell acquired additional land and cleared a number of fields over the next several years. One day in 1817, John Bell was inspecting his cornfield when he encountered a strange-looking animal sitting in the middle of a cornrow.</p>

<p>Shocked by the appearance of this animal, which had the body of a dog and the head of a rabbit, Bell shot at it several times without any apparent effect. The animal then vanished. Bell thought nothing more about the incident—at least not until after dinner. That evening, the Bells began hearing “beating” sounds on the outside of their house. These mysterious sounds continued with increased force each night. Bell and his sons often hurried outside to catch the culprit but always returned empty handed. The noises were soon followed by more problems. The Bell children began waking up frightened and complaining of sounds much like rats gnawing at their bedposts. It wasn’t long until the children began complaining of more terrifying things—having their bed covers pulled and their pillows were tossed onto the floor by a seemingly invisible force.</p>

<p>Source: The Bell Witch Legend of Tennessee</p>

<p>Location. Atlantic Ocean</p>

<p>Date: May 1817</p>

<p>Time: 1400</p>

<p>Summary: Witnesses onboard the ship “Leonidas” sailing from New York to Havre France reported seeing around two in the afternoon at a distance of about half the ship’s length, they saw a strange fish. Its lower parts were like a fish; its belly was all white; the top of the back brown, and there was the appearance of short hair as far as the top of the head. From the breast upwards it had a near resemblance to a human being and looked upon the observers very earnestly. It apparently remained in sight all afternoon.</p>

<p>Source: Jerome Clark, Unexplained!</p>

<p>Location. Amhurst, Massachusetts</p>

<p>Date: September 25, 1817</p>

<p>Summary:At 6:25 P.M. three travelers who had just visited the roman monument near Lanuejols and were going through the “Causse de Mende” to reach that town saw in the south-southeast (towards Villefort) a luminous object, “reddish in color, in the shape of a disk three or four times larger than the full Moon.” It disappeared 2 or 3 minutes later. The sky was hazy and a fine rain was falling.</p>

<p>Source: Le Midi Libre, 25 September 1954. We have not traced an earlier source.</p>

<p>Location. France</p>

<p>Date: September 25, 1817</p>

<p>Summary: One red disc was observed by three witnesses on a farm for over three minutes.</p>

<p>Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit</p>

<p>Location. Tower Of London</p>

<p>Date: October 1817</p>

<p>Summary:  An object was observed. Physiological effects were noted. One object, about 3 inches across, was observed by two witnesses, a married couple, at a castle for two minutes (Swifte).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another pseudo-scientific distraction campaign, very easily torn apart by a basic level of scrutiny which most people will nonetheless not devote to it, and therefor be hoodwinked yet again, as they have ben about the earth being flat. </p>

<p>One of the &quot;source&quot; images has no source. The article merely says the image is one frequently used to illustrate the sighting in Russia, not that it&#39;s an actual picture of the sighting. That article also says that the rocket exhaust appears so brilliant because the sun was just under the horizon, causing it to illuminate the exhaust trail but not the surrounding sky. This is the exact same reason the SpaceX launch looked the way it did, and rocket technology, frankly, hasn&#39;t changed much in the last 100 years. We still use kerosene for rocket fuel. Yes kerosene. So the outputs are similar, the stages of thrust are similar, and these would appear similarly illuminate by the sun being in a similar position. </p>

<p>The other source image, from Vancouner, is not only very dissimilar in appearance to the SpaceX launch, but it&#39;s blatantly a picture from some kind of production set, not a live picture taken of a UFO event. </p>

<p>Rubbish. Stop falling for this shit just because you want the world to be more exciting than you think it is. If you study some actual science instead of this pseudo-science, you&#39;ll not only be able to spot disinformation like this, but the world actually becomes <em>way</em> more fascinating than you probably think it is if you don&#39;t understand the physics and chemistry of events like these. You will literally be able to bear witness to more of life if you do the <em>de rigour</em> of studying it instead of engaging in these fantasies. We haven&#39;t been contacted by aliens, despite that they are statistically likely to exist (they&#39;re also statistically likely to be extremely far from us in both time and space). </p>

<p>All I am saying it wouldn&#39;t be hard to make us believe it was only a &#39;rocket&#39; cause false information would not be hard to spread, especially in these times. You were at the rocket launch? Great. I wasn&#39;t and I&#39;ve never seen a rocket launch before so I&#39;m gonna keep calling it a UFO. </p>

<p>Why should we believe them when they didn&#39;t believe us for so many years and still won&#39;t share any information with us. I call bs they&#39;re up to something even if it was just a &#39;rocket&#39;. We shouldn&#39;t be giving them the luxury to herd us around.</p>

<p>Well that sounds quite useless both in terms of accuracy and effect.</p>

<p>Many steerable ICBM warheads have a CEP of &gt;100m, though some are close to zero.</p>

<p>Even if a 500kg tungsten rod survived the atmosphere completely, retaining it&#39;s velocity and mass, the impact would be roughly comparable to 0.006 kilotons of TNT which is nothing. Why not put a 500kg real warhead into orbit instead?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live near Joint Base Lewis Mcchord in Washington State. I had seen 2 of these this past summer. I was freaking out and couldn&#39;t find any explanation. It wasn&#39;t on the news or social media. I didn&#39;t happen to take any picture as it seemed like it much further away. The first one traveled vertically towards earth.  Then it happened a month or so later, this one was traveling horizontally.  My girlfriend claims it was the air force.</p>
