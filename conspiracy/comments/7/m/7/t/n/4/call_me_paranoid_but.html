<p>i mean does anyone else get the vibe that this is a precursor to a false flag attack on the internet?
i mean hey everything is russia fault right, its not like the NATO countries have been pushing to try and restrict access to information on the internet for the last 10 years.</p>

<p>i mean lets be honest 90% of people would wake up to no internet access to anything outside of north america, see the manufactured news story blaming russia and fall for it hook line and sinker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. Putin is going to try to influence anything he can. The idea that he put all his eggs in one basket with Trump is absurd. He is going to try to manipulate any situation he finds himself in. That isn&#39;t a criticism, that is just logical. The only thing Putin is consistently aligned with is Russia.

    <div class="md"><p>exactly, i even think the idea that putin is just in it for himself is absurd. i mean im not saying he isn&#39;t living lavishly, but everything i&#39;ve read about the guy prior to the current propaganda war picked up. painted him as an honest, moral, ass busting kind of guy who was driven by wanting what was best for his people.</p>

<p>its hard not to idolize the guy to an extent when you read peoples opinions on him prior to ukraine/syria, and the sort of day to day life he actually leads.</p>

<p>america hasn&#39;t seen a leader comparable since Roosevelt imho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i know they wouldn&#39;t that is why it seems like such a red flag that they are pitching that they would.</p>

<p>i mean even if you assume russia is the devil, this would have zero positive outcome for them. they would lose the vast majority of their influence with the north american public. which of course would almost certainly lead to war, if not even more aggressive actions from the US (more fully backed by the public)</p>

<p>my concern here is this is a primer, this is the sort of false flag that actually could lead towards open war declared by the US, with no internet access to russia or europe, they US would be completely free to fire up a media blitz to blame russia via their little echo chamber as the outside voices over seas like (bbc,al-jazeera, etc.) would be all but completely silenced with in N.A.</p>

<p>This was actually a very successful deterrent employed by Richard Nixon referred to as the <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/03/25/madman-in-the-white-house/">Madman Theory</a>. He did a lot of wild shit because he wanted the Soviet Union to believe that the guy steering the wheel in the proverbial White House ship was batshit crazy. Nixon was a known drunk and Kissenger would cover for him but at the same time let certain stuff leak to support this whole concept that Nixon could be triggered to do something insanely stupid at any minute so you better tip toe around him and don&#39;t even think about scratching your nose in church. </p>

<p>It worked... to a degree. Overall it worked.</p>

<p>Russia could be playing a similar game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well its not impossible, but it is incredibly improbable.
if you know much about Putin this isn&#39;t his personality. hes the kind of guy who warns you once, then knocks your head off the next time.</p>

<p>and this isn&#39;t coming from the kremlin or their usual sources, its coming from a US outlet that constantly <del>shills</del> advocates on behalf of the government policy.</p>

<p>if this were brinkmanship from Putin the source of the story makes no sense, this is coming from the US media so unless you think putin own the US media the idea falls pretty flat imho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pure propaganda from BI, imho.</p>

<p>Perhaps they&#39;re protecting the World from <strong>UTI - United Nations Telecommunications</strong>...something to ponder.</p>

<p>Give this piece a read between the Lines:</p>

<p><a href="https://builtvisible.com/messages-in-the-deep/">https://builtvisible.com/messages-in-the-deep/</a></p>

<p>This from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are currently 263 active cables in place, with a further 22 planned in coming years. <strong>It is estimated that between 95% and 99% of all Internet usage is carried along these cables.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if it is 90-95% Worldwide every Nation would be in deep shit!</p>

<p>The first time I recall taking notice of the Threat was in 1989 when this goober schmuck did sell Intelligence to the KGB. We have many more loose cannons now than ever before and the threat of being <em>cut off</em> is very real - Who Watches the Watchers?</p>

<p>As it stands now, TPTB in cahoots with the UN would benefit from massive world wide destruction of these vital lifelines. Every World Leader would be faced with a complete Societal Breakdown if underwater cables were systematically sabotaged. Again, just my layman analysis/opinion.</p>

<p>However, with the word &quot;apparently&quot; I was indicating skepticism of the claim that Russia manipulated a US election to install a puppet.</p>

<p>The fact remains that according to the mainstream media, Russia has far more to lose by taking down the internet than it has to gain, so this propaganda seems to contradict earlier propaganda.</p>

<p>A country deliberately destroying or tapping into these lines would absolutely be an act of war.  what do you think we fight wars over? </p>

<p>Dude, use some history with your shit thinking.</p>

<p>If you stopped trades in the seas back in the day, you&#39;d start a war.</p>

<p>The internet is huge.</p>

<p>Think of it as the same.  You can&#39;t simply fuck with something so large and not think a war wouldn&#39;t start.</p>

<p>Like what in the fuck are you talking about?  FB?  Dude do you even know what the internet is used for?  Are you drunk?  I am.  But lay off the Everclear.</p>

<p>because you can&#39;t check your facebook </p>

<p>Do you realize it isn&#39;t just people checking Facebook right? </p>

<p>Right now you sound the same as someone railing on Millennials because they ate some avocado toast and didn&#39;t buy a house.</p>

<p>Right now, beyond satellite communications, which are far and away used by governments, the military and more as compared to what I&#39;ll call ground-based Internet is the primary way business is done.</p>

<p>Markets around the world would come to a grinding halt. As banks couldn&#39;t move their money they would start immediately going into panic mode and limiting what you could do. </p>

<p>News and information coming from other parts of the world to the regular Jane and Joe would come to a halt and what did come through would be via media satellites controlled by a very select group of global media companies. It&#39;s amazing how much China has been able to control what their population sees and hears via controlling what comes in and out. Also... Arab Spring anyone?</p>

<p>Access to cloud services in an interconnected world would start to fail and we&#39;ve seen a huge shift to the Cloud for a decade now. It&#39;s not just syncing your iTunes library but major businesses rely on the cloud to run their daily operations.</p>

<p>Good luck on your freedom of travel as you try and book trains or planes outside of your country.</p>

<p>Worldwide supply chains would fail and I&#39;m not just talking about getting your latest Android tablet delivered on time. Do you know where half your food comes from? Because if I bet you start looking at some of the packaging you might be surprised by its country of origin. </p>

<p>I could list 50 other things but I think this enough.</p>

<p>Two other thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Internet is not just the web (WWW) which is something so surprisingly few people know. If the Internet is a train track most people think of the web as its only traffic. It&#39;s a track and all-purpose one and it is moving things you have never heard of that people rely on every day.</p></li>
<li><p>This all has a cascading effect. You might say &quot;so what, my bank is a local community bank, they only have 20 branches... I&#39;ll still be able to get my money&quot;. Think again. The whole system is so interdependent at this point that a failure at the top or even in the most minute area no one was looking (<em>[the second largest power blackout in history was caused by a bug no one was thinking about](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003</a></em>) which trickles down to everyone far and wide.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>well as others have pointed out 90-95% of the internet traffic is through the cables. if they were suddenly gone, if 10% of that traffic was shifted to the sat network it would be all but useless.</p>

<p>in that sort of scenario what traffic do you think would be shifted to satellites? you would think the highest priority, and if the cables were physically cut were talking nearly a decade to replace them all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh. I was thinking, &quot;Well, if Russia has an interest in the internet cables, then I hope they keep it to the military&#39;s secret cables which I don&#39;t care about.&quot;</p>

<p>But a false flag? Hm. Yeah, they could use Russia as an excuse to cut the wires. Would piss off a lot of countries, though. Not sure the US could get away with it, some other country might look into it.</p>

<p>I guess stuff like this is why we need satellite internet. Not as fast, but it&#39;s hard to pretend it wasn&#39;t you who shot a rocket at it to blow it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well thats not actually a better option. it infinitely more difficult to cut a deep sea cable (let alone hundreds) than it is to shoot down a satellite.</p>

<p>in fact several countries already have anti-satellite capabilities
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon</a></p>

<p>the problem on top of that is the volume of traffic. (think wifi vs a hardline for example)</p>

<p>we simply do not have enough satellites to carry the volume of traffic we have when 90-ish % of the traffic is currently through the cables.</p>

<p>it would also make it incredibly easy for the USG to censor everything due to our own media being isolated, the average person wouldnt be able to read BBC, aljazeer, or even RT.</p>

<p>any sort of false flag like this would imho be almost immediately followed by open war (weeks maybe months or less) </p>
