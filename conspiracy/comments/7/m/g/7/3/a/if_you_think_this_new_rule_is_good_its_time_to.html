       Your posts now require a submission statement. That'd be great if that was where it ends. Apparently not however. Not only do you need a submission statement, but it needs to be an "effective" one. This opens the door for any and all potential mod censorship. At any point a mod can disagree with your attempt to tie your post to a conspiracy by deeming your submission statement as ineffective. And in that very thread Mods are trying to say there is nothing subjective about this rule? Come fucking on. "Here are some tips for writing an effective Submission Statement." This is the nail in the coffin. This "trial" is too see how stupid r/conpsiracy really is. If you willingly give the mods power to decide what stays and goes based solely on their opinions then what good is this community anymore? This rule is entirely designed to subvert r/conspiracy. If you support it you obviously haven't been following how the game works long enough.

       If the mods were some crooked cabal hellbent on censorship, I think they'd just delete whatever they don't like and then ban the users that complained about it. They wouldn't need to implement some new convoluted method to do so, cause there is already enough ambiguity in the pre-existing rules to rid the board of whomever they wanted to.

       You can't subvert a community overtly. That's not how it works. They want it to function, so its a double edged sword. Keep the discussions going, but only in the direction they want. If they outright banned and censored there would be no community left to steer

       If they wanted to delete posts, they could find any excuse they wanted to anyway, like many other subs do. I've never seen that here. Why is it going to start just because you're now required to add a couple sentences in your own words describing what you're posting? This makes no sense whatsoever.

       He's not freaking out. Every time the authorities talk about implementing censorship it should be HIGHLY scrutinized. Free speech is the foundation of conspiracy theory.

       I agree, I would have preferred a rule that blocks links and articles threat are political attacks, not conspiracies, here is an example of a post that is not about a conspiracy but is only a political attack.

       An article that is both fake news and a political attack.  The investigating committee that questioned Stein is a Republican majority committee.  The majority party decides who they question, not the minority party.

       Look at the comments. Look at the downvoting of the submission statement. 
Complete attempt of censorship by political correctness.

       And all the sheep here love r/conspiracy new police state, they are begging for yet, then they turn around and bitch about the government. Ridiculous hypocrites.

       This is a discussion that needs to be had if he users of this community value it in any way shape or form. Now watch all of the "nothing to see here" "you're overreacting" we'll get. Eventually you'll need submission statements on self posts too. It's so god damned blatant it's mind numbing that it needs to be pointed out.

       I've already seen submission statements that barely meet the definition, yet mods have allowed them, so I think you may be over reacting a little.

       I will agree that there is a potential for abuse. But there is a potential for abuse in any situation where a small number have to police a larger number.

       In the example below That WayneCarversMedSkool gives, i happen to agree with the initial statement but i also think that copy/pasting one line from an article is complete BS as a submission statement. Its not opinion, its the opposite of opinion.

       It’s like presenting a thesis for your post. It’s a sub of “critical thinkers” right? I see no problem with the posts having a more professional feel, instead of just spam with no description.

       I’ve seen a few mod posts that most all of the submission statements are being reported to the mods, and that the mods aren’t even able to see who is doing it. Strange stuff

       Bots infiltrating the sub posting propaganda at rates that can’t even be managed is what really controls the narrative. This rule in particular specifically filters that out. I’m. It seeing the issue.

        this new rule does not apply to self posts

       , you can just make a self post which will act as your submission statement and include the article link within it.. without fear of deletion under #13.

       Seems like a way to limit discussion  ...the idea for the new rule was also floated out a few times before the initiation in a manner that reminds me of other propaganda and censorship tactics.  I could be wrong though

       I'm highly skeptical of any people in charge claiming their trying a new form of censorship in order to create a more harmonic atmosphere. This is usually just an excuse to get people to allow them to steer the narrative of the community. Everyone needs to remain very skeptical of the mods over the next few months to see exactly how they implement these new rules.

       The fatalism exuding from others is not so good. Was the forum supposed to stand still? Nothing breeds complacency quicker than stagnation.

       This new rule is a big steaming pile of dogshit.  It should never have been implemented without some kind of CSS rules forcing you to make the statement prior to submission post.  I've had two of my posts (valid non political conspiracy posts) removed 12 hours after submission because of forgetting about this fucked up rule.  It feels like we're in highschool.  The mods are frantically enforcing this dumb ass rule.  Check out
       <a href="/u/Ambiguously_Ironic">
        /u/Ambiguously_Ironic

       post history.  They're enforcing this rule more harshly then I've seen with any other rule.  Total bullshit.  These 4 month old Mods (all the mods over conspiracy but one) are shady af.

       I like the new rule, because if you dont have something valuable to discuss, we dont need more shitposting on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is in dire need of what it used to have- discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now its a shithole of astroturfed comments found in deliberately fake, misleading or biased posts. I love the fact that people are now required to explain why a certain piece of info should be important to this community.

       If this helps clean out the garbage posts and users on this sub, I will stop deleting my comments :-)

       He's not freaking out. Every time the authorities talk about implementing censorship it should be HIGHLY scrutinized. Free speech is the foundation of conspiracy theory.

       expect to see a lot of right-leaning people support censorship that protects their narrative. Which is why so many people are skeptical as to why majority of people supporting these new rules are right leaning.
