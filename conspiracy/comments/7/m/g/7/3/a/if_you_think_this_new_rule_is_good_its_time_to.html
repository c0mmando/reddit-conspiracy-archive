        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Your posts now require a submission statement. That&#39;d be great if that was where it ends. Apparently not however. Not only do you need a submission statement, but it needs to be an &quot;effective&quot; one. This opens the door for any and all potential mod censorship. At any point a mod can disagree with your attempt to tie your post to a conspiracy by deeming your submission statement as ineffective. And in that very thread Mods are trying to say there is nothing subjective about this rule? Come fucking on. &quot;Here are some tips for writing an effective Submission Statement.&quot; This is the nail in the coffin. This &quot;trial&quot; is too see how stupid r/conpsiracy really is. If you willingly give the mods power to decide what stays and goes based solely on their opinions then what good is this community anymore? This rule is entirely designed to subvert r/conspiracy. If you support it you obviously haven&#39;t been following how the game works long enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This new rule is a big steaming pile of dogshit.  It should never have been implemented without some kind of CSS rules forcing you to make the statement prior to submission post.  I&#39;ve had two of my posts (valid non political conspiracy posts) removed 12 hours after submission because of forgetting about this fucked up rule.  It feels like we&#39;re in highschool.  The mods are frantically enforcing this dumb ass rule.  Check out <a href="/u/Ambiguously_Ironic">/u/Ambiguously_Ironic</a> post history.  They&#39;re enforcing this rule more harshly then I&#39;ve seen with any other rule.  Total bullshit.  These 4 month old Mods (all the mods over conspiracy but one) are shady af.</p>
