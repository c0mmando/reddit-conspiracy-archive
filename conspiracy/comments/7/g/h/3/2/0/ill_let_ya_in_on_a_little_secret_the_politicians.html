<p><a href="https://youtu.be/-WqlNPYCxe0">https://youtu.be/-WqlNPYCxe0</a></p>

<p>When you get to a certain level of the federal government, you are merely an actor. Your job is to convince your constituents and followers, that you care about the party and the people, and that the &quot;other side&quot; is the reason for all the problems. </p>

<p>TPTB either select these people because they can trust that they will perpetuate this  scripted and fake presentation of politics, OR they are channeled in through a secret society like freemasonry or an Ivy League fraternity. </p>

<p>In reality, behind the scenes these guys all get along and enjoy lavish parties and vacations together. But, when the lights come on and the stage is set, they put on their masks and go back to the script.</p>

<p>I believe there is a group of &quot;social engineers&quot; who literally write and screenplay the political drama and theatrics of each 4 year presidency. Even the presidential candidates are in on this. This even includes Trump, and his cabinet of Goldman Sachs billionaires. This is the big secret of politics that most of the masses don&#39;t understand yet, and a decent portion of this sub has yet to embrace this either.</p>

<p>We need to realize this on this sub. I&#39;m not even exaggerating a little bit, these people are legitimately actors playing a political role to add legitimacy to the left right paradigm. </p>

<p>this mentality is a sickness. And I think that&#39;s how they get you to support one or the other. Remember Romney vs Obama? Social engineers selected Romney to run against him, made him act all sleazy and corrupt, basically handing him the election by default. </p>

<p>My post doesn&#39;t mean we should &quot;give up because they&#39;re all in on it&quot;. It means grow the fuck up and stop putting false hope into an entity of the very system we&#39;re trying to defeat. Gotta realize the programming first, then we devise a plan or a strategy to defeat them. We need to start 100% fresh from scratch; no phony and corrupt ass electoral system, no phony and corrupt ass politicians, and no fucking left right paradigm to keep people on this pointless political treadmill forever.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about political establishment and last time I checked, the only people who care about auditing or even ending the Federal Reserve are conservatives. OWS was also years ago, the movement has completely fizzled out, and today&#39;s leftists are now preoccupied with criminalizing misgendering people, censoring people on Twitter, and punching &quot;Nazis,&quot; among other trivial issues.</p>

<p>Okay let&#39;s hear some names and the outcome as a result of their hiring? Is everyone from Wall Street an evil, corrupt bankster? Do they determine legislation or does Trump? Wasn&#39;t Obama the one whose cabinet was almost 100% matched with a list proposed by Citibank? And I find it funny you fail to mention his almost 100% endorsement of non-establishment candidates and railing against establishment politicians and media figures. </p>

<p>Besides his bombing of Syria (which was unconstitutional and based on a false flag gas attack), and his support for police militarization (which alone should be enough to make you back peddle).</p>

<p>He seems to have a cozy relationship with former billionaire pedophile Jeffery Epstein. It&#39;s reported by Epsteins brother he even flew on the underage sex plane. Is that presidential to you? Why do you give him a pass here? </p>

<p>His support for the CIA was another troubling issue. &quot;I&#39;m with you 1000 he said! Trumpers always come up with some 4d
Chess excuse, but he bowed down here.</p>

<p>Also, why did he meet with known globalist and murderer Henry Kissinger and claim he was a &quot;great man&quot;? More 4d chess? </p>

<p>How about when he vowed to &quot;bomb the shit out of the Middle East and take the oil?&quot; Does that sound like a non corrupt president to you? Also, he constantly supports warrantless spying and information collection under the guise of &quot;protecting us from terrorism&quot;, which is another bullshit lie.</p>

<p>Dude I could go on and on, the signs are all there. Quit plugging your ears and man up and face the truth. TPTB can still be defeated even if trump isn&#39;t the savior you hoped he was. </p>

<p>Because much of the establishment IS against him. That doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s actually working for the people, of course, everything he does is for himself. But the establishment really does dislike him. The funny thing is that because his policy positions are basically the same as theirs, the propagandists in the corporate media don&#39;t even offer substantive criticism of his actual faults. They make shit up about Russia and criticize him about not being polite enough, then turn around and actually praise him when he does actual horrible shit like bombing Syria illegally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the difference is what&#39;s there if you are interested in details.  These are details that effect real people&#39;s lives.  </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a couple mistakes &quot;everyone&#39;s the same&quot; people make.  First, they have this pipe dream that there will one day be a glorious time when politicians aren&#39;t shit.  That&#39;s ain&#39;t happening. Politicians will always be shit.  They&#39;ve been shit for a thousand years, and they&#39;ll be shit a thousand years from now.  Seriously, you can read Jeremy Bentham and Mark Twain and fucking Plato and Shakespeare complain about politicians, and they&#39;ll have the exact same complaints we do today.  If your issue is that politicians are shitbags -- that ain&#39;t getting fixed, and you gotta learn to take what you can get within the bellcurve of shit-baggery.</p>

<p>Second, yes, mainline politicians operate within a general framework of acceptable opinions.  That&#39;s always the case, but that doesn&#39;t mean this framework is static.  The process of moving it is generational, but it&#39;s possible.  In the meantime, there&#39;s meaningful difference within the framework that not only impacts millions of lives in the present, it influences how and whether you&#39;ll be able to shift the framework over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely when it comes to foreign policy, wars, support for terrorists and terror states and regime change agenda&#39;s drawn up by Neocons and AIPAC both corrupt US political parties are on the exact same page. And war and all the deception that comes with it is the big money maker. Those inside dealings related to weapons contracts pay huge on the stock market. Hence the reason why Jared Polis and others on both sides of the aisle have so many millions. They also rob the citizenry through supposed charity and social justice causes led by USAID, NED and Human Rights Watch. They create the deceptive narratives and funnel money to NGO&#39;s that conduct the propaganda for regime change agenda&#39;s for the Empire. Oh, and Bernie Sander&#39;s is in on this game too. Hence the reason he supports the White Helmets terrorists and the war in Syira/anti-Russia narratives about the election and Trump. They are all in on it. The faux left is being shepherded once again by Sanders who already sold them out once to Clinton. Note that he also stayed mum on Seth Rich&#39;s murder and the crimes revealed in the DNC/Podesta leaks. </p>

Congress had an economic band-aid applied to keep us economically relevant in the 80s in the form of lobbying and other shady federal practices. Since then both sides have indeed been polluted but in a way that makes it impossible for people to be cohesive. Regulating capitalism (even a little bit i.e. limits on lobbying by massive freedom destroying corporations) is &quot;crazy&quot; libtard shit while wanting a shotgun/rifle/pistol is now seen as vehemently right wing stupidity. They are mutually exclusive by design, one small example of a 2 headed snake aimed at patronizing and demoralizing the population at large.

<p>Of course it doesn&#39;t.  Everyone should be held accountable.  But you&#39;re not holding people accountable if you throw up your hands and say, &quot;They&#39;re all the same!&quot;  That&#39;s the opposite of accountability, because it blurs everything together.  It&#39;s like if a judge doling out sentences throws up his hands and says, &quot;They&#39;re all criminals!&quot;  Sure, that&#39;s true, but some of these people shoplifted and some are murderers -- if you paint them with the same brush you&#39;re not holding the shoplifter accountable, you&#39;re letting the murderer off the hook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought over in my head what it would take to create a government that is ultimately for the people and mostly shielded from manipulation, and I have considered capital punishment as an answer. But, no one would want to hold office, and I&#39;d be worried that more skilled manipulators would find better ways of hiding their &quot;campaign donations&quot; and framing their political opponents as traitors.</p>

<p>If you wish to earnestly tear down the current establishment, you should also formulate a plan for the aftermath.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, I think a better answer is found in Monty Python&#39;s The Holy Grail, where King Arthur&#39;s group comes upon the anarcho-syndicalist commune. Not that I think we should go syndicalist, but the idea that lawmaking decisions should be rotated as a semi-randomized draft. No more career politicians, no long standing hidden agendas. Each term, hold a new draft of people from all walks of life in the nation, to truly represent all peoples equally. That 1% of ultra-rich folk have their chance to get that 1% of the responsibility.</p>

<p>Transfer the &quot;Secretary of-&quot; roles to &quot;Cabinet of-&quot; for smaller groups of well-educated people for specialized sections, all of which are filled by the drafted central cabinet. Each one of these cabinets would be filled with <em>advisers</em> and <em>administrators</em> for foreign policy, military, healthcare, etc. as one would not expect a drafted layman to fully understand all facets. But, they would not hold any lawmaking power of their own. Every person elected to these roles has an equal say within their own cabinet, so that any pressure, bribes or blackmails into a corporatist agenda would be rendered ineffective.</p>

<p>The drafting mechanism must be a fully open-source platform for all to audit, kept to the utmost transparency. We have the technology to pull this off easily in this era. Rather than registering to vote, annually entering consensus data into a state run website of your household income, household occupants, race, sex, ssn, etc. would be the requirement, and that only adds people the age of 18 or older to the draft pool. Of course, all the draftees would need to provide some amount of proof to make sure their info is accurate at time of drafting.</p>

<p>All systems dealing with birth certificates, death certificates, immigration, etc would need to be linked to make sure that all those entered into the system are truly living persons, to prevent manipulation. The drafted cabinet members would have to be transported to a central location to govern the nation in person. No one person would get preferential treatment, but contracts with businesses would be established to make sure they have everything they need and are able to pay bills at home.</p>

<p>I know there are some huge gaps and concerns with this model, it&#39;s a very rough draft. Although, I&#39;m thinking something like this might be our best chance at creating a government model that thwarts manipulation and abuse from exceedingly powerful and influential forces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are on the right line I think, but <em>every</em> system is subject to corruption, and if the society has corrupt people they <em>will</em> find a way to corrupt the system.  So I think that in order to create such a system the first and strongest focus needs to be on the people themselves, the way they are raised and educated -- to create a moral, law-abiding citizenry from which effective leadership can be drawn.  Then we need an economic and legal system that benefits everyone, rather than one set up to enrich the elite at the expense of everyone else.  (That is a huge discussion in itself, and even a tl;dr would go too far off topic.)  Every system is a reflection of the people that make it, so regardless of how theoretically well designed a government is, if the people who make it up are lacking in good morals/principles the government will be as well.  </p>

<p>Anyways, I think these core societal issues need to be dealt with first to create a good and lasting political system; but of course it will take drastic changes in our political system to enact these educational, social, economic, and criminal/legal reforms in the first place.</p>

<p>Quite the Catch-22, huh?</p>

Because 100% of what a politician does is going to get a reaction from people - especially in a polarized, 2 party system.

Events like the actual elections, wars, releasing technologies, or making massive changes to society is what they control.

    <div class="md"><p>Happy to see this post.</p>

<p>I&#39;m dumbfounded at the sheer numbers that flock into arenas for these WWE events. They blur reality at many levels. You get fake drama that leads to fake physical conflict that leads to fake alliances and/or rivalries. </p>

<p>The best wrestlers know how to work a mic and work a crowd. They can go out there and insult the viewers and beat up their favorite wrestlers, but as long as they do it with confidence and can make the crowd believe that they&#39;re a somewhat of a flawed villain, the crowd will still pop for them.</p>

<p>This formula proves various things about crowd spectator dynamics. I&#39;ll share some of my opinions on this with you all. </p>

<p>If you saturate a crowd with a healthy dose of the same characters that stand for <em>something</em> and are always conflicting with others because of it, then the crowd will eventually be interested in their journey. They will hope to see a resolution to the conflict. </p>

<p>Individual members of the crowd might hold their own beliefs on whether they agree with the characters&#39; motives, but the intrigue will remain to see them succeed or fail.</p>

<p>This same exact formula has proven to work with reality TV. Many people can&#39;t look away because they see conflict trying to be resolved by characters that believe in something. Look at the Kardashian BS on TV as an example. They&#39;re always conflicting with one another to keep the viewer engaged. There may not be any meaningful resolution, just as WWE story arcs fail to hit their marks, but the people keep coming back to watch more.</p>

<p>Politicians have staff that identify goals and outline paths to achieve them. Social engineering is a huge part of reaching those goals and we see it every day as they cozy up with the media and newspapers. I do believe that they are all friendly with one another when the camera is off because they can all give each other a nod knowing that they&#39;ve made it to the big leagues. Their names are in the history books and depending on how well they&#39;ve worked the people of the country, their families can reap the fruit of their accomplishments for future generations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worth pointing out also that they attend lavish huge meetings at the same resorts, such as Sea Island&#39;s Clositer Hotel down in Southeast Georgia where AEI and the Carlyle Group meet each year with mainstream media attendees participating for a week. They discuss domestic and foreign policy, and the event is attended by both political parties and famous dignitaries. The media, of course, keeps it all hidden from the publics eyes. Attendees from think tanks such as Brookings and the Atlantic Council are also regularly in attendance. How do I know this? I used to be a waiter that worked there for a few years. Its interesting to see how cozy and buddy-buddy they all are with each other when not in front of the camera&#39;s. That&#39;s what opened my eyes and led me to realize that it is all a grand charade to enrich and empower a select few that are schooled at manipulating the masses. </p>

<p>Could it be? Trump is just another chapter? Sigh. I don&#39;t know. I do remember the video of... back to the future &quot;predictive programming&quot; 9.11 was pretty convincing. I was like wow. And then it also showed &quot;biff tannen&quot; character was pretty close to resembling trump.. I&#39;m like wait what. ..hmmm...HMMM... that&#39;s interesting plus the illl-game-card of trump &quot;enough is enough&quot; ...plus the serendipitous phrase of &quot;TRUMP CARD&quot; almost like it was written for script. ... ugh-hmmm-sigh. .

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve turned this over in my head, I don&#39;t blame you for thinking as such. There&#39;s a problem with that theory though. It just doesn&#39;t line up with the strategy they employed. Clinton&#39;s machine used an all out blitz with the media to destroy Trump. You can read in her leaked emails they planned to use him as a pied piper candidate to lead the Republican Party into unviable crazypants territory and easily beat him. They were sure they couldn&#39;t lose. Why were they so sure? Well for one, they knew they had him wiretapped. </p>

<p>What happened with Trump is more nuanced than what you&#39;re suggesting, which requires ignorance of too many facts to hold any water. What we likely saw was a last minute coup by a rival gang, who&#39;d likely recruited Trump for this years ago. Don&#39;t forget we&#39;re in the middle of a civil war inside the IC. Don&#39;t forget 100 agents tendered their resignations on comeys desk last summer. </p>

<p>For me, it goes beyond question that Trump, whatever his other motives, was clearly against this old guard establishment when he did what he did at the Al Smith dinner and it would take enormous evidence to convince me otherwise. You give these people too much credit.</p>

<p>We’ve been on the same path driven by the same driver(s) since at least the 60’s. It doesn’t matter if there’s an ‘R’ or ‘D’ before their name. I’m reminded of a hidden video I saw during the Bush presidency where some nefarious foreign body was trying secure a meeting with powerful politicians. The person being recorded was none other than future VP Joe Biden, offering up a meeting with none other than President Bush. Tell me how could this be, when publicly, they’re on opposite sides? (I do not recall the purpose of the video, other than to show that these politicians are quite cozy with one another). </p>

<p>Additionally (perhaps a bit of topic), it’s why we spend so much on the military and all that entails (black budgets etc). We [i]have[/i] to. Otherwise, our own nefarious deeds would bring us to our knees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at who is the hands behind Trump. You will see Stephen Schwartzman CEO of Blackstone Group who has a personal wealth of $10.5 billion. You will see Gary Cohn of Goldman Sachs, also worth billions. You will see Steven Mnuchin of Goldman Sachs, also worth hundreds of millions. You will see Sheldon Adelson worth over $25 billion and a lead AIPAC pusher for Israel. Guess who also sits on the board of Blackstone Group? Zionist Lord Jacob Rothschild. Now guess who they all partner with on multi-billion investments like the Ukraine blood coup? Why George Soros of course. Franklin Templeton and the Soros Foundation had a combined $9 billion invested in Ukraine&#39;s Nazis succeeding in that coup. Blackstone Group worked with the IMF to get them the best financing. Naked Capitalism covered this at the time. </p>

He has fooled his base to get in power and now playing a role that ensures the divide and conquer agenda. Your friends are as gullible as those progressives that thought Obama would prosecute Bush for the illegal invasion of Iraq. Trump has already kissed the wailing wail, danced with Saudi swords and posed with the pope. Tell your friends to watch Trump at AIPAC in March 2016 to see the real Trump. There&#39;s a reason Kissinger sat right behind him and Clinton at the Al Smith dinner. Tell them to check out those vids on You Tube. </p>

<p>They select their puppets based on a number of factors. Charm, appeal to the masses...</p>

<p>But they also choose them based on social agendas. TPTP are trying to incite a social and civil war within the American public. </p>

<p>The best way to do this, is to select a puppet who has a racist appeal, and a demographic that follows him.</p>

<p>Trump is nothing more than a catalyst selected by the elites for this purpose. They know what they are doing. This election painted both sides against one another effectively. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>think this is totally correct but with a slight twist or 2:</p>

<p>1) it isnt a grand plan IMO, its just greed (for money and power) and laziness at work. Politicians say whatever they have to in order  to GET elected, and then once in office they do whatever their donors tell them to do (regardless of what they promised or what &quot;party&quot; platforms are). So the &quot;acting&quot; is correct, but its to fool the public into voting for them and then continue fooling them into thinking they really <em>WANT</em> to do what they promised the people, but the &quot;other side&quot; keeps getting in the way.</p>

<p>2) The candidacy and then election of Trump changed this dynamic. Well, nothing has changed yet in reality, but he has EXPOSED the truth, pulled the curtain back on the system for the public to see, even though the media worldwide, right down to paid shills and trolls in this very sub, keep trying to cover it all up again.</p>

<p>Sorry, not gonna happen</p>

Its literally just a world wide psychopath network using political theatre so they can retain control over humanity&#39;s most valuable asset, its attention, rendering them unable to enact meaningful change on their own because they are constantly looking to authority for solutions. The political actor&#39;s giuld uses people like Kim Jong as a boogeyman and North Korea allows them to erode our freedoms and constantly have a place to point to and say &quot;You are free because it&#39;s not as bad here as it is there&quot; Then they use all the tools in their social engineering arsenals to create a CULTURE they know will be conducive to their aims (for example, the hippy drug culture did not come about organically and definitely helped to sabotage meaningful activism)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to explain this to some of my family members from time to time but usually to no avail. Just look at videos from Trump&#39;s inauguration - after the whole ceremony when he went back inside the Capitol building to sign executive orders. I remember watching that and seeing Nancy Pelosi and other high ranking Democrats positively giddy and laughing and excited standing next to Trump as he signed documents and handed out the pens. </p>

<p>Even on the news the other day, during that stunt when Pelosi and Schumer refused to show up to that meeting with Trump about the tax plan, but then the news actually showed a photo looking through the window of Schumer hugging Trump and laughing. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all a complete show. 100%. </p>

<p>You have determined that this is a conflict between the elite and the rest of us. This is called class consiousness. Consciousness means nothing however if you have no hope that the American people will ever be able to free themselves. I&#39;m sure many of you don&#39;t even think its possible and have fallen completely into dispare. It is possible, but you need theory and organisation before any change can commence. You can point out the problems of this system but until you understand it you have no way of forming a plan to kill it. So, who has studied the elites that control us? Who is the great demon these elites so despise and fear. Their greatest enemy, Marx.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the post! I see a lot of posts (especially in places similar to this one) that tend to generalize the entirety of government systems as being corrupt. I do believe that corruption runs rampant, however I do not think it has total control. With recent events in mind, it does seem like a lot of corruption is being weeded out. Ending corruption is a lengthy process. Most of which cannot happen in the public eye. After the corruption is &#39;purged,&#39; we must remain diligent. It will never be fully eradicated. We cannot become complacent.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1seThIG34R8">https://youtu.be/1seThIG34R8</a></p>

<p>Relevant article about who is mostly financing US elections.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/meet-the-billionaires-bankrolling-the-presidential-election">https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/meet-the-billionaires-bankrolling-the-presidential-election</a></p>

<p>It reminds me of the phrase All the world&#39;s a stage.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world%27s_a_stage">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world%27s_a_stage</a></p>

<p>In a globally connected digital society, all the world really is a stage in a literal sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the world&#39;s a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter who is on the stage, it&#39;s who owns the theatre. They can change the actors and go on with the show. Like WWE, it&#39;s also like a soap opera.</p>

<p>Trump is literally a WWE villain.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/MMKFIHRpe7I">https://youtu.be/MMKFIHRpe7I</a></p>

<p>Holy fuck. You Americans seriously voted for this guy?</p>

<p>Anyways, here&#39;s a picture of Trump and Clinton together.</p>

<p><a href="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1492115397/articles/2016/03/17/the-wedding-that-explains-the-election/160316-daly-trump-clinton-tease_dpubuo.jpg">https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1492115397/articles/2016/03/17/the-wedding-that-explains-the-election/160316-daly-trump-clinton-tease_dpubuo.jpg</a></p>

<p>For people supposedly ideologically opposed, they seem fairly buddy/buddy.</p>

<p>Trump is a perfect agitator. He riles up liberals over twitter and the media loves him for that. They don&#39;t even have to leave the studio to get a story, they can just sit there and hit refresh.</p>

<p>US media is an oligopoly. That&#39;s obvious when you look at the small collectives of large companies that own the majority of outlets. Trump was a glorified game show host on NBC for like 14 years. No shit he&#39;s an actor. </p>

<p>While you Americans eat up all the tabloid garbage news, your government or corporate plutocrat types are probably up to no good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the essence of the American almost-failed experiment at “Democracy”. It is sad that our Founding Fathers predicted this to a T. We Did end up in <strong>Idiocracy</strong> with a WWE albatross dumbass as President. </p>

<h1>Here is our first President, George Washington, talking about Donald Trump in 1796:</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. <strong>The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a bit on the state of our politics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s like he had a window into our times. We are failing as citizens in 2017. It’s on us.</p>

<p>This wouldn&#39;t be the case if all politicians were completely on the same side. What Ventura is describing is how they play up their divisions and disagreements for the public. It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re all working towards the same goals.</p>

<p>TL,DR; Political lines are blurry, and politicians present themselves as black and white in an arena that exists largely in grey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It includes anyone famous in science and math and Hollywood and so on. They live in a movie written for them to play out and we are the audience that also interacts to some extent. There are also double and triple roles and people who play a dozen characters and one character played by several actors and it doesn’t matter Bc to them the roles are fake so Catherine zeta jones or Julia Roberts could play marina abromovic interchangeably- it doesn’t matter Bc none of it is real. Everyone is forced to lie Bc when we talk about these entities we refer to the character names.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The corporate media&#39;s political theater is a huge distraction. The broad topic of politics in general can have an impact on literally every single interaction between humans. There is no way to escape politics, but we CAN escape the propaganda from the &quot;mainstream&quot; media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worth pointing out also that they attend lavish huge meetings at the same resorts, such as Sea Island&#39;s Clositer Hotel down in Southeast Georgia where AEI and the Carlyle Group meet each year with mainstream media attendees participating for a week. They discuss domestic and foreign policy, and the event is attended by both political parties and famous dignitaries. The media, of course, keeps it all hidden from the publics eyes. Attendees from think tanks such as Brookings and the Atlantic Council are also regularly in attendance. How do I know this? I used to be a waiter that worked there for a few years. Its interesting to see how cozy and buddy-buddy they all are with each other when not in front of the camera&#39;s. That&#39;s what opened my eyes and led me to realize that it is all a grand charade to enrich and empower a select few that are schooled at manipulating the masses. </p>
