<p>cuz there aren&#39;t any. I would even accept a schematic of an alleged floor heater. Weird how the nazis would heat floors instead of getting a better gassing scheme. It is almost like the same people who assumed when you shot a can of gas in a movie it would blow up, made these claims. </p>

<p>only in soviet territory, with fake chimneys, and no heated floors... hmmmmmm </p>

<blockquote>
<p>there was administrative paperwork showing the purchase of chemicals.</p>

<p>yes, which allowed for 60,000 cremations to take place not 6 gorillion. but you never looked at the actual papers did you? As for zyklon b, it is a pesticide to kill ticks and lice, which transmit typhus. </p>

<p>Typhus and allied bombing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This room also has a wooden floor over concrete. At one end of the shower room, there are two large concrete bathtubs. The tour guide explained that the prisoners were not allowed to loll in the bathtub, but had to get in and out in a few seconds. A sign in the shower room says that prisoners were given a shower before gassing to &quot;quite (sic) them down.&quot; The tour guide explained that the victims were given a hot shower so they would die more quickly in the gas chamber because the Nazis found that the heat of the bodies caused the gas to work faster. (Zyklon B comes in crystal form, like tiny white rocks, and it must be heated before it gives off the poison gas which kills lice or people.)
A door from the shower leads into the first gas chamber which is a large room with an alcove, that resembles a three-sided room within a room. In the alcove, there are heavy blue stains left on the walls and ceiling from the Zyklon B gas used here. There are two holes in the ceiling through which the Zyklon B pellets could be dropped and openings in the wall through which hot air was blown in, according to the guidebook. This room also has a wooden floor over concrete; the walls are covered with stucco.</p>

<p>found this about activation temps: &quot;The gas chamber also had to be heated, as the Zyklon B pellets would not vaporize into hydrogen cyanide unless the temperature was 27 °C (81 °F) or above.[31]&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>how about you supply the date of this. I bet it is way after the report you already know about. </p>

<p>post some pictures of the room that has holes in the roof, be sure to include the escape hatch and fake chimney. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>from what i&#39;m reading here i get that you&#39;ve never been to europe/went to a camp nor have you ever spoken to a holocaust survivor. your arguments are absolutely insane. 
pesticide to kill ticks and lice? lol as if the germans gave a damn. i had the chance to listen to many survivors tell their story and all of them described how bad the hygiene was and how they hated being in their Baracke &#39;cause of all the lice and stuff. 
I have also visited Dachau Camp and I stepped inside the gaschamber which was marked as &#39;Brausebad&#39; - it definitely was not a bath. You are clearly misinformed about that whole thing because I learned that gaschambers weren&#39;t used and thought for killing people but towards the end of the war they started using them for that. 
I have no idea why people think this was a hoax - it was very much real </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the put options are pretty crazy as well.  Not only those, but check out this article by a guy who investigated the put options with the CIA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This industry veteran had read the book and reached out to me to relate a story he had never told anyone before.</p>

<p><strong>He said that on September 10, 2001</strong>, the day before the terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon, he was at a customer outing and received a frantic phone call from his sales assistant who was covering the desk in his absence.</p>

<p><strong>A major sovereign wealth fund had called to place an order to buy $2 billion of 2-year Treasury notes</strong>. Even by the standards of large bank dealers, an order for two billion dollars of notes in one transaction is almost unheard of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The collapse is great and all, but I normally stick to prior knowledge for instance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 9/11 Commission Report, published in July 2004, included statements that tended to absolve a pair of Saudis living in Southern California before the attacks of sinister involvement with two Saudi hijackers – <strong>Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.floridabulldog.org/2017/11/ex-fbi-agent-says-911-commission-misled-public/">Source</a></p>

<p>Those two lived with an undercover FBI informant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hijackers-lived-with-fbi-informant/">Two of the Sept. 11 hijackers who lived in San Diego in 2000 rented a room from a man who reportedly worked as an undercover FBI informant, highlighting the lack of cooperation by the nation&#39;s law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
Newsweek magazine reports that <strong>Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi</strong> lived with a &quot;tested&quot; undercover &quot;asset&quot; who had been working closely with the FBI office in San Diego.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CIA &amp; FBI were both warned about them a years in advance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi -- another of the September 11 hijackers, also on American Airlines Flight 77 -- were among those photographed by police at the meeting in Malaysia.</p>

<p>In March of 2000, another nation told the CIA that Alhazmi had flown from the Malaysian meeting to Los Angeles.
Nevertheless, it appears the CIA let more than a year go by before putting the men on a list of people to be kept out of the United States.</p>

<p>Government officials with knowledge of a timeline submitted to Congress told CNN Justice Correspondent Kelli Arena that in <strong>late December 1999 or early January 2000, the FBI and intelligence agencies were alerted to a person named Khalid</strong> who was said to have terrorist connections. No last name was given.</p>

<p>On or about January 5, 2000, the officials said, the agencies were given more information about Khalid -- that he attended the meeting of suspected terrorists in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the benefit of that, is the presumption the dollar or notes will rise in value after a terrorist attack or a war? In a way you have to consider the urgency of it. If it&#39;s a bigger conspiracy no one is putting in a very obvious order the day before. It seems a rushed. Whereas a few months before, to absolve liability is a bigger red flag to me, just harder to prove and link</p>

<p>The ever changing number of Deaths</p>

<p>Its illegal to question the official story in most of Europe</p>

<p>Nazi&#39;s were funded by Zionists &amp; the Holocaust led to the creation of Israel</p>

<p>We Let Hitler escape death &amp; Flee to Argentina</p>

<p>Its used a way to make Jews the victim &amp; to shield them from any Criticism</p>

<p><strong>9/11</strong></p>

<p>Each plane on 911 had specific targets all of which were hit with great precision. There were 3 major securities brokers in the Twin Towers, Cantor Fitzgerald (largest in US), Euro Brokers and Garban Intercapital. Flight 11 hit the North Tower right below the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald destroying all records of securities transactions. Cantor Fitzgerald was the primary target. Flight 175 hit the South Tower below the offices of Euro Brokers and while this all took place massive explosions were reported in the North Tower under FBI offices on the 23rd floor and under Garban Intercapital on the 25th floor again destroying any and all securities records. Flight 77 hit the Pentagon targeting the Office Of Naval Intelligence where investigators were working on illegal international financial schemes based out of the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, Eurobrokers and Garban Intercapital. Flight 77 not only destroyed all records related to these investigations but it also killed 39 of the 40 Naval Intelligence Investigators. The flight that crashed in Pennsylvania missed its target, building 7. All certificates for US bonds and other securities were completely destroyed. The first and foremost reason for the events of 911 was to conceal the identities of the 100s of intelligence assets, international bankers, elected officials and international players involved in the demise of the Soviet Union and to prevent the exposure of a &quot;National Security&quot; event, the destruction of the Soviet Union. The 2nd reason behind the events of 911 was to end for all time the ongoing investigations by numerous government and non-government organizations into these money laundering and gold market manipulations. The 3rd reason behind 911 was to provide the cover to allow for vilification of Islam and for blame to be placed on Islamic Fundamentalists allowing for public opinion to support extended wars to acquire global petroleum and mining resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing if you look at my subs I don&#39;t necessarily believe anything out right. What I believe is that if you put enough evidence in one place paradigms can change and unforeseen connections can be made. </p>

<p>I think there is strong evidence for a cover up of some kind.  When you get into the nitty gritty of history of just a few hundred years ago you start to notice phrases like &quot;generally believed to be&quot; or &quot;experts suggest&quot; or &quot;the original has been lost &quot; etc . You start to poke at these instances and the evidence for the official story starts to fall apart. </p>

<p>The most intriguing evidence is in places like Tomsk Russia where the entire city even the churches in the outskirts of town appear to be covered at least 8 feet sometimes 30 feet in soil. </p>

<p>These places in the middle of nowhere are important because the buried churches we see have very fine brick walls sometimes 7 feet thick! These exist in regions with no  history of industrial manufacturing. And there is no way to claim that they magically raised the city like is claimed in Chicago or Seattle. </p>

<p>So something moved millions of tons of earth and sand in the past. If the dates of the buildings are to be believed then this would have to have happened sometime between 1700 and 1860.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Russia is an immense country. They kind of have a history that is difficult to pin down outside of the well known population centers. There are areas where the population rarely sees outsiders and they still hold some very old world pagan beliefs. The Tunguska event happened in a very sparsly populated area and it took decades to get any kind of real documentation of it, now it would be easier but so much time has passed...
The Russians themselves share a country with vastly different cultures within it. With Chinese to the East to the Baltics in the West to the Laplanders to the North and Afghanis to the South and lots in between. That country has gone through purges as if they were the originators of the word. Gveb that, it is nowhere near impossible to believe that in some areas people honestly dont know what happened in the areas they live in, they just dont. Soviet education for the masses is a relatively recent upgrade. It used to exist fine, for the elite, well You know along comes stalin and kind of brought the bar low to the ground. So now and i am speaking only of the example you gave with no intention of implying my $0.02 is the answer worldwide, if something strange in russia is found, its going to be a bit more difficult to bring the light of truth to the subject.
I understand and agree with the basics of your comment though, and have heard of stories around the world through books, old and new, and through <em>ahem</em> the internet. However i am not educated in the specific areas in which these are mentioned so it leaves more of a feeling inside my gut than slap across my face with hard evidence. That aside, got any other examples? I&#39;m always in the mood to listen. ⛰</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to admit I never really took the time to look into both those tragedies. I heard about them but, hey life. I also kept hearing about the actors and false flag. Yours were the first video of both off these that I have seen. It looks pretty weird, and yeah it definitely looks like some staged event. My question is, when does this ride of lies stop? I really want to get off it. This world is insane and its taking everyone with it. I no what I can&#39;t believe in as I&#39;ve stopped believing anything the government says, I can&#39;t make sense out of many of these events because there are too many rabbit holes to fall into, too many possibilities to consider with each nullifying the others out (for example the weird fact if no debris in the flight that crashed in Pennsylvania. That was no plane. But if that wasn&#39;t w plane there were no passengers, no passengers no terrirists. But then there is all this other evidence of terrorists roaming around up through  9/11. One of these stories cancels out the other. And there are many other theories that make sense just like that). I&#39;ve stopped giving my opinion to everyone but here in Reddit because...well I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve experienced it too. Lastly I am losing sight of what can be done. </p>

<p>Now that all these sexual abuse allegations by people (whom as children were around him) are being made about everyone BUT Michael Jackson. </p>

<p>Corey Feldman spent a TON of time around him. MJ was a classic example of a good man who did a TON of things to help heal the world and was targeted once he started pointing out things that just weren’t right in the world. </p>

<p>When the allegations first started in 1992 about Jackson molesting a 12 year old it was a media circus (coming soon after OJ’s mess) Jackson was 35. But the story is really a tale of parents looking at Jackson as a paycheck. And the media exploiting his kindness. The man had a heart of gold. </p>

<p>I think all of the pedophiles in Hollywood probably LOVED the attention he gained as they continued to manipulated threatened and coerce their victims into silence. </p>

<p>There have been a ton of books published, even dissertations that support that Michael Jackson was an eccentric man, childlike in his actions and interests but NOT a ped and was framed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll one Up you on this MJ Truth:</p>

<p>The minute Michael Jackson gained ownership of this valuable catalogue of songs the powers that be plotted and worked feverishly to gain access to it. In 1995 Sony Music approached Michael with an offer to pay him $95 million to merge his ATV Music Publishing with Sony&#39;s catalogue forming a 50-50 joint owned venture. It was basically an offer Michael couldn&#39;t refuse because it was very attractive and lucrative. Not only did he earned back twice his initial investment he now owned 50% of a much larger company which eventually grew to over 2 million songs! As a result of this shrewd business move Michael now owned songs by artists such as Eminem, Lady Gaga, Bob Dylan and other highly acclaimed artists.</p>

<p>In a few short years, things became sour between Michael Jackson and Sony. He was dissatisfied with them as an artist and he felt that they were purposely under promoting him. He believed that there was a conspiracy against him and the true aim of this lack of promotion was to use financial trickery to say that his albums weren&#39;t making a profit and costing Sony money. He was supposedly in the red and actually owed Sony money for marketing and promotion.</p>

<p>Michael believed that this was an attempt to squeeze him financially. He surmised that Sony believed that if he got further into debt (he had outstanding bank loans with Bank of America that he was making payments on) he would be forced to sell his 50% share in the partnership to them enabling them to wrestle sole ownership of the publishing catalogue. Things began to happen to Michael, during this time period he was accused of child molestation which he settled out of court for $20 million. After this incident, he was coincidentally once again hit with another charge of child molestation which he was found innocent of in a court of law.</p>

<p>Michael began to speak out against Sony and the head of their music division Tommy Mottola. He even went as far as launching an anti-Sony campaign which included rallies that included slogans such as “Sony kills music” and “Sony sucks”. He also recorded the anti-establishment song “They Don&#39;t Really Care About Us”. As Michael&#39;s relationship with Sony progressively deteriorated he anticipated his exit from Sony altogether.</p>

<p>On June 9, 2001 he even outright states the following: </p>

<p>&quot;The minute I started breaking the all time record sales, I broke Elvis records, I broke the Beatles records. The minute Thriller became the all time selling record in the Guinness Book of World Records, overnight they called me a freak, they called me a homosexual, they called me a child molester, they said I bleached my skin. They made everything to turn the public against me. This is a complete conspiracy you have to know that&quot;.</p>

<p>On July 15, 2002 almost a year later he came out even bolder with his claims against Sony. In a gathering in London he said the following:</p>

<p>“The tradition of great performers from Sammy Davis Jr. to James Brown to Jackie Wilson to Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, the story is usually the same. These guys work really hard at their craft and their story ends the same. They are usually broken, torn and usually just sad and the story is very sad at the end because the company takes advantage of them they really do. And Sony being the artist that I am, I have generated several billions of dollars for Sony and they really thought my mind was on music and dancing and it usually is, but they never thought that this performer, myself would outthink them.</p>

<p>So we can&#39;t let them get away with what they are trying to do because now I am a free agent and I owe Sony just one more album and it&#39;s just a box set. So I am leaving Sony a free agent owning half of Sony. I own half of Sony&#39;s publishing and I am leaving them and they are very angry at me. I just did good business you know and Tommy Mottola is a devil. Mariah Carey after divorcing Tommy came to me crying. She was crying so bad I had to hold her. She said to me that this is an evil man. Michael this man follows me, he taps my phone and he is very very evil and I don&#39;t trust him and he is a horrible human being”.</p>

<p>Also during this time period (around the time of his molestation trial) media reports began to surface stating that Michael Jackson was flat broke. Michael refuted this notion in an interview with the Reverend Jesse Jackson when he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s not true at all, that is just one of their many schemes to embarass me and drag me through mud and it&#39;s the same pattern so don&#39;t believe any of this tabloid, sensationalized kind of gossip&quot;.</p>

<p>My personal beliefs on the subject of Michael Jackson being broke is that he felt in his mind and based on the financial numbers how could it even be possible that he was flat broke when he owned a music publishing catalogue worth more than 2 billion dollars? Although it appears that he had mounting debts and his cash flow wasn&#39;t as strong as it used to be I personally believe that in order for him to extinguish these mounting debts and be cash flow positive, he would have to sell a portion of his catalogue or the entire thing and there was no way that he was going to do that.</p>

<p>Another viable option for him to tame his debts was touring which he had not done in years. Despite this fact, Michael received an offer from AEG (Anschutz Entertainment Group) to do a supposedly 50 show London world tour which according to the New York Times would have netted him 132 million dollars. Michael seeing the value of this opportunity signed the contract. Despite having signed the contract according to those around him he never really consented to do 50 shows because he knew that he was not physically capable of doing them.</p>

<p>Although Conrad Murray was ultimately convicted in the death of Michael Jackson I strongly believe without a shadow of a doubt that the murder of Michael Jackson involved a wider conspiracy. The powers that be saw him as a threat because he wasn&#39;t the Peter Pan character that they believed him to be. This was surely a problem for them because he had influence over billions of people throughout the world. The Deep State feared that he would use this influence in a way that would be counter-productive to their agenda. He also owned 50% of the world&#39;s most valuable music publishing catalogue and he wasn&#39;t willing to part with it. So in their eyes he had to be eliminated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A literal swimming pool at Aushcvitz. Conformist coward historians defend the absurd ridiculous claim that it is a water reservoir disguised as a swimming pool. Too bad the blocks for the jumping boards are still clearly visible, and there&#39;s plenty of pictures of it with the jumping boards still attached. It&#39;s also placed way on the outskirts of the camp, whereas water reservoirs are traditionally always centrally placed to allow for efficient distribution. The claim that it was there for officers and german guards is also bogus as it is behind the camp inmate buildings. A pretty massive reality check for people who have never questioned that part of history.</p>

<p>This room also has a wooden floor over concrete. At one end of the shower room, there are two large concrete bathtubs. The tour guide explained that the prisoners were not allowed to loll in the bathtub, but had to get in and out in a few seconds. A sign in the shower room says that prisoners were given a shower before gassing to &quot;quite (sic) them down.&quot; The tour guide explained that the victims were given a hot shower so they would die more quickly in the gas chamber because the Nazis found that the heat of the bodies caused the gas to work faster. (Zyklon B comes in crystal form, like tiny white rocks, and it must be heated before it gives off the poison gas which kills lice or people.)
A door from the shower leads into the first gas chamber which is a large room with an alcove, that resembles a three-sided room within a room. In the alcove, there are heavy blue stains left on the walls and ceiling from the Zyklon B gas used here. There are two holes in the ceiling through which the Zyklon B pellets could be dropped and openings in the wall through which hot air was blown in, according to the guidebook. This room also has a wooden floor over concrete; the walls are covered with stucco.</p>

<p>found this about activation temps: &quot;The gas chamber also had to be heated, as the Zyklon B pellets would not vaporize into hydrogen cyanide unless the temperature was 27 °C (81 °F) or above.[31]&quot;</p>

<p>how about you supply the date of this. I bet it is way after the report you already know about. </p>

<p>post some pictures of the room that has holes in the roof, be sure to include the escape hatch and fake chimney. </p>
