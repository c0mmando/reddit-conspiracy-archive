    <div class="md"><p>This predatory rape culture that you&#39;re talking about isn&#39;t being eliminated here. The media is giving the illusion that it&#39;s being purged, but this kind of predatory behavior is commonplace across all industries everywhere and the media is clearly selectively choosing who to burn if you look at what allegations get attention and which don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I&#39;d agree that people seeing this happen in the media is a good thing in that it encourages victims to expose their attackers, but the media showing this does not necessarily represent reality. Please don&#39;t make the mistake of trusting that the corporate media actually represents reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s not going to be eliminated over night. But it is giving courage to the assaulted to come forward, like you said, which is good.

<p>Like I said, look at what allegations get attention and which ones don&#39;t. Look at how the allegations are covered and how this differs from person to person. Don&#39;t just think about Kevin Spacey and Donald Trump, think about George Takei and Bill Clinton. Consider how recent allegations against Spacey and Trump were covered, consider how recent allegations against Takei and Clinton were covered (or not covered). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well how would you suggest it be covered? I&#39;ve seen Takei stuff everywhere and heard plenty of stuff about how Bill Clinton should be talked about more in regards to his past.

<p>Men are socialized to be less willing to admit to being victims. Because of what it says about their masculinity or some bullshit. </p>

<p>There obviously are high profile male victims though. Off the top of my head there&#39;s Corey Feldman who has been talking about pedophilia within Hollywood for decades, and Terry Crews has also recently told a story about being victimized as well. I can&#39;t recall his name, but there&#39;s also the actor who brought Kevin Spacey into the spotlight when he told a story about Spacey assaulting him when he was a teenager. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then hypothetically if I rob someone on the street, then afterwards the victim says it didn&#39;t happen out of embarrassment, the robbery clearly didn&#39;t happen. Because we can ignore what actually happened for what spin is put on it right?</p>

<p>Had a whole conversational bit with <a href="/u/johnbranflake">/u/johnbranflake</a> where he said federal employees, specifically those under executive branch, don&#39;t have loyalty to the constitution but only to the President. The guy either is some really sheepish Trump supporter or a really bad troll farm/PR worker. </p>

<p>It is almost like a certain agency is throwing all of its assets under the bus.</p>

<p>Not all of them. Just a select few, especially those guilty of the lowest offenses. We&#39;re not hearing about people drugging and raping children even though it happens, instead we&#39;re hearing about creeps masturbate in front of people, sometimes after asking for permission first. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s OK, but it&#39;s obviously a much lighter offense than the depths of criminality really going on. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn">controlled burn</a>. &quot;Controlled burning is conducted during the cooler months to reduce fuel buildup and decrease the likelihood of serious hotter fires.&quot; They burn the low level creeps to protect the high level ones. Before long we&#39;ll probably be hearing shills saying things like &quot;Nope, obviously X is not guilty of any crimes like that, they would have been exposed when everyone else was!&quot; There have been new allegations made against Bill Clinton, but did anyone see the corporate media give those allegations the same attention they gave to others? That&#39;s how you know that certain targets are being selectively burned. They got the go-ahead from higher up to let certain people go down, but others still must be protected. </p>
