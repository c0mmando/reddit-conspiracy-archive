<p>Amazing.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/5WmCC">http://archive.is/5WmCC</a></p>

<p>Going from top down...</p>

<p>3 month old account that supports Antifa, constantly posts in support of GMO&#39;s and vaccines, repeatedly defends the YouTube Elsagate videos and appears to even downplay the removal of Net Neutrality.</p>

<p>A 1 month old account that constantly posts Anti-Trump spam, even in conservative subreddits, even pushing the refuted Buzzfeed piss dossier.</p>

<p>An 8 month account with only 28+ karma directly linking to and praising <strong>CNN</strong> with 156+ upvotes? Yeah, that&#39;s a natural non-shill thing on Conspiracy. Weirdly this one also has a history of downplaying the Elsagate/YouTube pedo scandal...claiming its not real and it&#39;s just a 4chan prank.</p>

<p>Nothing suss here. No siree. Clearly I&#39;m [shill tactic 43: &quot;calling anyone who disagrees with you a shill&quot;] and [shill tactic 16: &quot;you&#39;re a Russian bot!&quot;].</p>

If she sounded more credible they would have definitely went with the story. They didn’t because they knew he was trying to run something by them.

    <div class="md"><p>Veritas had to release this very mundane footage quickly because the Washington post caught them red handed trying to vindicate a pedophile. Every news source talks about Trump a lot. He&#39;s a controversial subject and people want to hear about the latest stupid ass thing he said. So the fact that news stations and papers talk about Trump a lot isn&#39;t very mind blowing. </p>

<p>And then the guy they are interviewing says there are some super liberals writing in the editorial section. Holy shit, a left leaning newspaper has liberals writing in their opinion section? Stop the fuckin presses, that&#39;s crazy. </p>

<p>Bottom line, it doesn&#39;t effect a new papers credibility. Project Veritas tried to trick the Washington post and they failed miserably. Now, the Washington post looks like a credible news paper who vets their stories and O&#39;keefe looks an asshole trying to vindicate a pedophile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are the things Trump stands for.</p>

<p>That was clear. Learn to read.</p>

<p>The man is accused of raping his ex wife, of raping an underage girl, of assaulting 16 other women at least.</p>

<p>He called for new forms of torture, not for intel or safety, but because the bad guys deserve it as he put it.</p>

<p>He called for taking out families of suspected terrorists.</p>

<p>He called for police to beat suspects.</p>

<p>It&#39;s telling that you somehow aren&#39;t aware he said all of these things, and that you know these things are bad, but try to put them on me instead of the president. Sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Veritas had to release this very mundane footage quickly because the Washington post caught them red handed trying to vindicate a pedophile. Every news source talks about Trump a lot. He&#39;s a controversial subject and people want to hear about the latest stupid ass thing he said. So the fact that news stations and papers talk about Trump a lot isn&#39;t very mind blowing.
And then the guy they are interviewing says there are some super liberals writing in the editorial section. Holy shit, a left leaning newspaper has liberals writing in their opinion section? Stop the fuckin presses, that&#39;s crazy.
Bottom line, it doesn&#39;t effect a new papers credibility if they have a lean. Project Veritas tried to trick the Washington post and they failed miserably. Now, the Washington post looks like a credible news paper who vets their stories and O&#39;keefe looks an asshole trying to vindicate a pedophile.</p>

<p>See, now I wrote it. Happy now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair tho, Trump’s “stupid ass things” he says (not my words) are actually a useful distraction for him when negative stories take center stage. It’s pretty brilliant on his &amp; the GOP’s part, distract from the negative stories and at the same time rile up his base by throwing anger/hate at some random opponent. It’s worked better than any political strategy in the last decade and better than any strategy that the democrats have had in maybe 20 years.  </p>

<p>TIL recording people saying VERY SPECIFIC THINGS, and letting those things stand on their own, is propaganda. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to libel someone with the most destructive epiteth we have in our culture, you damn sure better have some kind of objective evidence to back up the statement.  Otherwise it&#39;s easy to see that you&#39;re just using the phrase &quot;Child fucker&quot; as hyperbole to embellish your argument  Becuase let&#39;s face it...you have no argument.  </p>

<p>Veritas got exposed (again) and they try to turn it around and claim victory, taking the most extreme interpretation of their footage. </p>

<p>Their videos show them saying &quot;we don&#39;t like trump (duh), we report things factually, but sometimes get too hung up on some things&quot;. I&#39;m struggling to see what the breaking story is here</p>

<p>No one said they trash Trump for ratings. Trump being gone would hurt them, that&#39;s obvious. But it&#39;s like saying the cops wouldn&#39;t have a job if there&#39;s no crime. It doesn&#39;t mean the cops are manufacturing all the crime, it doesn&#39;t mean wapo is making things up about Trump, it&#39;s just stating the obvious. Project Veritas, on the other hand, manages to manufacture scandals. </p>

Nothing they have ever done has been legitimate, they dont release raw footage, they edit encounters to make them look different from what actually happened and yet for some reason, you and several others from the same place seem to think (or at least are trying to convince people) that wapo did something wrong when they literally caught an actual paid shill in the act of trying to falsify a story to discredit them.  </p>

<p>This, after wapo was also hit with a fake auto-call claiming to be them where &quot;Bernie Bernstein&quot; offered money for dirt.</p>

<p>Actual false-flaggery, actual examples of a group supporting those in power teying to manipulate people&#39;s views and subvert the free press are sitting right there and this is what you do, you defend poor project veritas because theyve never had an ulterior motive and have always acted in good faith, havent they?</p>

<p>The same people who were adamant about stopping a pedo ring that turned out to be in their imagination will defend a literal pedophile and support attempts to discredit the victims if it means getting their way.</p>

<p>It seems the NYTimes fired a couple people in the wake of Project Veritas&#39;s investigation, but the paper will not confirm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are the things Trump stands for.</p>

<p>That was clear. Learn to read.</p>

<p>The man is accused of raping his ex wife, of raping an underage girl, of assaulting 16 other women at least.</p>

<p>He called for new forms of torture, not for intel or safety, but because the bad guys deserve it as he put it.</p>

<p>He called for taking out families of suspected terrorists.</p>

<p>He called for police to beat suspects.</p>

<p>It&#39;s telling that you somehow aren&#39;t aware he said all of these things, and that you know these things are bad, but try to put them on me instead of the president. Sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s dissect this for bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they could release full tapes. They don&#39;t. For a reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Horse shit&quot; of course, being the scientific term for &quot;I don&#39;t want to accept what I&#39;m seeing on camera, nor can I defend against it, so I&#39;m just going to call it names.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are paid by the sitting president to create quite literal propoganda </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citation needed as to the sitting president thing.  I&#39;m aware the Trump <em>campaign</em> paid PV for opposition research.  This is not controversial, really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to create quite literal propoganda and you don&#39;t seem to care whether it&#39;s true or not .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TIL recording people saying VERY SPECIFIC THINGS, and letting those things stand on their own, is propaganda. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here we have definitive evidence that PV is working </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, Doing their job</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to defend a child fucker and </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re going to libel someone with the most destructive epiteth we have in our culture, you damn sure better have some kind of objective evidence to back up the statement.  Otherwise it&#39;s easy to see that you&#39;re just using the phrase &quot;Child fucker&quot; as hyperbole to embellish your argument  Becuase let&#39;s face it...you have no argument.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you are worshiping them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Defending their tactics, yes.  Absolutely.  I will continue to support them financially as well.</p>
