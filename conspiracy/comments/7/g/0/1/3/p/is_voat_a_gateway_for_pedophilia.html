    <div class="md"><p>People are intentionally closing their eyes. Yes, there are creeps on the internet. Yes, they hang out in places where censorship is minimal. You know who else has to lurk in bizarre places so as to have a forum? Researchers. Whistleblowers. People that KNOW they are being censored not for what their content is, but bc of what it puts a light to. </p>

<p>Everyone discusses PV, and easily discredits anything they say.. Funny thing? PV was late to the pizzagate show, yet the msm, reddit and the internet at large would have you believe they started the investigation as a shmear campaign... Those of us that have been here since the beginning know this to be false. PV is probably controlled opposition. Trying to get ahead of us, and give us yet another leader, someone to rally behind... Who just so happens to be another pawn. Go figure. </p>

<p>A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent&#39;s argument, while refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be &quot;attacking a straw man&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ohhh ok. </p>

<p>Well.. you might want to pass on to this &quot;council of nine&quot; that they might want to recalibrate their .. TopMinds-o-meters.. or whatever, because I&#39;m not from there, and I don&#39;t post there.</p>

<p>I read posts there, because they are pretty funny when they roast people.</p>

<p>I may even have messaged a couple of them because they seem to be pretty cool guys.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not from there, and I&#39;m not a member.</p>

<p>I like it here. There are a hell of a lot of cool people here.</p>

<p>But I think it can be even better, and I will do what I can to see that happen.</p>

<p>I mean, you can say that all of my comments here are negative, but I think that anyone looking at my post history can see that&#39;s a bit unfair.</p>

<p>I lean towards the critical, perhaps, but I think that it&#39;s important to examine our beliefs.</p>

<p>I can even be a bit of a dick from time to time, but that is my prerogative. Sometimes the appropriate response to a claim or some behavior is mockery. Sometimes it&#39;s also just fun. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.</p>

<p>Anyways, I think that&#39;s all I have to say to you.</p>

<p>Give my best to the council.</p>

<p>Voat only exists because Reddit is too censorship-happy. Subreddits that get banned (like many pervy ones) go to Voat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are legal differences between nn, modelling, and porn. I&#39;m not agreeing with the lines, just acknowledging they exist. The same laws that enable old navy or the gap to photograph kids in swimwear enable cretins online too. The same laws that enable you to take photos of the beach are the ones that enable these ppl their creepshots. The same laws that deny a teenager&#39;s ability to make bodily decisions are the same ones that many use to make statutory rape claims, a charge that acknowledges consent, yet remains illegal due to vague ideas about age. 
You can&#39;t stop them, but you can use the same loopholes to expose them.  Voat comes in handy, an archive of r/conspiracy of sorts. While the conversation here spins the gears, the content there cements the need for further research. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t need any more censorship online, we need to protect the places we can speak freely, even if that means we share space with those we despise. Their loophole is our loophole until the laws change to bar us all from discussion. </p>
