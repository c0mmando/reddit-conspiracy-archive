       Do any of you believe that we are being legitimately watched/tracked? Some of us are dark web users, truther‚Äôs, post on our social media‚Äôs our views/opinions and are labeled as ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù I will not disclose what I personally look at and know, but it‚Äôs always in my head that I‚Äôm being tracked/watched, and sometimes get thoughts that my own life is in danger at time. It‚Äôs me overthinking, but you can‚Äôt help to think that at times. Anyone have any feedback and our thoughts on this?

       A few quips from someone who has long been interested in conspiracies (since I was a kid, am old now):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        As far as being labeled crazy. Sometimes people in the community post some 'crazy' things without any real proof or absent direct proof at least a good case (look at flat earth or pizza gate. Not talking pedophilia but that one specific thing).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       We should all strive to better document and phrase things as well as vet sources. We complain about 'anonymous' sources in the MSM but they usually know their source and vet them. While others take the word of 4chan without question. That is a mistake and hurts us all.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        People watching us or feeling threatened: See 1 above to some extent. If you can't make an actual case why would they bother? Add to that I would be more worried about corporations bringing suits and the like against people exposing them. The government can more easily claim plausible deniability on many things (especially when people are relying on sources they don't question because they tell them what they want to hear).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       We should approach things more like an attorney/prosecutor might and consider those we are trying to reach as a jury. That takes real work and checking our sources and limiting the scope of the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       If you have a smart phone, internet, and exist in society, you're definitely being watched. Shut off apps on phone that monitor and bloat ware, but it doesn't matter. They're harvesting data. We collect it for them.

       I have a personally formed conspiracy that us with ‚Äúawoken‚Äù minds have already been identified that we can‚Äôt be controlled nor swayed to be a puppet. We are our own opposition and they know it. The things I say in person and sometimes even text have to be recorded and or logged. I scare myself sometimes with what my brain can comprehend and understand haha.

       That's a part of it I think a large part is that you're a mod for 5 subs and just awake in general and trying to enlighten others, an upside to remote neural monitoring is knowing when they don't like something I do and when I was mod of a public sub they'd induce a lot of random pains throughout the day more than usual till I quit.

       This isnt the 80s. We no longer need physical people to "watch", collect, and quantize data. Everyone that can be watched is being watched. Were now at the scary point where they have enough computer power that it isnt all just collecting data to collect data. Real time analysis of everything from the serious to the mundane because they can.

       Its not that you dont have to worry tis they you probably dont have to worry.

       I sincerely doubt that I and most people are actually a threat to TPTB or whoever, unless we get together is mass groups and start protesting like in South Korea last year. I think most people on here like to research diffrent theories which isn't really a threat.

       Unless you're actually up close and poking the bear, in direct contact with someone with information, or actually doing illegal things online, I think you're fine.

       I personally think most people who follow this type of stuff on here and 4chan are probably on some kind of mild list.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt (((they))) give to much of a shit about us though, everyone is being tracked of course but for most on here it will just be computers scanning for key words etc rather than a bunch of shady guys having a file on you and watching everything you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the people that do the digging they don't like and I mean real digging, physically investigating things and making videos or blogs about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around the time pizzagate and the wiki leaks insurance file thing exploded for some reason I started getting super paranoid about clicking certain links and stuff posting about it though. I had to stop following the different threads about it all.

       No I don't think I'm being watched or tracked. A year or so ago France said they didn't have the manpower to track all the suspected terror sympathizers in their country. So why would your country have all the would be terror suspects on full time watch and still have left over manpower to watch the few million or so conspiracy theorists too? I think people give intelligence services too much credit. They are full time busy watching real threats. And they are probably pretty good at separating real dangers from kooks. 
This is something people here don't want to hear. Anyone ever got a knock on their door from the men in black about an internet post? I have been chatting to people on various conspiracy sites since 1997 and no one ever gets hauled away in a dark van. There are too many people here to watch. 
But if it makes you feel important to think the NSA is hanging on your every word me saying its bullshit won't change your mind.

       I‚Äôve been tracked and watched before. Got a hell of a story for you Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three years ago I was growing weed in the closet at my apartment. There wasn‚Äôt any smell. Air ventilation was fine. Electricity usage was very low because I was using LED grow bulbs. Nobody knew about it but my closest friends. None of them would have told the police, these are people I‚Äôd trust with my life and known for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I‚Äôm about 4 months into growing when things start to get weird. I get home from work and I noticed was a cop parked at my complex almost right across from my reserved parking spot on the curb. This is the first time i have ever seen a cop at the complex and I‚Äôve been there for 7 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next thing I noticed. Every fucking day when I drove to work, there would be a cop car on my route parked in a lot near my apartment facing the road, morning and night. So essentially, this cop saw me. Every. Single. Day. Leave and go to work. Likely tracking my whereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried dismissing these things because I didn‚Äôt text or call anyone to talk about my grow setup.  More cops though continue to appear near my place. I felt very uncomfortable and like I was being watched, it‚Äôs eery.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets weirder. I get a random note on my door from the complex that says they need to do a ‚Äúemergency maintenance inspection‚Äù, whatever the fuck that means. I asked my neighbors if they‚Äôve ever heard of this before. They said they‚Äôve been there for years and never heard of anything like it. Hmmmm. Keep in mind, nothing in my apartment wasn‚Äôt working and I‚Äôve never called the complex about maintenance issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I set up my iPad as a remote camera and installed a locking door knob on the grow room. I wasn‚Äôt concerned about anything because as I said, no smell. And the lights aren‚Äôt on unless I‚Äôm home, so there wouldn‚Äôt be any obvious signs of a grow op. I‚Äôm at work watching my apartment through this iPad app. A few guys enter my apartment. They walk immediately to the closet and try to open the door, then they leave. WTF.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later that day I‚Äôm pulling up to my complex after work. There‚Äôs a cop parked on the street facing the gate. I pull up to the gate and enter the code to enter. The second the gate opens, this cop guns it and follows me into the complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, my heart is beating out of my chest. I could hear my heartbeat in my ear drums. I kept looking back in my mirror. He was following me pretty closely. I wasn‚Äôt carrying, but my apartment was loaded with weed and had 3 plants growing...He never pulled me over or came to my apartment. Weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       I decide to throw in the towel. I‚Äôve had enough of these incidents to know it‚Äôs not paranoia. None of this happened before i started growing. I waited like 15 minutes after getting home then i walked outside to see if the cop was there. He wasn‚Äôt.  I chopped up my plants early. I bagged everything so it could cure it, my buddy said he would take care of this for me. I took the rest of the plant materials and dumped them behind the complex in the forest. Then I threw the painter buckets in the dumpster. I kept the nutrients, lights, and fans because those were too valuable and they can‚Äôt convict someone in that alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I‚Äôll post pictures as soon as I‚Äôm back home.

       VHF is the outdated antenna signal used to broadcast channels. Now they use a digital signal, it's not VHF no more. According to a wikipedia article, they "made room" for law enforcement, so they can use those signals. Probably encrypted but wouldn't be surprised if that was used for spying
