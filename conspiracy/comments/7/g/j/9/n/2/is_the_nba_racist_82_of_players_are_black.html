But the NHL is expected to &quot;look to Inner-Cities for New Generation of Diverse Players&quot; while it&#39;s comedy to think that the NBA would do the same for white players.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want answers, usually all you need to do is follow the money.  If the league feels there a market of talent they can profit off of and improve the overall talent in the league, then it would foolish not to do exactly that.  Not sure what your point really is.</p>

<p>MLB had had the opposite problem.  Black and US born players are down.  The league has been trying to grow the sport in minority communities and also trying to improve the coaching at the amateur levels.  </p>

<p>Are they being champions of diversity for reaching out to minorities?  No, they want more of the football and basketball athletes to choose baseball so they can improve their product and profit. </p>

<p>Also, you have to be athletic to play sports, but you also have to have the skill to play professionally.  You can be as strong as you want, run fast, jump high, have elite hand eye coordination, ideal build, whatever your measures are.  You can max out all of them, if you have no professional skills, the coaches are not good enough to bring these skills out anyways, or the opportunity to receive this level of training is not there for you, then you are probably not going anywhere.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get these efforts twisted.  It is not some wholesome diversity program even if some people spin it that way.  They want to increase profits.  It is also not an issue of diversity.  It is an issue of opportunity and again increasing profits.  Plain and simple.</p>

<p>Just a few, and obviously, when talking about races, we are talking about a large group of people, and we are averaging these characteristics.</p>

<p>I mean, England developed the processes that you know as the agricultural revolution by 1725. There are places in Africa and Asia that still haven&#39;t figured it out... The same can be said for the Industrial revolution, the medicinal revolution, and so on...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so this brings up one of the things I was thinking about.  Everyone cries racism when somebody claims that one race has a higher IQ on average than the other...but I had four different people tell me that there are more blacks in the NBA because they are better athletes.  I don&#39;t think that either of these are true...my issue is why is it okay to say one but not the other?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could say the same thing about CEO&#39;s in corporate America.  How do you think CEO&#39;s decide who to hire?  They look at their performance in college.  They look at the measurable on exams or previous workplaces.  Do you think billionaire CEO&#39;s care about some sort of racial makeup?  They just want to make money.  They pick salesmen who will sell the most product.  </p>

<p>Yet there are HR departments dedicated to making sure the company is &quot;diverse&quot; enough.  I&#39;m not saying it should be one way or the other, I&#39;m only asking why the double standard.  Why not have it the same for the CEO and the NBA owner?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there are so many more factors that go into intelligence and there are many different types of intelligence. Athleticism exists independently of your social-economic status, of where you grew up, of your fluency in a language, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think on the surface that argument sounds good but I disagree.  I think that athleticism is more complex than you are making it.  Every sport requires a different skillset so it is hard to measure &quot;athleticism&quot; just as it is hard to measure &quot;intelligence&quot;.  You could do tests to see if somebody would potentially be good at basketball (vertical leap test) just like you could give somebody a test to see if they would potentially be a good doctor (mcat).  But just because somebody can jump high doesn&#39;t mean they could hit a baseball or run a marathon.  </p>

<p>Also, athleticism does not exist independent of your background.  If your parents put you on 3 different basketball teams all growing up but my parents don&#39;t put me in a single sport my whole life, you are usually going to be a better basketball player than I am. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I&#39;ll respond since you took my bait.  I am not trying to divide and conquer like polkadotgirl says.  I am open minded and am willing to hear anybody out.  I actually think the social engineers are trying to divide and conquer by constantly portraying whites as the root to every problem.  I&#39;d love to see all races stop the nonsense and come together as brothers and sisters that we are.</p>

<p>I started to think about this idea when I read a few articles/tweets celebrating how this is the first time in 20 years that the Grammy&#39;s have not had a white male nominated for album of the year.  I don&#39;t care about white&#39;s being left out...heck I can&#39;t sing or dance to save my life.  But the reaction is what got me thinking.  </p>

<p>You say that black guys are better athletes and that is why they are more represented in the NBA.  Using that logic, why would you say white men are more represented in corporate jobs?  </p>
