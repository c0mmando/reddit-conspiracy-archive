       This was my point.  I don't think the NBA is racist.  I also don't think the NHL is racist.  But the NHL is expected to "look to Inner-Cities for New Generation of Diverse Players" while it's comedy to think that the NBA would do the same for white players.

       If you want answers, usually all you need to do is follow the money.  If the league feels there a market of talent they can profit off of and improve the overall talent in the league, then it would foolish not to do exactly that.  Not sure what your point really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       MLB had had the opposite problem.  Black and US born players are down.  The league has been trying to grow the sport in minority communities and also trying to improve the coaching at the amateur levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they being champions of diversity for reaching out to minorities?  No, they want more of the football and basketball athletes to choose baseball so they can improve their product and profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you have to be athletic to play sports, but you also have to have the skill to play professionally.  You can be as strong as you want, run fast, jump high, have elite hand eye coordination, ideal build, whatever your measures are.  You can max out all of them, if you have no professional skills, the coaches are not good enough to bring these skills out anyways, or the opportunity to receive this level of training is not there for you, then you are probably not going anywhere.
      </p>

       Don't get these efforts twisted.  It is not some wholesome diversity program even if some people spin it that way.  They want to increase profits.  It is also not an issue of diversity.  It is an issue of opportunity and again increasing profits.  Plain and simple.

       Just because they expanded into those markets one way or another and the talent is now there to help improve their product, increase the fan base, create a new market, and make more money.  You can put whatever other spin on it that you want, the truth is money.

       Been proven with some of the best basketball players being white, if you try out and have skill.. and can help the team you get on the team.. been happening since picking teams as kids. Never once did I think of racism by choosing a team of who played better together or had more skill.. the original post is garbage..

       I mean, England developed the processes that you know as the agricultural revolution by 1725. There are places in Africa and Asia that still haven't figured it out... The same can be said for the Industrial revolution, the medicinal revolution, and so on...

       That's fine, neither am I. Despite what you may think, I'm not even racist. I am however, intellectually honest, and the white race has undeniably advanced quicker than any of the others.

       Ok so this brings up one of the things I was thinking about.  Everyone cries racism when somebody claims that one race has a higher IQ on average than the other...but I had four different people tell me that there are more blacks in the NBA because they are better athletes.  I don't think that either of these are true...my issue is why is it okay to say one but not the other?

       How do you think NBA teams decide who to draft? They look at their performance in college. They look at the measurables in the gym. You think billionaire team owners give a shit about some sort of racial makeup? They just want to win games. They pick players who they think will win them the most games.

       You could say the same thing about CEO's in corporate America.  How do you think CEO's decide who to hire?  They look at their performance in college.  They look at the measurable on exams or previous workplaces.  Do you think billionaire CEO's care about some sort of racial makeup?  They just want to make money.  They pick salesmen who will sell the most product.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet there are HR departments dedicated to making sure the company is "diverse" enough.  I'm not saying it should be one way or the other, I'm only asking why the double standard.  Why not have it the same for the CEO and the NBA owner?

       Because there are so many more factors that go into intelligence and there are many different types of intelligence. Athleticism exists independently of your social-economic status, of where you grew up, of your fluency in a language, etc.

       I think on the surface that argument sounds good but I disagree.  I think that athleticism is more complex than you are making it.  Every sport requires a different skillset so it is hard to measure "athleticism" just as it is hard to measure "intelligence".  You could do tests to see if somebody would potentially be good at basketball (vertical leap test) just like you could give somebody a test to see if they would potentially be a good doctor (mcat).  But just because somebody can jump high doesn't mean they could hit a baseball or run a marathon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, athleticism does not exist independent of your background.  If your parents put you on 3 different basketball teams all growing up but my parents don't put me in a single sport my whole life, you are usually going to be a better basketball player than I am.

       Lol, what your stating has become more apparent as being racist. Sterotyping is less racist than what you are doing at this moment. And having a higher iq does not translate to having a better education or job. It just means that you have a higher brain power to use to solve things.

       I know you're trying really hard to have some "This totally isn't about races being smarter than blacks" plausible deniability here, but can we drop that for a minute?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if a certain race was less "intelligent" than the average white/asian/whatever what would you do with that information? Give yourself a pat on the back and say, "who's the smart boy, oh yes smart boy you are so much better than those dumbies, who's a good boy!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is that great white basketball players are judged solely on their skill. The same can't be said for blacks in other fields.

       Ok I'll respond since you took my bait.  I am not trying to divide and conquer like polkadotgirl says.  I am open minded and am willing to hear anybody out.  I actually think the social engineers are trying to divide and conquer by constantly portraying whites as the root to every problem.  I'd love to see all races stop the nonsense and come together as brothers and sisters that we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started to think about this idea when I read a few articles/tweets celebrating how this is the first time in 20 years that the Grammy's have not had a white male nominated for album of the year.  I don't care about white's being left out...heck I can't sing or dance to save my life.  But the reaction is what got me thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say that black guys are better athletes and that is why they are more represented in the NBA.  Using that logic, why would you say white men are more represented in corporate jobs?

       Maybe they thought I was really trying to imply that the NBA is racist.  I agree with you...one of the most dangerous things about political correctness is that you can't even have an open discussion anymore about this type of thing so nothing really progresses.

       i think education levels might be something to do with this. i mean, if you were extremely well educated, would you take the risk of trying to become atop level sports player, or would you go get a job with your education so you could live? i dont think there is any double standard here. and yes, you are coming across a little triggered with your post. it isnt double standards. do you want equal whites to blacks for the sake of it?

       While I agree with you that I am weird...the other guy was clearly joking.  Look up the Rooney Rule...he is alluding to something like that.  Just saying that it would sound weird and even racist if you were to say "every rap record label is required to interview x number of white rappers" but yet it doesn't sound weird when it is for black coaches in the NFL.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to play the victim or pull the reverse racism card.  I have just always though it was weird how our minds work and how saying something for one race is totally fine but if you flip it and say the exact same thing for a different race it doesn't fly.

       No it’s not racist. A certain race or demographic excelling in anything does not mean it’s fixed or a race war... let people be great at what they do and stop letting race be a factor.

       No...I mean looking back on it I guess you could say my title was clickbait but I was just trying to think of a catchy title to hear other people's perspective on something else I was thinking of.  I don't really think the NBA is racist.
