    <div class="md"><p>I saw a news article the other day about a 12 year old Swedish girl that got raped. It might have been a migrant that did it, I don&#39;t know, they can&#39;t investigate unfortunately because the murders have to take priority.</p>

<p>But sure, I&#39;m aware of the Stan&#39;s maybe they should take the migrants since they&#39;d have an easier time integrating. I&#39;m also aware of the historical Muslim invasions that but for the grace of God would have succeeded; they came pretty damn close to sacking Vienna and would have got it if not for the Poles; Charles Martel &quot;Hammer&#39;d&quot; them at Tours, the Reconquista took forever... that may all be ancient history to your average European, but not to a good Muslim; their culture is centered around conquest, expansion, and converting their new subjects. Islam is more than a religion, it&#39;s a political system and they&#39;ll never stop. The people that read the nice parts in the beginning of the Quran and call it &quot;the religion of peace&quot; don&#39;t know about abrogation, and it&#39;ll be their downfall; when they come to realize their open minded tolerance and love of diversity is seen as weakness to be exploited they&#39;ll realize too late that they fucked up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m treating the whole Islamic culture as what it is: a foreign culture that&#39;s been about 400 years behind ours ever since the fall of Baghdad; that makes me a pragmatic realist, not a nazi, it&#39;s possible to bring small numbers of them at a time and integrate them into our society and culture, bringing large numbers of military age males that don&#39;t integrate is not immigration, it&#39;s an invasion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, sorry for assuming what you know and thank you for your detailed answer.</p>

<p>On islamic culture being 400 years behind ours I only partially agree, some Muslims are actually not backwards, some know how to step back and keep the best from their culture (the Bible is as backward as the Coran if you ask me, it&#39;s the interpretation that makes the difference). Christianism is also based on invasion and conversion : &quot;Your descendants are going to become like the dust of the earth and spread out to the west, east, north, and south.&quot; (Genesis 28:14) but you won&#39;t see any christian terror group claiming some holy land or starting a holy war (at least not in the last 700 years).</p>

<p>I have close friends who come from practicing muslim families and know how take a step back but still recognize themselves in some aspects of islamic culture. If you make them feel like islamic culture as a whole is bad, you won&#39;t help them to stand back.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we should respect their religion for the sake of multiculuralism, but because it will help them integrate in western society (while still keeping some parts of their culture of course, who doesn&#39;t like kebap?).</p>

<p>Sometimes the best way to have you want is to not say what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>On islamic culture being 400 years behind ours I only partially agree, </p>

<p>The Islamic Golden Age—from the 8th to the mid-13th century—genuinely was one of the periods of greatest flourishing of human knowledge and progress. And Baghdad was its focal point. A truly global repository of human knowledge, this Arab-Muslim imperial capital also welcomed—indeed encouraged—scholars from across the known world. Founded 500 years earlier, Baghdad’s population had reached one million within a century, making it the world’s largest, most prosperous, and celebrated city. For many historians, the arrival of the Mongols into the heart of Muslim faith and empire is the single most devastating moment in the history of the Muslim Middle East. It’s easy to see why—and hard to argue otherwise—because the Sack of Baghdad would mark the end of the Islamic Golden Age.</p>

<p>Doing what they are most famous for, the Mongols thrashed Baghdad. In 10 days of unremitting violence and destruction, Baghdad and its inhabitants were completely, and utterly vanquished. Almost without exception, the population was either put to the sword or sold into slavery. The River Tigris ran red with the blood of slaughtered men, women and children. After this, every building of note in Baghdad including mosques, palaces, and markets was utterly destroyed, among them the world-famous House of Wisdom. Hundreds of thousands of priceless manuscripts and books were tossed into the river, clogging the arterial waterway with so many texts, according to eyewitnesses, that soldiers could ride on horseback from one side to the other. And, of course, the river turned from red to black with ink. Among innumerable libraries and other centers of learning in ancient Baghdad, the greatest of them all was the House of Wisdom—this was the place that the best scholars and professors aspired to reach, and not just Muslims from the Islamic world. Imagine if you will all of America’s Ivy League Colleges rolled into one; add to those the science and technological power  of Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Stanford, and Berkley, then add Oxford and Cambridge to the mix, and the world’s great non-English-speaking universities. That&#39;s coming close, but it was even <em>more</em> influential. Texts from India, Persia, Greece gathered in huge numbers. Texts originally composed in Persian, Sanskrit, Greek, Syriac, and Chinese were all eagerly rendered into Arabic. Combined with this extensive translation work, however, was a wealth of original scholarship, funded and encouraged by the caliphs. The arts and sciences alike were covered, so that advances were made in almost every imaginable subject, including mathematics, medicine, astronomy, physics, cartography, zoology and poetry.</p>

<p>Baghdad was left a broken and depopulated city. Even if those left alive had wanted to rebuild, they lacked the numbers, the resources, and the skills to do so. The death and destruction were such that it would be more than a decade before anyone from Baghdad performed the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. In attacking Baghdad, they also destroyed the network of canals that irrigated the arable land thereabouts. Famine and plague followed the Mongol horde to Baghdad as elsewhere. It’s easy to see why they’re often tagged with a reputation as the most destructive of all the great empires.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about when I say they&#39;re 400 years behind us, I didn&#39;t just pull that number out of my ass; think about what happened after the fall of Rome, the so called &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, or imagine if we got hit with an EMP and for all intents and purposes were back to living in the 19th century for years... that&#39;s what happened to them, it caused them to regress into fundamentalism and they never quite caught back up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christianism is also based on invasion and conversion : &quot;Your descendants are going to become like the dust of the earth and spread out to the west, east, north, and south.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re talking about the Old Testament, those descendants were the Jews. Yeah, we had crusades, but that was more like just what was going on back then, reclaiming the holy land was the &quot;reason&quot;, gold and loot was the <em>reason</em>, hell on one of them they made it as far as Constantinople, a Christian city, said fuck it and attacked them instead of going all the way to Jerusalem and then went back home.</p>

<p>Islam was founded by Muhammad, a war lord, and their basic beliefs are centered around conquest; it&#39;s the reason why within 100 years of his death there were Islamic caliphates controlling Arabia, North Africa, West Africa, the Middle East, and Somalia, and it didn&#39;t stop there, and it hasn&#39;t stopped yet. </p>

<p>Like I said, it&#39;s not impossible for them to integrate into our society, maybe a family or two at a time in a given area; it is impossible to integrate a large population simultaneously because they&#39;ll form a community within your community that&#39;s hostile to outsiders (you).</p>

<p>There are 5 distinct stages that have been identified, and this might sound like racist BS, but there are examples of all of these around the world; you have your Muslim friend and that&#39;s fine, I don&#39;t currently have any Muslim friends but I have in the past, I&#39;m not advocating against all Muslims. I&#39;m against bringing in large numbers of refugees (and so is Trump to get back to the videos he tweeted), like they&#39;ve been doing in places like Germany. It&#39;s not bigotry or racism if it&#39;s reality. So this is kind of like a loose framework of what happens:</p>

<p>Stage 1. ~2% Muslim population (US, Canada, Australia)</p>

<p>Muslims are conciliatory, talk about &quot;the religion of peace&quot;, sell halal food in stores, ask that you don&#39;t let your dog around them, open mosques that give back to the community</p>

<p>-everything&#39;s all good, what&#39;s the problem?</p>

<p>Stage 2. 2-5% population density (UK, Germany, Denmark)</p>

<p>They begin to proselytize other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, start gangs/organized crime often with major recruiting from the jails. </p>

<p>-Usually these are the children of the original immigrants, but you know, what can you do? Kids will be kids.</p>

<p>Stage 3. Establish Sectional Control of Major Cities 5-10% pop density (Sweden, France, Netherlands)  </p>

<p>First comes the demand for halal food in restaurants, and the blocking of streets for prayers; then comes the demand for self rule within their neighborhoods under Sharia. When Muslims approach 10% of the population the demands turn to lawlessness.  In Paris, we are already seeing car-burnings. Any criticism of Islam results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam. In France which may be over the 10% range, the minority Muslim populations live in ghettos, within which they are 100% Muslim, and within which they live by Sharia Law. The national police do not even enter these areas (no-go zones). There are no national courts, nor schools, nor non-Muslim religious facilities. In such situations, Muslims do not integrate into the community at large. The children attend madrassas. They learn only the Koran. To even associate with an infidel is a crime punishable with death.</p>

<p>Stage 4. Regional Control 20-50% pop density (Kosovo, Macedonia, Cyprus)</p>

<p>After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues.</p>

<p>Stage 5. Islamisation &gt;50% pop density (Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco)</p>

<p>Unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and jizya, the tax placed on infidels. As Muslim population levels increase to a majority there will peace at last. Dar al-Islam is achieved and everyone lives under Sharia and the Koran is the only word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know much about the religious tensions in some countries you mentionned, but I have been living in France for a good part of my life.</p>

<p>French was still colononial power 60 years ago, with major colonies in islamic countries (Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria), so most of the economic migrants come from those countries (maybe less now but it has been the case in the past).</p>

<p>The thing is french ghettos (or &quot;cités&quot; as we like to call them, since they are often huge building complexes &quot;closed&quot; from the rest of the city) are first the home of the people with the lowest income, most likely to be muslim immigrants. All the crimes your refering to (burning cars are a classic during riot, but drug dealing is the main cause of violences in those places) are commited by the least religious people. Ghetto mentality (feeling rejected) leads to communautarism that seems to be centered around religion, but those are just searching for an identity since they feel &quot;rejected&quot; by the country. So yes, if we don&#39;t do anything about it they may turn to islam, but islam is not the reason of their actions. Even more important, saying that islam is the reason of their actions will push them even more to islam.</p>

<p>For an exemple, most of the people who went to Syria for the Jihad were converted muslims of french origins, or cultural muslims that were not pratiquant at all (drugs, alchohol, anything you want) but lived in those cités. Those people were the perfect target for ISIS to recruit, not because of their islamic background, but because of their lack of identity. Islam is just a sticker they put on their forehead to feel like they belong to something.</p>

<p>Of course some muslims are pushing this communautarism for religious reasons that reflect what you are saying, but they reprensent a really really tiny part of the muslim population.</p>

<p>France made a lot of mistake regarding the integration of those populations, &quot;maybe if we give them the french nationality but put them in ghettos it will be okay&quot;.</p>

<p>For comparision I will also talk about Switzerland, where I&#39;ve also lived for some time, and it is one of the most multicultural country of Europe (well at least for the french-speaking part, the german and italian speaking parts are more homogenous and nationalist).</p>

<p>In the city I lived 45% of the population didn&#39;t have the nationality, and most of the swiss population (those who have the nationality) are actually immigrants families.
There is no real &quot;pushback&quot; from the local population so everyone feel like they belong, and it is one of the safest cities I&#39;ve been to.
There are still inequalities but people don&#39;t turn to islam or anything else to fill the lack of identity because they do not feel rejected.</p>

<p>Sorry for the mistakes, not a native speaker.</p>

<p>Really? Because the media has spent the last couple days only talking about what Trump has said not what he&#39;s doing, first with the pochahantaus thing and now with the 3 Muslim tweets. He plays the media like a fiddle, every time he needs the news not talking about certain things he pulls stunts like this time and time again.</p>

<p>Bet it&#39;s like some trash liberal was telling you &quot;all cis white men are evil&quot; (assuming you&#39;re a white male, but i&#39;m sure i could find another example if you&#39;re not)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, &quot;islamophobia&quot;. Dude, you&#39;re fucked in the head; these people throw gay guys off roofs and then pelt them with rocks to death, their women are worse than 2nd class citizens, they have sex with little boys and nobody thinks anything of it. But showing videos of it is somehow islamophobic? Why, because it makes them look bad? Nobody makes them act like that, it&#39;s their culture. You might be islamophobic if seeing another culture acting how they do upsets you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of what you think about DT you can agree with these two things that have me supporting him more than other presidents.  I did not vote for him but do see some light behind the blinds. </p>

<p>He has single handedly red pilled more citizens of the US then all presidents combined. Truth</p>

<p>He also avoids MSM outlets and constantly looks down on them. MSM is the biggest disinformation and propaganda sector there is.  First president to do this and utilize twitter I believe. Truth</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose it&#39;s not completely him that is redpilling perhaps he is just the catalyst. But through media bias and events such as Vegas. The public has been much more aware of the strangeness of our reality. He has also called Hillary out on Haiti and recently tweeted &quot;deep state&quot; twice. More than I can say about any recent president.</p>

<p>To add a large number of pedo busts and sexual misconduct has been outed under his presidency. I have to imagine this stuff was still happening under the Obama but I don&#39;t recall hearing a bunch of arrests for sex crimes like I do now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this is related to conspiracy or not but the guy is, although plawed, is a weapon against the elite. </p>

<p>A big issue for us as conspiracy theorists is that we look for fairness in society and the well being of all, especially against the establishment.</p>

<p>DT has now proved that the media, Wall Street, Soros, The GOP and the Democrats  are all against him and want him removed from office by any means necessary.</p>

<p>His recent &quot;retweets&quot; prove that he is the only world figure willing to stand up to the obvious globalist war against Western culture.</p>

<p>I had be hoping that he would help us all drive towards a more exposed society. He has done so tenfold. </p>

<p>He is a breath of fresh air and is exposing a hateful and dangerous ideology that seeks to enslave us.</p>

<p>Who is he and what does he want??</p>

<p>Is it pure and simple, TRUTH.</p>
