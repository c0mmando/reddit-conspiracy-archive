        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When will his base turn on him if he doesnt lock hillary up?  Can you see him in 2019, Hillary and Podesta still free, and his base still supporting him?</p>

<p>I and others have given him alot of leeway here because, one he&#39;s up to his neck in this witchhunt against him so its hard to get things done, I get that, with everyone against you, everywhere.  And those of us who believe the 4D chess idea, believe that things are in motions, that Mueller flipped, that things are happening behind the scenes.  But, I know alot of people myself included are tired of tomorrow or next week or Monday or Friday for it to happen.  We want it to happen now.  It, meaning Trump locking hillary up and admitting this whole thing, that this is all his master plan.</p>

<p>But im impatient.  His base is impatient.  We are impatient.  </p>

<p>Can you see him in October, September 2020 and he&#39;s campaigning for reelection and he&#39;s still not locked her up?</p>

<p>Would you still support him?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their actually has been some significant perges from T_D, where they banned users who got pissed at various times for shit he did.  The problem, much like Hillary supporters, they live in an echo chamber and only accept what they want.  For instance, most HRC supporters will say Trump worked through back channels with Russia the push propaganda about Hillary.  At the sametime, they refuse to acknowledge Hillary &amp; the DNC paid a former MI6 agent to work with Russian officials to create the Dossier which the vast majority hasn&#39;t been verified after a year in the possession of the FBI.  Both are the same in by book and I think both are bullshit.  Does this mean I support Trump or Hillary, fuck no.  I didn&#39;t vote for either so I have a nice situation where I can point at various things can call bullshit and others and say that&#39;s fuckes up.  I personally think the Russian-Trump story is bullshit and designed to attacked not only social media but also 3rd party news outlets.  If you have a chance, i strongly suggest you listen to the 1st 45 minutes of Jeremy Scahill&#39;s podcast that was releases yestersay, he kills it and represents 75% of my view point.  Great episode!</p>

He said something like &quot;all the inner peace in the world is meaningless if you&#39;re just going to get blown up&quot;.

We&#39;ve tried hugging it out, and we&#39;ve tried waiting for the truth to prevail, and we&#39;ve tried fighting for peace, even.

    <div class="md"><p>what the point is, politics is corrupt. it doesnt matter how much we talk about, how much we know, its a corrupt game. politicians dont even really care who knows, because no one can do anything but moan about it. the only way is to change it from the inside, which means trying to get into those positions where the corruption is, or, being the people to send them to prison. which when we think about it, is quite alot harder then just moaning about it. this isa serious global issue. what are we going to do though? well, just wait until it happens, and watch the cycle continue</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it takes time to bring down a network of criminals. The justice system is complex and there are many &quot;cooks in the kitchen&quot; any of the cooks can throw a wrench in the works and ruin a case. Lawyers can use obstructive and delaying tactics to keep it in court for years indefinitely. Judges can allow these obstructive measures, or did allow the prosecution, juries can be tampered with, law enforcement can contaminate evidence, leak evidence and obstruct any way they can. As you can see there are many ducks to line up before the administration can pull the trigger. It takes time to build a case and this is one case you cannot get impatient. It&#39;s too important. So far I see a lot of signs that HRC is very worried and working overtime to keep the administration distracted. This is just my take on it. </p>

<p>I hope she does, but I&#39;ll be satisfied if she&#39;s just made irrelevant and things with the economy keep going well, hopefully we can somehow turn around the democrat party to make them more like how they were, because dealing with liberals now makes me really hope for terrible things for them; if we could get it back to how it was when I was a democrat: strong borders, anti illegal immigration, a little bit of identity politics, but just in the form of like affirmative action, none of these worthless thugs going around demanding free shit. Yeah, that would be fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, when the world stops REEEEEEEing &quot;hate Trump now, plz?!?!?!?!&quot; That&#39;ll be a start. The truth is in the opposite of what those types of people want us to believe and feel. The funny thing is that I was well on my way to not liking him at all until all the world&#39;s perverters and censors had a collective aneurysm, insulting the man for everything, down to his preference in steak sauce, as if that were supposed to get me to hate him. It&#39;s all so blatantly obvious, so inorganic, so forced, so <em>anti-truth</em> that the part of me which rebels against those who presume to control others with trickery just could not stand for it any longer, so now, for that simple reason - that the &quot;evil&quot; of the world is practically shitting themselves begging for me to hate him -, I hope that he&#39;s what we need. How they don&#39;t see this sort of reaction coming just absolutely baffles me. There are those who place truth above all, above everything including even virtues and principles, and we are all just about sick and tired of being told that reality isn&#39;t reality. We found who the reality deniers are, and that they are so vehemently anti-Trump is enough for us to have hope. </p>
