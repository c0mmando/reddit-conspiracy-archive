<p>The interview he did with Fox news is on his page - The sheriff says Paddock used a hammer, well this guy is the only one ive heard who ACTUALLY SEEN THE WINDOWS FALL OUT AROUND HIM, he describes hearing fireworks like sounds then all of sudden the glass exploded out from mandalay bay and fell around him, then he heard what he realised was a &quot;few other gunshots&quot; followed by the 2nd window coming down around him..</p>

<p>Why is this Interview NOWHERE else and no one has mentioned this clip before? Was i really the first to come across it that realised the significance? surely not..</p>

<p>Edit: Ive tried to add him as a friend and message him with a question or two but still no response back.</p>

<p>Edit: I found this video when i was google searching for exactly what type of windows that Mandalay Bay had installed, i never found that info but found this which is much better. Keep searching random places for those clues people!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s like that 9/11 interview where it got aired once on TV, investigators realised the significance of it and tried to shut it down from ever being played again..</p>

<p>He&#39;s literally the only eyewitness so far to say he seen the windows come down, yet its the only interview people haven&#39;t seem..  Just seems a lil weird to me</p>

<p>You think a blunt edged hammer makes a hole in impact resistant glass? Or that a 5.56 round is going to blow it to pieces?   Please...</p>

<p>The guy would have had to tape tannerite to the window with the green tape from the photo and shoot the tannerite  - it&#39;s quite cute how people think he used that lil mallet..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is the same, what does the window breaking matter? Ok so it wasn’t normal glass and a machine gun shooting at it wouldn’t break it so he used some tannerite which he had a shit ton of in his car, either way he then proceeded to shoot his gun at a crowd of people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is the Sheriff has said the hammer was used to break the window..</p>

<p>Im not trying to prove anything other than that the Sheriff lied, and if he lied about that it opens up the question what else did he lie about?<br/>
It would also beg the question why lie about it? To stop a copycat knowing how to break the windows effectively? Thats plausible..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how people take a very simple and quick interview and then some how try to warp it into meaning something and try to punch it up. Ok he heard the window break, we know the windows broke. </p>

<p>&quot;I was sitting down in the lobby area outside on the sidewalk and all of sudden I heard what I thought was fireworks I looked up and one of the windows was falling down glass shattering and coming down and then a few random gun shots and then another window busted out and then just a bunch of rapid fire gunshots after that. It went on [shrugs] for about two minutes.&quot; </p>

<p>and how is that significance? Hammer on big glass, like 20+ square feet of big thick glass is going to be loud, really loud. We know the first shots were just a couple pops, it&#39;s in the all the other videos. Then we know it went to more autofire (or whatever you want to call bumpstock fire), being that too is in all the other video. Don&#39;t get me wrong, always interesting to see yet another interview etc but it&#39;s the same chain of events as everyone else. Unless one&#39;s trying to read into &quot;what I thought was fireworks&quot; to mean something more then how everyone tends to think any/every mid-level boom is fireworks. </p>

<p>Your missing the fact he says window 1 broke out after fire works  THEN gunfire and the 2nd window breaking...  so he is shooting his gun and using the hammer on the window at the same time?</p>

<p>Please explain</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>with a booming concert across the road - yeah he is really gonna hear a hammer hitting a window so loud</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concert has it&#39;s speakers pointed away from the hotel and it&#39;s also a block or more away being some low walls etc. So yes he is going to hear a mini-sledge hammer break 20+ square feet of thick plate glass 300feet away with the sound coming at him. At least that first <em>Boom</em> of it breaking.</p>

<p>and I&#39;m not missing any facts of &quot;he clearly is saying&quot; being I typed out word for word what he said in the interview minus a half dozen ums. Go read it again:....all of sudden I heard what I thought was fireworks I looked up and one of the windows was falling down glass shattering and coming down and then a few random gun shots and then another window busted out and then just a bunch of rapid fire gunshots</p>

<p>so he hears a boom of a huge plate glass getting busted, some gun fire (I&#39;m guessing out that window), then he says another window busted out (doesn&#39;t say how or say it was shot out) and then a bunch of rapid fire. All of that match ups shot for shot with all the other witness videos. I mean ok if you want to read into then fine but don&#39;t &quot;he clearly is saying&quot; me as if I just miss heard the lyrics to Manfred Mann&#39;s Blinded by the Light for the 100th time. I typed out exactly what he said in the interview.</p>

<p>This is just that strange thing people do for interviews where they try to go all Zapruder film on every syllables or phrase a person says for some reason. As if &quot;was fireworks&quot; means bunch of gun shots being he said fireworks with an S vs saying something like &quot;a firework like sound&quot; or whatever. I mean hey as I said, if you want to read into it like that then great. All I get out of this is yet another witness who shot for shot matches up with every other video we have seen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh so now your allowed to guess what he&#39;s meaning ( im guessing out that window )   But im not????  Ok</p>

<p>So your version is   - He heard the small hammer somehow breaking impact resistant glass despite the videos i have provided in this thread, then in a hurry he quickly fires a few pop shots just to make sure everyone has scattered and to make life harder for himself, then and only then does he run over to the other window in the OTHER SEPERATE room and breaks that window with a hammer - but this time the witness doesn&#39;t hear the hammer hitting the window like fireworks, apparently this time it just falls out with no sounds other than gunshots and THEN Paddock starts shooting into the crowd?</p>

<p>Really?? think about that for a moment bud...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if he hears the other window get busted out or not, it&#39;s not in his statement. The lack of that info being in his statement during the interview doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t hear it. It&#39;s just not in his statement..  </p>

<p>Guy heard a sound, saw a window falling, hear some gunfire, saw another window fall, hear some more gunfire. That&#39;s it, that&#39;s the entire interview. Time line wise if you over lay that info with the info we have from dozens of other videos it reasonably to say that the guys statement just happens to leave out the decent pause time wise between the first few random shots and then the rapid fire shot. I&#39;d also say that if he directly calls out gunfire as gunfire but makes a clear definitive statement about the first sound being what he &quot;thought was fireworks&quot;, then that first sound wasn&#39;t gun fire. Being in his statement he does ID gunfire correctly as gunfire, as backed up by the other videos of the event matching what he is saying he heard as far as the order of gunfire. So what&#39;s the fireworks like sound? Odds are it&#39;s the window getting busted out by the hammer. </p>

<p>That&#39;s working with the info you have, based on a statement. What you&#39;re doing is projecting an outcome you want or feel happened by working backwards towards that outcome while filling in gaps on your own vs only using what is said in the interview. </p>

<p>Had to hit it so many times that it sounded like fireworks</p>

<p>So hit it a bunch of times is in that statement now? No, it&#39;s not.. </p>

<p>Look this is pointless being you clearly don&#39;t understand the issue here. If a person makes a statement along the lines of &quot;My yard is mostly green grass.&quot; that&#39;s all the info you get to work with over all as far as that statement. It&#39;s projection to say &quot;mostly&quot; means he rarely waters it or they must mow it once a week. In fact &quot;My yard is mostly green grass.&quot; doesn&#39;t even definitively show if they mean front or back yard. You could at best infer they mean front if whatever issue was being talked about happened in the front yard. </p>

<p>Why post random videos of 3m widow/glass door covering that have nothing to with the MGM hotel? Are Mandalay Bay windows covered with 3M security film? Looking at the break pattern, are those higher windows even tempered glass? It sure seems like a some jagged breaks for tempered glass. What does the building code in NV require as far as a certain type of glass/covering/style in a high rise? I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s not in the witness statement. So I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re calling it &quot;evidence&quot;. </p>

<p>Clearly the windows don&#39;t have any sort of security film so I bet if you hit them hard they would break making a bunch of noise. I wish we had a statement about..... Oh wait, &quot;....I looked up and one of the windows was falling down glass shattering&quot;.. Shattering glass, in a statement about something I&#39;m directly asking about. Hum, does shattering glass make a firework like noise? Yeah kind of, at least at the first big break moment, ya know, as working with what&#39;s in the statement when the person says &quot;I heard what I thought was fireworks&quot;.</p>

<p>Oh but that&#39;s just working with the info giving from a boring witness statement. It&#39;s of course video of a different guy, from years ago, hitting/shooting a different window, in a demo of 3m glass security covering tempered glass meant to be used on doors to stop someone from bashing into a building then projecting that whatever is going on in that video from years ago has anything to with Mandalay Bay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only valid point from your statement and something that i&#39;m seriously pondering over is the fact he does say glass falling around him and your quite correct that this wouldnt be consistent with tempered glass hit with a hammer or shot out.</p>

<p>But remember my theory is that Paddock taped, tannerite to the windows with the green tape shown in crime scene photos (that apparently had no use, just sitting on a table) , i&#39;d be willing to bet remnants of that tape would of been found on the windows and the witness statement certainly corroborates Paddock standing back and fire a couple shots to hit the tannerite container.   This would explain why the glass broke in the manner it did and also why it shattered, because it wasn&#39;t hit - it was exploded.</p>

<p>Just a theory. </p>
