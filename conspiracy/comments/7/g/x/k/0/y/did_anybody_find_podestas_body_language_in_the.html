       EDIT: first off, let's give a huge thanks to that brave girl for calling him out in this stuff in public. We need more of this kind of legitimate public questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can tell a lot about someone's guilt by judging their body language when confronted on something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta didn't even actually answer her question. As soon as he heard the term "pizzagate", he just zones in on coming up with a response that will clear him of guilt to the audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       First thing I notice is that he takes several sips of his water, setting the glass down and picking it up multiple times, just generally being kind of fidgety and antsy as she's asking the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/GDa-LxhHBnQ">
        https://youtu.be/GDa-LxhHBnQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Skip about 10 seconds in
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, once he begins to answer, of course he starts out with "fake news", but what I noticed is an increased amount of blinking and he starts doing this weird hand shaking thing? Seriously, check out the clip, his hand is just levitating and shaking as he stumbles through the response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take everything you know about this investigation to throw it out the window for a second; does this look like the body language of someone who is innocent?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't convict him based on this alone, but I think his behavior in this interview should be taken into account.

       Podesta does look a little anxious though.

       You know what would calm him down? How about a nice relaxing hot tub with some adolescent children?

       Don't wanna defend Podesta, but if he was innocent wouldn't he react in the same way? Doesn't matter if he is guilty or innocent, he for sure should be pissed.

       Nope.

       If he was Innocent, he would have simply addressed the allegations and the argument that his emails are using coded language.

       Are you really thinking about it though. How many internet heros have harrassed the guy guilty or not since the allegations have come out.
I used to lose my fucking shit when clients would call me 80 times a day. It's not unreasonable to think that, if bombarded daily with the same bullshit you are bound to loose your shit at some point.

       That's not how this works. People get anxious/nervous even when they're innocent. Have you ever been pulled over, even if you weren't doing anything wrong? That shit is stressful.

       Let me put it this way, a corrupt politician like john podesta, who has tons of creepy pedophilic artwork, and who is currently heavily implicated in a child abuse scandal, does NOT get the benefit of the doubt from me of being an innocent person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, he's innocent until proven guilty, but he has done nothing for me and largely the rest of this sub id assume, for us to give him the benefit of the doubt of being innocent. Sorry.

       I don't think that he is innocent and I believe that PG is true, but claming that weird body language helps this case is kinda dumb. Cause u would act weird in both scenarios.

      <p>
       What concerns me the most, is that nobody from deepstate is going crazy. If Q thing is true, they are fucked. But NOONE is ratting out fellow criminals. Only Dumba Brazile tried to push HRC under the bus. Weird.

       Not literally the same, no. I was providing an example of a time people might get nervous when they're innocent. It was an example that's meant to be relateable, since the vast majority of us will never face this sort of questioning.

       Lol, c'mon--if an innocent person had thousands of people repeatedly accusing them of raping, killing, and eating multiple children, and those accusations had persisted for over a year, you think they would be calm.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you accuse people of literally the most heinous crimes possible, you can't take them getting upset as a sign of guilt. No one is calm about being called a kiddie-rapist.

       His temperament (which is also questionable in this video) is not what my post is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's his anxiety ridden body language that hints at guilt. He's not 100% guilty because of this, but it's another thing to take into account regarding this investigation.

       PG is also much bigger than just John podesta. James Alefantis for example.

      <p>
       If he were innocent, why did he treated to kill the entire family of a voat poster who exposed one of his shady properties?

       This is what im talking about, the behavior of these people does NOT reflect innocence.

       Podesta is guilty.
However, were he innocent he would still react this way. It's been a solid year of us saying he's raping and murdering small children. If people said that about me I would get pissed too!

       He has a lot of anger boiling under the surface. He was so defensive, when she didn’t accuse him of anything. Just asked how he was dealing with the “conspiracies”. Looked like it took all 2 ounces of his self control to not completely flip out.

       Whenever you're in a conversation with someone who does something like this, start mirroring their gesticulations. It'll totally throw them off their game.

       No, but I find the focus on his body language by pizzagaters today to be extremely telling. No facts, let's try to interpret his thoughts via a few seconds of visible frustration when he's confronted with something troubling.

       I think the biggest tell is that instead of saying its false he says its “debunked”. Anything can be debunked for a few bucks. Thats most of what the “media” does

       He gives me the creeps. He looks like a villain from a Disney movie.  I wish someone would interview Skippy, would love to see Podesta in a hoodie, sitting slouched and angry, answering questions.
