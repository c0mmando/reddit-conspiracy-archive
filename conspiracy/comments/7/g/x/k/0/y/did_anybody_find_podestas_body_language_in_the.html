        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EDIT: first off, let&#39;s give a huge thanks to that brave girl for calling him out in this stuff in public. We need more of this kind of legitimate public questioning. </p>

<p>You can tell a lot about someone&#39;s guilt by judging their body language when confronted on something.</p>

<p>Podesta didn&#39;t even actually answer her question. As soon as he heard the term &quot;pizzagate&quot;, he just zones in on coming up with a response that will clear him of guilt to the audience. </p>

<p>First thing I notice is that he takes several sips of his water, setting the glass down and picking it up multiple times, just generally being kind of fidgety and antsy as she&#39;s asking the question.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GDa-LxhHBnQ">https://youtu.be/GDa-LxhHBnQ</a></p>

<p>Skip about 10 seconds in</p>

<p>Then, once he begins to answer, of course he starts out with &quot;fake news&quot;, but what I noticed is an increased amount of blinking and he starts doing this weird hand shaking thing? Seriously, check out the clip, his hand is just levitating and shaking as he stumbles through the response. </p>

<p>Take everything you know about this investigation to throw it out the window for a second; does this look like the body language of someone who is innocent? </p>

<p>You can&#39;t convict him based on this alone, but I think his behavior in this interview should be taken into account. </p>

<p>Typical skippy. People defending him in this post, I find that rather odd. </p>

<p>Granted, he&#39;s innocent until proven guilty, but he has done nothing for me and largely the rest of this sub id assume, for us to give him the benefit of the doubt of being innocent. Sorry. </p>

<p>His temperament (which is also questionable in this video) is not what my post is about.</p>

<p>It&#39;s his anxiety ridden body language that hints at guilt. He&#39;s not 100% guilty because of this, but it&#39;s another thing to take into account regarding this investigation.</p>

<p>PG is also much bigger than just John podesta. James Alefantis for example.</p>

<p>If he were innocent, why did he treated to kill the entire family of a voat poster who exposed one of his shady properties? </p>

<p>This is what im talking about, the behavior of these people does NOT reflect innocence. </p>
