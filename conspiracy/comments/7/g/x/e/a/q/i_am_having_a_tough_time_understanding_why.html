      <p>
       I read the statement of offense. What I gather is that this is about Flynn lying that he had contact with Russians. I have yet to read anything on collusion or election interference. I don’t understand how any of this has to do with Trump getting help from Russia during the election which is what I though Mueller was there for.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I’ve read again this is about Flynn lying that he talked to Russian Diplomats AFTER Trump had won the election to discuss what the Russian Government was going to do about Obama’s executive order on sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I just don’t understand why Flynn would lie about this as what he did in talking to the Russian Diplomats was not illegal otherwise you would have seen that as an illegality mentioned in the statements Mueller issued today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Correct me if I am wrong on any of this.

       The charge Flynn pled guilty was so light because he has taken a deal to testify against the Trump administration. There are reports that he will testify he was ordered to set up the contacts by Trump himself. This is the big deal.

       Well it’s weird that they said that maybe you misread/heard but if you read the statements Mueller put into the court system they do not say this. You have to go by the documents not what a reporter said. If you read an article saying this could you post it please?

       We don't know exactly, because the information he has given so far has not been made public, and he will be called upon to testify further.  He had been in contact with the Russians, this much is fairly certain.  When, how often, and how much trump knew and/or directed this remains to be seen.

       This is yuge, despite those who support this administration will say to downplay it.

       Yes after the election. At least those are the charges pled guilty to today.

       Depending on the contents of the contacts they might violate the Logan Act.

       Contacts itself would have been illegal afaik. Lying about them to the FBI is.
      </p>
      <p>
       But depending on the contents of the call they might be in violation of the Logan Act.

       And you have to keep in mind, this is only the information that was publicly released. The Mueller team has shown multiple times they keep information confidential and use it at the right times.

       Actually you do need the rest. Saying "Contact itself isn't illegal" is like saying "If Donald said Hi to Putin in line at the movie theater isn't illegal." It's the nature of the contact that matters.

       Please, the Logan Act is rarely ever applied. The activity undertaken by Flynn was standard operating procedure. Unlike Obama imposing last minute sanctions on Russia for "interfering" with the election by using Facebook posts (lol).

       It wouldn't be much of a plea deal if he was agreeing to testify about something that wasn't illegal. So whatever he is testifying about must be worth an awful lot to the investigation.

       Yes I am aware but the phone call itself wasn’t illegal one was about U.N. sanctions on Israelis settlements and multiple countries were contacted Russia was just one. The other Flynn was contacted by the Russian Government on how to move forward about the sanctions this was AFTER the election. If you remember the hot mic moment with Obama talking to the Russian diplomat in 2011 during those elections he said he wauld have more ability to help them after the elections. So this was the Russian Government contacting a new admin in the US on how to move forward with what a precious admin had done. I’m going to assume they would’ve contacted Clinton’s team if she would’ve won.

       Contacts itself wouldn't have been illegal afaik. Lying about them to the FBI is.
      </p>
      <p>
       But depending on the contents of the call they might be in violation of the Logan Act.  And you have to keep in mind, this is only the information that was publicly released. The Mueller team has shown multiple times they keep information confidential and use it at the right times.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have no idea what else Flynn has given Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hot mic incident isn't an issue because Obama still was sitting president at the time. Trump and Flynn were not part of the US government yet when that calls took place even if the election was already concluded.

       The Logan act is not going to be used against anyone in a president elect transition team. That makes absolutely no sense. A president elect admin cannot talk to foreign governments as they transition into power? And I’m not saying him lying isn’t illegal I just don’t know why he lied to begin with.

       That's the big question. In my opinion he lied because this wasn't the first time he was in contact with Russia and was afraid of revealing thread on which more could have been unraveled.

       But this is my personal speculation.

       Why is this a big deal? Trump had already won the election. Mueller's team is investigation COLLUSION DURING THE ELECTION. Flynn isn't going to testify "against" Trump.

       You just talk in circles. Flynn would've been charged with more serious crimes if Trump was involved in some conspiracy. Also, Trump was never interviewed by the FBI (or anyone), so the "lying is a serious crime" is out the window. Kushner is the super senior member of the Transition Team in Flynn's agreement, and none of this points to collusion. He got caught (on audiotape) lying to the FBI. What he's "giving them" is going to shock you and most of America (and doesn't include pedophiles), but don't take my word for it!

       Flynn was only charged with a small crime to get him to turn on Trump as part of a deal imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lying to the FBI might just be the convinient charge to use because it doesn't reveal any cards Mueller is holding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until now Trump has not been implicated in criminal activity directly but that wasn't my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       This might be the starting point to seeing actual evidence of wrongdoings Trump. This is why many people see it as a big deal.
