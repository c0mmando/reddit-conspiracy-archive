<p>I read the statement of offense. What I gather is that this is about Flynn lying that he had contact with Russians. I have yet to read anything on collusion or election interference. I don’t understand how any of this has to do with Trump getting help from Russia during the election which is what I though Mueller was there for. </p>

<p>From what I’ve read again this is about Flynn lying that he talked to Russian Diplomats AFTER Trump had won the election to discuss what the Russian Government was going to do about Obama’s executive order on sanctions. </p>

<p>Also I just don’t understand why Flynn would lie about this as what he did in talking to the Russian Diplomats was not illegal otherwise you would have seen that as an illegality mentioned in the statements Mueller issued today.</p>

<p>Correct me if I am wrong on any of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am aware but the phone call itself wasn’t illegal one was about U.N. sanctions on Israelis settlements and multiple countries were contacted Russia was just one. The other Flynn was contacted by the Russian Government on how to move forward about the sanctions this was AFTER the election. If you remember the hot mic moment with Obama talking to the Russian diplomat in 2011 during those elections he said he wauld have more ability to help them after the elections. So this was the Russian Government contacting a new admin in the US on how to move forward with what a precious admin had done. I’m going to assume they would’ve contacted Clinton’s team if she would’ve won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just talk in circles. Flynn would&#39;ve been charged with more serious crimes if Trump was involved in some conspiracy. Also, Trump was never interviewed by the FBI (or anyone), so the &quot;lying is a serious crime&quot; is out the window. Kushner is the super senior member of the Transition Team in Flynn&#39;s agreement, and none of this points to collusion. He got caught (on audiotape) lying to the FBI. What he&#39;s &quot;giving them&quot; is going to shock you and most of America (and doesn&#39;t include pedophiles), but don&#39;t take my word for it!</p>
