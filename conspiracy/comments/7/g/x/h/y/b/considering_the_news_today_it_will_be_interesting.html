       The next obvious questions won't be asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions like - Who reached out to the Trump administration regarding the UN vote on settlements in Israel. Who did they initially talk to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are Israeli government officials contacting an administration that hasn't taken office yet and asking them to act on their behalf?
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't deflection...this is asking very pertinent questions. But these questions won't be asked, will they?
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow, someway, Israel will avoid any type of scrutiny for interfering in the governance of the US. Like always.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the mainstream media are going to call out Israel?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think Alex Jones or Roger Stone are going to have jackshit to say about Israel?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think any members of Congress are going to say "it's very disturbing to see Israel pressuring an incoming administration to take actions like this before the Inauguration"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I sure as hell don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do expect to happen is that somehow, not only will Israel be painted as completely innocent, they will get what they want...like always.

       All the Russia bullshit is hype, propaganda intended to distract attention from the Zionist cabal that controls the US government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dig into the so-called 'Russian' conspiracies. How many of these 'Russian' contacts are in fact Jewish?
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionists do not exist only in Israel and the US. Some of the wealthiest and most powerful players in Russia are Zionist Jews.

       Yea putin said earlier this year that israel was an important ally to them. Guarantee you if far leftists ever take control of the country and stand up  to israel they'll go straight to russia. Who knows maybe we'll cozy up to a secular iran by then.

       I'm not sure how to read the Putin - Israel connection. It is ambiguous, and I think Putin likes it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not allies, methinks, Putin totally tucked up the Zionist scheme WRT Syria, and that pissed Israel off in a major way. Also, he screwed screwed over several Jewish Russian mobster oligarchs (Mikhail Khodorkovsky and others) which made Zionists livid.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, Putin recognizes the power the Zionists wield through their control of the world financial systems and their stranglehold on the US and other western governments, so he treads lightly, and has maintained a fairly amicable relationship with Israeli and Zionist potentates inside Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a bit of a wild card, but I doubt that he is a Zionist stooge.

       Wow.  So you are one of those "special" people that need things explained to you very slowly, with small words..................  let me see if that is possible so you might be able to understand. (I hope that wasn't too big of a word for you.)

      <p>
       If a place that is not the USA does a thing that is good for them it is ok as long as it does not hurt the USA.  But when a person that works for the USA LIES ABOUT IT, that is a problem.
