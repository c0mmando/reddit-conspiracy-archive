       I've been called a shill so many times for just believing that Trump knew about getting help from the Russians. For thinking that Seth Rich was pushed as a cover and there was organized coordination to spam this sub with it and other anti-democrat propaganda. For thinking that Wikileaks is being fed with Russian money. For doubting speculation of pedophilia when there's no victims or an official code word list that is not from 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've lost so many good people in these arguments who merely got angry when they saw the blatant lying. When they get attacked for their political beliefs, when someone looks through your comment history to discredit what you say, when they take one look at your name and use it as an argument instead of the subject at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       We won't forget how they treated us. All we did was believe in a conspiracy and wait. Will anything come of it in the end? Who knows? But it certainly looks like the president has Russian connections from being a rich guy in the late 80's and 90's and they have the ability to steal emails and fabricate conspiracies against those who they don't like. I honestly find it offensive people think Russians are so weak they couldn't pull something like this off or have the resources to coordinate surgical internet political strikes.

       On 06.23.2014, Clinton was subpoenaed by Congress to hand over her emails within 30 days. On 06.24.2014, she had them deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care your party affiliation. If you or I did were subpoenaed by congress to hand over information, and then deleted/destroyed/tampered with that information, we would be locked up in a heart beat.

       Yes, I do, actually. To be wrong helps us grow as individuals, so we can strive to be better. However, in this case, Clinton is the epitome of corruption in DC

       Clinton is just where you have focused, so you don't see all the other shit going on. The Clintons were no saints, but all the garbage you guys share is literally insane. Bush was a legit war criminal and mass murderer, that would be a better example of someone getting a pass.  You do exactly what Trump does when he can't answer the question, BUT BUT What about Killary??

       It is obvious that you are brainwashed by some "alternative" mainstream garbage. You people are like zombies dude. We are talking about Trump and Russia, and you bring up Clinton and then Assange in order to avoid actual thinking about what you are talking about. It is really sad actually

       According to these reports, he was told to do it before he was elected. If you can’t draw the conclusion that trump literally asked Russia for those podesta emails and then boom, they were there, maybe you’re in the wrong sub.

       No where in the reports does it say Flynn was told to do it before the election. The phone call was about the Israeli settlement sanctions in the U.N. he was also told to contact other nations about this. When it comes to he Russian sanctions Flynn was contacted by the Russian diplomat first this was after Trump was elected so the Russians were contacting a new Governmental body on how they should press forward if Clinton would’ve won Russia would’ve contacted her team about this.

       Lying to the FBI? That's all they have?
      </p>
      <p>
       What charges were dropped as part of this deal?
       <em>
        Were
       </em>
       there any other charges?

       Here is apparently what he did:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The lies that Flynn told FBI agents:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          Flynn claimed he did not ask Kislyak to attempt to "refrain from escalating the situation" after sanctions were imposed against Russia by the Obama administration during a December 29, 2016 conversation.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Flynn "did not recall" that Kisylak told him that Russia planned a moderate response to the sanctions thanks to that conversation.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Flynn claimed that he did not ask Kislyak to delay or defeat a pending vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution during a conversation on December 22, 2016.
         </p>

       Wow. Trying to convince the Russians not to go overboard with their response to essentially bullshit sanctions placed on Russia by the US. What an evil man!

       Well, Trump has a massive PR campaign in the conspiracy realm. The social engineers need to prop his image up on these subs so that people think he's anti establishment.

       Unfortunately the idiots on 4chan still think he's a good guy and are obsessed with this "Q" guy and trumps relationship with him. All this goofy secret codes language and supposed 4D chess...it's all shit the social engineers are doing to try and gain our trust. FUCK that.

       There's a few multi-year ones, but you'll more often than not only have &lt; 12 month accounts defending prez.

       Not saying there aren't also new account bots on the left, but I always check the account age to 'add it to the calculation' of how serious to take a particular user.

       Watch what? We have been predicting exactly what is happening since last year. Trumps administration and team are transparently corrupt. Not in the way that Clinton is corrupt (the make believe fairy tale devil kind), but in a real verifiable way that has been reported by journalists and experts across the world for many years.

       I think it would be easy to pay off Stein. They especially needed her to take votes away from "democrats" since they will actually vote another party. They just have to gang up against the republican neo-con machine.

The writing is on the wall, in sealed indictments, coming out of the fbi. You call for the fbi to investigate Clinton, but then you call the fbi corrupt for investigating Trump. lolol the cognitive dissonance kills me

       It sounds as if you are making some serious errors because you still identify with political parties and/or ideologies. Errors like lumping Trump supporters into a collective "other" because "they" disagreed with you and "we won't forget."
      </p>
      <p>
       Who won't forget? People that care about truth regardless of what letter is next to your name? Because that's the only political party that anyone should ever support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carroll Quigley admitted political parties are a strategy of tension:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can ‘throw the rascals out’ at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy”

       Is that the only response you have to that? Trump being corrupt in no way implies that the Democratic establishment is not corrupt. They're both beholden to corporate interests and major donors, both voted for disastrous wars and for curtailing our civil rights, and both will happily get rich selling our country and our future prosperity to the highest bidder.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a "both sides are the same," or "Democrats are just as bad" argument. It's an argument that both sides perpetuate the same corrupt system. They play complementary roles in a drama that takes the attention away from the real, unelected power.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you play this game of believing the enemy of your enemy is your friend, you're happy with the scraps they kick down to you from the table. When you pit yourself against your fellow citizen, you help ensure that concentrated power will remain so.

       Honestly, because I find liberals/progressives generally more open to dialogue, and this site as a whole leans Democratic so it's a bit pointless for me to pile on. But maybe more importantly, right now, Trump is being criticized for his alleged bigotry, personal enrichment, and ties to Russia. All likely true to an extent, but by focusing on these as their political discourse, the left is losing sight of those traditional leftist values with which I do agree: workers' rights and solidarity, opposition to war and foreign interventionism, and civil liberties at home.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the left strongly supports these values, the country fares better. When Obama won in 08, he continued much of Bush's disastrous foreign policy, albeit more subtly, and yet much of the anti-war left was silent for fear of criticizing him and weakening his presidency. If Trump is ousted during this term or in the next election, I'm more worried about a relieved left not pushing hard enough for these values.

      <p>
       Trump won because people voted against Clinton or didn't vote. The Democrats failed to present a coherent vision of the future for all Americans, and instead played into a divisive game of identity politics that alienated or discouraged many voters, and even if it had won, would have served corporate interests more than workers.
      </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And there are fundamental similarities. I do not trust Democrats to spend taxes wisely and they inevitably concentrate ever more power in the federal government, power which is ultimately wielded by the corporate backers who put them there. The 1950's were prosperous in large part because the European manufacturing base had been decimated and Asia had yet to industrialize. America was the only real industrial power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also argue that just as if not more important than high marginal tax rates was strong organized labor movements. Workers leveraged their power collectively and demanded good wages and working conditions rather begging politicians for handouts. Democrats do not fight for increased organized labor, and their voters don't understand its necessity.

       Paid to lose democrats who'll give you such boons as the right to be enslaved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and lied too aswell, the NDAA and shit. Hey look, something the limousine democrats fought for and passed. Couldn't give a shit about poor families being saddled with a bunch of administrative lackeys clawing at your day-to-day living expenses like food, shelter and heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cherry ontop though is the amount of lost limbs and minds AND civilians that occured through obamas Proxy wars. Traitorous, treasonous and everyday that goes by without the hyperbolic vitriol of republicans is another day I realize they really are just one party. The traitors need to HANG.

       Lying to the FBI? That's all they have?

       What charges were dropped as part of this deal?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The lies that Flynn told FBI agents:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          Flynn claimed he did not ask Kislyak to attempt to "refrain from escalating the situation" after sanctions were imposed against Russia by the Obama administration during a December 29, 2016 conversation.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Flynn "did not recall" that Kisylak told him that Russia planned a moderate response to the sanctions thanks to that conversation.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Flynn claimed that he did not ask Kislyak to delay or defeat a pending vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution during a conversation on December 22, 2016.

       I am a real user and I love conspiracy theories, and you are either some kind of dunning kruger poster child or a legit shill. The writing is on the wall, in sealed indictments, coming out of the fbi. You call for the fbi to investigate Clinton, but then you call the fbi corrupt for investigating Trump. lolol the cognitive dissonance kills me
