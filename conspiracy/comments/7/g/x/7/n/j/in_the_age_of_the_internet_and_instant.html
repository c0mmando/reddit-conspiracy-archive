    <div class="md"><p>&quot;would you rather vote for someone that appeals to your values and beliefs to do it for you?&quot;</p>

<p>39 years and counting, I&#39;ve never met such a creature.</p>

<p>He isn&#39;t wrong, representativism was meant to fill a void we now can fill better. I find it almost laughable, people will talk and bitch about politics with all their free time, hours a day, but given a chance to make it better through their own actions, will shrink away. Direct democracy is how we get away from most of the deep corruption. And it could be a bit less demanding, for example, only voting on so many bills in a year, not necessarily everything. </p>

<p>Regardless of the costs involved, I don&#39;t know why anyone would forgo a direct voice for an elected representative who takes bribes and votes how he or she wants or the &quot;party&quot; wants regardless of what their constituents want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your sentiment. Unfortunately, after the civil war, the national government for better or worse has been centralizing its authority and restricting the rights of local autonomy. Sometimes this is good, sometimes not so much. But as far as national civil rights (ending slavery, women voting, anti-discrimination standardization) there are some good sides. Its not all win-win or lose-lose. But for many issues, greater autonomy would improve well being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with it in theory but think about it in action. So you and a fireman vote on a law regarding fire code laws. His vote has more weight than yours. What if hypothetically there&#39;s a proposal to lower the number of people allowed in concert venues at once, and you feel strongly about that as common sense tells you it&#39;s safer. It will probably cost your local businesses some business and some people will lose money. But it&#39;s proven to be safer so you vote yes. If the fireman voted no, why the hell would his vote matter more? See what I&#39;m saying? You can feel strongly about things and as long as you can back up why, your vote should matter just as much as anyone elses. Also, like I said, you don&#39;t want to give someone the power to determine how that ranking system would work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy">Delegative democracy</a> is a really interesting alternative. It&#39;s a form of direct democracy with one addition: instead of voting directly on any given issue, you can select someone you trust and allow them to vote for you.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example: you just moved to a new state, where one of your best friends happens to live. You and he have very similar values and opinions, and share a very similar perspective on things politically. The county council elections come up, but you haven&#39;t had time to read up on each candidate... rather than voting, you can opt to vote however your trusted friend will vote. And if the candidate your friend supports flips you off in traffic you can choose to vote directly and choose a different candidate, or a different person to delegate your vote to. You could opt to vote with a party, and change your vote on any issue where you disagree with your party.</p>

Sure there&#39;d be a lot of wrinkles to work out, so what?  At least we&#39;d have a direct say and eliminate a lot of corruption.  And it would be a lot of work and time on our part, mostly educating ouselves on the issues... again, tough shit, it would be our responsibility.  Also make voting mandatory, you want to receive any kind of benefits, services, etc, you vote.  Personally I would love a system like that and would look forward to every vote and be about 1000X more engaged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still need checks on pure mob rule by the majority or you risk 51% of the population voting themselves benefits at the expense of 49%.</p>

<p>Representative government with divided powers helps solve some of the problems. It also helps limit the damage from a demagogue who can convince low information voters to put him in power, because there just isn&#39;t that much he can do without getting support from other (hopefully more competent) representatives.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s how it was supposed to work before international bankers took over both parties to ensure that you can never &quot;vote the bums out.&quot;</p>
