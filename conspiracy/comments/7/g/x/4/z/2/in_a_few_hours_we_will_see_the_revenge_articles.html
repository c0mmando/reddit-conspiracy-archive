There will not be nuanced consideration of what this all night <em>really</em> mean, just hyperventilized shreiking about Fake News, witch hunts, &quot;not part of the campaign,&quot; &quot;he pled guilty to lying so why would we believe him now,&quot; &quot;he&#39;s a Democrat,&quot; &quot;QAnon says this and this,&quot; etc etc etc. Maybe some Seth Rich non-updates to boot.</p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t believe this means Trump is &quot;done for&quot; or that the whole investigation is suddenly an open and shut case. But we all already knew that Flynn probably lied to the FBI in December, and this seems just about the lightest charge they could lob at him-- which likely means he has flipped in some way, and more things are set to come. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure if Trump actually sees Obama as his sworn enemy. Seems the only times Trump mentions him is when he&#39;s projecting and deflecting. </p>

<p>I think we&#39;re giving Trump too much credit. Very likely his thought process is much less complicated:</p>

<p><em>&quot;I said bad things about that guy and now people like me. I will say more bad things about that guy and more people will like me.&quot;</em></p>

<p>And we still haven&#39;t gotten to Sally Yates coming later on with even more evidence that Flynn was bad news and Trump firing her for it.</p>

<p>and this seems just about the lightest charge they could lob at him-- which likely means he has flipped in some way, and more things are set to come.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this logically follows. It could be that they flipped him and let him off only charging him with what&#39;s already been public knowledge for the better part of a year, but it could <em>also</em> be that there wasn&#39;t sufficient evidence to nail him on anything worse. How do you justify jumping to the former conclusion without further evidence? </p>

<p>This news honestly just doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal to me at all. Flynn got charged with and is pleading guilty to the thing we <em>already knew he was guilty of</em>. Seems like wheels are turning, but it&#39;s hardly the revelation many are portraying it as. Not yet, anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is certainly possible. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the tip of the iceberg because the paid and undisclosed Turkish agent stuff seemed like it would garner much harsher charges than this one, which doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Turkey...plus his son&#39;s involvement in things.</p>

<p>The theory was that he&#39;d flip to avoid harsher penalties and shield his son from trouble, plead down to this lesser type of charge. Which I&#39;m guessing would only be possible if he gave Mueller something he didn&#39;t already have that would implicate someone else, probably higher up.</p>

<p>I obviously don&#39;t know for sure, of course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s gonna have to happen for the &quot;he&#39;s a democrat&quot; argument to be used against Trump? It&#39;s hilarious how today the WH made a statement referring to Flynn as a former Obama administrator when he&#39;s been referred to in relation to his role in the current administration up until today. Trump has been asking the Republicans and even James Comey to end their investigation into him, but when SHTF today it was like a desperate attempt to distance themselves as far away as they can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is making this bigger than it really is.</p>

<p>He is charged with lying, and he resigned because of lying to pence.</p>

<p>Whatever information comes from him now can&#39;t be trusted.</p>

<p>For the record I&#39;m a libertarian and support neither hillary or trump, but this fact is way overlooked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>get ready for the crazy responses...............  He worked for OBAMA.  OH MY GOD.  (but Obama FIRED HIM!!!)  He was only in the Administration for 23 days........... (because you had to FIRE HIM)  </p>

<p>I never made any sense that the President would go to such lengths to protect someone like Flynn.  I think we are all about to learn why Trump fired the FBI Director, wanted this whole thing dropped etc.  No President goes to the effort that he did for an aide.  Remember Scooter Libby?  He wasn&#39;t even pardoned and took the bullet for Cheney!!  They cut him loose and he paid the price.  Flynn is going to take this whole group down.............  watch.  And when the dust settles, people will finally come to their senses and the crazy far right will be sent back under the rock it came from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A functioning media is supposed to present both sides and perhaps provide a bit of non partisan context behind otherwise convoluted political stories. It’s no secret that it fails dismally. It gets difficult for people to have in-depth discussions when they are relegated to alternative news platforms because a siege mentality develops. Astro turfing makes it worse because people don’t even know if they are having a genuine debate.  </p>
