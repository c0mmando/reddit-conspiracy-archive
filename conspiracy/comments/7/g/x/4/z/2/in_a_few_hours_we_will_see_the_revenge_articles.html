       Mark my words. We've seen this cycle every damn time...it will be Infowars, Gateway Pundit, Zerohedge. There will not be nuanced consideration of what this all night
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       mean, just hyperventilized shreiking about Fake News, witch hunts, "not part of the campaign," "he pled guilty to lying so why would we believe him now," "he's a Democrat," "QAnon says this and this," etc etc etc. Maybe some Seth Rich non-updates to boot.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I don't believe this means Trump is "done for" or that the whole investigation is suddenly an open and shut case. But we all already knew that Flynn probably lied to the FBI in December, and this seems just about the lightest charge they could lob at him-- which likely means he has flipped in some way, and more things are set to come.

       The plan is to make it sound completely legal, since the conversation with the Russians took place AFTER the election. (It is not)

       This is my favorite narrative, and says a lot about the level of understanding the poster has of the American justice system.  Apparently the concept of hitting a turned witness with a softball charge in exchange for turning on their boss is something so American that people in other parts of the world aren't at all familiar with the concept.

       That's not how it works. He plead guilty to lying to the FBI, the charge carries a max 5 yr sentence, they're recommending 0-6 months in exchange for his cooperation; if they could charge him with a more serious crime they would, and then recommend a low sentence.

       So please explain it to me why it’s illegal? I don’t understand? If it did happen after the election... and it was about a cooperative attack on ISIS, which was one of Trumps campaign promises... not only that but Russia is the closed superpower to the situation down there... ISIS pretty much has been taken out since this time last year... I really don’t get this Russian hysteria.

       It's not illegal. You'll notice that it's been framed as 'people will claim it's not illegal' without saying what they claim actually

       Its not illegal, thats his point.  People are going to avoid the real issue we're seeing and just point to "it was legal so what, ignore it."

       Exactly, I personally think Clinton absolutely broke the law and it's pretty damn obvious they deleted the emails knowing full well they were destroying evidence. It drives me nuts when somebody yells what about her emails because I think that whole thing was criminal too. That doesn't mean someone else should get a free pass and it sure as hell doesn't mean they didn't do anything wrong themselves :p

       But you kinda have to admit that its a very weird thing to do by Barry to give (whats turned out to be) good advice to Trump, if theyre in some battle against each other, no? And a total failing on Trump to not look into it himself?

       Honestly? I don't think Obama sees Trump as his sworn enemy, even if Trump does. He was the departing president advising the new president. There's a kind of cordialness that needs to happen in regards to the presidential race, where it's like "well, we said a lot of shit about each other bit you won and you're going to run the country now so here's some advice." Trump would have been well served to consider advice from Obama, since he's one of the few living people who has experience doing the job that he just signed on to do.

       I'm not even sure if Trump actually sees Obama as his sworn enemy. Seems the only times Trump mentions him is when he's projecting and deflecting.

      <p>
       I think we're giving Trump too much credit. Very likely his thought process is much less complicated:

       But Patriots fans would say they don't give two shits about the Bills and probably never waste a second thinking about them one way or the other.

       Donald Trump thinks Barack Obama is his sworn nemesis. Barack Obama likely doesn't give two shits about Donald Trump.

       Because Obama has always shown that he wants the best for this country and would be able to put politics aside to see to that. That it was a private meeting anyway, in a setting outside of the political spotlight. And I'm sure he had evidence with him to support his advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we still haven't gotten to Sally Yates coming later on with even more evidence that Flynn was bad news and Trump firing her for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to put Flynn on Obama is the worst spin job since dude from Breitbart saying the Virgin Mary being young when she gave birth to Jesus to excuse Roy Moore's behavior. It's not quite that fucking stupid but it's up there. A notch below. That they even tried that, like officially, just shows how fucked they are.

       From all i can gather Flynn lied, and was asked to negotiate with russia after trump had become president elect. This is against customs but not illegal.

       The big questions are did Trump direct him to do this, direct him to lie about it later, and then at the very least attempted to obstruct justice re: the Flynn investigation explicitly (with Comey).
      </p>
      <p>
       Coverup worse than the "crime" seems to apply here...maybe even the coverup being the crime itself. The biggest question is why lie, why did all these guys lie during and after the campaign. Shit just doesn't add up.

       Like it's some kind of sitcom where the main character is bummed out because his girlfriend has been distant and out with his best friend and he thinks she's cheating on him and he goes home sad and depressed only to open the door and then bam! It's his girlfriend and all his friends and family and she was just planning a surprise party for him the whole time! He was never in any trouble! And cue the happy theme song and the freeze frame laughing at the party as everyone goes home happy.

       This news honestly just doesn't seem like a big deal to me at all. Flynn got charged with and is pleading guilty to the thing we
       <em>
        already knew he was guilty of
       </em>
       . Seems like wheels are turning, but it's hardly the revelation many are portraying it as. Not yet, anyway.

       That is certainly possible. I'm assuming it's the tip of the iceberg because the paid and undisclosed Turkish agent stuff seemed like it would garner much harsher charges than this one, which doesn't have anything to do with Turkey...plus his son's involvement in things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory was that he'd flip to avoid harsher penalties and shield his son from trouble, plead down to this lesser type of charge. Which I'm guessing would only be possible if he gave Mueller something he didn't already have that would implicate someone else, probably higher up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I obviously don't know for sure, of course.

       I've just gotten sick of the same overly aggressive barrage of deflection posts that dominate the sub every time there's news that potentially makes Trump and his cohort (the current US government) look bad and/or corrupt. It's the same routine every time, so I decided to call it out. And now it's happening regardless.

       What's gonna have to happen for the "he's a democrat" argument to be used against Trump? It's hilarious how today the WH made a statement referring to Flynn as a former Obama administrator when he's been referred to in relation to his role in the current administration up until today. Trump has been asking the Republicans and even James Comey to end their investigation into him, but when SHTF today it was like a desperate attempt to distance themselves as far away as they can.

       get ready for the crazy responses...............  He worked for OBAMA.  OH MY GOD.  (but Obama FIRED HIM!!!)  He was only in the Administration for 23 days........... (because you had to FIRE HIM)
      </p>

       I never made any sense that the President would go to such lengths to protect someone like Flynn.  I think we are all about to learn why Trump fired the FBI Director, wanted this whole thing dropped etc.  No President goes to the effort that he did for an aide.  Remember Scooter Libby?  He wasn't even pardoned and took the bullet for Cheney!!  They cut him loose and he paid the price.  Flynn is going to take this whole group down.............  watch.  And when the dust settles, people will finally come to their senses and the crazy far right will be sent back under the rock it came from.

       A functioning media is supposed to present both sides and perhaps provide a bit of non partisan context behind otherwise convoluted political stories. It’s no secret that it fails dismally. It gets difficult for people to have in-depth discussions when they are relegated to alternative news platforms because a siege mentality develops. Astro turfing makes it worse because people don’t even know if they are having a genuine debate.
