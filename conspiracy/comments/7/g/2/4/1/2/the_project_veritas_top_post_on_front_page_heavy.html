<p>I get that, and can even get behind it (in theory).  But call it what it is.  And don&#39;t blame people for calling bullshit on it when he gets busted for it.

<p>As far as the Moore stuff goes, I agree with you.  Idk why the press is rallying behind this so hard on both sides.  Everyone is doubling down.  It&#39;s a weird case of him being guilty, but also of his situation being abused by scam artists (the yearbook lady, okeefe, etc)</p>

<p>But this Moore business is showing me that apparently we <strong>can&#39;t</strong> all rally around doing the right thing and that politics trumps pedos.  Because as my conservative grandfather said at Thanksgiving dinner:  &quot;Moore may be a sicko, but we need his vote on the tax bill.&quot;  So I don&#39;t know <em>where</em> the hell we go from here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All genuine concerns.  I think pg is real personally.  I was following the zerohour1 leaks on it all and if it&#39;s fake, the process through which it developed seemed extremely organic.  It didn&#39;t just&quot;pop up&quot; with a flood of posts on reddit one day. I was there in real time watching it happen.  </p>

<p>Now, after some right wing pr saw how popular Facebook damaging  it was, they no doubt spammed it to hell with redundant, poorly written articles which I&#39;m sure would give the appearance of it being fake.  </p>

<p>I can promise you though, that no matter the truth of the accusations against Alefantis, podesta, etc; the source of these allegations was organic and there is reason to make these accusations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right, I honestly don&#39;t know.  I wasn&#39;t in on the beginning of PG - I jumped in about a month after it gained traction.  By that time there was so much shit muddying the waters, <em>flooding</em> the muddy waters, it was hard to take <strong>any</strong> of it seriously.  I&#39;m not down with demonizing, doxxing and accusing grandmas of sex trafficking or reading into low-brow humor pics of kids.  Sadly, that&#39;s the direction people went with pizzagate so it easily resembled a wild smear campaign.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a real risk we run in this sub - getting ahold of real and pertinent information and then letting the crazies take over with their pitchforks and tiki torches and blowing it all to hell.  Maybe they are disinfo agents, maybe they are tinfoil hatters - hell if I know.  But when rational people question information - while having a legitimate interest in the subject matter - they are painted as shills and deniers, making the entire subject a black/white binary issue.  And the <em>entire subject</em> becomes a joke.  Just like pizzagate.</p>

<p>Sorry, that was a soapbox tangent, but one I certainly needed to get off my conspiracy chest.</p>

<p>The disinfo and censorship that we experienced off the bat was so overwhelming though, I couldn&#39;t believe it at the time.  I was genuinely super angry and depressed about how it was being swept under the rug.  That to me is the biggest peace of evidence-the coverup.

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s see:</p>

<ul>
<li>The &#39;Russian Propaganda&#39; issue appears to be more than a little of a &#39;storm in a teacup&#39;. WP reported on some third-party research, and later when some of the subjects of said research disputed the findings, added a disclaimer to that effect. Short of replicating and validating all research for themselves (not possible on a newspaper&#39;s budget), this would appear to be the proper way to go.</li>
<li>Sean Spicer in the bushes: this would appear just to be a minor bit of sloppy hyperbole.</li>
<li>The &#39;Utility hack&#39; seems to be the most serious. However the issue was not so much getting things wrong about a breaking story (which happens quite frequently), as failing to adequately document their corrections. Not great, but not appalling either.</li>
<li>Thegatewaypundit and WND are appallingly bad sources, notorious for repeating any old half-baked or discredited claim.  Neither they, <em>nor anybody who cites them</em>, should be taken seriously.  HuffPo, WT &amp; DailyWire are only slightly better. I had not previously heard of ZeroHedge, but what little I have now read about them suggests that they&#39;re no more credible than the first two. TM&#39;s quality is all-over-the-place, and given that <em>this</em> TM author is spewing Seth Rich stupidity, it would appear to be from the very bottom of their barrel.</li>
<li>And <em>why the fuck should I care</em> about a 60 year old involvement with the CIA? A lot of organisations that should have known better were roped into some seriously dodgy activities in the McCarthy/Red Scare/height-of-the-Cold-War era.
None of this adds up to jack shit, in terms of providing evidence that the <em>modern</em> WP has any systemic problems. I could probably find better sourcing for the claim that Elvis is alive.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>All genuine concerns.  I think pg is real personally.  I was following the zerohour1 leaks on it all and if it&#39;s fake, the process through which it developed seemed extremely organic.  It didn&#39;t just&quot;pop up&quot; with a flood of posts on reddit one day. I was there in real time watching it happen.  </p>

<p>Now, after some right wing pr saw how popular Facebook damaging  it was, they no doubt spammed it to hell with redundant, poorly written articles which I&#39;m sure would give the appearance of it being fake.  </p>

<p>I can promise you though, that no matter the truth of the accusations against Alefantis, podesta, etc; the source of these allegations was organic and there is reason to make these accusations.</p>

<p>Bush/Reagan calll girls/boys.  Trump.  Hastert.  Paul Ryan and the Racine squad.  Moore.   There are plenty of right wingers who are of suspect and part of this culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right, I honestly don&#39;t know.  I wasn&#39;t in on the beginning of PG - I jumped in about a month after it gained traction.  By that time there was so much shit muddying the waters, <em>flooding</em> the muddy waters, it was hard to take <strong>any</strong> of it seriously.  I&#39;m not down with demonizing, doxxing and accusing grandmas of sex trafficking or reading into low-brow humor pics of kids.  Sadly, that&#39;s the direction people went with pizzagate so it easily resembled a wild smear campaign.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a real risk we run in this sub - getting ahold of real and pertinent information and then letting the crazies take over with their pitchforks and tiki torches and blowing it all to hell.  Maybe they are disinfo agents, maybe they are tinfoil hatters - hell if I know.  But when rational people question information - while having a legitimate interest in the subject matter - they are painted as shills and deniers, making the entire subject a black/white binary issue.  And the <em>entire subject</em> becomes a joke.  Just like pizzagate.</p>

<p>Sorry, that was a soapbox tangent, but one I certainly needed to get off my conspiracy chest.</p>
