<p>No, that&#39;s hardly even brought up. I personally think the event is what it looks like as far as Paddock just shot up the place being the effort and skill needed to pull off what he did is so very low. </p>

<p>Yet even that&#39;s a guess being we honestly have almost nothing to work with fact wise, everyone (myself included) is just guessing at this point. The information lock down has been amazing if you think about it. This high profile of a case and......... nothing.</p>

<p>I think the only thing the majority of people agree on is that Campos (the guard) looks rather incompetent and a little sketchy over all as far as his story, his actions, his travels and that lame interview. The Ellen interview was just terrible and either a pure pay off or maybe another layer of MGM damage control. The local Vegas PD also seems to be in over their head as far as the investigation goes. I also think a majority of people think MGM screwed up some where along the line liability wise. Maybe not in a direct &quot;your fault&quot; sort of way but enough to be in panic mode about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just has a strong vibe that nobody died. And this, after days and days of reviewing hundreds of videos, researching the &quot;victims&quot; and their families, and the underlying circumstances around LV.</p>

<p>I mean, people can go at each others&#39; throats for eternity over whether Bldg 7 was a controlled demo, or crumbled perfectly straight down into its own footprint due to a small fire in one corner of the building, ya know?</p>

<p>People are used to being told that the apple in front of them is an orange..  for the last 20 events since shady hoax. LV is no different. There were no real ballistics. Machine gun sounds were piped into a sound system, and crisis actors dropped and played dead/injured, like they did for Aurora, Boston, etc. The revision of the NDAAs Smith-Mundt act ushered in the legality of the US using propaganda on its own citizens within its borders. The fact that we&#39;ve seen exactly ZERO photos or video of a <em>single</em> perpetrator of ALL of these events should also make you wonder if it&#39;s real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I saw those two ads for crisis actors. I have so many questions about crisis actors.... but anyways, I agree with all you said, but what do you mean we&#39;ve seen zero photos of the perpers in all these events?

    <div class="md"><p>There are no videos or photos that <em>actually</em> show a &quot;perp&quot; doing the deed, or even in the area in every one of these events. San Bern, Aurora, 2 church shootings, Sandy Hoax, etc. We are told stories in the newspaper, with a picture of a person&#39;s face, and that&#39;s the extent of it.</p>

<p>It 100% of these cases, it would be entirely possible to stage a scene (fake or half-real) or carry out a black-ops attack, and dump a patsy&#39;s body in the road with a bullet in the side of his head, then craft some story out of thin air about who this &quot;lone gunman&quot; was.. even though half of these events have multiple eyewitness accounts documented on live TV that they saw <em>multiple shooters</em>, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious because I grew up very close to where Dylan Roof did (25 ish minutes away, but when you grow up somewhere and have to drive far to go anywhere good, etc). What do you think about the video footage of him going into the church? I did SO much research and even paid for beenverified and other sites as everything was happening on the news, and I&#39;m like 90% certain the dude never existed. The only thing that throws me off now is that he was supposedly assaulted in prison, and then people sent his attacker money and he was able to get out. If he is really in jail, who is he and why him?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yeah, the fact that like NO ONE showed up to the hospital when workers came in for overtime to be ready says it all when it comes to the reported casualties. Not to mention, that guys interview where he supposedly carried his &quot;buddy&quot; (he never says his name) OVER a fence, onto a rolling bin, and then &quot;under a stage&quot; without getting any blood on himself despite that friend having 3 gunshot wounds to the chest.

    <div class="md"><p>So, there was a mass casualty drill at the same time the shooting was taking place. There is video footage of people at the hospital &quot;acting&quot; like they were dying, but with no blood. From personal experience, I have been to mass casualty drills with more realism than that. One example was a high school in La Canada where the students were really into it. Multiple agencies showed up and, from the pictures, you&#39;d never know it was a drill.</p>

<p>From the pictures on the ground, it does seem very difficult to find any evidence of actual bullet wounds. A statistically improbable number of survivors have been killed in the aftermath, since the shooting. One founded the High Desert Phoenix non-profit, years ago, after her friend was kidnapped and murdered in an abandoned military bunker.</p>

<p>Stephen Paddock had a scar on his throat, but no scar is apparent on the corpse and the pictures lack the proper amount of shell casings from the firing.</p>

<p>Jesus Campos was immediately photoshopped into an image, posed like baphomet, though his appearance on the Ellen show has him appearing as 30 lbs+ heavier. Jesus Campos&#39; timeline has been repeatedly proven wrong.</p>

<p>The union that just took all Las Vegas private security guards into the fold are the ones who pose with Campos, leading some to believe they are a protection racket.</p>

<p>Noveske rifle barrels sold to Saudi buyers were in Paddock&#39;s possession, fueling theories that this incident is part of the regime change that just occurred in SA. There are allegations Saudi royalty was in the hotel at the time. Recently, there have been multiple arrests with one Saudi being killed in the process of arrest.</p>

<p>At Jesus Campos&#39; house, employees from Zebra Tactical and On Scene Security &amp; Investigations were present. One employee, carrying a Federal Concealed Carry badge, is caught on camera making hand signs of devil horns. The law firm responsible for registering these businesses is owned by the Schellerups, where Mark Baxter Schellerup is a &quot;Tie Binder&quot; (studies covert politics) at the Bohemian Grove cult.</p>

<p>Red Rock companies seemingly stole a large amount of land to the heirs of Howard Hughes by tricking them into accepting shares that were rendered almost valueless in the final moments before the transaction.</p>

<p>Red Rock is a reference to the red granite obelisk that stood in the center of the Circus of Nero and still stands in that same place where the Vatican is today. Check out the logo for Red Granite productions and you will start to notice the underlying cult themes.</p>

<p>For these reasons and many more, the evidence goes everywhere. It is tough to make a determination, but it seems likely that a robbery could have taken place at the opposite end of the Strip while multiple SWAT units were deployed by the concert.</p>

<p>One theory suggested that the casinos are surreptitiously mining bitcoins. This theory was boohooed by many people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but they site that it wouldn&#39;t be worth 25k machines doing this. The number of registered slot machines is closer to 250k, so I wouldn&#39;t use their reasoning to discount this theory.</p>

<p>Mostly, I am still waiting for more information.</p>

<p>At this stage, we know the news has lied to us and information is being kept from the people. The logical conclusion we can draw, at this moment, is that the news does not have free agency.</p>
