       Repost from an earlier post of mine in the_donald. I genuinely want input. I'm not trying to hurt anyone's feelings.(don't really care if it does to be honest.) I just want answers.

       What do you guys think of this quote from Donald Trump:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years,” Trump said. “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
       </p>

       It costs him nothing to praise people but hurts business if he starts getting judge-mental.

       No matter how you want to spin it, the meta-fucking-data proves Trump was there. Question is now, did he take part in the elitist *chicanery?

       Yeah... Trump was never in the flight logs. Clinton was.

      <p>
       Very wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was just in the "black book." So were plenty of other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch the deposition, where Epstein gets asked about his "egg-shaped" penis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lawsuit filed against Trump had no such details.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Epstein’s little black book and flight logs read like a virtual Who’s Who:** Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Larry Summers, Kevin Spacey, Prince Andrew, and Naomi Campbell all hitched rides on Epstein’s private planes.** Socialites and distinguished scientists went to visit Epstein’s island in St. Thomas, and cavorted at epic dinner parties at his palatial townhouse—then the largest privately owned residence in New York, as he liked to brag. There, they picked at elaborate meals catered by celebrity chefs like Rocco DiSpirito, marvelled at Epstein’s opulent decor, and noted the pack of very, very young model-types with whom Epstein always seemed to surround himself.

       It's dangerous to be delusional.  It's even more dangerous to outright ignore information that contradicts your strange delusions of Trump
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being a sexual predator.

       But notice the wording. It is non-specific as to who belongs to who. I found the page in the little black book, but I have not seen a single entry in the flight logs that indicate Trump flew on the Lolita Express.

       I already pointed out in the flight logs where Donald Trump and several family members are listed as having flown on said flight.  I linked it, as well as providing a screenshot.  You still refuse to accept the fact that Donald Trump flew on these flights.  This is why I'm calling you delusional.  You literally won't accept the truth.

       He has sick comments about his daughter. He, Ivanna and Ivanka are literally in Epstein's little black book. Ep(((stein))). Ivanka marries a jew. Epstein knew known predators Spacey and Clinton, Clinton's who knew Trump before he got into politics. It's all connected.

       Ivanka is hot as fuck so I get it, I mean it's weird, but there's been weirder things. I just think it's stupid to use that as away to disparage them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The access hollywood tape is also pointless. Trump has never claimed to be the center of morality, but using that to say that he's a rapist is ridiculous, much more a child rapist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Epstein connection is troubling, I think he's said something about it saying he didn't do any of that other stuff, but I find it hard to deny that he is of innocence here. This is just something we either choose to believe or we don't as there is not much evidence to illegality besides him just being on the plane.

       You heard it there folks. It's okay to be gross about your daughter if she's hot. Incest is a-ok and we get it if the daughter is attractive.

       I thought we were going to have discussion, but you're silly. Obviously incest is not okay. All he said is if he weren't her daughter he'd be dating her. Which I would probably say the same thing, it's not even sexual.
      </p>
      <p>
       He did say that one thing they have in common together is sex? but I didn't understand that much. But dude like, there's other things to harp on him about other than these two comments. Don't compare Joe Biden to him, none of those pictures are even close to Joe Biden creepy.

       I mean, in the grand scheme of all things Trump, I'm not sure it's worth "harping on", but let's also not normalize dads saying they'd date their daughter either.

       You'll have to pardon my whiplash.  One minute this sub thinks photos of kids eating pizza is pedo inspired, but the next minute saying you'd date your daughter is a-okay.  Agreeing to disagree is fine, but that shit is a bit confusing.

       Trump: “Now, somebody who a lot of people don’t give credit to but in actuality is really beautiful is Paris Hilton,” he said. “I’ve known Paris Hilton from the time she’s 12, her parents are friends of mine, and the first time I saw her she walked into the room and I said, ‘Who the hell is that?’”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Did you wanna bang her?” Stern asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Well, at 12, I wasn’t interested,” Trump said, “I’ve never been into that, I've sorta always stuck around that 25 category."
      </p>
      <p>
       "But even at 12, you were kinda like "wow, she's hot," Stern asked.

      <p>
       "I saw her at 12, she was beautiful," Trump responded.

       Not evidence of anything, sure, but Trump by his own admission thought that a 12 year old was attractive.

       Look dude I totally agree that it's weird, and trump has more than proven that he has no tact. But this is just stupid to argue about. My guide to whether trump is a good person or not is not based on one sentence he said. He's said so many more questionable things but that is all they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is about conspiracies not about nitpicking weird shit trump says. It's just such a stupid and argument, I don't want to have to defend trumps tact less comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       A real conspiracy is that Trump is surrounded by ashekenazis. That lots of his donors and advisers are them.

       I agree that one sentence doesn't define a person, but together with the Epstein comment he made makes it worse.

       Even still, it's definable actions that show what a person is, so until Trump has been proven to do something, I'm not going to claim he's some MONSTER. I just think he's creepy towards women/girls.

       Sounds an awful lot like consent to me; seriously, some of you people really need to work on critical thinking skills. Trump isn't in the flight logs, he's in "the little black book". People used to keep books with all their contacts information, we didn't have smart phones back then. Trump testified against him.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years,” Trump said. “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This sounds like him dropping bread crumbs for people that are looking for them; why would he mention "many of them are on the younger side"? It's like him casually saying "everyone knows of course, Hillary's belief it takes a village...which only makes sense of course because in places like Haiti, she's taken a number of them" in his speech at the Al Smith Dinner.

       The paedo blackmail for Isreal thing was initially started by Robert Maxwell Ghislaines Czech Father. Who was tasked with recruiting left leaning billionaires to the Greater Isreal cause by mossad. Trump was a left leaning billionaire with a Czech wife so he was near the top of the list with all the oligarchs from eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union. Being part of this club is why he will do anything for Isreal and has Kremlin backing.

       Sounds like a threat to Epstein?   It's like him letting Epstein know not to fuck with him because he knows about his brownstone games.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe him, Jeff, bill, and Chris tucker are all into banging 10 year olds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either one is crazy.  Maybe trump got caught in a brownstone op back in the day, but in doing so he got dirt on all the other child bangers too.  Maybe he will jump on the sword and martyr himself and take all the other pedos down with him.  I'm not hoping on it, but at this point he is our best bet on one of the pedos flipping on the others.  His ego is too big, and he is too petty.  He has very little to lose at this point reputation wise.

        Meanwhile, the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach last night confirmed a Web site report that Epstein has been banned there. “He would use the spa to try to procure girls. But one of them, a masseuse about 18 years old, he tried to get her to do things,” a source told us. “Her father found out about it and went absolutely ape-[bleep]. Epstein’s not allowed back.” Epstein denies he is banned from Mar-a-Lago and says, in fact, he was recently invited to an event there.
