       Look, I know some of the people involved are sincere and care a lot about child sexual abuse. Hell, I work in child protection services myself. The largest enquiry into institutional child sexual abuse ever in my country (the Royal Commission) is about to hand down it's final report after a 5 year investigation that has exploded in depth and in horrific findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a serious, global issue that has destroyed countless lives, left people acutely traumatised, and has knock-on effects of social disadvantage that continue through generations...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...but Pizzagate is a contemptible joke so ridiculous that they had to rebrand it Pedogate. They had to expand its scope to include just about all pedophilia and child trafficking perpetuated by relatively powerful men across the globe. Which is, conveniently, pretty much all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately, people have been urgently bleating "oh it was
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       about elite pedophilia. Well, back in the day, it was very noisily and particularly about 1.) some very specific alleged politico pedos who liked pizza, and 2.) a specific pizza place. Hence the name.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're serious about combating child abuse, you should examine the evidence of the Pizzagaters with a critical eye. Ask yourself why it's presented the way it is and what is its provenance? Also, who's presenting it and what are their credentials and motivations?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it stand to reason? Or is it a lame Gish Gallop interlaced with outright bullshit? I'm interested in Pizzagate, but mainly as a social phenomenon. The body of evidence is weak as shit, and there's too much deliberate bullshit and fact-wrangling for me to think that there aren't hardcore trolls, shills, and agitants involved, hiding behind a very handy veil of "why are you
       <em>
        defending
       </em>
       the
       <em>
        pedos
       </em>
       ?"
      </p>
      <p>
       If the bullshit ceased, and the evidence started to make some kind of basic sense, maybe I'd eat humble pie and take another look.

       Seeing as there is exponentially more evidence that trump rapes kids and pizzagate is pushed to DEFEND the child rapist Trump. No there really isn't anything there.

       If pizzagate was real Trump would have been implicated long ago. Pizzagate a defence of pedophiles as long as you have that sweet R next to your name

       Fact: there are no good "allegations" concerning Keith Olbermann. Your desperation to attack English itself and the person pointing this out is a desperate distraction.

       So, turns out my point -- that these "accusations" (there's another word too) against Keith Olberman -- are wholly unsupported remains.

       Yes pizza gate was investigated by some people on the Internet. Do you know why? Because the fucking FBI and the fucking Washington police didn’t look into it at all, zero, zilch, no investigation. That is the fucking problem.

       He already retired. The only reason he came out of it was to do that little show on GQ. The show has now ended because he is confident that Trump is finished. There really doesn’t seem to be any outside influence in this decision.

       Uh, no? If you bothered to watch his last video, he says that he thinks Trump is finished because Flynn has ceased communicating with White House lawyers, meaning he probably has taken a deal with Mueller. Mueller doesn’t do that for Flynn unless Flynn gives him the goods, whatever that may be, and so Olbermann feels confident “the goods” is collusion evidence.

       It started out with hacking the server, and that Trump got them to get him the emails so Clinton would lose. Turns out, when all those emails were transferred out of the server it happened too fast to have been done over the internet, someone had to have done it in person (Seth Rich maybe). Then it was that Donald Jr and Kushner met with the Russian lady lawyer; turns out she was paid by FusionGPS to meet them, and FusionGPS set the meeting up because Hillary told them to. She was trying to entrap them, but they didn't actually do anything. (Another thing to mention is there's no such crime as collusion, Mueller's investigation was actually originally for obstruction of justice because Trump fired Comey, which may have affected his investigation into collusion... which isn't a crime. Also, according to Comey, he wasn't investigating collusion. This whole thing is a farce.) So now, they have evidence that the Russians bought ads on Facebook, said ads were about Bernie Sanders, BLM, and Antifa; they had nothing to do with Trump. Manafort was indicted for failing to register as a foreign operative like 8 years ago, when he was working with Tony Podesta, Hillary's campaign manager's brother, who is also being investigated and his big time lobbying firm recently shut down over this. Another thing is that Mueller was involved in the Uranium 1 deal, where Hillary took bribes to sell 20% of our uranium production capability to Russia, which is illegal, and Mueller actually personally delivered it to Russia, so unless he's worked out a deal he shouldn't even be involved with this whole thing because he's compromised.... I could have used 20-30 pages writing all that out in more detail, so it's really condensed without sources, but if you look you'll find them.

       Every single bit of that needs to have a citation or it just looks like a fever dream of somebody who can’t admit that Trump fooled you.

       You simply cannot accept a reality where you have been tricked. I know. I’ve been there. My whole world was a lie. But it is better to come out of the other side. To understand that you can be made a fool by certain plans and figures. It isn’t hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing you just said is real, really. You’re taking disparate data points, some real, some not so much, and constructing a narrative that suits your purposes. Come back to consensus reality. Trump is going to jail. He is a traitor to this nation. Everybody knows it. Democrats do. Republicans do. Whole country does except Trump and his base.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you going to do when he is impeached? I hope you aren’t planning violence. It won’t solve anything.

       Literally none of this is them "changing their story" like you claim. It's just further evidence of different points of the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just take your first claim, that the transfer was "too fast". This, like most of your points is just some nonsense some internet numbnut came up with. It's not true- I remember those posts and that multiple people showed right off the bat those transfer speed were available just about anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's true about everything you've posted. Just some T_D horseshit that doesn't mean anything and hasn't caused anybody to change one iota of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       For god sakes please wake up- Russian partisans, claiming to be Putin linked, literally offered Papadopolous thousands of Hillary emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       He plead guilty to this. Trumps campaign manager who's literally never managed a campaign has spent most of the last decade representing a Putin stooge in Ukraine and possibly laundering dirty money.

       Wish I could see the look on your face when you finally realize Mueller was hired to clean up the swamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump interviewed Mueller the day before he was assigned as special counsel. The media reported it as Mueller being interviewed for the job as head of FBI, but he has already reached the maximum term limit.

       The conspiracy is fairly well explained in the title. Basically: Did Keith Olbermann retire because some sexual shit is about to come out about him?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a hell of a leap to make without any further evidence, so you're right about that part, but nowhere near as extreme as a bunch of other conspiracies that get discussed here on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       No need for mods to get involved, because then where would they stop? They just delete every conspiratorial question that someone comes up with?

       Op was putting forth a hypothetical situation and/or question under the umbrella of conspiracy theory based on Olberman's shady as fuck past. It''s not an accusation of pedophilia and it's not completely out of the blue. At best you could argue Op was insinuating Olberman was guilty of sexual misconduct of some sort, but personally I don't see that as much as I see a guess with at least some merit.

       Well, he came out today and said he was erasing all his anti Trump stuff and retiring from politics because he believes Trump is finished now that he called Sen. Warren "Pocahontas" (for like the 100th time).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also today, Morning Joe came out and said
       <em>
        he's
       </em>
       erasing his anti Trump stuff and is done talking about it because "it's so 2017".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also today, Rep Luis Gutierrez (D), a leading voice for immigration reform and amnesty announced he won't be running for re-election.

      <p>
       That's kinda weird.

       He was on the right side of the tracks with his original tirades against Dubya and his administrations blatant abuse of power and the loss of freedoms under the Patriot Act et al, which was a just and worthy cause to publicly bitch about no matter who was in power but he went on a hiatus or to work in the sports division right after Obama arrived and has only returned to that soap-box with Trump's inauguration.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it would seem that his and the network's motivations were all strictly political and strictly one-sided at the end of the day. His attempts to re-vive that and make the same case in the same way against Trump without having anywhere near the same kind of justification for it he had against Bush and the neo-cons is simply more of the same absurd and tiresome media circus that is tanking big time trying to make a mountain out of a mole-hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       He went from being one of the very few media voices crying out in the wilderness to being lost in a veritable sea of them that any efforts by him to try and outdo in order to be noticed, have simply made him look like another raving and sputtering idiot like all the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's retiring because no one is listening or wants to and just ahead of the door that would have hit him smack in the ass on his way out.

       Yes pizza gate was investigated by some people on the Internet. Do you know why? Because the fucking FBI and the fucking Washington police didn’t look into it at all, zero, zilch, no investigation. That is the fucking problem.

       Yeah, keep telling yourself that man; you have to be able to see that the whole Russian thing is bullshit, they've changed what they're accusing him of so many times... Oh, one other odd coincidence today, McCabe is getting fired. Trump has basically got a handle on things now and he's consolidating, sorry to have to tell you.

       Wish I could see the look on your face when you finally realize Mueller was hired to clean up the swamp.

      <p>
       Trump interviewed Mueller the day before he was assigned as special counsel. The media reported it as Mueller being interviewed for the job as head of FBI, but he has already reached the maximum term limit.

       Imo it's got legs, but is handicapped by the partisan bots spamming it just to bury clinton.  Trump has ties to pedoculture as well, so it makes sense.
