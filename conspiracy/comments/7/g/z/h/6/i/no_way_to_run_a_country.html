Furloughing 600 state department workers is no way to deal with foreign relations. Leaving a dozen science and technology  positions unfilled is no way to make America great again, instead we are falling behind in science and technology now. Picking people with no legal experience and who the American Bar Association says is unqualified to fill Federal judge positions, is crazy. Using family to fill White House positions is nepotism, and only happens in third world countries or Dictatorships or Crime Families. Using Wall Street Cronies to fill his Cabinet, to give breaks to Wall Street and himself. Telling foreign diplomats to stay at his properties so he makes a profit from it is not only unethical it is also illegal and violates the constitution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s teaches perspective. if you&#39;re experienced in it (bullying and name calling) you begin to learn it&#39;s natural and a way of expression. bullying and teasing is also rooted in humor and playfulness. it teaches you to enjoy being held accountable and also once you can deflect it back (playing along in the bullying and name calling) you begin to gain the confidence to push yourself and  lose childish fears like failure and peer pressure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the only reason I&#39;m glad Trump won and not HRC. Hillary would have kept her shady shit hidden, and looted the country under the table.

<p>The solution, of course, doesn&#39;t lie in more status quo Corporate Whore bullshit like Kamala or Deval or HRC. I think we need a real Progressive Populist who is a champion of the People to run against Trump in 2020. Whether or not this can happen in the context of the Dem Primaries is yet to be determined...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t have to be Bernie specifically. But in my mind it must be someone who follows in his vein of politics and campaigning style. I personally voted for him in the Primaries and wrote his name in in November, and I am aware that not everyone here will agree with my opinions on the man, which is totally ok. But like I said, I think we need a real Progressive Populist, in the same vein as William Jennings Bryan and Bernie, to run against Trump in 2020 and right the ship. But that is my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Tulsi, I really do. I think that her actions in Congress and her activism in places like the Dakota Access Pipeline show she is on the side of the People, and work against the bad taste her former presence on the CFR left in peoples mouths. Personally, I would love to see Tulsi gain a bit more experience, to prove she is as committed and dedicated to the cause as Bernie. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not an easy ask, however, since Bernie has been in congress for 3 decades. But if Bernie doesn&#39;t run, and my choice is between Tulsi and a corporate whore like Kamala or Deval, I will vote Tulsi all day every day, and I would vote her over Trump in a heart beat, though I worry in the back of my mind that she has the potential to pull an Obama on us...that being said, I think she is genuine, but I would really like to see her in Congress for a few more years, or as a Cabinet level position/VP in a hypothetical Bernie Administration come 2020. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm that&#39;s fair. Besides the CFR thing, she really does come off as a great leader with the People&#39;s best interest in mind. She is a military vet too which I always consider a plus because these people tend to be less war-hawky knowing the cost of war and value of the life of each soldier. You make a great point about how she can use some experience in Congress but I don&#39;t think she should run behind Bernie. I&#39;m done with that old man after what he pulled last election. I&#39;m with you that if she runs for the democratic ticket, which I have a good feeling she might, I will definitely be supporting her.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think Bernie betrayed the movement. He endorsed Hillary so that he couldn&#39;t be Nader&#39;d and blamed for her defeat, which they still try to do, though far less effectively. There were articles at the time os his endorsement and statements from his inner circle that he worried HRC would lose, his endorsement was clearly political in nature, and I think he came out stronger for it.</p>

<p>That being said, I think the real proof is in the pudding of his actions afterwards. He founded Our Revolution, which is a grassroots organizing effort to get Progressives to run at every level of government in Primaries against Establishment D&#39;s, and Nina Turner is the current president. With their help 8 State Parties have been taken from the Establishment, and in the November elections last month, 19/21 OR endorsed candidates won, including self avowed Democratic Socialists, and in Red states as well. He also founded the Sanders Institute with members like Tulsi, Nina, and Harry Belafonte, among others, as a Progressive Policy think tank. I see his actions as building parallel institutions to the Party in order to launch a full, grassroots driven Progressive insurgency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It definitely should be Bernie Sanders.  He&#39;s the most popular politician in America - and that was coming from being a relatively no-name junior Senator in the one of the smallest states just a couple years ago.  Think of the name recognition he has now.  And we all know that the dem primary was stacked/rigged against Bernie.  If he runs again, which I absolutely hope for (I wrote him in as well), and we have a fair primary, I think he would definitely win the nomination and he would have the best chance of beating Trump over all other contenders.  </p>

<p>Bernie has an actual platform and agenda for the working/middle class and would do much better than Hillary especially in states like Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, etc.  The primary was front-loaded with southern states before he was very visible.  But I think now he could make gains in red states pretty effectively.  He would certainly generate more excitement and be able to turn out the vote for him and down ballot progressive democrats.  </p>

<p>Bernie Sanders is one of a kind.  Not bought and sold.  Consistently has been on the right side of issues for decades.  Plays to the hopefulness of America instead of negative campaigning.  Simply has good character and to boot he knows how to run a good grass-roots campaign.  I would absolutely vote for him again and I think a lot of working America across both party lines would as well, seeing him as an advocate.  Independents are the largest voting bloc right now and they heavily favored Bernie.  It&#39;s basically what the Democrats should have done in 2016 - but the advantage is now everybody knows him and it turns out they love him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for sharing your political views with us. maybe you should run for president? i mean, if you want something done right, do it yourself. i think america got what it had a long time coming. everyone   should be happy with trumps win. he did it. if thats the bar set, it should be an inspiration to all of americas citizens.  personally, im glad he won. thank god hillary didnt get in. just because her staff were not family, they are all from the same tree. what trump did, was bring in people he can trust and rely on, his family. hes re writing the standards.if enough people have a issue with it, maybe they will go do something to change it. good for him. barrier = broken</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what is different? The last Prez did the same... bad mouthed the other side... quit being a crybaby and creating division. The &quot;in kids&quot; are all about spreading love and rejecting division and hate and are far above this petty political crap... there are bigger problems that exist above politics... maybe consider waking TF up. Peace and love... Q Fan</p>
