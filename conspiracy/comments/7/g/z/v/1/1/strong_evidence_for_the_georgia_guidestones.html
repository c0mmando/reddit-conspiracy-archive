        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I need to preface this post with a few terms that will be required to understand what the host is saying:</p>

<p>Squirrel - Someone who joined, learned the information and then left to form their own organization. It is later found that these groups are usually STILL under the control of the main branch.</p>

<p>Freezone - An organization affiliated with the main CoS branch, with the same end goals in mind - but can operate without having to answer &quot;Yes&quot; to the question: are you a member of the church?</p>

<p>Reading list: A list of approved reading, thought to be positive influences upon the initiate. Nothing outside of this list is permitted, everything permitted is carefully considered and chosen.</p>

<p>Fair-game - &quot;Anyone who is not us, is open season&quot; (Remind you of any religions or other groups at the root of all this conspiracy?)</p>

<p><strong>In the radio show I am posting, the host spend about 40 minutes going through TWO things:</strong></p>

<p>The first is the <a href="https://youtu.be/v7gNdTFgfEA?t=11m42s">credibility of the source</a> and then, <a href="https://youtu.be/v7gNdTFgfEA?t=20m54s">the evidence/answer in question</a>.</p>

<p>The evidence in question can be found in <a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/Lonesome%20Squirrel.pdf">this book</a> (Which I may add is coincidentally one of only three books I have been unable to acquire through archive.org). It is in chapter 6, search freely for &quot;Elbert&quot;.</p>

<p>The host, I must add, just yesterday posted a video that looks like he had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRgZMh_T1M">stroke</a>. There is a reason if you search for this guy you won&#39;t find much on here... this guy is onto something with the ancient civilizations research he did for 2007 - 2016 and his research into the church in 2017. Look what he gets for it.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong> The evidence points to the site of the Guide-Stones being a landing site for our favorite alien-related religion.</p>

<p>Anyway, soapbox out. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh and I&#39;m sure this is going to get downvoted to hell and beyond, so... let that speak for itself.</p>

<p>Andn I am not sure exactly what we are to expect to discover and I admit I am not very invested in the Georgia Guide Stones, but see them as a personal statement by someone who had some extra cash and no family he wanted to give it to had some fun instead. </p>

<p>I also see people here who are so thoroughly invested in their own theories, they must state them, no matter how far out and even impossible they may be.  That might be all that the Guide Stones are about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer, yes.</p>

<p>The name Prison Planet, people originally thought it was from Michael Aquino - but BEFORE him, it was hidden in OT level 3, from 1949 onward. So ask yourself, where did Alex get the name from?</p>

<p>not true.</p>

<p>true, but irrelevant -- the operating thetan levels did not exist at the time of the founding of scientology.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>timothy leary was fond of the expression &quot;prison earth&quot; in the 1970s -- does that prove that he was a scientologist?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;No,  certainly  not!&quot;,  Wolly  complained  with  great  annoyance,  because  I  was  not  allowing  him<br/>
to  end  off  the  conversation.  &quot;Ron  came  here  some  years  before  Xenu  started  dumping  his<br/>
undesirables here. Ron&#39;s landing party touched down in what is now Elbert County, Georgia. In fact, 
last  June,  I  went  there  with  Ron  to  see  the  place,  and  he  decided  to  construct  a  monument<br/>
commemorating  the  original  landing  site.  He  wants  it  to  be  completed  by  his  next  birthday,  this<br/>
March 13th.&quot;
&quot;Can I go see it?&quot;, I questioned.
&quot;It&#39;s not finished yet&quot;, Wolly stated. &quot;All I can tell you about it is that it&#39;s one of Ron&#39;s personal 
projects  that  he  has  become  involved  with.  He  is  not  planning  it  as  a  dissemination  program  for<br/>
Scientology. The name of it will be the Georgia Guidestones, and he&#39;s planning to turn it over to the 
State of Georgia when it is completed, so that it can be preserved as a state landmark and never be 
torn  down.  Ron  just  wants  to  commemorate  the  first  landing  site  on  Earth,  that&#39;s  all.  He  is  very<br/>
sentimental and nostalgic when it comes to history, although few people know it.&quot;
&quot;Where is this place located?&quot;, I asked.
&quot;It&#39;s in the center of a farm on a hill on Route 77, between Elberton and Hartwell, Georgia&quot;, he 
disclosed.  &quot;Right  in  the  middle  of  nowhere.  Ron  always  liked  to  go  to  Stonehenge,  In  England,  and<br/>
it&#39;s going to look something like that, but more modern.&quot;
&quot;Won&#39;t his name be on it as the sponsor?&quot;, I inquired.
&quot;He doesn&#39;t want that!&quot;, Wolly sneered. &quot;When we went there, he told everybody that he was a 
former  concrete  worker  named  Robert  C.  Christian  whose  great-grandmother  was  from  Georgia.  It<br/>
was  a  marvelous  mock-up.  Of  course,  he  did  tell  Joe  Fendley,  the  man  at  the  Elberton  Granite<br/>
Finishing  Company  who  is  building  it,  that  he  was  a  war  hero  in  World  War  Two,  which  certainly  is<br/>
true.&quot;
&quot;There  is  only  one  thing  that  puzzles  me&quot;,  I  said.  &quot;Why  did  he  select  the  name  Robert  C.<br/>
Christian?&quot;
&quot;Ha, ha, ha!&quot;, Wolly laughed. &quot;You&#39;re pretty smart, picking up on that, without having done OT 
Seven yet.&quot;
&quot;Well, now that I asked, why did he?&quot;
&quot;It was just Ron&#39;s way of getting back at Emperor Xenu for what he did to all of us. Ron has a 
very  good  sense  of  humor,  as  well  as  the  capacity  to  use  a  a  little  sarcasm  whenever  he  has  to<br/>
make a point about something.&quot;
&quot;I  don&#39;t  understand.  What  does  Xenu  have  to  do  with  the  name  Robert  C.  Christian?&quot;,  I<br/>
asked, very puzzled.
&quot;Xenu,  like  all  the  rest  of  us,  picked  up  other  bodies  in  his  subsequent  life  cycles,  and  is  far<br/>
better known for one of his more recent identities.&quot;
&quot;Why?&quot;, I asked. &quot;Was he Hitler?&quot;
Wolly looked at me as if I had just arrived from another world and didn&#39;t know a fucking thing. 
He shook his head from side to side as he gulped down his drink.
&quot;No, Xenu wasn&#39;t Hitler!&quot;, he answered. &quot;He was Christ!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Supposedly, B.F. Coggins, an extremely wealthy and powerful granite and real estate magnate in Elberton, Georgia, has in his company’s possession a Rosicrucian document describing the Georgia Guidestones monument as some sort of portal. The document admits that the monument contains hidden messages, but that only the enlightened will understand them. Moreover, the monument was designed for an activation event that will indicate the immediate threat of a global catastrophe so horrific that humanity will come close to losing all hope. The document reassures the survivors that they are loved and will be cared for. The tenor is such to evoke the impression that intercession will occur either supernaturally or by space aliens.</p>
