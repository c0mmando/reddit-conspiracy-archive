I&#39;ve had this conversation a million times, I will stay pretty convinced that trump will stay in office. This is a liberal pipe dream to get mike fucking pence in. You know, the dude that wants to electrocute gays. I don&#39;t give a fuck about this investigation because it&#39;s all corporate media driven. The warhawks that are for the GOP tax bill, the people that sold the US on the Iraq and yatta yatta. Do I need to go on? Liberals only care about process and never an end goal.

What I care about is that enough comes out about his corruption, lies and treason that the out-party takes a chamber of Congress, so we can arrest the slide to being a corpofascist dictatorship before it&#39;s too late.  I already fear we&#39;ve crossed the point of no return, and the country is lost beyond repair, but I hope it isn&#39;t the case.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that, Trump is the symptom not the disease.  And 2000 is probably a good place to start for when everything went to shit -- that&#39;s around when politics truly turned completely into team-sports/horserace bullshit, which has only gone into hyperdrive in the Internet era.  I have no idea where we go from here as a country, but something major needs to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s actually a lot of speculation into how Mueller might be structuring things to weaken Trump&#39;s ability to pardon.  For instance, it&#39;s known that he&#39;s been in contact with the New York DOJ -- pardon&#39;s can end federal prosecution but not state action.  It&#39;s also unclear that the president can issue a preemptive pardon, and there&#39;s people suggesting that Mueller is being strategic in what charges he&#39;s bringing in indictments and guilty pleas -- Trump can&#39;t necessarily pardon what hasn&#39;t yet been charged.  So, for instance, Flynn might have strong reason to make a deal if Mueller has indicated that New York State would prosecute his son.</p>
