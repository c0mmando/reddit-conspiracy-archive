       .... but for all the anti propaganda savvies here, well, this is really nothing. It's going to FALL FLAT on their faces again, yet AGAIN.

       That's all they have, one lie. ONE lie. LMFAO. About meeting with diplomat. Nothing. For a whole year. Shocking.

       Your only hope is that Mueller flipped Flynn. This is as likely as there are more than 2 genders in the world.

       Yeah all that happened is a former National Security Adviser just plead guilty to lying to the FBI about his relationship with a foreign adversary, suggesting he's rolling over on senior members of the White House if not the President of the United States.  No biggie.

       Im not trying to beat a dead horse but this is literally the next line spouted right after what you just said. I've had this conversation a million times, I will stay pretty convinced that trump will stay in office. This is a liberal pipe dream to get mike fucking pence in. You know, the dude that wants to electrocute gays. I don't give a fuck about this investigation because it's all corporate media driven. The warhawks that are for the GOP tax bill, the people that sold the US on the Iraq and yatta yatta. Do I need to go on? Liberals only care about process and never an end goal. They're pointless

       I don't think Trump will be impeached.  I don't really care about that.  What I care about is that enough comes out about his corruption, lies and treason that the out-party takes a chamber of Congress, so we can arrest the slide to being a corpofascist dictatorship before it's too late.  I already fear we've crossed the point of no return, and the country is lost beyond repair, but I hope it isn't the case.

       I can agree with you on that. If something does happen with the Russia stuff I do think the blue wave will be imminent  but I don't think it's just trump and that trump made this country bad. It's been a shit hole for the last 17 years really.

       I agree with that, Trump is the symptom not the disease.  And 2000 is probably a good place to start for when everything went to shit -- that's around when politics truly turned completely into team-sports/horserace bullshit, which has only gone into hyperdrive in the Internet era.  I have no idea where we go from here as a country, but something major needs to change.

       There's actually a lot of speculation into how Mueller might be structuring things to weaken Trump's ability to pardon.  For instance, it's known that he's been in contact with the New York DOJ -- pardon's can end federal prosecution but not state action.  It's also unclear that the president can issue a preemptive pardon, and there's people suggesting that Mueller is being strategic in what charges he's bringing in indictments and guilty pleas -- Trump can't necessarily pardon what hasn't yet been charged.  So, for instance, Flynn might have strong reason to make a deal if Mueller has indicated that New York State would prosecute his son.

       Too bad he didn't get a sweet deal like Hillary where the FBI let her have multiple lawyers(even a co-conspirator), took no notes or recording, didn't verify her statements, etc..

       She gave the FBI smashed Blackberries and Hard drives. (At a minimum this is obstruction of justice) She didn't have any "Intent" to commit a crime - Comey.

       They gave immunity out like candy to her staffers and the deputy director said Fuck Flynn and Fuck Trump in a meeting.

       I mostly agree. Slight correction, she
       <em>
        said

       she smashed the blackberries, I don't think she turned those in. The top brass of the FBI surely looks corrupt but I wouldn't put that on all of them. Surely there has to be some good noncorrupt guys in the rank and file.

       Yea man, that Comey speech still bugs me. He listed all the ways she broke the law and should be charged then let her off the hook. That was around the 7th time he was involved in letting the Clintons off the hook, going way back to the 80s and the Marc Rich case..

       You don't need an ace lawyer to tell you not to lie to the FBI. Anyone who works in government knows that--especially security community folks!

       Lying about Russian contacts was either epically, baroquely stupid or an act of desperation to cover something else up. I don't know which, but right now Mueller does.

       With all the coverage of this, how can you not understand how a plea deal works? This charge isn't all they have, or Flynn wouldn't have pled out. This is the charge he agreed to plead guilty to, in exchange for
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       getting charged with other offenses. (FARA liability most likely, given the Manafort charges, and maybe other lies to investigators or even the Turkish thing.)
