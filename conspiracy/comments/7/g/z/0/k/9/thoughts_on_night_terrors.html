       Just curious to see this subs thoughts on Night Terrors. Do you have them or know anyone that does? What do you think causes them? I have a family member that does and was just curious. I would hear things like STAY AWAY FROM HIM and GET OUT and DON'T YOU TOUCH HIM at times. However, it was mostly kind of like a weird haunting moan if that makes any sense and shrieking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've only had one instance of this myself and it was very weird. I honestly don't know if I was just dreaming this or what. I was by myself so there is no one to back up what happened. However, I opened my eyes from sleep and realized I was making this sound that was basically like saying "ahh" when the doctor checks your toncils but it was like a lower pitch and it was loud and just going on for a good 5-10 seconds while I was cognasent until I snapped myself out of it and shook it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also got a nephew (not my blood) that was going through an episode when spending the night once and he was crying and the only thing I could do to snap him out of it was make eye contact with him. He resisted eye contact at first and his eyes were open the whole time. Scary shit.

       Normally I get the kind that happens when your brain wakes up but your body doesn't. You see shapes in the room and feel an overbearing, evil presence, but that is just your subconscious freaking out about being awake but trapped in an unmoving body. I think most night terrors can be explained this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it happens to me I just focus on willing my fingers, then my arms to move, until my body wakes up and I have control again, then all the terror goes away instantly and I can fall right back asleep.

       That happened to me one it was terrifying. I think that's called sleep paralysis though and not night terrors but I'm not completely sure.

       Night terrors are from evil spirits. You can't catch them like an infection. I don't know why certain people get them but I think it has to do with good vs. Evil.
If someone is on track to change their life for good I believe evil comes to them to disway them from doing good...
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had night terrors myself and its something I don't wish on my worst enemy.
They are horrific and scary as fuck...

       Weird, when I lost weight and got rid of my apnea mine went away. Maybe fat people are evil or attract evil spirits, I'll have to get some energy crystals next time I gain weight.

       Why don't they want you waking him up?

       I often have terrible nightmares that make me moan and scream in my sleep. I've told my family to wake me up if this happens.

       I did wake this family member up every time it happened. Curious are you having a nightmare when they wake you up? Are their common themes to what is going on when it happens?

       Yes, there are common themes to my nightmares. I've been having them for almost 20 years. But they have gotten worse through the years. When I say worse, I mean me moaning, talking and screaming while still asleep. I didn't always do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm very grateful when someone wakes me up if I'm having one of these nightmares!

       I had them when i was a kid. Between ages 4-7. Not going to really go into details of it, but I'd wake up unable to move for literally minutes. Not fun.

       I still get them occasionally...after it happens enough you start to realize what's going on. For me, I focus on willing my body to move. I start with my fingers, then once they are wiggling I work on my arm. Once I have an arm under my control again everything comes back fairly rapidly.

       Sounds like Sleep Paralysis, which I believe is a little different than what my family member had going on. She would be having conversations with someone or something. Regardless it's all awful. What do you think made yours go away?

       It was paralysis yes, but directly attributed as a physical manifestation from what was a distinct occurrence in my dreams. It was a reoccurring specific action. Not sure what led to it subsiding, but possibly my parents separating. I think I also switched from sleeping on a water bed. My cat I recall would sleep with me at times, but can't remember specifics if she influenced anything. I'm not sure I spoke in my sleep, as part of my terror was being unable to speak. Both in my dream and after waking...

       :) I'm surprised you have never encountered some. They are quite popular in the US, ranging from tattoos to people hanging them on their car mirrors. I always got good vibes from them though, that's why I ask.

       Normally I wouldn't even look at a post about this but oddly enough my daughter, 17, very bright, stable, etc. mentioned to me a couple days ago about having horrible night terrors at 3:30 almost every day.  I sort of shrugged it off, said dreams are your brain's way of removing plaque, totally normal don't worry, but I set my alarm for 3:00 the last couple of nights and was going to stop in and help her if she had nightmares.  I seriously don't think what she has are dreams, to nights in a row I have stopped in and sat with her for over an hour afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Odd you posted this.  Like I said I sort of thought this is a dream, natural brain function, but figured if I helped her get through a couple she would be fine.  At a loss for what to do, whatever my daughter is enduring is beyond anything I can imagine.

       I've heard that if people wake up between 3 and 5 a.m., that they are going through a spiritual awakening. So I'm wondering if this has something to do with your daughter.

       You know if this was someone else I would say great but this is my daughter so I would rather it just be a dream.  She is a great kid and I am scared shitless that when she said this isn't a dream, I woke up to help her, and couldnt, that I don't know what to do.  I can deal with boyfriend problems, school problems, but the terror I saw in her face broke my heart.

       Maybe it is something that is trying to prevent her from being "awakened spiritually". ???

       How long has this been going on?

       Maybe she should keep a notebook and keep track of all this. Tell her to write down what she eats during the day and what time she goes to bed. Also, write down the time of night she wakes up (or has these terrors).

       She has a diary going back to October 15. You have to keep in mind this is my daughter. She is a straight A student, I thought this was nothing until I set my alarm, and now I am terrified. I am an r/conspiracy poster because I believe we are being lied to, but when I say we I mean most people, nothing has ever personally affected me. If you saw the terror in her eyes I saw, she really couldnt tell me how bad it was, just said you dont want to know dad. I was stunned to see this post, I seriously thought this is just a phase, but to be honest I am thinking of trying to get her help. I have never seen fear like this. I thought Id feel better hearing other people went theu this but I actually feel worse. I cant sleep, I wait for it to happen againa nd it does, and when I read someone had these for three years I wanted to scream.

       So she is experiencing this EVERY night? If so, I guess it isn't a particular food causing this. (Just trying to help you and think of all possible causes).
      </p>
      <p>
       You mentioned she is 17 and a straight A student. Would it be stress? Maybe she is keeping her feelings (stressful feelings) bottled up and it is coming out at night, in the form of these night terrors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just trying to brainstorm here and think of all possible causes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anything - out of the ordinary - happened in the past few months? Anything that would cause any kind of stress?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about college applications? That can be stressful, even if she says it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, this could be a "spiritual" thing. Good versus Evil. But I don't have any knowledge or experience with all that. Just know what I've read.

       I always just lurk in here for these kind of things, but I felt I had to post to see if I could help someone else go through what I have for so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've dealt with it for as long as I can remember of my 30 years. I Probably not the most encouraging that it never ends, but I'm still here and I'm doing good in life. There's a lot of us out there who deal with it. My wife sticks with me knowing she has to deal with me waking up around 2-4am in absolute terror. I think the most important part is accepting that these are a part of you and you can still live happily. Cliche as it sounds, but often I feel like if I let the terrors keep me awake all night, I'm letting them win. But I would rather deal with this than pump myself with anything from a pharma. I wouldn't change who I am just to sleep soundly every night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Food and also any vitamins or medications. Cutting out caffeine and decreasing my sugar intake has made a large improvement in how often I experience night terrors. I notice for me, keeping a good balance of magnesium helps too. Our foods are slowly becoming more magnesium deficient, so adding some extra dark leafy greens or supplements help. I suspect too much B12 can cause issues as I just noticed many of my recent "episodes" were the same day I took B12. I'll try to keep a journal and track when I take magnesium and B12 compared to my night terrors, that could be a good experiment. Though, part of me believes it's partially foods and partially paranormal. I don't think anyone can answer that for certain. It could be both. It could be neither. It's what I believe, so I combat it from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's some extremely vivid instances I've had where I can describe in great detail something I see when I wake up. Sometimes I can control my reactions and just acknowledge the thing is there and it just flies on by. Sometimes I wake up thinking something is right there and wants to kill me. There's been at least one I've noticed where my wife and I have had roughly the same nightmares in the same night around the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for "protections":
1.Some times I just sleep in another room.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         One thing that has helps me on bad nights is to "project" my thoughts as if I'm telling an entity "Just go away. I'm not interested. I really need to go to work." That works for some.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If it's in the dream, I learned to recognize when I'm in a dream. Once you know you are dreaming, you are only limited by your imagination. The hard part is if you're too conscious, your conscious mind doesn't understand "magic" and will hold you back thinking it's not possible. But it's a dream, everything is possible.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I read once to fill myself with the belief in Light, Goodness, and Jesus, but not the man Jesus or anything the Church has ever told me. I just think of the idea of Jesus as a messenger of good who or may not have been a physical figure. I fill myself with light and goodness and try to project that as a bubble around me. It feels like a pulsing energy that runs down my spine and out through my limbs when I do. I don't pray to any specific religion's God, but to that which is Good in the universe. For those who continue after I say "go away", this seems to help.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The big one that seems to have the best track record at helping me but also seems to stop my wife's nightmares too while she is sleeping is to fill yourself with love. Not like "romantic love", but just like "love one another." Push out the negative thoughts of others and think about what you love about people. List off the reasons you love your parents, your spouse, etc. It ends up having a similar energy feeling as the Light/Goodness one above, so they might be related energies if you believe in that stuff.

       When I was 17 I actually started to have them also at 3 ish AM every day. For about two or three weeks straight. 
Probably had to do with when I entered REM or something/was coming out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd wake up after screaming some awful non human shreik which would scare me more than the dream I usually couldn't  recall.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad would run in and I'd think he was some monster and I'd attack him or cower in the corner.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd have dreams of being in another realm or dimesion and creatures contouring their bodies and telling me I didn't belong there. Or my family members in another reality trying to touch me and hug me, but burning me when they touched me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also had reoccurring dreams of levitating in my room, shooting up into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've regularly had sleep paralysis since then. If I take Benadryl, pseudofed, or any upper/downer  I am guaranteed to get it. If I take a nap I am guaranteed to get sleep paralysis. If I drink I have it, if I take cough meds or really anything that's stimulating or sedating I know it will mess with my gaba and I'll have this crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up GABA/GLUTAMATE, phone screans and blue light filters.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's literally the most terrifying thing because it's your brain dumping out all the adrenaline and scary emotions/thoughts all at once and it can seem so real. I get freaked out thinking about it.

       Well now you
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       the spirit world is real. Sounds like your daughter has caught the eye of a negative entity. To get rid of it you should pray together. I had an experience where a sleeping family member spoke to me but not as himself. Very specifically to me, and very definitely asleep. Evil spirits do roam the Earth, and they have a thing for our daughters. Protect yourself with Jesus. Sounds crazy I know. But this is not a new phenomena and only very recently did people become anti spiritual. These things are loving that "science" has dropped our guard.

       I fell asleep in the snow once and my body shocked me awake to keep moving.  I think night terrors are part of this same sleep survival shock shutdown mode,  lizard brain stuff.  But if you curb the booze you get less  nightmares and terrors imo.

       I've got a creepy story about night terror/sleep paralysis:
      </p>
      <p>
       About ten years ago my friend had a legitimately haunted apartment. Sounds silly but lots of weird stuff would happen- lights would turn off/on in every room someone would enter, sometimes following them through the house as they walked. We'd leave to get some fast food and come back and candles would be lit. Shit like that. We all thought it was funny and made a lot of jokes about it. We didn't perceive it as threatening- if anything I thought it was fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       My GF took a nap there one night while everyone was hanging out, but she came out of the room crying saying she awoke to a demonic creature sitting on her chest immobilizing her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Classic sleep paralysis, I know, but she never had it before or afterwards. I always wondered about that event.

       Demons seem to like doing that to people. It used to be

       I had a friend who works as a psychic and would visit possessed people and houses. Some must have followed him back, because I slept in his guestroom and one was on my chest.

       I've been waiting the last 2 years for a night terror to sit on my chest.  I've been planning every night to grab it by the throat and eat it.  But ever since moving out of that scary house, i haven't even had a nightmare.

       this may sound a bit silly at first, but using a method similar to fighting Dementors in Harry Potter has worked for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isolate and identify the fear in your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       find a source of joy and comfort and protection for your support.
      </p>
      <p>
       mentally project this image onto the mental torment.
      </p>
      <p>
       then dismiss it as 'Ridiculous'.
      </p>
      <p>
       repeat to self until the synapses in your mind 'grow' a stronger connection that will cause thoughts to naturally 'flow'  to dismissing of threat and envisioning a comforting idea. (similar mental training can be used to train oneself on many things...)
      </p>
      <p>
       it evolved after i used to get them during periods of high stress and using religious mental sourcery/ prayer. after i lost my religion and learned more about how the mind functions and percieves things, i started duplicating my previous methods with non-religious themes.   i used to envision a ball of light and love god or a being of light wrapping me in protective wings in a sort of 'hide under the blanket' mental struggle. i find they occure at times in life where my life is more stressful than my biology can keep pace with.
      </p>
      <p>
       best of luck.

       I’ve suffered from night terrors for the last 30 years. Sometimes it’s once or twice a week, sometimes it’s 4-6 times a night.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those saying you can focus and realize it isn’t real to snap out of it, that’s impossible for some us. It’s literally like waking up in a horror movie, but you don’t know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, it’s not evil spirits or the supernatural.

       If it's not evil, what do you think caused your terrors? My family member was abused as a child and I was always was suspect of that as a cause.

       It’s not evil spirits because evil spirits don’t exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I deal with are Hypnopompic Hallucinations.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hypopompic hallucinations are a category of sleep disorder where the person wakes up to a sensory hallucination. Spanning from auditory to tactile, olfactory and visual hallucination, the sufferer perceives oddities like the devil sitting next to him or her. Technically, our muscles are under partial paralysis during the dreaming stage. For a person prone to hypnopompic hallucination, waking up occurs adjacently to perceiving nightmares.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can’t tell you the cause, but mine generally wax and wane in rhythm with stress and anxiety levels I’m experiencing in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I’ve learned helps mine is sleeping with the TV on. I think the sound of the TV in the background just wakes me straight up as I’m transitioning from my sleep state into the sleep/waking state in which I experience the terrors.

       I rarely have night terrors, maybe once every few years. I did once have a night where I only had night terrors, all night long, hundreds of them, that day a deer jumped out in front of my truck and ruined my vacation.

       About 8 years ago I had them so bad, every night. Terrors and sleep paralysis. I was living alone in an old house. A common one was that I would feel so sure I had woken up but my eyes were still closed and I could sense someone standing over me, and usually they were holding my hand and waiting for me to open eyes and I just knew they were a fucking evil man. I would just be paralyzed in fear and my heart would be racing trying to figure out what the hell I should do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I would realize I was asleep and it was dream and I had to consciously calm myself down--which was really hard to do, but once I did my eyes would actually open and I'd just be panting and sweating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would have a similar one that a tiny old woman had climbed into my bed and was lying next to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another one I had a lot, sudden intense footsteps running toward me, and I would again believe I'd woken up but this time very suddenly and I would see a shadow man running straight at me. Just before a crashed into me I would actually wake up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The house wasn't scary but it hasn't happened once since I moved from that house--and I have always been extremely skeptical of "haunted" happenings, until I actually witnessed it. One time I was home alone until he morning walking through my kitchen and a spoon that was laying flat on the counter legit launched straight at me (about 7-8 feet away).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another time in the same area of the house an 'S' hook on my hanging pot rack fell and hit me in the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last thing (same area of house) was a flat folded drying rack was sitting very securely on top of my stacked washer/dryer and I was standing nearby and it was like yanked down. It had to have been slid forward in order to come off.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the 'S' hook might have a logical explanation but the spoon and the drying rack definitely did not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I'm saying as crazy as it sounds, I believe my house was legitimately haunted and that's why I had the night terrors.

       Demons seem to like doing that to people. It used to be

        common knowledge
       </a>
       that these were demons, but with modern scientism they've come up with silly explanations that don't fit the data just because they are natural.
