        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe not all Trump supporters are not fake (check out my last post about it) but a lot are just stuck in a tribe mentality. If you insult their precious leader, or basically anyone who fits the &quot;Roy Moore&quot; mold, they take it as an insult to their entire existence and movement. </p>

<p>Then they call you a Hillary supporter, and say things like &quot;Hillary would have done X!&quot;</p>

<p>We fucking get it. Perhaps Trump is the lesser of two evils. Perhaps he&#39;s not. But they are both shit. And i refused up vote for either of the two because i can&#39;t stand either one.</p>

<p>There is a big difference between Trump supporters and non-Trump supporters though. I&#39;ve never seen an actual Hillary supporter in this sub. Ever. But I feel like Trump supporters are seeing them EVERYWHERE. Which is completely not true.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basic divide and conquer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said . I hated them both and yet wanted Trump to win and supported his campaign.  It seemed to me a Trump win would not only be vastly amusing but that the extreme hatred and snobbish bias would expose the whole establishment as the corrupt hypocritical con game it is.</p>

<p>Swamp creatures crawling out on all sides atm !</p>

<p>Partisan arguments have no place on a conspiracy thread , if you are here you should at least be aware that in politics one side looks square and the other looks round , but both are indeed the same monster.</p>

<p>The American political circus has become the greatest show on earth and well worth the popcorn. I hear the bread supply is up too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an argument equally true in both directions. I&#39;m registered Dem. I have a long list of criticisms regarding the management, or rather unethical unacceptable mismanagement, that the leadership of the party has lead us down. In short the enterprise is being run as a personal club to reward sycophants family and friends. Any voter with the backbone to call the bullshit dismissed with a misdirection comment then the politician runs away as quick as can be.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting because in the lead up to the election I almost never saw a trump supporter out in the wild (at least with a score positive enough to keep their comment above water).</p>

<p>It&#39;s always basic divide and conquer and now so much easier that &quot;grassroots efforts&quot; can be &quot;established&quot; by just aging a few new reddit accounts and paying 5 or 10 bucks for a vpn, cruise to a sub of your choice and get to work.</p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised with the ease that just one person can appear like many that these theories aren&#39;t just flying off the shelves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s safer to doubt everything you read but that isn&#39;t practical so here we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Your fucking doctor has ruined me!” Trump cried.</p>

<p>Donald held back Ivana’s arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants.</p>

<p>“Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified… It is a violent assault,” Hurt writes. “According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes, ‘he raped me.’”</p>

<p>Following the incident, Ivana ran upstairs, hid behind a locked door, and remained there “crying for the rest of night.” When she returned to the master bedroom in the morning, he was there.</p>

<p>“As she looks in horror at the ripped-out hair scattered all over the bed, he glares at her and asks with menacing casualness: ‘Does it hurt?’”</p>

<p>See also: unpaid contractors, Trump U, and kicking his family off health insurance. Either you are not a good judge of character or you don&#39;t actually give a damn about his character.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to defend Trump but I was really going by what I saw of him in Celebrity Apprentice. Maybe he&#39;s grown as a person from those days. It&#39;s possible that I misread him too(not to mention, it was never from actually meeting and speaking to him. It was from my intuition based on his show Celebrity Apprentice.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you should be more thorough with your character judgment of presidential candidates. You do realize that  television programs are not real life, right? I&#39;m not trying to be an ass and I apologize if I&#39;m coming off that way but he has a track record of being an awful person throughout his entire life. </p>

<p>Did you listen to any of his stump speeches? He sets off so many social engineering red flags.</p>

<p>I agree with you. I tend to give my intuition too much credit sometimes which can make me careless. Not to say I voted on him and support him based my perceptions of him on TV(including the debates), because when time for that decision came, I scrutinized him a bit more and concluded that I&#39;d rather just not vote for anyone.</p>
