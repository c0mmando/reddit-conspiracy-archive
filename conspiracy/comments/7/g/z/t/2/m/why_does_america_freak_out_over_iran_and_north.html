<p>Doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with the discussion though.
They&#39;ve made progress but they are still limited technology wise. You can&#39;t forget they had to get their nuclear technology via Pakistan.</p>

<p>Making nuclear bombs and ICBMs is a lot harder when you have virtually no foreign allies except China, and even China isn&#39;t keen a nuclear ICBM North Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uranium one, led by the democrat majority and president, sold nuclear fuel to Russia Ukraine. One of these Ukraine/ Russian owned mines was caught selling fuel to North Korea. Also, part of the arm ukraine against Russia weapons went to NK. North Korea then sold that to the muslim brotherhood. Israel and UN intercepted this. We then see Israel attack the DNC and favor trump as the Iran nuke deal was the initial anger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No its not. Its a legit business deal. While the uranium likely never left America, the deal gave power to these people to act out internationally as they thought it leverage against the administration that approved and would likely retain power.

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, your first article is about rocket engine components, not fuel. Furthermore it states that these were illicitly obtained cause you know Ukraine is in the middle of a fucking war at the moment... </p>

<p>Secondly, your second article is about the Egyptian military, not the muslim brotherhood. And it&#39;s about short range weapons. Need I remind you that Egypt, relative to other arab and middle eastern countries, has decent relations with Israel and doesn&#39;t shoot missles at Israel?</p>

<p>Thirdly, none of those articles have anything to do with uranium one.</p>

<p>Fourthly, Israel did not hack the DNC nor have anything to do with getting Trump elected.</p>

<p>Did you even read your own articles? Or did you just link some articles in the hope that I wouldn&#39;t read them and just blindly believe you? None of what you linked supports youe argument. It&#39;s tangentially related, at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so there was nothing about a mine in the WaPo article and now you give me a new article.</p>

<p>This article states that Ukraine wants to buy fuel from a company in the Toshiba group instead of Russia because they are at war with Russia. Pretty logical.</p>

<p>Ok. Firstly: this is nuclear fuel for reactors, not enriched uranium to use in atomic weapons.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is no link to North Korea? Are you trying to make a link with Uranium one? I thought we were discussing North Korea? </p>

<p>Look man, no offence, but you&#39;re asking me to take leaps of faith and connect dots that, in my view, aren&#39;t there. </p>

<p>We can go several rounds on this but my view is that:</p>

<p>A. North Korea isn&#39;t technologically capable of your original question (i.e. the subject of the thread)</p>

<p>B. Uranium one is not a conspiracy.</p>

<p>C. North Korea didn&#39;t sell weapons to the muslim brotherhood. They did sell to the Egyptian state but it were RPGs and they were caught red handed.</p>

<p>D. Israel has nothing to do with the DNC nor electing Trump.</p>

<p>I think that about covers all the points we discussed? Anyway dude it&#39;s almost 5 am and I&#39;m tired. It was fun discussing this with you but we both know we aren&#39;t gonna change each others minds so I&#39;m gonna go catch some sleep. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show me your source.  The Intelligence contractors use cheap immigrant H1B visa labor, some of the manufacturers use prison labor and for overseas operations, like during the Iraq war they use ultra cheap labor from places like Bangladesh and Indonesia to do the cooking, laundry and cleaning. And the for profit military companies, even as they are paid in U.S. tax dollars, can hire foreign soldiers to serve in places like Africa and Afghanistan, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because in the case of Iran, they have to scaremonger and create another &quot;WMDs in Iraq&quot; pretext to impose regime-change there.</p>

<p>They also accuse Iran of &quot;seeking the capability to make nukes&quot; -- something the IAEA said 40 countries could do quickly if they wanted to, 10 years ago. That&#39;s 1 out of 4 nations on Earth btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember hearing a few reports of them getting their first satellite a few months back, but I haven&#39;t heard of them launching more. I guess I have to look into land based ICBM and their warhead configurations. The only thing I really know is about Triton II D-5 warheads and they base their targeting and position based off of stellar navigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t use an icbm accurately without a satellite... After George Bush dropped nk sanctions, they did a lot of work with China&#39;s space program. A NK has been to the source station with China. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what Raytheon says about it, you need at least 3 satellites and 3 relay stations to be accurate to negate weather differences across great differences. You cant just point and shoot bc the earths surface isn&#39;t a literal sphere. </p>
