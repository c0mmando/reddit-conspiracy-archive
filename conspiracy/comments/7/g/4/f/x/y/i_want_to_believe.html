    <div class="md"><p>Except that we&#39;ve already found many planets that probably have life in our own stellar neighborhood. This number will only increase the longer we observe and the more telescopes we build. It stands to reason that these planets will harbor similar evolutionary life patterns as ours, and they will look out and find our planet as an ideal candidate for life. Any race able to build interstellar transport vehicles nearby would certainly be curious about Earth given its ideal conditions for life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because our star is relatively young compared to others that we have observed. Stars nearer to the center of the galaxy tend to be older, thus life would have evolved billions of years earlier on these older star systems. </p>

<p>Additionally, planets even within our own solar system were inhabitable to complex llife forms before us - specifically <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-climate-modeling-suggests-venus-may-have-been-habitable">Venus may have been inhabitable over 2 billion years ago</a>. That is a long time for life to have possibly evolved - and that is just within our own solar system. It stands to reason that other nearby star systems had planets that also were inhabitable long ago that could have hosted advanced life before we were even out of the bacteria stage. </p>

<p>Another point, is that you say we&#39;ve found planets only capable of bacteria level. However, I&#39;ll give you at least one counter example - <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-discovers-first-earth-size-planet-in-the-habitable-zone-of-another-star">https://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-discovers-first-earth-size-planet-in-the-habitable-zone-of-another-star</a></p>

<p>Note that to find a planet takes a long time of observation. From these distances we can only infer their existence from the light that is periodically missing from the light we see from the star. That means that if the planet is on an orbit whose elliptic plane is not in line with ours, it is much less likely that we will notice it. This means that there are tons more planets out there than we have even observed just within our stellar neighborhood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, a planet in the habitable zone has no guarantee of actually being habitable.  There&#39;s far to many variables involved. Yes, life COULD exist there...I never said there wasn&#39;t life out there.  I personally doubt it, but statistically there should be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude... I&#39;m not getting drawn into a nonsensical argument. I&#39;ll just tell you that you&#39;re wrong and leave it at that. The universe is infinite.. Infinite time, infinite space. Humans are a very new species. If the earth is one year old, we arrived at 11:59pm on the last day of December. To think that we are the only planet with life in INFINITY is a little narrow minded to say the least. And to think that any other possible lifeforms lack the ability to observe other planets or to travel outside their own star system is likewise as dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know whether the universe is infinite or finite.  We have theories, but they are theories at best.  For you to say categorically one way or the other is narrow minded of you.</p>

<p>The universe (and our galaxy actually) are around 14 billion years old.  Our solar system is around 4 billion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unlikely that there are species capable of installer travel, even of any scientific thought at all in our galaxy and they&#39;ve had the same amount of time to evolve as we have,</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had 4 or 5 billion years to get to where we are, and we have fish and dogs, and elephants, and snakes here as well.  Any of them go to an advanced technical stage?  No, we are the only species in 4.6 billion years to do so here, so why are you so sure that it&#39;s happened anywhere else?</p>

<p>There are a lot of pretty exact variables that enable life on this planet - distance from the Sun, the Moon, the composition of the atmosphere...all sorts of things.  </p>

<p>But hey, you don&#39;t want a conversation.  No worries.  Take care. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making know to the public that ET&#39;s already are here also would mean &quot;they&quot; would also need to explain the zero point energy the ET&#39;s introduced and &quot;they&quot; are using against humanity. It would also mean the complete history of humans and all science books need to be re-written and wour actual history is not very flattering for &quot;them&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;their&quot; end game is the complete take over of any humans left after some created &quot;natural&quot; events. &quot;they&quot; are trying this by means of creating a complete new digital matrix. This new matrix will use 5G, rfid chips the internet, AI and other technologies to cut people completly off from nature&#39;s energy source, the unconsious self and the universal consiousnesss of humanity. AI will run this artificial frequency based matrix and people will be pushed or forced to keep within &quot;their&quot; limits by all means possible. We are already feeding the AI with all the information it needs and soon everything involving you is monitored and/ or controlled.</p>

<p>The artificial extraterrestial matrix we are now living in has some controll over people, but people are still able to get in contact with their unconsious self and the commen consiousness we are all part of. This is now difficult already, but with Love or some knowledge most people are able to get in contact. The new digital matrix will try to cut this contact completely, leaving humans even more &quot;lost&quot; and in chaos than we are now.</p>

<p>The reasons? Well, it is not only controll over people, power and money. We humans are way more powerfull than we know now and if we ever find out what we are actually capable off &quot;they&quot; literary can&#39;t excist along us anymore. The reason for the matrix is to keep people and this &quot;reality&quot; in a low vibration state. &quot;they&quot; need it to be like this becouse they live of the negative energy of people. Once enough people wake up and resign their fear for &quot;them&quot; and start living according our natural state of Love &quot;they&quot; will soon run out of &quot;food&quot; and the artificial matrix will collaps.</p>

<p>This also explains all the pushback against the truth in all area&#39;s of our life. &quot;they&quot; absolutely do not want us to start thinking and waking up, their existence in this &quot;reality&quot; is at stake and &quot;they&quot;are literary fighting for their lives here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen a low flying black cube UFO. This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that&#39;s what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn&#39;t see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching &quot;black cube ufo&quot; for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/</a> I think they are the Archons... P.S. The &quot;Texas Black Cube&quot; pics you see all over the internet are a proven hoax. It always bugs me that it gained so much traction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are hidden because they&#39;ve been visiting for millenia, and only the top level secret society members and ruling class are aware of this fact. If people were to know that we&#39;ve been visited for a long time, they would wonder how they got here. Therein lies technology that the hierarchy believes need be kept from the masses for control reasons. You can&#39;t control a population that is flying out to other regions of our solar system, or even other star systems. Additionally, the energy generation and harvesting systems to perform such travel if implemented on the surface would remove our dependence on the corporate energy network which is also controlled by the ruling class. In terms of government officials, its likely that the ones in the know are agents of said ruling class or genuinely believe that the masses &quot;cant handle the truth&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psyop is short for psychological operation. It is a broad term used to describe when agents of some power are used to manipulate the public opinion or shape the narrative of a particular subject. Usually its done by spreading propaganda and disinformation. In this case it would have been around the time the nazis and later the allied powers acquired &quot;electro-gravitic&quot;, creating the UFO sighting phenomenon. Agents would have been used to spread false information about aliens visiting in order to distract from the fact that these craft are created by government and corporate entities in possession of technology that far exceeds the capabilities of standard jet propulsion. </p>

<p>According to steven greer and others, much of the technology explosion of the 20th century was due to reverse engineering crashed alien craft such as the Roswell incident. The instrument panels on these craft and other aspects would have paved the way to transistors (leading to computers), semiconductors, carbon nanofibers, and various other technologies. The tech still hidden could include antigravity propulsion technologies, time travel, age reversing tech, and other exotic technology. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read that ancient societies received tech from various sources throughout their development. For instance, Atlantis received crystal healing and crystal weaponry from the Venusians. This tech was lost to the public after the destruction of their continent, but the knowledge was presumably carried on through mystery schools, priest classes, and monasteries. </p>
