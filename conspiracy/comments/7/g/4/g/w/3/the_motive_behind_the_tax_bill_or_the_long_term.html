        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It was sometime early in the 80s.  I was watching live news at a Republican victory celebration for either Reagan&#39;s election, or, more likely, the passage of the much touted Reagan tax plan.  A reporter was interviewing an obviously jubilant young man who, in the passion of the moment, offered insight into the far reaching, yet previously unspoken, goals of the administration.  He said that they wanted to increase federal deficits so high that whoever controlled the Congress or the White House would have no choice but to cut the government.  His statement resonated within me with the sound of truth and I was stunned for this was a well thought out, yet deceitful, means of fundamentally changing the course of our country. </p>

<p>It was years later that I recognized the young man as Karl Rove.  He had all the physical, emotional and ideological traits.  And, his Freudian slip in the 80s interview began to make sense of the conflicting juxtaposition of conservative ideology to balance the budget with their actions when in office to reduce taxes and increase spending.</p>

<p>When I read Paul Krugman&#39;s editorial this morning in the NYT, the brilliance of the design of the Republican tax bill came into full focus.  Low and middle income tax breaks are offered initially to con us into excepting this gift of a Trojan Horse.  Yet, these same tax breaks will evaporate within 10 years to balance the corporate cuts and thereby allowing passage by simple majority.  The Republicans say that they tax cuts can simply be extended when the time comes.</p>

<p>However, whoever is in control of the government at that time will be forced into choosing between the politically unpopular choices of raising middle/low income taxes or cutting federal programs to reign in the deficit.  Does this sound familiar?</p>

<p>Ever since passage of the New Deal, the Great Society programs, and the EPA and other regulatory agencies, there has been a concerted and persistent conspiracy to drastically cut welfare programs and cripple the regulating power of the federal government to &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;.  These forces are willfully attacking the fiscal security of the United States government to effect a transfer of power from the people to the corporation. This is treason.  This is war.</p>

<p>Edit:. I&#39;m not making a case for or against big government.  That&#39;s another discussion.  I&#39;m alerting people to the fact that our government&#39;s fiscal basis is being willfully eroded as a means to an end they may not understand or want.  This circumvents the discussion/debate that should take place within Congress as framed by our Constitution.  If you&#39;re implying that the people cannot govern themselves (democracy eventually implodes) be explicit and suggest your alternative. Anarchy? Oligarchy? Kingdom? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or it&#39;s like the people who have been selling the lie of good big government are really just taking your money and wasting it on pointless regulation and jobs.  We are subsidizing millions of pointless jobs, many government positions are advanced forms of welfare.  The DMV for instance - could be fully automated, yet we pay millions in salary for these sloth workers every year.  Why?  To create a voting population that will always vote in their best interest  - to keep their government jobs, so they keep voting for big government.  There is no reason to have the governmental layer to separate you from your money before it gets invested into another person.  This is communism (which fails every where it&#39;s tried) and it is not the American way.  Personal responsibility, personal wealth, and person-to-person uplift.  That&#39;s what America is all about.  In no way do we need Uncle Sam&#39;s greedy hand in all of our pockets, limiting the good we can do in the world by siphoning off as much of our wealth as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An inefficient or poorly run government doesn&#39;t mean the idea is bad, just the execution. They may need to streamline it a bit, more checks/balances to make sure everyone does their job, and they def need to weed out the corruption and make it more about servicing others instead of themselves.... but I think it would work if done properly.</p>

<p>Also, so what if people have braindead jobs in the gov&#39;t? If it gives them a decent salary, plus benefits which gov&#39;t jobs usually do, what is wrong with that? IF they were all replaced with machines then you would just have more people out of work and on welfare or something..... atleast they are working this way. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have been plenty annoyed with gov&#39;t offices where I call to try and get help and they just try to pass me off to another department or something, annoying as hell, but still. </p>

<p>Greed and corruption is always there... from the gov&#39;t or big biz. The philosophy of free market or everyone should be able to provide for themselves might seem good in theory, but in practice will fail because of greed and corruption. Maybe if they broke up all the corporations, political finance reform, gerrymandering, and anything else that keeps people from a fair shot or letting money buy special interests. Until then... atleast the core social services and benefits are prob better in gov&#39;t hands since they can fix internal problems easier then the gov&#39;t having to meddle with private buisinesses that are taking advantage of consumers (cause you get pushback about gov&#39;t regulation and stuff). </p>

<p>It increased aggregate demand which stimulated the economy when demand was incredibly low.</p>

<p>To comment on OP&#39;s post: Those raises over time were put in by Ryan and his I&#39;ll who have been trying to stop Trump since before the election. Tax cuts will then force corporations to pay their fair share instead of off shore and the growth in the economy isn&#39;t being taken into account either.</p>

<p>Am I happy these people seem to have incredibly long term limits and no requirement to talk periodically to poor people?  Not really.  But just because someone is voted into a position does not guarantee they will listen to a voter.  It seems they only listen to &quot;speech&quot; that comes from a voter named &quot;$&quot; and plenty of 00000&#39;s.  If you look into this link   <a href="http://www.amendmentgazette.com/how-spending-money-became-a-form-of-speech/">http://www.amendmentgazette.com/how-spending-money-became-a-form-of-speech/</a>    you&#39;ll see how elected representatives, and the judges the politicians have appointed, ruined the power of humans without a name like DeVos $1,065,000.</p>

<p>&quot;The country’s annual deficit is the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The national debt, which exceeds $18 trillion, is the net of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses.&quot;</p>

<p>The deficit shrank under Obama</p>

<p>In fiscal year 2009, which started almost four months before Obama&#39;s presidency began and ended eight months into it, the deficit was 9.8 percent of GDP. The 2014 shortfall is 2.8 percent of GDP -- <strong>a decrease of 71 percent.</strong></p>

<p>There was a surplus under Bush, and now Trump is planning to spend even more, while bringing in even less, causing the deficit to increase greatly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, our deficit <em>should</em> have increased in 2008 and for a few years.  Interest rates an employment cratered, and the best move in that situation is to borrow money cheaply and then use the money to directly hire the newly unemployed (to build things that will bring economic benefit for decades, like major infrastructure projects) and give money to the unemployed so they&#39;ll buy things and keep the economy going.  Now interest rates are rising, employment is close to baseline, and corporations are sitting on mountains of cash -- now&#39;s the time to increase taxes on the wealthy to blunt the risk of a speculative bubble and pay down the debt as financing costs increase.

    <div class="md"><p>I upvoted you for having a coherent thought even though I disagree with you.</p>

<p>I do not think it&#39;s a good idea to try to keep us in a state of stasis, where we heavy tax in good times and increase welfare in bad times.  This ensures that all times are simply &quot;meh&quot; and we have an increasing reliance on the state.  We need to have periods of extreme unfettered growth (like every other country with reasonable tax rates are seeing).  If we tax the shit out of the rich, the rich will NOT invest, the rich will leave the country, and we will be left with a 3rd world shithole.  You cannot overtax the rich.  They create businesses and jobs with their money.  Tax them, yes.  But do not overtax them.  They will leave.  21st Century econ.</p>
