        Atlantis
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The story of Atlantis tells us that an advanced civilisation existed and the continent on which it existed sank beneath the sea, engulfing the entire continent in water. Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias, written in 360 BC, contain the earliest references to Atlantis.

       <strong>
        The Antarctic Treaty
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Antarctic Treaty was signed in Washington on 1 December 1959 by the twelve countries whose scientists had been active in and around Antarctica during the International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957-58. It entered into force in 1961 and has since been acceded to by many other nations. The main purpose of the Antarctic Treaty, which was signed in Washington on December 1, 1959, is to ensure "in the interest of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue for ever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord." The Antarctic Treaty is an unusual occurrence in the realm of international relations. It is a treaty that does not recognize any sovereign nation's claim on any part of the Antarctic territory as well as a treaty that states that the purpose of the Antarctic continent is dedicated to “peace and science.”
      </p>

       <strong>
        No fly zone
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pan Am flight 50, using a Boeing 747SP, also flew over both poles. No scheduled commercial flights over fly the South Pole since there are no great circle routes in use which do so. Flights from New Zealand to South Africa would fly over Antarctica but no airline currently flies that route.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could being consumed by water mean that the Earths crust shifted and displaced the continent Atlantis existed on down to the south pole, thus being consumed by ice 'water'. Do all our Governments work together to uncover the secrets frozen in the Antartic ice?

       That's what I'm trying to say, the continent beneath the ice is Atlantis. Instead of being consumed by water, the Earths crust shifted and displaced the continent in frozen waters. The continent then slowly froze over and now we have an entire continent frozen in time beneath the ice. All the countries on Earth aren't fighting over Antartica, they're working together in the name of 'peace and science'.

       I don't think he is trying to say the city is still active under the ice, but that some event occurred which shifted its global position and it then froze over. So there probably isn't buildings and 'people' running around but maybe buried artifacts of the lost civilization are under the ground that is buried by the ice.

       What if Atlantis was an EMPIRE and not a single city? A world wide trading network, perhaps as advanced as 16th century Italy (could have balloons or basic gliders etc, da Vinciesque scuba suits, tanks or submarines...)
      </p>
      <p>
       It would explain the multitude of ruins around the world... why do they all have to be independent city states and not part of a greater network?

       Many of the WWII powers explicitly sought antarctic expeditions.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Byrd">
        Adm Byrd USN
       </a>
       claimed that due to the nature of war, using antartica to attack america WAS a reality; and the US should be at the forefront of settling bases at the poles to protect against such attacks.

       Look into Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson. Theyre doing some amazing work putting the pieces together. Atlantis sank 9,000 years before the Time of Solon, solon was alive in around 500-600 BC, so it sank around 11,500 BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       From wiki:
      </p>
      <p>
       "From the analysis of data from cores of coral reefs surrounding Barbados, he concluded that during meltwater pulse 1B, sea level rose 28 meters (92 ft) in about 500 years about 11,300 calendar years ago."

       Antarctica is not Atlantis, many forget the geographical placement of continents and the globe from 60k years ago. If Antarctica is real Lemuria is too. Read the stories of the wars between Atlantis and Lemuria and you may see the same thing as always two ideologies headed towards a mutual self destruction.

       The whole world is/was Atlantis. There was an advanced world before ours that reigned for roughly 1600 years before the great flood wiped them out and that's when the sudden freezing of the Arctic region happened and we get our modern weather fluctuating between hot and cold.
