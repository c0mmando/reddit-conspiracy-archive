       This is the matra of those who cannot step outside of their fragile belief systems. They attack what they cannot understand, what they refuse to understand. It threatens their world-view and subsequently triggers their amygdala into a flight-or-fight response. They choose to fight by instilling doubt in others' understandings, instead of confroting the doubt of their own inner world.

       Oh because families are totally up on what's really happening in the world.  Not saying we are but at least we're in a place we can comfortably say anything and get decent responses out of people, which brings me to my next question, why in the hell are you here just to detract from a perfectly valid conversation in the context of a CONSPIRACY SUB?

       I believe we are all here to discuss theories and ideas. That doesnt mean i have to agree with any of them. We all, myself included have the right to deny the plausibility of those theories.

       Well considering there are tons of facts supporting reptilian humanoids throughout history I'd feel inclined to call your frame of mind dismissive and fragmented.

       You're not helpful to him if you actually believe he needs help.  You're just going to cause a knee jerk reaction.  Is all the shape shifter nonsense too complicated for you to read or what?  It shouldn't be taboo to entertain a line of thought.  Debate him instead of ridicule.

       it is quite interesting that throughout human history there are tons of references to humanoid reptilian like beings/little greys all around the world. 
Flying saucers aswell, they are in sculptures paintings, everywhere,  hell there have even been crop circles in medieval times. 
Who knows what is true and what is not but we understand so little of the world let alone the universe, or the human consciousness or other dimensions, etc. so who are we to say if the reptilians are not real/ not running the show on the other hand who are we to say they do
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine bees and us, the bees see us somehow but can never understand what we are, yet we harvest them for honey and there is nothing they can do about it, something similar could of course be going on with us humans and the so called reptilians

       Everything is a manifestation of consciousness. You can only pick up on the frequencies you are familiar with.  If you see life through the reptile part of your mind, you will see the reptile-mind operating in others. If you operate through your Higher Mind, like the neocortex + hippocampus, you will see the Higher-mind operating in others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our society is geared towards/controlled by the amygdala parts of our minds (dopamine seeking, comfort seeking, avoid pain, seek pleasure, driven by fear/flight or flight, sex)
      </p>
      <p>
       Start seeing life through your higher faculties and you will see the "Light of God" in all things.

       I never believed the shapeshifter and archons stories myself too, but then started to think a bit further.
      </p>
      <p>
       That TPTB wanted power and money seem logical too me, but the one thing i did not understand is that they are ruling and using this world like there is a spare.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had power and welth, you would like to pass it on in your family, so all the power stays with your loved ones, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, if they continue like this there is no world to safely live on in the future, what is the purpose of getting all that welth and power without a future for your children and grandchildren?
      </p>
      <p>
       Until i came across D. Ickey and a lot of other sources and i saw myself confirmed in a lot of stuf i always thought but was mostly even worse. The "story" of the archons an reptilians opend me to a new world view and that the real PTB might not be human or are being influenced by non human entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       And seeing all is energy, frequency and vibration and they are spreading fear instead of Love i believe that we all are being influenced by something that realy does not give a fu.k for this planet and seems determind to keep it in a worse state as possible.
There is a connections between religion, spirituality, history, science, humanity and ET's and to me it looks we are all in this together and in the beginning even part of one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But real hard evidence is hard to find, and i believe that will change soon, but until then it is more of a truth feeling inside i get while i look at all the connections, but i am also still searching for answers, just like many.

       What tugs on my understanding is why do most accounts of alien beings have an apparent likeness to us,two arms and two legs etc. Surely their evolution can't be the same as ours which is dictated by our environment.

       That likeness might be a common demoninator for an evolved, intelligent and fully sentient species.

       For a species to grow to a certain level, this shape might be the most natural to occur to make us adapt to certain needs.

       Even in the same environment evolution doesn’t affect all living organisms the same. Just look at the gazillion different species of everything in our planet. Your point has been the main reason why I’ve always been skeptic about sighting accounts. The new age has now started merging with these theories and now they’re “inter dimensional light beings”, mainly propelled by Greer and Wilcox (both frauds, in my view). My opinion is that none of the sightings are based on fact. They would’ve been much more widely spread, IMO. That’s not to say that people aren’t being truthful. Hell, I saw an Asian jesus dressed up like a rockabilly singer at the foot of my bed one time I was in that half asleep state while watching Howard the duck. There was nothing here, but it doesn’t mean I didn’t see it.

       I do not buy into this, pretty ridiculous imo.
Although I haven't looked into this deep but all the videos and evidence I've seen is a quick "bug" and their eyes change for a second. That's not enough for me to think humanoid reptiles are real.

       I don’t buy into it either, but the law of one is an interesting read. There’s some YouTube videos doing readings of it you can listen while driving or whatever. At the very least it’s an interesting concept:

       The way I look at it is this. Based on some assumptions of course but let's say the catastrophe that wiped out the dinosaurs millions of years ago didn't get them all. Some were wise enough to go underground/ in caves etc. Well if those creatures were able to survive and potentially thrive they would also continue to evolve. Millions of years later you have a very real possibility of intelligent, humanoid reptilians. And if this were they case they would be the original inhabitants of this planet.

       For those asking about what I saw: I was about 13 years old and I met up with some friends at my old middle school soccer field late at night. Me and my buddies were meeting up with some girls and everyone was drinking, except me. I had never drank before and I was pouring it out while “peeing” in the woods. I was scared of what the  sensation would be. Anyway a bunch of drunk, teenagers went back to this girls basement including myself. Her parents were not home and we were playing truth or dare, spin the bottle type high-school shit. The lights were dim, and everyone was scream talking and being sloppy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basement had sort of sections: a bar, TV entertainment area, pool table area, and a bathroom.   I was very uncomfortable and was finding it hard to fake being drunk. I was playing pinball in the other area away from the crowd when I noticed the bathroom light on, I glanced over and saw the reflection in the mirror of what was the shapeshifting reptilian creature. I believe I caught the transformation back into human appearance. The entire skin of this girl was a different shade and texture. Her head literally retracted in and shrunk quite a bit. And the eyes, the eyes scared me for life. Something that i will never question my own sanity over. I know what I saw. These were the eyes of a lizard type creature. The “pupils” were vertical and had a yellow film.
      </p>
      <p>
       She literally no joke pushed up her boobs and combed her hair back and walked out of the bathroom, back to the crowd. Didn’t even notice me. My heart was racing out of my chest. I continued to play pinball and called my mom to pick me up. 10 years have passed since this event, and I have never experienced anything like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only spoke about this instance as if it were a joke and was to fucked up to see straight to my buddies. They were cracking up. I never really knew this girl prior to that night, just seen her in school. She was quiet and mysterious. I have not seen a sign of her existence since graduating.

       I need something to make me believe in them.  I've read a lot but it all seems to lack any form of proof.

       I dont know what u mean with your first sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not trying to detract anything i was simply stating my personal opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we are all here to discuss theories and ideas. That doesnt mean i have to agree with any of them. We all, myself included have the right to deny the plausibility of those theories.
