       Torture should be illegal. So, it's a good thing that the law does an effective job of protecting us from being tortured, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, that is not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       This piece of writing will tell you why that is, and will hopefully help to catalyze a reversal of the trend described herein.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Certain members of the population are unable to avail themselves of the only prescription drugs offered to them as a treatment for their medical conditions due to acute toxicity, the development of chronic side effects, or the risk of death brought about by these medications in these specific individuals. Furthermore, certain individuals within this group are able to successfully treat their conditions, fully or partially, through the use of medicinal Cannabis. 
Among those individuals, there are many who live in states (as well as the country at large) in which medicinal Cannabis is either completely illegal or illegal for use in the treatment of their specific condition. Finally, one or more members of this last cohort are understandably unwilling to violate their state's legal sanctions, and are incapable of relocating to a state where medicinal Cannabis is legal for the treatment of their condition. What materializes for these unlucky fellow humans at the intersection of these various factors, is a precarious predicament in which their ailment persists chronically, with no effective treatment within reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain public officials; namely the president and the governors of states where medicinal Cannabis remains illegal, are capable of immediately removing the legal obstacles facing these individuals through the use of executive orders. Now, for these officials to be aware of this, and yet continue to forgo the actions necessary to do so, means they are committing an unmitigated act of torture by definition. Proof will follow that this intentional act fulfills, without question, the linguistic definition of torture. Furthermore, this intentional act is either illegal, or as the title of this writing implies, technically legal. Whether or not one's analytical approach determines this act to be legal, its literal aspect--the aspect which has tangible ramifications in the physical and mental realms--can truly be nothing other than torture. What follows will aid you in unearthing this unavoidable conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the creation of this piece of writing, no responsible party will ever again be permitted to claim ignorance of this sobering reality. Should they respond by immediately nullifying these inhumane anti-medicinal-Cannabis laws, such individuals may demonstrate that they do in fact care about the humans among us who are suffering needlessly, or perhaps they will merely evince that they care enough about their own public image to heed the ineluctable impetus arising out of this treatise. In either case, what would truly matter is that they would be fueling an effort to obliterate the last remaining obstacle preventing literally tortured individuals from accessing their prime antidote--medicinal Cannabis. Alternatively, if they leave the laws unperturbed, thereby failing to heed the raw truth contained herein, they would be indubitably revealing their true nature: as benumbed marionettes of a fractured system, and active perpetrators of a blatant crime against humanity.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Imagine for now that it is true that there is at least one ailing individual who fits the aforementioned description.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate, such an individual:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Has an ailment that, when left untreated, is capable of inducing acute and/or chronic suffering, and possibly death.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Has no effective prescription drug options, due to severity of side effects, risk of death, absence of efficacy, or a combination thereof.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Can at worst, partially mitigate their suffering, and at best, neutralize their ailment, through the use of medicinal Cannabis.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lives in a state where medicinal Cannabis is not legal for use in the treatment of their condition.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cannot feasibly relocate or violate the law to obtain medicinal Cannabis (nor should they be expected to).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Proof of the existence of such individuals will be furnished in the subsequent entry (to be posted at the FB page I created for this topic "Cannabis Advocates Against Torture") but for the purpose of our present analysis let's simply assume that they exist. From this vantage point, let us dissect how "torture" is actually defined. Commencing with the purely linguistic definition we can turn to the Oxford Dictionary, which defines torture as acting to:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Inflict severe pain on.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cause great mental suffering or anxiety to.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In light of this definition, we must ask ourselves the question: does the failure of certain public officials to nullify laws hindering the access to medicinal Cannabis qualify as inflicting severe pain upon, and/or causing mental suffering or anxiety to, the aforementioned ailing individuals?
Presuming the existence of such individuals as described above, we can confidently say that certain people indeed do experience severe pain and/or mental suffering and/or anxiety as a consequence of intractable medicinal Cannabis prohibition.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, inflicting and causing are words that imply awareness and intent. Are these public officials actually aware of such vulnerable citizens and aware of the precise nature of their predicament, such that their failure to remove the prohibiting laws can qualify as intentional? It seems quite unlikely, though by no means impossible, that at least some of these public officials are not fully aware of these vulnerable citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, as previously mentioned, the publishing of this treatise resolves the implications of that lingering question. Namely, this piece of writing and the proof of the existence of these ailing individuals that it will ultimately contain, means that there are no longer any public officials that can appeal to naivety in a desperate effort to justify their inaction. With its publication, their awareness of this travesty is necessarily established and therefore fulfills the awareness aspect that defines a torturous act.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so what about intent? Though reference to "intent" is merely implicit in the linguistic definition of torture, the relevance of intent does figure prominently and explicitly into the legal definition. Thus, before unraveling the implications of requisite intent, let us explore that legal definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the Association for the Prevention of Torture:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "Article 1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is the internationally agreed legal definition of torture:
"Torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
        <strong>
         It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.
        </strong>
        "
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We can thusly unpack the legal definition of torture as containing:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Intentional infliction of severe mental or physical pain or suffering...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         ...inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         ...not arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to lawful sanctions.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now, the first of these bullet points is a distillation of the purely linguistic definition of torture as defined in the Oxford Dictionary--along with its uniquely explicit reference to intent. The second bullet point describes the nature of the identity of the person inflicting the act, such as the politicians being put to task in this work, who have the power to obviate the torturous ramifications of the current laws. The third point is a wildcard of sorts. It basically means that if the act of torture occurs as a consequence of an established law, it cannot be legally defined as torture. However, we can know from a study of history that objective facts ultimately overtake any legal sanctions contradicting them. In other words, historically, laws are constantly altered or eliminated consequent to the revelation of factual information and moral epiphanies that demand their nullification.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a sense, the legal definition of torture contains the literal, corporeal component, combined with the liability component. The literal component is the basic physical definition of torture. The liability component is the hanger-on, the prosthesis, the addendum that in a sense allows governments, on the basis of a definitional technicality, to get away with acts that would otherwise be deemed illegal torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put another way, these two components could be regarded as the rational component, and the magical component. The rational component is so named because it is the definition most rational persons would arrive upon when pondering what the word torture really means. The magical component is so named because it uses sleight-of-hand to make governmental liability vanish in cases where every other component of the rational definition stands.
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to eliminate medicinal Cannabis prohibition is one of those glaring cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presently, the actual literal state of affairs is as implied by the title of this work: Illegal Cannabis/Legal Torture, in that it describes the motivation for how all branches of our government currently behave in the face of this quandary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, there are presently inactive laws that had once been active in our history, the consequences of which would now be considered illegal, such as debtor prisons. Therefore, one might argue that the maintenance of certain presently active laws may actually be illegal, when appealing to the inexorable future nullification of these laws, despite currently accepted definitions stating they are not. More on this legal versus illegal conundrum later.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, we must return to the meat of the issue--the question of intent--as both the legal and linguistic definitions of torture hinge upon it either implicitly or explicitly. Can the failure to act be itself considered an intentional act?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       THE QUESTION OF INTENT
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider when you take a road trip. Let's assume that your only option for transporation is your car. If you are not driving an electric car, you do so with the implicit knowledge that your car's gas tank will be depleted. Does this therefore mean that you intended to deplete your gas tank? Of course not. Your intention was to get from one location to another. The depletion of gas is a collateral circumstance.
      </p>
      <p>
       By way of this example we can see that intentional action requires more than mere knowledge or awareness of an action's solitary consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine instead that you recently purchased a hybrid car with a switch that would allow you to use all-electric or all-gas exclusively. Let's say also that default position of this switch when the car is purchased is on the "use only gas" setting. We can assume that you would get to your destination with the same celerity with either setting engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, would the conscious choice to embrace inaction and leave the switch in its default "use only gas" position during your road trip equate to you intentionally depleting the gas? Indeed in this case, with all other conditions being equal, intent would be present and active. After all, if you did not intend to deplete the gas, you would have made the conscious decision to move the switch to the "use only electric" position before hitting the road. This leads us to the clear conclusion that what intent requires is:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        awareness of all potential consequences
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       combined with:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a conscious choice between two or more options whose consequences are distinct
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The fact that inaction was the chosen path therefore is inconsequential to the determination of intent. If the car's switch had "use only electric" as the default position when purchased, and you chose the action of switching it to the "use only gas" position prior to embarking on your trip, the ultimate consequences and the quality of your presence of mind when acting or failing to act would have been fundamentally identical in either case, and therefore the presence of intent would remain constant whether you took the action to change the switch from "only electric" to "only gas" or you simply left the switch in the "only gas" position. In other words, conscious inaction is equivalent to conscious action in the determination of intent, assuming the agent making the decision influences the relevant outcome (whether or not gas is depleted) by way of their action or inaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving forward with this principle in mind, consider the following thought experiment:
      </p>
      <p>
       You live in a society where you have been appointed to the official position of "Water-Bearer." For whatever reason, the person appointed to this position is the only proverbial conduit through which the members of this society can gain access to life-sustaining water. The actual source of the water happens to be a single well that can be drawn from indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a predicament of sorts, however, in that this well is contaminated with pollution. There is no way to resolve this pollution. The only way for the citizens to obtain this water and therefore not die of thirst is to obtain a jug of the water from you, the Water-Bearer, and accept the necessary risk of consuming the contaminants it contains. Some people will become violently ill and suffer from the contaminants. Some people will actually die from the contaminants. Even still, certain citizens will be physiologically capable of detoxifying the pollution without incident, as if they were consuming pure water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, one thing is for certain, anyone who refuses to consume the water, will eventually die of thirst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare this scenario to the gas tank analogy. You should see that, in regards to the question of intent, it is identical to the scenario where one is taking a road trip using an exclusively gas-powered vehicle. In either case, there is only one option that must be honored to achieve the necessary result (driving and distributing water). In either case there is untoward, yet unavoidable, collateral consequences (depleting the gas tank and inducing suffering or death in sensitive individuals). It should therefore be clear that in this scenario, as the driver did not intentionally deplete the gas-only car's fuel tank, the Water-Bearer did not intentionally cause suffering or death to the citizens whose physiology reacted adversely to the water's contaminants. Neither scenario provided two or more options whose consequences were distinct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now consider a modification to the Water-Bearer analogy: A new aquifer is discovered that contains pure, uncontaminated water. A well is promptly constructed to draw water from that aquifer. A new policy has recently come into effect allowing the citizens to now draw water from the wells of their own volition, without needing to have it provided it by you, the Water-Bearer. However, a locked cover is placed upon the well after its construction, and the only key capable of opening this lock is given to you. All that would be required for the citizens to be able to access the new, pure-water well, is for you to unlock and remove the cover impeding access to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say, in light of these conditions, you choose to instead forgo unlocking the cover and leave only the original, contaminated-water well accessible to the citizens. It should be obvious at this point that, as with the road-trip using a car with an electric vs. gas switch, the fact that mere inaction was the choice made does not nullify the presence of intent. By failing to act to remove the locked cover, you, the Water-Bearer, will have definitively caused intentional pain and suffering to the physiologically sensitive citizens given no other choice than to draw from the contaminated well. Indubitably, you will have acted to torture these specific individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       These considerations are very significant, as we normally associate images of active water-boarding, active medieval forms of torture like drawing-and-quartering, or acting to bury someone alive (to name a few) with the image of torture in our minds. However, as has just been demonstrated, torture can be embodied by inaction as well, as long as the inaction is founded upon:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        awareness of all potential consequences
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       combined with:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a conscious choice between two or more options whose consequences are distinct
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       From all of this we cannot fail to see that the inaction embodied by the failure to nullify anti-medicinal Cannabis laws is undeniably a form of torture as defined by the Oxford Dictionary. That said, because of the "magical" clause tacked-on to the legal definition of torture...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        not arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to lawful sanctions
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       ...this particular form of torture at present is technically legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again, is it truly legal? Let's step back and explore whether this act of torture, despite the language contained in its legal definition, might actually be illegal after all.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       ON NATURAL LAW
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine, if you will, a person who must walk regularly in order to relieve extreme pain in their legs that arises from being sedentary for more than twelve hours. This person is completely blind, but is otherwise completely self-sufficient. They have no human acquaintainces that can help guide them while walking, and live in an apartment so small that achieving the necessary exercise simply cannot be done within the confines of their home. Ultimately, the only way this person can safely get the exercise they need to relieve their extreme leg pain would be through the assistance of a seeing-eye dog.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, in this person's reality, the use of seeing-eye dogs has been made illegal and is a crime punishable by imprisonment--possibly the worst scenario imaginable for this individual who needs to walk regularly. Let's say there are a few prescription drugs on the market meant to relieve the kind of pain they are experiencing, but this individual has tried all of them no avail. Most of them do not work at all, but the ones that do have some degree of efficacy also exhibit signs of acute hepatotoxicity in this individual's body. In other words, when the pills were taken their liver was being irreversibly, possibly fatally, damaged. Consequently, prescription treatments are not an option. The governor of this person's state is aware that there are citizens facing this exact predicament, and is aware that such individuals can only experience respite through the aid of a seeing-eye dog. This governor has the power to issue an immediate executive order legalizing the use of seeing-eye dogs. At best, the executive order will stick and a new law will arise out of it. At worst, this ailing blind citizen, and others like them, would have their suffering mitigated for a few days until legal challenges to the executive order were made apparent. Even in the worst case scenario, at least the issue would be thrown into the spotlight of the political arena, and the probability of a positive legislative change coming about that favors such individuals would likely be be quite high.
      </p>

       What if, instead, this governor chooses to ignore the plight of the blind citizen and others like them, despite having the ability to tap into the power of an executive order with a few pen strokes or key strikes on their behalf? This poor citizen will suffer in the silence of their small studio apartment as a direct consequence of this governor's intentional inertia. In other words, this governor is committing an act of illegal torture. Even with the aforementioned "technical/magic" component of the legal definition of torture in place, those of us existing in this plane of reality should be able to immediately appreciate that the prohibition against seeing-eye dogs in this scenario is a violation of a "higher" law so to speak. Specifically, it is a violation of natural law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among other things, an appeal to natural law proceeds reflexively from an appreciation of the intrinsic right of human beings to access the medicine, aid, nourishment or treatments they need and which cause no direct harm to others. The natural law that dictates this would of course be glaringly violated by the legislative mandate against the use of seeing-eye dogs. This is why the hypothetical governor, in their combination of awareness and intentional inaction, could be accused of an illegal act of torture, as the specific "legal mandate" in question is a violation of fundamental natural law and is therefore an invalid "legal sanction." In other words, the "magic" component of the legal definition of torture would, in this instance, be swiftly nullified.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illegality of medical cannabis in some states and the country at large is no different from this seeing-eye dog scenario: There exist people that are suffering from conditions that are not able to be helped with any of the available prescription drugs, and yet who are able to be successfully and safely treated with Cannabis in one or more of its forms. One or more of these people live in a state where medicinal Cannabis is illegal, are unable to relocate to a different state, and are understandably unwilling to risk violating the Cannabis-prohibiting law in their own. The governors of each of these states, as well as the president himself, in their failure to act swiftly to assuage the conundrum faced by these select members of their citizenry, are indubitably committing an unmitigated act of torture in direct violation of natural law.

       ON INTERNATIONAL LAW
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if one were to attempt to deny that cogent explorations of natural law easily nullify the extant legal sanctions against medicinal Cannabis, we can still successfully countervail the "magical" aspect of the legal definition of torture by appealing to international law. Specifically, numerous countries within the United Nations have made medicinal use of Cannabis legal within their borders:

       By legalizing medicinal Cannabis, these allied nations have acknowledged and responded to the extreme need faced by those members of their citizenry who are only able to achieve respite from their conditions by way of access to the Cannabis plant and its extracts. To be sure, there is always ample reason to deny the international applicability of laws that cause harm to innocent people, such as the practice of female genital mutilation in some cultures. Conversely however, the legal precedent of medicinal Cannabis legalization followed by these countries is one that is logically and scientifically recognized to prevent and ameliorate harm to their citizens. Being unable to deny the sound rationale behind not legalizing a practice like female genital mutilation, we simply must do no less than reflect that very same foundational logic, whereby we find ourselves unable to deny that the international application of medicinal Cannabis legalization is not only a worthy suggestion, but an absolute moral requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps, in contrast to our initial exploration of the technically legal determination of medicinal Cannabis prohibition, we could collectively term these explorations grounded in natural and international law, as the intuitively illegal determinations.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       THE TIME HAS COME
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is this: Whether embracing the technically legal interpretation, the intuitively illegal determination, or a dialectical fusion of both determinations, an inexorable conclusion about torture-by-way-of-medicinal-Cannabis-prohibition screams out:
      </p>
      <p>
       This must stop now!
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       TLDR; I have proven that the failure of state governors and/or the president to issue immediate executive orders to nullify anti-medicinal-Cannabis laws constitutes an actual act of torture against certain members of our human community. Due to a legal loophole it is "legal" torture, but torture nonetheless. Perhaps if we can frame the issue in this manner (it is true after all) these public officials will cease to be so dismissive.

       That's awesome! Indeed it is. I feel as if we have been fighting for access to this life-improving and at times life-saving medicine for so long, that I hope I can make a difference by reframing the issue in these terms. Every day there are more people who need access to high-quality Cannabis extracts that simply do not have any way of acquiring them, and to denigrate the suffering of these fellow humans is madness!

       Firstly if I need a lawyer I'm coming to you lol.. Secondly what a great post I am a firm believer that we should be giving this medicine to people who truly need it I can't understand why a heroin addict can be prescribed methrodone yet if your struggling with issues that marijuana can help relieve then your a criminal . Here in the UK it's a joke we give alcoholics alcohol and heroin addicts substitutes yet for people who have cannabis to help them they get arrested and treated worse than somebody who has mugged an old lady . I hate the way it's portrayed in the world as this dangerous makes you go crazy drug when in reality it is a plant that produces some high power medicine.  I wonder if we actually did some long term studies what other issues/problems it would solve. Yet again though if it won't make lots of money then it won't ever become mainstream

       Thank you for sharing your kindred experience from the UK. When living in these supposedly civilized nations we call home, its one thing for us to be resigned to the fact that there are very many things that just don't seem to make sense, but when it comes down to this level, where it is so blatant and in our faces, with zero degrees of separation from our loved ones and even ourselves, it gets to the point where you cannot even get through the day without raging at the insanity of it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree, if we can remove the floodgates impeding proper funding and support for Cannabis research it seems all but certain that in the fight against dozens of issues that now ail us will in a matter of months/years we will have one of the most potent tools in existence added to our arsenal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe to resolve the money issue we can simply make Cannabis our currency? I'm being facetious but in all honesty I can't see it not being an improvement over what we are doing now!

       I feel the same it drives me crazy sometimes if I wasn't grounded by my family then I think I would actually give up all hope somedays.  I've always felt like this and actually only found this place a week ago and I see alot of like minded people here which is rather refreshing. My day to day life is just full of ignorant, boring, mundane people who seem blind to problems in the world today .

       Back on subject we plan to move somewhere that it is legal as soon as finances allow my partner suffers with some severe mental health issues she has been on so many meds that just cause more issues in the long run. Your analogy was a really good one in your post and we could relate to it quite a lot.. I think it has the potential for so much more I have seen so many success stories for some of the worse diseases and whilst it doesn't cure it most certainly helps in some way or another.  In the UK in the 90s cannabis was actually quite a huge talking point here but that seems to of died down now and people have more gone underground getting dangerous hybrids etc etc etc which is just funding criminals looking to make some quick money.. It could be done so much more efficiently and the country could probably make it work financially which begs the question why won't they? For me it's just because it's too powerful people are so much more open minded and not as easy to mind numb with all the crap they feed to us.

       It is a myth that cannabis isn't studied thoroughly, long term or short term.  Cannabis is one of the most studied substances on earth with over 20,000 published studies on it.  We're not going to find some unforeseen consequences after legalization.

       Pretty easy to go dig a link of Google about 20000 studies been done.  The studies they are doing are not on what effects on certain diseases etc it's about the effect on the person whether they become addicted etc etc not the actual medical side of it . The medical side is split you get half of scientists and medical professionals saying it helps and the other half saying it hinders.. The research is done on such a small scale its irrelevant.. I can take 10 people from my street see how they react it wouldn't be a real representation of people around the world.. I'm not saying research hasn't been done but not enough has been done.. Not just for cannabis but for all the natural medicines that our planet provides. Instead we would rather fill our bodies with chemicals

       It's even easier to be so dismissive of the evidence I just brought up.  It's a fact that there are tens of thousands of studies on cannabis.  Largely on its effects on humans, mice, and cells.  So you can just sit there and be dismissive even though I just completely proved you wrong.  It's a fact cannabis is the most studied plant ever.  It's a fact there are tens of thousands of studies on it.  It's a fact a large portion of those studies are on it's effects on living things.

       No it literally is a fact bro.  Like are you mentally deficient or something?  Are you arguing there aren't over 20,000 studies on cannabis right now?  Yes or no?

       Good job, you can do jack shit other than say "NICE GOOGLING HAHAHAH GOTCHYA!!!!"  You think those 20,000 studies were stictly on Botany?  No they weren't, they were on the cannabinoids and their effects on people, mice, and cells.

       I don't doubt that there will be a lot of this sort of manipulation going on. In fact it probably already is happening to a large extent in the areas where it has been legalized. However, as long as we would continue to have access to heirloom seeds combined with the freedom to grow and selectively breed it ourselves we should hopefully be able to keep that sort of manipulation from becoming truly all-encompassing.
