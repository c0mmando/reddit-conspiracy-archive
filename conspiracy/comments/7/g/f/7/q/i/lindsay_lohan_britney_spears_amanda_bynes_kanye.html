<p>No, Kanye is not on &quot;Trump&#39;s team.&quot; He may have been for a short period of time or perhaps he just said that to create a media storm...but he has actually publically distanced himself from Trump since.</p>

<p>Anybody who knows anything about Kanye knows that Kanye is on Kanye&#39;s team...and that is it.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for those that get sucked into believing this fan fiction stuff. This is literally a <em>step DOWN</em> from the Q Anon bullshit that has been distracting and misleading people for months now. One glance through the tweets is all it takes to see how ridiculous this shit is. Soooo....this twitter user is supposedly some sort of insider with connections to &quot;Q&quot; (who has already been debunked as BS), deep knowledge of the spiritual mysteries of our existence, full knowledge about all extraterrestrial species, etc. </p>

<p>How gullible are you guys? Or do you know its BS but just have fun playing along?</p>

He is more concerned with doing that through his art...and honestly right now seems most concerned with his Season 6 fashion line and new Adidas silhouettes.....</p>

<p>&quot;Monarch programming is a mind-control technique comprising elements of Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) and Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). It utilizes a combination of psychology, neuroscience and occult rituals to create within the slaves an alter persona that can be triggered and programmed by the handlers. Monarch slaves are used by several organizations connected with the world elite in fields such as the military, sex slavery, and the entertainment industry. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that people are making this much more complicated than it needs to be.  Mind Control isn&#39;t some pie in the sky, supernatural, magical thing.  </p>

<p>The Mind Control in Hollywood is more similar to a Pimp and a Crackwhore, than to what many here imagine.  And this phenomena isn&#39;t new.  Look up Mickey Rouke, or tons of other Child Actors from 1/2 a century, or more ago, who were given drugs in their EARLY(like 12) teens.</p>

<p>They used to give them amphetamines/coke/alcohol.  Now they give them adderall, Xanax, and Marijuana.</p>

<p>But, as I said, it&#39;s really not all that complicated.  They give you an agent, or &quot;handler&quot;, who then gains your trust(often by being your doctor feelgood, who will hide your drug habits from the public for you), and uses it to control you.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no subliminal messaging.  There&#39;s no &quot;brainwashing center&quot;.  There&#39;s none of this hoccus poccus.  All that this(it&#39;s called black magic, when you control people against their will) is, is manipulation, of the garden variety, that we see in every walk of life.</p>

<p>However, the CIA(or whoever) has been pumping the Alex Jones idea of Satanism, and Crazy Mind Control, in order to take this VERY simple idea, and make it unbelievable to the rest of the population.  It&#39;s like when the CIA released that Dr. Judy Wood, to say that 9/11 was caused by some interdimensional God Ray.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you not heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">MK Ultra</a>?</p>

<p>&quot;Project MKUltra, also called the CIA mind control program, is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects, at times illegal, designed and undertaken by the United States Central Intelligence Agency. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture in order to weaken the individual to force confessions through mind control. </p>

<p>MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people&#39;s mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis,[citation needed] sensory deprivation, isolation and verbal abuse, as well as other forms of psychological torture.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard of it.  And I believe these methods are used.  But it&#39;s not the way people think, on this subreddit.  The TESTS were done by strapping people down in facilities.  But the actual implementation of &quot;mind control&quot; is done in every day settings, as it&#39;s much more effective.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like they capture these people, and hold them down, and microwave them until their brains are fixed.  Much of this is done by faking friendship.  By gaining trust.  By taking advantage of vulnerabilities.  Once you have somebody&#39;s trust, you are in the position to give them drugs, or various other things.  </p>

<p>The best mind control, is when you make somebody do something, and they believe it&#39;s their own decision.  This isn&#39;t an instance of forcing people to do things against their will.  It&#39;s an instance of convincing people that doing what the agent want IS their will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MKUltra is old hat. The CIA loves that conspiracists use it as an example because it makes them sound outlandish. LSD doesn&#39;t make you susceptible to obeying orders. </p>

<p>Much more &quot;mind control&quot; can be accomplished through the technology, psychology, and pharmaceuticals that it is mainstream knowledge are available. You&#39;d be surprised how much you can accomplish through the power of suggestion alone.

    <div class="md"><p>LSD is used in mind control, as are many types of psycadelics.  LSD, Psilocybin, etc work by essentially &quot;erasing&quot; old brain &quot;patterns&quot;.  This is why you can take LSD/Psilocybin, after being depressed for your whole life, and suddenly not be depressed.  It has the ability to erase old brain &quot;patterns&quot;, which people refer to as their &quot;thoughts&quot;, or &quot;personality&quot;.</p>

<p>In normal settings, this results in a person being able to &quot;remake&quot;, or &quot;rebirth&quot; themselves as a new person(which is why you see the idea of &quot;rebirth&quot; often in modern music/conspiracy theory).  </p>

<p>But, this ability to erase yourself can obviously be used to replace somebody&#39;s personality more easily.  It&#39;s not a &quot;get mind controlled quick&quot; scheme.  It requires tons of elbow grease, and conventional methods of control, in conjunction to work properly.</p>

<p>The effects of Acid were seen on a massive scale in the 1960&#39;s, when suddenly a large portion of the population overnight seemingly &quot;changed&quot;, into hippies.  When you erase your previous mind brain patterns(which tend to be negative), you end up without prejudices that a normal person would have.</p>

<p>On another note, snowden is a CIA agent.  Self Admitted.  He&#39;s a part of a large scheme, that I really don&#39;t feel like getting into.  Short of it is that he&#39;s a CIA agent(self admitted), who was used to spark the Arab spring, and make people accept international surveillance.  Snowden was not a revolutionary(all you need to do is listen to him to know that). </p>

<p>He was a CIA agent, whose job was to get the people to accept international surveillance.  And he succeeded.  </p>

<p>If anybody is truly interested, I can go more in depth, and provide sources, but it&#39;s pretty tiresome at this point repeating the same shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really.  It&#39;s slightly more complicated than that.  Often, when &quot;stars&quot; get rich, they no longer need to work.  Or, they choose to change their &quot;entertainment&quot; in a direction that the agent does not want.  </p>

<p>Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, Britney Spears, etc, could have just bought an Island, and lived out their days on Royalties, and proper investments.  But, the agent is there to keep them in the machine, as long as is needed(which is often longer than the performer desires).  </p>

<p>Convincing a person who has a net-worth over 50 million dollars to travel the world, and work VERY HARD every day of their life isn&#39;t exactly easy.  </p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s another problem.  These musicians/entertainers wield a MASSIVE amount of power.  People listen to entertainers more than politicians, religious leaders, and even their families.  That&#39;s why they&#39;re so heavily controlled.  And that&#39;s why such extensive effort is taken to make sure they don&#39;t make $100 million dollars off the machine, then start destroying it.  Michael Jackson is an example of this, and they had to frame him for child abuse, and eventually kill him, to shut him up, because he was too powerful.</p>

<p>An expert from Harvard who spent 60 hours with supposed Robert F. Kennedy assassin Sirhan Sirhan believes he was induced to commit the murder by mind control:</p>

<p>&quot;Convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan was manipulated by a seductive girl in a mind control plot to shoot Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and his bullets did not kill the presidential candidate, lawyers for Sirhan said in new legal papers.</p>

<p>For the first time, Sirhan said under hypnosis that on a cue from the girl he went into “range mode” believing he was at a firing range and seeing circles with targets in front of his eyes.</p>

<p>“I thought that I was at the range more than I was actually shooting at any person, let alone Bobby Kennedy,” Sirhan was quoted as saying during interviews with Daniel Brown, a Harvard University professor and expert in trauma memory and hypnosis. He interviewed Sirhan for 60 hours with and without hypnosis, according to the legal brief.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s much more complicated depending on the issue. Sometimes warlocks do witchcraft that enables those jinns to go and find somebody and cause him to do whatever the witchcraft is saying. In this case some sort of  programming that could be triggered with keywords and such.</p>

<p>People are immune by default unless a gateway between our dimension and their dimension is opened. This can be enabled by causing the victim to eat something or walk over something or do something highly immoral that could attract demons (future workers who wants to execute the witchcraft program, again in this case causing the person to hear and see things that would make him do certain things everytime a keyword is said).</p>

<p>There are different techniques to kick out these demons. The worst of them is to go to other warlocks to make you a stronger witchcraft that could bring demons who would overpower the first ones. The best and most effective one is by changing your life into a more righteous one and staying away from drugs and alcohol and immoral acts and praying to God and reciting the word of God (The Quran).</p>

And not any type of trauma, it makes a deep spiritual hole in an innocent child (child abuse, children witnessing rituals where other children are abused, children witnessing children being sacrified..etc). Sacrifice to demons is one of the bad sins God does not like but it makes the actors in the evil realm come and execute what is asked from them because it fits their satanic/demonic agenda and the devil himself rewards the demons based on the damage they were able to inflict or the number of people they were able to affect or based on the strength of the marriage they managed to destroy.

    <div class="md"><p>If it was so easy not to care what people think, places like reddit and other online forums wouldn&#39;t exist.  </p>

<p>I used to play minor-pro hockey in a small town and I was kind of a local &quot;celebrity.&quot;  Believe me, it sucks.  You can&#39;t do anything or go anywhere without someone getting in your face, and then add social media, and local news media, and it&#39;s fucking terrible.  Now, blow that up into national coverage with full internet exposure and try to imagine what that would do to someone. Seeing your own name and face on the TV with someone saying something shitty about you actually does suck, and it does affect people.  You seem to think these are not actually human beings.  </p>

<p>I also crossed paths with, and remain friends with some of the biggest names in hockey today.  I&#39;m talking rock star levels of popularity.  I guarantee <em>you</em> that lots of celebrities are absolutely destroyed on the inside, from insecurity and self consciousness because they&#39;re under 24/7 scrutiny.  They can&#39;t even go get a coffee at Tim Horton&#39;s because half the people in the store just can&#39;t wait to tell them how much they suck.  </p>

<p>I get it. 100%. </p>

<p>I also never said that <strong>all</strong> those who use drugs are running from trauma. I can’t (and wouldn’t) say that all of them are because of sexual abuse. But, you nor anyone else can say that <em>some</em> of them don’t turn to drugs because they were abused in that industry. </p>

<p>Anyone who thinks that the entertainment industry isn’t completely ass backwards and fucked up needs their head examined. That isn’t directed at you btw, just a generalized statement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate also the respectful response. </p>

<p>I think also a 3rd factor that cannot be overlooked is that of personality and upbringing. Take two stereotypical cases: that of a second generation celebrity, and that of you rags to riches Hollywood story. </p>

<p>In the first case, you have a child that didn’t get raised like the rest of us. They don’t gain an accurate understanding of money, humility, social structures and norms, etc. Without the struggles or character building. I suspect this produces personality defects that can manifest later in life as breakdowns and erratic behavior. </p>

<p>In the second case, I think certain insecure personalities are drawn to Hollywood. Think of the clown who is dead inside but portrays happiness on the exterior. Fake and success only temporarily conceal underlying defects and insecurities that again can manifest as breakdowns. </p>

<p>Last thing I’ll say, is that no doubt there is abuse. There are permutations of all these factors that yields the results we see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, you&#39;ll have to be more specific about who claimed paedophilia in Hollywood was &quot;mythical&quot;. For some years now, most people have acknowledged that child abuse could occur anywhere people get regular unsupervised access to young children. Pre-school kids, schoolchildren, scouts, altar boys, children in reform schools, actors – they&#39;re all potential targets for paedophiles, who gravitate to those jobs where they can have that  access. And a single abuser can abuse large numbers of children. But the reality of child abuse is that the vast majority is carried out by trusted individuals like teachers, priests, parents, and step-parents, not by shadowy cabals of satanists.</p>

<p>And what paedophilia are you talking about? All I can think of off the top of my head are the Corey Haim/Corey Feldman stories that we&#39;ve been hearing about for ages and the Kevin Spacey allegation. The rest of the Hollywood allegations I can think of involve adults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other words, you have no evidence that paedophilia in Hollywood is any more prevalent than anywhere else where adults can have unsupervised access to children. And I don&#39;t have idols, certainly not people like Spielberg and Harrison Ford. </p>

<p>I have seen the claim there is &quot;no evidence that paedophilia in ______ is any more prevalent than anywhere else....&quot; used numerous times for academia, the Pentagon, etc. Not sure why this is considered a relevant point, but it&#39;s certainly a good distraction. Perhaps pedophilia is an &quot;epidemic&quot; everywhere, but Hollywood can help mainstream it better because they deliver the media manipulation to the masses.</p>

<p>As for your claims of &quot;mainstream media&quot; saving the day here....well, that&#39;s just laughable. NBC spiked the Ronan Farrow story, who had to take it to The New Yorker. The New York Times beat them to the punch because they knew if the New Yorker (or NBC) reported it before they did, the NYT would look extra-bad for spiking the Weinstein story a decade earlier, when Damon/Crowe leaned on the paper. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do I spook you? I&#39;m all for holding people accountable for their awful sexual harassment of adults or abuse of children, I just don&#39;t think that the fight against such abuse is helped by moving the blame squarely from the individuals involved to some claimed group of shadowy elite with some secret agenda. I&#39;m old enough to have been around when the moral satanic panic of the late 1980s swept around the world (even to my small country), and I saw how much money and police resources were wasted on pursuing claims of satanic abuse.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say the mainstream media &quot;saved the day&quot;. Please don&#39;t put words in my mouth. And you&#39;ve completely ignored my question: who is this mysterious &quot;they&quot; you claimed have to &quot;soften the masses minds&quot;? And why would they need to soften up the masses&#39; minds? You seem to be saying that there is a plan to reveal sexual abuse for some nefarious reason. I&#39;m genuinely curious here. What do you think is going on?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure why this is considered a relevant point</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s relevant because you made a comment implying that there was a lot of paedophilia in Hollywood and that some unspecified people had dismissed it as &quot;mythical&quot;, but you&#39;ve provided no evidence that it is any more prevalent there than in any comparable environment.</p>

<p>As for Hollywood &quot;mainstream[ing]&quot; paedophilia, to do that they&#39;d have to be presenting it as somehow acceptable, and I&#39;d certainly like to know if you have any examples of this. The revelations about the sexual harassment of women and men by Weinstein, Spacey, et al are certainly not being presented in any favourable light, so if you&#39;re right and these stories are going to be followed up by further revelations about the sexual abuse of minors, it&#39;s hard to see how this could be considered part of a plan to mainstream it, unless by that you simply mean make it more widely discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I do know is that no credible evidence was ever produced to justify the satanic panics, while a lot of very leading questions were asked of children by untrained investigators and testimony contaminated by parental questioning.</p>

<p>The marketing of adult clothing and adult-themed material to teenagers and children is certainly a relatively modern phenomenon. But I don&#39;t see that as some satanic plot to mainstream paedophilia; it&#39;s just rampant capitalism trying to create and exploit new markets. As such, it&#39;s not confined to or directed by any particular sector or country. As evidenced by examples such as drug companies pushing doctors to prescribe opiates and tobacco companies first denying the harmful effects of smoking then looking to expand their markets in the third world, you can find unscrupulous executives everywhere.</p>

<p>You see satanists with a secret agenda, I just see greedy people with a very obvious agenda. What I don&#39;t get is why those who, like you, believe in satanic conspiracies don&#39;t make more of an effort to convince the general public of the truth of their claims. Time and again, I just see people refusing to debate the evidence with skeptics and writing them off as shills.</p>

<p>You know there was also a time when good manners meant something. And a time when sense meant something (it meant, BTW, &quot;sense&quot;, not &quot;sixth sense&quot; and not giving one&#39;s six cents). And a time when god meant something.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t you just let people make their own decisions about what &quot;true&quot; conspiracy is? why, you think people in general, and on this board, are so stupid or so uneducated that they can&#39;t make up their own minds?</p>

<p>And also, in case you are not aware, one of the signs of creeping totalitarianism in a society is when the thought police show up at every place where people dare to express opinions or evince speculations. Seems to me that something like this happened to the comment section on this sub. </p>

<p>If anyone is reading this little exchange, my recommendation is to engage with commenters according to the merit of their comment. IF they bring a fact or a well-supported hypothesis, that merits a response. But if it&#39;s arms waving and gesticulating casting aspersions without offering their own credentials for a rebuttal, then it&#39;s best to ignore them and move on.</p>

<p>An aside&quot; I have my own doubts about secret global pedo networks, but that&#39;s all they are - doubts. Just as I doubt the existence of an &quot;illuminati&quot; network. I have no proof to bring re non-existence of such. Those who seek proof are more than welcome to continue in their endeavor. Should proofs materialize, I&#39;ll weigh them. wasting time shooting down this or that just because I happen to not be convinced is silly. Which is probably the attitude of most sensible people. That&#39;s why comments that do just that - frothing around the mouth because some people somewhere on a sub called &quot;conspiracy&quot; may possibly be misleading the darling children who are decidedly not even on this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was about to credit you with sensibility before I got to the name calling (Berntards?). Unfortunately, when you feel compelled to resort to silly labeling you will likely lose your audience.</p>

<p>I think some of the conspiracies being bandied about are indeed silly, and detract perhaps from deeper and practically verified conspiracies (such as the Seth Rich murder - highly likely to have been an assassination). Sopmething is indeed strange about the LV shooting more because of what didn&#39;t than what did happen. And so on. But I have no problem skipping over headlines that don&#39;t interest me to get to the ones that do. Why is that so difficult for you?</p>

<p>The argument you bring (if it can be called &quot;argument&quot;) is that too many conspiracy theories make no sense and/or offer next to no support. Fine so far, but then, what is it you want? scrub the sub from any but the ones approved by you? and is that not like the &#39;arguments&quot; presented by TPTB to scrub &quot;Fake&quot; news because they differ from the officially sanctioned propaganda.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you want to debate like an adult fine. But if labeling and name calling and hasty off the cuff comments are your thing, then no, waste of time for me.</p>

<p>why are you on this sub if conspiracy of any kind is not your thing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, I like a good conspiracy theory. Doesn&#39;t everyone? But to my mind a conspiracy theory should not be synonymous with a creative writing exercise using a current news headline as a prompt.</p>

<p>This sub is described as &quot;a forum for free thinking and discussing issues&quot; with a goal of &quot;a fairer, more transparent world&quot;. Fairness and transparency are not advanced by the promulgation of unfounded accusations or by a refusal to allow questioning of the claimed evidence.</p>

<p>There are subs where posters have to treat every post as real, even if it&#39;s not. This is not one of those. There are subs where no criticism of a topic is allowed. This is not one of them. There are subs for creative writing. This is not one of them. As long as this sub remains a sub with a goal of a more transparent world, I&#39;ll continue to question those claims that I think are obscuring the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s the conspiracy- and you might not like it.</p>

<p>It takes an incredibly empathetic or imaginative person to try and understand what it’s like being a celebrity- much less being in that industry (if you aren’t already).
There’s a lot of people, who, even if they see what’s going on as wrong, still see the situation with stars in their eyes.
The truth is, a lot of what goes on is just not that glamourous.</p>

<p>When you’re a huge celebrity, it’s very easy to lose grasp on your humanity, as well as your humility. Everyone around you sees you as an idea first and person second. Executives see you as a dollar sign. The public sees you as a slut. Or a demon-possessed illuminati member. Or a bad influence to children. Fans can sometimes be extremely overwhelming because they’re take on your reality- who you are as a person, is so skewed, if they see you as a person at all.
Every single human being in the world knows how being misunderstood feels. No one is ever going to be truly misunderstood. But we’re shaped by our circumstances. Do you think having voices in your head suck? The people without celebrity don’t have to worry about thousands- and millions of actual other human beings. Sure there are fans who appreciate them and tell them how they love them. But for every fan is another person who  tells them to kill themselves. Says how nappy their hair is. How gay they’re acting. How fake they are. Judging your life freely- and feeling entitled to it. It’s not easy to just “shut it off” because it’s everywhere. It’s on the internet, on television screen, even on the racks before the cash register at your local pharmacy. The entire world chiming in on who they think you are and who they think you should be. 
And in a cutthroat industry, it’s hard to trust anyone. As your life changes and your celebrity increases it’s hard to keep a level head.
Especially when nothing is truly real- you’ve got your publicist telling you who to hang out with, who to date, etc. You’ve got your agent suggesting that you sleep with an executive for a deal. You’re working a seven hour shoot overnight only to do a morning show right after, so after spilling to entourage how busy your schedule is- they tell you they can help you- by dropping some pills into your hands that’ll keep you up and energized. You don’t know who to trust, if there is anyone at all.</p>

<p>it’s easy for anyone else to say what they’d do if they were in that position. Except, they’ll never be in your position. They’ll never be in your shoes, have your past and your present. Have your knowledge in the moment. Your level of discernment. Your maturity. It’s so, SO easy for people to say what they would do, when they don’t have to do shit.
It’s why this industry is so horrible for children, because they grow up being groomed by everyone around them.</p>

<p>And the thing is, this is how reality is- because outside of your celebrity, there are still people sleeping for promotions in the corporate world. People still pushing drugs to balance college and two part-time jobs. Users on reddit who feel entitled to call you fag, retarded, a horrible person- based on something as frivolous as a comment you made on the internet. It’s world we live in.</p>

<p>And now increasingly in a social media world that grants everyone a feeling of celebrity, with a culture of chasing fame and actually wanting eyes on you- invading your privacy, I’m so so so worried about the mental health of the youth growing up today.</p>

<p>Anyway... this probably going to get lost. It&#39;s easy for everyone here on Reddit to say, &quot;Down with Hollywood, <em>their</em> the problem,&quot; when it&#39;s the everyday person that takes part in culture that keeps the ball rolling. But, whatever....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a good article on the current music hit-makers. At the end they ask the behind the scene makers what it takes to make a star, since really they&#39;re writing the music for everyone.</p>

<p>The most astute person responds that star quality is a desparate neeed to escape: Timberlake in Orlando, Rhianna in the Carribbean, and Katy Perry in the Bible Belt. This desire to escape allows the performer to enter into an authentic contract of fantasy with the audience. All are trying to escape, and the star who has a shit life and did some bad shit to get it now delves into the fantasy deeper, escapes deeper.</p>

<p>Someone with a horrible life desperate to escape helps to create a legitimate escapist performance for $20-200 for an hour set.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny. Without the talent and the luck though, they&#39;d be making that $20-200/hr one person at a time as opposed to an audience at a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And we still haven’t really heard much from him since... so many people just dismiss him as a loony tho because that was the mainstream media’s narrative for a decade (and his way of dealing it, by not playing by their rules, not apologising for things he didn’t do to save face, but instead fight in whatever indirect way he could that just made him seem crazy to the general, unaware public).</p>

<p>DMX made a little personalised video directed at Kanye after he was taken to the mental hospital (we were told he voluntarily checked in to a hospital, but I’ve also heard he was forcibly removed after his last rant about Hollywood/Hillary/MSM), telling him to ‘stay strong brother’ against all the evil in this world. Honestly brought tears to my eyes thinking of the deep shit going on that we might not even know the tiniest bit of, just have a little bit of a general understanding. And people like DMX and Kanye have been vilified and attacked for more than a decade fighting for people who laugh and dismiss them as crazy...</p>

<p>I believe Kanye is an MKULTRA victim and the &#39;Yeezus&#39; album is a veiled attack and a display of disobedience against his masters. He comes closest to directly calling them out on the song New Slaves (lyrics). If you ever have a chance to listen to the album, please do. It is nothing like anything he he released before. It has a very abrasive minimal noisey sound with Kanye&#39;s vocals being the most aggressive and the most lyrically explicit in his career. It doesn&#39;t make much attempt to be mainstream or &#39;sell-able&#39; save for maybe one song. It had <a href="https://sentireascoltare.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sentireascoltare-kanye-west-yeezus.jpg">no cover or disc art</a> either. This is around the time things got the most chaotic for him too. Even if you&#39;re not a fan of Kanye or hip hop, it&#39;s an interesting listen at least once and he&#39;ll probably not release anything like it ever again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean... Some people think more than others. The more thoughtful you are, the more you have going for you (unless you&#39;ve been taken by the hand and shown the world). There&#39;s a comfortable noise level in your head that can intensify with stress, and &quot;the industry&quot; schmucks and tax collectors you have to deal with likely outweigh the benefits of having money. At the end of the day, they still have to create, and keep it relatable. Most people can&#39;t relate to being a genius who&#39;s being drowned by a bunch of hacks with their hands out. Not saying any of those named are genius-level, but I can certainly understand having meltdowns. The conspiracy is that Joe Normal having a breakdown is overlooked in favor of celebrity meltdowns.</p>

It was done as a mechanism of control, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there are more cases of it.
