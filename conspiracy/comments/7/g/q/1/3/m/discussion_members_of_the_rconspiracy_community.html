    <div class="md"><p>For those who believe that 9/11 happened as we are told, all I have to say is Building 7. Even if you can&#39;t wrap your mind around the Towers, the Pentagon, and the rest of the madness of the official story, look at Building 7. Watch how it falls. That is the thread that began to unravel my own belief in the official narrative, and I think it&#39;s the best place to start when trying to &quot;redpill&quot; family and friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mainly because I was told of the attack by the US Military in a public forum months before it happened.  All US bases prior to 9/11 were closed because intelligence pointed to an attack on american soil. </p>

<p>My reasoning: if the US Military was complicit in an attack on their own people why would they have warned us before the attack took place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think seeing Rumsfeld assisting the medical team on the Pentagon lawn rather than rushing inside to be briefed is rather suspect. If you’re a military person, you know that Ralph Eberhart could have ended 9/11 had he simply done his job. </p>

<p>The notion that this was a “failure of imagination” is not true. The claim that terrorist were able to strike at our soft underbelly because our defenses were “pointed outward and not inward” is nonsensical, and the claim that the overlapping war games <em>helped</em> response time rather than hampering it is ludicrous. </p>

<p>There were only 4 fighters on standby to guard the entire NEADS. That is insanity. <em>Especially</em> if the light was blinking red. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most likely scenario in my mind. “Let it happen on purpose” it’s called. Thing is, they HAD to have had help here and there. For example, the INFOCON level was lowered to its lowest alert status on the 10th, FAA Hijack Coordinator Mike Canavan was out of the country I believe and failed to designate a replacement in his absence, many FAA and NORAD people were in their first day on the job on 9/11–there are a ton of little things like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will bite.  I think it&#39;s real simply because it&#39;s too big of a thing to have happened in &quot;secret&quot; and have that secret kept.  </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s not like we don&#39;t know that the terrorist class had their eye on the World Trade Center already - they&#39;d tried to knock it down before.</p>

<p>As for Building 7, here&#39;s a simple concept.  Go to the beach and bring a Jenga set.   Flatten out a big chunk of sand, and build a small &quot;skyscraper&quot; then dig a big hole right next to it.  What you&#39;ll find is that sudden instability of the area next to it changing shape will undermine your structure.  </p>

<p>People talk all the time about the unnatural fall of the WTC buildings, but I still remember as a kid (decades before 9/11) about the very unique construction of those towers versus others and how they basically had an exoskeleton that held them together.  I&#39;m not sure where that fits in the conversation, but I haven&#39;t heard it discussed much at all.</p>

<p>My own view is that the 9/11 deniers can&#39;t get their head around the idea that people can be so evil as to hijack a plane with kids going to disneyworld in it and use it to knock down a building.  I wish I couldn&#39;t - but I&#39;ve seen enough bad things in this world to know those folks are out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Twin Towers went down several stories creating pressure under them.  They fell. Less pressure.  Things underground around it shifted.  </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve heard (and someone could chime in here) is that all those buildings have pumps and things to keep water out running full time and or course those all stopped during the event too. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t pretend to be an expert on it - but sure seems to me that you glow a lot of shit up and change relative pressure underground and there&#39;s going to be a lot of effects to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you reconcile footage of NYFD firefighters giving first-hand testimony of “molten steel running down the channel-rails, like you were in a foundry. Like lava” and footage I’ve posted of an explosion taking place before the collapse event about 10 stories below any fire in the south tower that appears to eject a human being from the building at high speed along with dust and debris?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not bought into the fact that &quot;jet fuel doesn&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; and it might not have been just jet fuel burning. There&#39;s a lot of crap in buildings including gas lines, etc.   As for the ejecting thing - towers build up internal pressure.  That&#39;s why they all have those interior revolving doors at the bottom of the elevator banks.  That plus shit blowing up might create pressure across multiple floors.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert - and I&#39;m guessing neither are you.  No one is an expert on this as it has never happened before that I can think of.  </p>

<p>My original point was that I believe it simply because I believe it would have required too many people to keep it secret.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s my opinion.  You are entitled to yours.  Truth is none of us will ever know what happened that day.  The so called &quot;experts&quot; who Monday morning quarterback all this also have opinions, but I am not choosing to believe them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t researched it extensively and don&#39;t have a strong opinion either way, but my biggest question for proponents of the &quot;inside job&quot; narrative is this:</p>

<p>Between 2001 and 2003, we saw the Bush administration take immense pains to attempt to tie Saddam Hussein to 9/11 as part of their fabricated justification for the Iraq war they were already dead-set on. If the US government or its allies were in any way in control of the 9/11 plot, or even just actively misleading us about findings in the investigation afterward, why not plant some compelling evidence that would actually enable them to make that connection, and let them invade Iraq right away? It just doesn&#39;t quite seem to mesh with the covert agenda we now <em>know</em> they were pushing at the time. I&#39;m open to any evidence, but this is a bit of a sticking point for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’ve raised a good point. If their eye was on Iraq from day 1 of the Bush 43 admin (and it was), why not include an Iraqi National as one of the hijackers? Give him alleged ties to the Iraqi government for bonus points. That’s a fair question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very skeptical of the official story but don&#39;t really buy the conspiracies for simple reasons like this. If this was a false flag what did it accomplish other than a war in Afghanistan, something that they probably could have done with or without a false flag.</p>

<p>On the other hand the sheer number of &quot;coincidences&quot; surrounding 9/11 and the official story is something I don&#39;t know if I will ever be able to buy.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m more likely to buy the &quot;they let it happen&quot; conspiracy because I still can&#39;t answer this question... If America was just confirmed to be under attack by people who were hijacking planes, crashing them into buildings and more hijacked planes are believed to be in the air.... Why in the fuck do you let the President sit in a room full of kids where he was public ally scheduled to be that day at that time... A situation where you are under attack I think the number one priority of everyone in GWBs crew would be to get POTUS to a safe a secure location... Why did no one think a plane might be headed right at the &#39;most important&#39; man in the country... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Them letting it happen <em>is</em> a conspiracy though. Don’t get me wrong I’m not barking at you. I think what you’ve written there is very well-put. </p>

<p>The LIHOP (Let it happen on purpose) theory is where my research has led me. A trifecta of neocon ambition and profit motive, Zionist geopolitical motive, and Saudi financial support. </p>

<p>Inb4 “you antisemite!” Shut the hell up and research it. </p>

<p>Anyway, the whole, why did they allow Bush to remain in that soft target after the second plane hit when their standard operating procedure would have had them out of there and into the Beast and then into AF1 instantly is a great question. My only answer is my most honest answer. I don’t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with most questions I run into thinking about this is the answer turns out to be, I simply have no clue... </p>

<p>Now with LIHOP, the remaining questions are, how specific was their info. Did they know dates? Methods? Actual airlines to be hijacked etc... </p>

<p>I think just based on how easy it has been to disseminate information that if they truly knew every detail of the plans for the day that that information would probably have been leaked... My best guess is that they had intelligence as to what the plans and intentions were, but probably not any specific dates, names, airlines targeted etc. Even though I think this is the most likely, I still can&#39;t buy the building 7 story. Some fuckery was afoot, I&#39;m just not sure our government has been competent enough in the past 20 years to pull anything like that off so well. </p>
